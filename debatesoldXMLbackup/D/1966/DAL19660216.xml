      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government are prepared to accept the full supra-national obligations of the European Economic Community in the event of the Irish application for membership being accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, our application for membership of the European Economic Community was made without any reservations in regard to the supra-national implications of membership.  The Government's attitude in the matter remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that the subject matter of this question might be a very live and burning issue when our application for membership comes to be considered, in the light of the fact that France herself is not in favour of supra-national government and France has so far been the stumbling block to the admission of the United Kingdom and our application seems to be irretrievably linked with the United Kingdom?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to recent similar questions I have set up a working party to review existing arrangements for encouraging savings and to examine the possibility of improving them.  I expect to receive the report of the working party at an early date, and a decision on their recommendations will be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It has for many years been the practice to employ industrial and similar consultants where the expertise provided by them was not available within the existing structure of Government Departments. References to this practice will be found in the Budget speeches for 1961 and 1963 and in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion, 1964.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that, of late, the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been refusing applications for credit for development purposes; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the present policy of the Corporation regarding agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As against £5 million approximately in the last financial year the Corporation have already lent £5.4 million in the present financial year and will have lent £5.7 million approximately by 31st March next.</P>
      <P>As I have already explained in reply to previous questions, when capital is short, priority must be given to loans for directly productive purposes.  For this reason the Corporation are giving priority to loans under the unsecured loans scheme, and to loans for live-stock, seeds, fertilisers and essential machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corporation consider that this information should not be disclosed more frequently than is required under section 5 (4) of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, that is, at the end of each financial year. Obtaining deposits is a competitive and confidential business.  I agree with the views of the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the amount retained as a liquid reserve, the moneys received from deposits are used to finance the Corporation's lending policy, and reduce <Col N="1616" /> the amount of Exchequer support required for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>It is the considered view of the Government that in the circumstances of this year the holding of the Presidential and local elections on the same date would be undesirable.  In arriving at this decision we had regard to previous experience in 1945 of the holding of these elections on the same day.</P>
      <P>In taking the decision not to repeat the 1945 experience the Government considered also the possibility that they might have the concurrence therein of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, and of the newspapers which ordinarily follow the line taken by these Parties, in view of the strong criticism which the then leaders Deputies Mulcahy and Costello and the late Deputies Norton and R. Corish expressed of the decision to hold both elections on the same date on that occasion on the ground that it was designed to serve the political interests of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that the decision to hold the Presidential and local government elections on separate dates in this year was influenced to any considerable extent by the expectation that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and their supporting newspapers would not take a different view <Col N="1619" /> on this occasion.  Our decision was based on a careful assessment of the experience of 1945, which made it clear that it would be more conducive to the proper conduct of each election to hold them on separate dates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Fianna Fáil economic axe has fallen on health, education, housing, the Garda Band and the FCA?  In view of the fact that the country is now facing a serious financial crisis, why is it that the Minister is prepared to plunge the country into the expense and uncertainty of two elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional expense, placed against the holding of these elections properly, is not a matter of great significance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that the figures he has given are not the correct and proper figures. Surely the Minister knows that the holding of these two elections will cost the country about half a million pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>The cost of holding local elections is borne by the local authorities and could range from about £100,000 to £120,000, depending on the extent to which local authorities decide to issue polling cards.

      <P>Duties performed by Gardaí in connection with elections and activities related thereto are in many cases carried out on a part-time basis and are combined in varying degree with other police duties.  It would accordingly not be possible to give an estimate of the total number of Gardaí required for election work or the cost of salaries or incidental expenses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the position of vocational education in the city of Dublin.  I would preface my remarks by paying tribute to the Minister for his dedication in the field of education and the wonderful results he has brought about in many aspects of education in which I am interested outside this House.</P>
      <P>In the city of Dublin at the moment, we are faced with a very serious decision as regards vocational training for boys and girls.  Last year, we had 600 boys who could not be taken into schools because we had no space for them.  It is a tribute to Deputy Hillery, the previous Minister for Education, that that number was cut very much indeed.  We look forward this year to the fact that, under the present Minister, we shall wipe out this deficit in pupil space.  If we cannot take a boy into the vocational school, it means that that boy may be denied the right of ever serving his time to a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee has a huge programme on hands.  I make a plea for special consideration for the city in order that we may carry out this vast programme.  At the moment, the city is trying to provide schools in Coolock, Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Rathmines, Ringsend, the North Strand and other <Col N="1641" /> places.  The ratepayers, this year, will contribute £306,000 towards the cost of education.</P>
    <P>In the city, we ask no man where he comes from, if he seeks education in the schools.  At the moment, there are 27,000 people in the schools, including the boys and girls in the day classes.  This year, the total expenditure in the city will be £1,600,000.  This is a vast sum and thanks to the Minister for, first of all, some time ago examining the pay of teachers in the schools.  The teachers' conditions were improved very much indeed but this cost money and, this year, we have to face an increase of £300,000 for education&mdash;and this is purely vocational education.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the city, as apart from the rest of the country, because this programme of ours will cost many millions of pounds.  At the same time, there is a great degree of urgency.  I do not think any of us would be happy if even one boy or girl is denied the right of post-primary education in our vocational schools and this is particularly so in the case of boys as it may mean a handicap by the loss of a trade which they will carry for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which I would ask the Minister to consider and, actually, he has already done this.  Some time ago, I asked him if he proposes to increase the field of scholarships.  The Minister replied that he proposes to introduce legislation whereby local authorities may increase the number of scholarships with suitable Government backing.  If we are to advance and if we are to fulfil our hopes for the country, it is terribly essential that vocational education be given a primary place in the scheme of things.  No parent today wants to see his child finish his education in a primary school.  I venture to say that each one of us, irrespective of the side of the House we may occupy, believes we must increase the opportunities for post-primary education, whether it be in a secondary or in a vocational school.</P>
    <P>With further industrialisation, the vocational schools will play a much <Col N="1642" /> bigger part than they have done in the past in preparing our youth to face life and, by their efforts, to contribute to the wealth of the country.  Under the existing laws, a local authority can contribute only a certain amount to the vocational education programme. In Dublin city&mdash;and I am sure it is the same with other authorities&mdash;it is the product of 2/- in the £.  In Dublin, this means about £300,000.  This is all we can contribute in Dublin Corporation. We should like to contribute more but, at the same time, we feel this is a very heavy burden on the ratepayers. Perhaps some day we shall get around to changing the whole financing of education and make it a common charge.</P>
    <P>Whether they come from outside the city or outside the country, we turn away nobody from the schools.  They are very welcome to come to study in our schools but unfortunately we cannot extend it to boys and girls where we have not the space.  Take, for example, Ballyfermot, which is a growing suburb.  Only a few months ago, we opened a new boys' school there. In the course of the next year or so, there will be a grave problem in that area of how to accommodate the young students who wish to be educated there. I am quite confident that, with his dynamic drive to improve matters, the Minister will wipe out that deficit of 300 places for pupils in the boys' school.</P>
    <P>We are doing what we can for education, with the help of the Minister. In one area, we are using a primary school as a vocational school, not that the general population has fallen but because more children are seeking secondary education or vocational education.</P>
    <P>There is one last point which I should like to touch upon.  Nearing completion in the city at the moment is a new college of technology where men and women will be trained to the very highest degree in various aspects of technology.  I am wondering if, in the city or the country, we could not have a tie-up between the universities and the college of technology.  This new college, I would say, will be far better equipped as regards technology than some of our universities.  I think we <Col N="1643" /> could effect some economies by bringing the university people and the vocational education authority together and working out a scheme whereby men and women who qualify at the college of technology could qualify for a degree in the university with some further examination.</P>
    <P>On the subject of university education, I would ask the Minister to consider the fact that, last year, many students in this city were unable to get admission to the medical school of University College Dublin although they had done a &ldquo;pre-Med.&rdquo; course before that.  There was just no room for them.  I know of one family where the mother and father made great sacrifices to educate their child there but she was turned down this year because they could not admit her. That is happening at a time when we talk about sending our graduates to under-developed countries&mdash;and I am all for that.  However, I think we have to examine, at all levels&mdash;vocational, secondary and university&mdash;the great problem of lack of space for students. I have every confidence that, by this time next year, the Minister will remove many of the grievances I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <P>I simply want to take advantage of the Supplementary Estimate to inquire from the Minister in relation to a number of points dealing with the transport of national school children in any area who attend schools which may be closed. Is there any set of regulations and rules governing this matter that could be supplied to Deputies by the Department of Education?  When questions are asked of Deputies, it is very unsatisfactory not to be able to give a definite reply.  Such questions were asked of me last week by a deputation in connection with Coolnahorna national school, County Waterford, which, I understand, will be closed next June.  I felt I was unable to answer the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that yesterday, in reply to a colleague of mine on these benches &mdash;Deputy Mrs. Desmond&mdash;the Minister indicated that the cost of transport <Col N="1644" /> would not fall on the children concerned but would be a charge&mdash;in part, anyhow&mdash;on the manager of the school.  Unfortunately, in rural areas, anyhow, we find that where managers of schools&mdash;even where they get subventions from the State&mdash;are charged to supply heating, such as fires, for example, they very often pass on the charge to the pupils.  I fear very much that, when it becomes a financial charge on the manager of the school, we may indeed find that whatever portion of the fare will be charged to the school manager, it will be passed on to the pupils' parents and perhaps may excessively be passed on.  Unless there is some definite regulation to which we can point, it will be difficult to indicate what amount of expense, if any, the parents will be obliged to meet.</P>
    <P>I have already given the Minister particulars of the school in question. I am relying on his good judgment. Having regard to the fact that there is a school-going population of 38 and that the school was built as recently as 20 years ago, it is my personal belief that a small addition would enable it to come into the two-teacher category. The pupils attend from a widely scattered area.  I understand that the means of transport contemplated is a minibus.  That would mean a saving in the number of trips required to bring the children to school.  May I ask if the old school will be the fixed point of departure to the proposed new school in Rathcormac?  These are things parents would like to know. Definitely, they would prefer that the school would remain open and be developed into a two-teacher school, but should that be contrary to ministerial policy, I presume I have very little hope of having that policy changed, although I depend on the good sense of the Minister to have the matter considered as favourably as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another question I should like to put to the Minister.  When pupils leave home and assemble at whatever point or points may be indicated, do they immediately become covered as they would be if they were <Col N="1645" /> at school?  I understand that once they are in school, they are in the charge of the manager.  In whose charge are they during transport from the point of assembly until they reach the school, which, in this case, would be a distance of eight to ten miles in some cases and not less than six miles in many cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the vast majority of pupils who may be transferred are children of rather tender age, from four to seven years. Unless they are accompanied to the assembly point and unless somebody takes charge of them in a minibus, I can visualise overcrowding of the bus with serious danger to life.  I would suggest to the Minister that some carrying capacity should be indicated so that young children of tender age will not be put in with more adult children of up to 14 years of age, both boys and girls, who, at that age, are not noted for gentleness or consideration for others.  The Minister should give serious consideration to these points.  I have asked him privately to do so and I am sure he will.</P>
    <P>There are just two other points relating to my constituency on which I should like information from the Minister. One is in regard to the Christian Brothers' secondary schools in Dungarvan. The Christian Brothers are in process of opening a new primary school for which they got a substantial grant, for which they are very grateful. The school will be opened on 9th March and I understand that the Minister has indicated that he will send some of his officials to the opening ceremony.  In the case of the secondary school, which was the second Christian Brothers' school to be opened in Ireland and has been in existence for over 100 years, there is serious need of reconstruction.  There is a very large school-going population in the neighbourhood. The school caters for children within a radius of 15 miles of Dungarvan.  The school is an all-Irish school, all subjects being taught through the medium of Irish.  I would ask the Minister favourably to consider the making of a grant towards the reconstruction and if he could see his way to give such a grant quickly, it <Col N="1646" /> might be possible to get the contractors who are to finish work on the primary school prior to 9th March to continue and to carry out the reconstruction of the secondary school.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to interest himself in the proposed vocational school for Kilmacthomas.  This project has been under consideration for eight or nine years.  I know a good deal of the fault lies in the fact that there was a change of site and that our architect may not have been as expeditious with plans and specifications as he might have been.  I do think that the Minister should intervene and endeavour to have the school provided as soon as possible.  It is costing quite an amount of money to parents whose children have to travel 15 or 16 miles and in some cases a good deal more in order to attend school in Dungarvan. The parents pay half the bus fare and the school authorities, comprising the Department and the ratepayers, I expect, pay the other half.  It is a considerable hardship on the pupils that they have to wait until approximately 5 p.m. for the bus to take them home. In winter they arrive home in the dark of night.  If the school in Kilmacthomas were available, it would serve the entire area around the centre of Waterford. I would ask the Minister to urge on the persons responsible the importance of completing the school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to voice the feelings of some of my constituents who are deeply concerned about the new proposed policy of the Minister with regard to the closing of one- and two-teacher schools.  I am sincere when I tell the Minister that that proposal has caused consternation and indignation in at least two areas with which I am concerned.  The persons there have been forced to the conclusion&mdash;to which I do not subscribe&mdash;that a Dublinman who has been honoured by appointment as Minister for Education has no concern with rural areas. I, knowing the Minister, realise that that is not correct.  But, if some of these people to whom I am referring had been here last night listening to Deputy Briscoe, they would have been <Col N="1647" /> confirmed in their opinion.  Deputy Briscoe is another Dublinman.  I do not know whether he was quite sincere or not but he disclosed a terrible lack of knowledge of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>He said that he welcomed the proposed policy of the Minister, that it would confer big benefits on the areas concerned, which, of course, is quite incorrect.  He further said, disagreeing with what Deputy Jones said earlier, that, if a pilot area were set up as an experiment, the squeals and screams from those concerned would be loud and long.  I can assure Deputy Briscoe &mdash;he is not here now&mdash;that if he had expressed himself after the same fashion at one of these meetings, the squeals and screams from him would be very loud when the people threatened to lynch him.  Without any disrespect to the Deputy concerned, I would say his speech was typical of the kind of speech one would hear from a Dublin jackeen.  That is a term related to Old Dublin like &ldquo;Molly Malone,&rdquo; The Commbe, the &ldquo;Mountjoy Hotel,&rdquo; etc., etc.  There is no disrespect. That would be the reaction of the people to such a speech from Deputy Briscoe.</P>
      <P>I wonder will this be used now as an excuse by the Minister and his Department to prolong the delay in carrying out very necessary repairs to a great many schools, schools which have been passed for improvement long since.  I had personal experience of dealing with the Minister in connection with one school.  It was under consideration for so long that in the last communication I had from the Minister, he said he would consider my suggestion and provide a prefabricated school in the interim period until the new school was built.  Such a school was never provided; neither were any steps taken to improve the old school or build the new one.  I fear the position is as bad in relation to a great many other schools.  They will become very much worse before anything will be done with them.  The stock answer will be that, in view of the change in policy, the matter is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I have here before me a copy of a memorandum which was sent to the Minister from one area in support of a claim for the retention there of a two-teacher school.  It is pointed out in the memorandum that the area concerned is a purely farming area.  If the school is closed, that will have a detrimental effect on the economy for the following reasons: as dairy farmers, they have been encouraged to produce more; they are endeavouring to do that in the face of great difficulties; doing away with the school in the area will naturally interfere with labour.  The labour problem is bad enough in that area.  I will give the Minister the name of the school&mdash;it is Curraghs national school, Liscarroll, County Cork.  It has been openly stated by some of the labourers that, if the policy proposed is implemented, they will leave the district. That will make the present difficult problem still more acute since it will be impossible to replace labour.  They also point out that there is no guarantee that the children dispossessed will go to the proposed central school.  They will probably go to school in the nearest town, my home town, of Kanturk. They will immediately become town and city minded and there will be no great likelihood of their returning to the rural areas.  Unfortunately too many are becoming town and city minded as it is.  This new policy will aggravate that trend.</P>
    <P>Again, the problem of transport will arise.  The Minister said yesterday there would be free transport.  The Minister knows very well that not even free transport will work satisfactorily for very young children.  The parents then will be forced to transport their children to the school of their choice morning and evening.  I would like to know from the Minister, if a school is closed and the proposed policy is implemented, is it suggested that the children dispossessed must go to the central school?  It was stated at a meeting at which I was present by a member of the Government side of the House that the children would not be allowed to go anywhere else.  I said I did not believe that and I hope it is not true.  It would be very dictatorial to say the least of it.  I do not believe <Col N="1649" /> the Minister would resort to that extreme.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out, too, that the closing of a school in a district would lead to a depreciation in the value of property in that district.  I subscribe to that view.  I am an auctioneer and, in all advertising, one of the features stressed is convenience to schools; the phrase generally is &ldquo;conveniently situated to church, school and creamery&rdquo;.  These are the important amenities in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is also pointed out that the schoolhouse is the social centre of the parish.  It is used for agricultural classes, for meetings of the ICA, and so on and so forth.  It is a general meeting point in the district.  In this particular school there is a flourishing branch of the county library.  That is a tremendous advantage.  Because of statements made, the trouble was taken to inquire from secondary teachers as to the standards of the pupils going to them from the smaller schools, especially from the two-teacher schools.  They were assured by the headmasters that the pupils compared very favourably and that they were actually better in some instances than the pupils from the town schools. That speaks very highly for the methods adopted and the teaching done in these small schools.  There is the personal interest in the pupils. That is lost when the children go into bigger schools.  With some pupils the personal touch is very important.  The point has also been made by these people that a very small percentage of the teddy boys, the Mods and Rockers, the juvenile delinquents, come from those areas but once they get a taste of the towns and cities, things will change very much.  That is a big point in favour of retaining these small schools.</P>
    <P>There is also a very big objection in regard to transport.  It was suggested at one time that these children were more backward than those who had the benefit of attending bigger schools. If that were so, which is not subscribed to by everybody, it is going to be very much worse now because no parent in the rural areas will put <Col N="1650" /> children of tender years on a bus with bigger pupils, let them off for the day and hope they will arrive back safely some time that night in the dark.  If parents have to avail of that transport, young children will not start school until two years later than normally, which will be a decided disadvantage to them in after life.  Even if it were safe to send these young children to bigger schools, we know that there are some young children who require more care than others in their kinder-garten days.  There would be no one at all to look after them and there would be no provision made to give them a hot meal which would be very necessary for them and which could be brought to them if the school were convenient to home.</P>
    <P>These points were ably put by these people and I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter on the lines suggested yesterday by Deputy Jones of the Fine Gael Party. It is very wrong to have one policy for the whole country in this connection. There may be a good case in respect of one-teacher schools but I do not think any good case can be made for the closing of two-teacher schools.  They are an important social service in the life of the rural areas, and traditionally so.  They should be retained in an effort to preserve the rural community who are so important to the social and economic life of our country.</P>
    <P>One other point I should like to put to the Minister is in regard to subsidising transport for post-primary education.  There are some parents' associations making a very good job of it at the moment, but it is very difficult to provide the necessary finances.  I was concerned in one case where we consulted CIE, and their minimum estimate was £70 a week. Through the good offices of some people, we got a private bus owner interested who said that in order to open the service he would be prepared to do it for so much, which I can say was very much less than what CIE required.  However, it is very hard to keep up the finances and, in view of the importance of post-primary education, <Col N="1651" /> I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task in the public press by Deputy Meaney who attended one of these meetings at which I was present and who said I did not know what I was talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy deny his Party's policy last July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out on that occasion, when discussing the matter after Deputy Meaney had spoken, that these were personal views and not Party policy, and Deputy Meaney knew that.  He also stated that Deputies should not make an election platform out of such meetings.  I do not think anybody was making election platforms out of such meetings.  We were sincerely concerned about the people in question.  It might be a lot better for Deputies to tell the people in plain language: &ldquo;We cannot do anything for you&rdquo;, than to string them along and say: &ldquo;We will help you to make a good case&rdquo;.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the overall policy in regard to the closing of one-teacher and two-teacher schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to pay a very special tribute to the Minister for the dignified and gentlemanly way he has handled some of the onslaughts on himself.  I should imagine the greatest difficulty the Minister faces is putting up with the advice of amateur educationists. Some of those amateur educationists ride their hobbyhorses in public but some of them do not go back to the unsaddling enclosure to get the true result at the weigh-in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very much concerned and involved in the question of one-teacher and two-teacher schools over the past five months because the first opinions that were voiced came from the parents in Goggins Hill in Ballinhassig which is part of the constituency I represent.  I attended a meeting there, together with my fellow Deputies for the area.  In my own way I tried to point out the advantages of the central school idea and the parents there <Col N="1652" /> seemed to be reasonably receptive to that idea.  Eventually the Minister agreed to meet a deputation from this area and he did so.  Every one of them was enormously impressed with the sincere approach the Minister had to education and it was agreed at their request that he would erect a prefabricated school at Goggins Hill.</P>
    <P>The Minister later communicated with the reverend manager and said he was going to erect this school but then a strike was called by the parents.  In my opinion, this was the most irresponsible action I have ever seen parents undertake because the only people to suffer will be the children themselves and, despite what Deputy Burton may think, I pointed out in public to them that it was in their interest, to agree to the central school idea.  There were some forces very strongly against it and by a majority decision, it was agreed to hold the strike which I here publicly would like to disagree with completely.</P>
    <P>Many on the Fine Gael benches have spoken about what a wonderful thing it would be if we had physical education, civics and nature study in our schools.  This is very laudable and everyone would love to see it but how practical is it with a one-teacher school?  In my opinion, it is impossible and so, in order to be consistent, you must concede that if you want these subjects taught, you must have more teachers in the schools.  Instead of having the whole educational curriculum confined to certain subjects as at present, the expansion and widening of the curriculum is in every pupil's interest.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised to hear Deputy Jones, whom I consider to be a very good judge of education and very sincere in his approach to it, not agreeing to this policy because I should have thought that the Deputy, with his knowledge of what is involved in schools from his practical experience, would have been one of the first to endorse the Minister's decision on the central school idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly why&mdash; from my experience, I would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1653" />
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that from the Deputy's experience he would have seen the tremendous benefit to be gained from this type of central school.  I know the Deputy does not normally play politics unless forced to do so, and obviously his approach is sincere.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear that the Department have ceased to recruit unqualified teachers and that we shall now go ahead full steam, utilising only qualified teachers.  I represent part of a county, Cork, which has the highest percentage of secondary school pupils in the country in relation to the population at secondary schools and this idea in post-primary education of the comprehensive school will be welcomed by the vast majority.  At least that was the impression I got in discussing it with various people connected with education.</P>
      <P>If changes are to be brought about in our educational system and in education, it follows that there must be either change or stagnation.  There must be some point of initiative.  There must be some central administrative authority and in my opinion, the only central point of co-ordinating administrative authority is the Minister for Education and his Department. If you were to build a secondary or vocational school many years ago or even up to the present day, you were assured of its being filled and utilised to its fullest capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in our 900 post-primary schools we have, in the opinion of the Department of Education, enough accommodation for all who want to avail of post-primary education. Obviously, in such circumstances the unco-ordinated building of secondary and vocational schools could go on indefinitely.  Equally, obviously neither the secondary nor vocational authorities could be expected to take the initiative in calling a halt to unplanned building.  The point has arrived where the only existing central administrative authority is the State and the State must act.  The time has come, in other words, where all the post-primary education needs should be planned and budgeted for scientifically, <Col N="1654" /> which is the way I view what the present Minister and the Department are endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>The matter of accommodation is only one difficulty that can be reasonably easily surmounted with a certain amount of capital and organisation.  A more complex problem is that of providing sufficient trained teachers. Again, this is the ultimate responsibility of the State but I think it is well within the capacity of the State and the Department to deal with this problem. There remains the whole problem of the child itself.  If he or she is to be compelled to attend school until the age of 15, the point of principle arises as to which school the child should attend.  If there are only secondary schools and if the theory of the private nature of the secondary school were followed to its logical conclusion, there could never be a raising of the school leaving age.</P>
    <P>But I know that to deny post-primary education to any Irish child is a crime in the eyes of anybody who takes a responsible view of education. Obviously what the Minister and the Department are trying to bring about is co-operation and collaboration between secondary and vocational schools on this problem.  Even then, the problems only begin to emerge when the compulsory school leaving age of 15 is adopted and we compel children to go to school up to that age.  We must provide the type of courses that are suitable for him or her.  I do not think anyone would consider that either secondary or vocational schools make that type of provision at the moment.  The vocational school course is only of two years duration and the secondary school course is generally three years.  While the secondary school course is entirely a bookish course, the vocational course is largely practical and there is a wide range available to the child who presents himself for this type of education.</P>
    <P>Obviously if this type of child is to be catered for, the secondary and vocational syllabuses will have to be brought into reasonably close conformity with each other.  If the vocational school pupils are to have a <Col N="1655" /> proper chance, the course will have to be lengthened from two to three years. This is what has been decided upon by the Department and by the Minister and what is about to begin next year. In 1970, we hope to have raised the school leaving age to 15 years and now is the time to plan for that change and not wait until 1970.  I do not think in those circumstances, that anyone can accuse the Minister of not planning far enough ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the agricultural schools available to us.  In the book <i>Investment in Education</i> on page 15, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In addition to grammar and vocational post-primary education, there are also some more specialised forms of second level education.  The most important of these is agricultural education.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the pleasure of attending the opening of an extension to the agricultural college at Darrara.  The facilities available there to people who wish to make their living from agriculture are tremendous and I would like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education for making this type of education available to the people of Cork city and county who wish to avail of it.  In addition, we have the Munster Institute where the training of domestic economy instructresses takes place. The only complaint I received was that we still have not got enough but we are moving in the right direction and are planning to link up our future educational needs with our future manpower needs.  We are stimulating vocational courses which are closely linked with our manpower policy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to thank the Minister for the courtesy he extended to the people from my constituency when they came up here to discuss their problems with him.  I would like to say that I am one hundred per cent behind him in what he is trying to achieve for the benefit of Irish education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Burton in the statement he has made <Col N="1656" /> with regard to the closing of schools. Deputy Burton's point is that there would appear to be some schools in his area under the hammer at the moment as far as closing is concerned and the school he seemed to have in mind is that at Liscarroll.  I know this district and I know the hardships the people in it will have to meet in the event of any of the two-teacher schools having to close down.  I believe that three or four other districts are in a similar position.  The schools in them are probably old and require to be replaced, redecorated or repaired in the near future.  The Minister must bear in mind that as far as some of these schools are concerned, it will be a great hardship on both children and parents to provide transport to any central school that might be thought of.  These districts are far removed from any centre where alternative education might be available.</P>
      <P>Parents will be very reluctant to avail of this transport from the point of view of having their children out from early morning until the late hours of the evening.  We have had experience in east Cork and mid-Cork of parent's associations asking public representatives for assistance to keep the existing two-teacher schools in operation.  I attended one of those meetings and listened to the points put up by the parents and in particular to the obvious hardships they would have to bear if the schools were closed.  I must agree with some of the points put forward by the parents and I do believe that a great deal of hardship will be caused to the schoolgoing children.</P>
      <P>Children who up to now had the opportunity of going to school at four or five years of age will probably not be able to go now until they are past six years of age.  The younger the child is, the more care and attention it will have to be given when it goes to school, so I would ask the Minister to examine the position of the two-teacher schools before he makes a decision to close them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular matter with which the Minister should concern himself.  Up and down the country we <Col N="1657" /> have a number of old schools in a poor state of repair and, in addition, with no sanitary services.  These may even be four or five-teacher schools. They may have been built many years ago and whoever is responsible for them, the manager or the Department, an immediate effort should be made to put them into a proper sanitary condition.  There was a school built in my area in 1934 and it was only last year that the necessary sanitary services were laid on, after years of agitation by the parents and people of the district.  We have many more schools of that type and the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the school managers, should ensure that the necessary sanitary facilities are laid on as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as school transport is concerned, we have in County Cork the great desire of the parents to have post-primary education provided for their children and to have transport to the centres where this is available provided as quickly as possible.  I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the provision of transport but there are many parents who find it extremely difficult even to attempt to finance the transport and as a result they are probably imposing hardship on themselves and on their children.  We have people travelling long distances to secondary schools in Newmarket and Kanturk, and, as Deputy Burton pointed out, as a result of the efforts of the parents, they have succeeded in providing transport through their voluntary contributions.  To my mind, that imposes a hardship on them, and particularly on the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of North-East Cork, there is a school about which I should like the Department to make up their minds in the near future.  In the parish of Castlemagner, a dispute has been going on for a long period between the parents and the school manager as to where the new school should be located.  The present school is at Ballyhass and there is a difference of opinion in regard to the new school. One thing that must be said about the <Col N="1658" /> engineers attached to the old British Government was that they located schools convenient to the people.  The dispute about this school has been going on for two years and while I am not suggesting where the school should be located, I do suggest, for the benefit of the children in that parish, that they should get consideration and that that consideration should be given as speedily as possible.  I shall conclude by asking the Minister that, if possible, he should consider the question of subsidising transport in remote localities. This is important as far as post-primary education is concerned.  I should also like him to consider the provision of sanitary services within the schools, which is very necessary at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to attack the Minister or to make a Party issue of this that I rise to speak in this debate.  I am here to express the views of the people of Sligo-Leitrim.  In that constituency the majority of the schools are one- or two-teacher schools except in a few towns, and particularly in a large centre like Sligo.  We Deputies for the constituency have been approached about the proposed closing of a few schools in the area and of course there will be many more before long earmarked for closure if this trend continues.  We were approached about two schools in particular, Carrickgeengear, Manorhamilton, in Leitrim and Glenkilamy in Sligo.  Notification has been given that the Minister intends to close these schools.  I will not say anything about them because we have questions down for tomorrow and we expect that the Minister will be giving us an answer about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national school in a rural area has always been a social centre and very often people looked to the teacher for advice.  They had discussions with the teacher about how their children were progressing.  The number of pupils is limited in them and it is easy for the teacher to concentrate on the children who number about 30 or 40, while some 12 or 14 years ago they numbered 50 or 60.  If this change which the Minister has in view takes <Col N="1659" /> place, little toddlers of four years of age will be going by bus for a distance of perhaps eight miles to a town.  This will create great hardship for them. This type of child is going to school today but if he has to go two miles to the crossroads and then take a bus to the school, he will be leaving the house, in the months from October to April, in the dark and will be returning home in the dark.  I do not think that this will appeal to the people who have always sent their children to the local school.  We should not forget that those schools, even in the remote areas, have produced the best of scholars who have given a good account of themselves in Church and State.  What has happened in the past could happen again.  In know of rural schools, some of them in very backward areas, and if I were to mention the names of some of the scholars who came from those schools, the House would indeed be surprised.  We should not find fault with these schools for they played a big part in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>If this proposal is proceeded with, there will be a greater inclination on the part of the youth, when they have finished their schooling, to move from the rural areas.  I have no hesitation in saying that as a Deputy it will be my duty to stand behind those people who have made representations to me to speak against the closing of those schools.  Anywhere I think a school should be closed, if it has a very small number of children attending, I will advise the parents to give way, but where there is a reasonable number of children going to the school and where the prospects for even a further ten, 12 or 14 children going to that school next year are good, I will be in favour of keeping that school open. In my area we have children, after reaching the age of 14 years, going to the local town to obtain their vocational education or secondary education and the people are satisfied with that position.  A few years makes all the difference for these children and of course they can pursue their studies further if they wish to.</P>
    <P>The question of cost should not enter very much into this matter because <Col N="1660" /> where a teacher is giving good service in a school, we should not count the cost of his salary or anything else.  If we relate the cost of transport for a year to the cost of his salary, and so on, the difference would not be great. It would be much cheaper to have the teacher than to have one or two minibuses and their drivers, even if the teacher were only in a one-room school.  It would be better to have that than to have these minibuses travelling around the country, with the children having to leave their houses at an early hour.  As I say, cost should not come into this.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is a holdup in the carrying out of extensions to a few vocational schools.  I would ask the Minister to try to get that work going as soon as possible.  The children have little space and nothing can be done until these extensions are carried out.</P>
    <P>For the past few years there has been a demand for a school of technology in Sligo.  The people are most anxious that the Minister will sanction such a proposal and have asked me to have it speeded up.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the sanitary conditions in some schools in my constituency. No matter what happens, we still have such schools with us.  The conditions in them are dangerous both for the children and the teachers.  I directed the Minister's attention to a school in the village of Ballintogher and there is another serious case in the Rantogue area of County Leitrim.  I shall give the Minister particulars and ask him to check on them.  It is too bad when we are spending such huge sums at present that the provision for repairs and facilities for small schools such as these is being neglected.</P>
    <P>We are not going to say that we do not approve of the closing of some of the small schools.  Where the number of pupils attending is very small, we must be reasonable.  But if there is any hope at all of the averages being kept up, I would appeal to the Minister not to close those schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking because we will have an <Col N="1661" /> opportunity of dealing with education on a broader field when the Estimate comes before us.  I think all Deputies will admit that the Minister is reaching out for perfection in the field of education.  Much progress has already been made.  We know there are many defects in the present system and it is the Minister's responsibility to try to remedy them.  Never before in our history has the demand for education been greater than at present.  Therefore, the Department of Education must review the whole system and provide something to meet not alone the wishes of Deputies but of local authorities as well.</P>
      <P>To achieve anything worthwhile in education requires the co-operation of all Deputies, members of local authorities, religious communities and, above all, of parents.  We all have our responsibilities. Political affiliations must be set aside where education is concerned. The child must be our first consideration. I have sympathy with rural Deputies.  Nevertheless, Deputies are obliged to bring certain facts before the deputations of parents referred to here.  It is easy for parents to be misled with regard to two-teacher schools.  I wonder how many of us have explained to parents that certain changes must now be made in the interests of education and in the interests of their families?  I have heard it said from the opposite side that Deputies say one thing to parents and another thing here.  I do not approve of that.  Unpopular steps have to be taken and we must be honest in this matter.  We must start by educating the parents themselves and conveying to them the importance of education at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have an opportunity of discussing comprehensive schools at a later date.  In all this talk about upset and inconvenience, we forget the most significant point, that is: what system is the best to adopt?  It is natural that we should encounter opposition in these matters but we must be prepared to stand up here and say: &ldquo;I believe that this is the best system for the education of our children.&rdquo;  I heard a very enlightening speech yesterday by Deputy Jones.  I am fully aware of his experience in this field.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1662" /> I am convinced in regard to what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>We have many problems in Cork city.  We have over-crowding and, what is worse, a long waiting list.  I visited a school last week and saw two classes in session in the one room.  I must ask myself if the time has come to review this whole matter of education. At present many schools are making arrangements for extensions and trying to provide the comprehensive system in their own schools. Everybody is trying to improve education. We should co-operate as far as possible with the Department in providing the best possible system, a system worthy of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wyse was sincere in asking for co-operation in this matter.  Before one can fully co-operate, there must be leadership.  I listened very attentively to my colleague from Dublin city, Deputy Moore, when he saw fit to praise the Minister for what he has done up to the present.  I have the greatest regard for the Minister and I am satisfied he would do a better job if he were allowed but I do not think there is anything at all to rejoice about.  Quite obviously, what needs to be done is not being done.  This perhaps can be attributed to the Government policy of stalling&mdash;call it what you like.  Instead of continuing to give lip-service to this important matter of education, something positive will have to be done.</P>
      <P>It is about time something positive were done about post-primary education training.  Deputy Moore made a case which clearly indicates to my mind how the Government, and the Department of Education, in particular, have fallen down on this very important matter.  He went on to explain that there are queues for the vocational schools and queues for University College, Dublin.  This will continue and there is no use in putting down in any book &ldquo;This is what we dream of&rdquo;.  It is about time we got down to doing something positive about this job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Far too often&mdash;and it still continues &mdash;children are left to depend on the parents' pocket for further education. We can all say: &ldquo;Get together and do something about it&rdquo;.  The obvious way in which it can be done is for the Minister for Education to twist the arm of the Minister for Finance and to get him to &ldquo;cough up&rdquo; the necessary money for it.</P>
    <P>An aspect of this matter which very often intrigues me is the absence of interest in boys and girls coming up to 14 years of age who leave school at 14 years.  Through questions in this House, and through inquiries elsewhere, I have tried to ascertain how many boys and girls can be accounted for as coming into employment between the ages of 14 and 16 years. Not even the Taoiseach can give an answer to that question.  They are nobody's children.  Nobody takes account of this important aspect of the matter.  This is a dreadful situation in our country.  It is an indictment of any Government that such a situation should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>When we think in terms of vocational education, there is one main point we must bear in mind, that is, our ability or otherwise to procure a sufficient number of competent teachers.  I am a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and it has been my experience&mdash;as, I am sure, it has been the experience of other Deputies who are or who have been members of vocational education committees throughout this Republic &mdash;that we cannot get the types of teachers we should like to get because of our inability to pay the salaries such people command.  We are not in a position to induce a sufficient number of competent teachers to leave their employment with different firms to take up the job of teaching in the vocational schools.  Try as the vocational education committees might to have the situation changed, and let them perfect the case as much as they can to produce evidence to the Department of Education that they have been unable to get a first-class man as a teacher for a particular job, it has not succeeded in getting the Department of <Col N="1664" /> Education to change their attitude on this matter.  That goes not only for the present Minister but it went for his predecessor in office and for the man in office before him again.  It seems that there is a hidden hand in the Department of Education which derives great satisfaction out of stalling things, particularly if it is considered that it is in the interests of &ldquo;progress&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the one-and two-teacher schools.  I am concerned about the absence of schools in my constituency.  I know of young children who have been and still are obliged to walk for miles in the city of Dublin to reach school because the Minister has refused to give them transport.  They have to walk miles in the rain and in all sorts of inclement weather and nothing is done about it. We also have a situation where transport is supplied for children from corporation housing schemes to the centre of the city but when they get into the centre of the city, they may have to walk considerable distances to their respective schools because further transport is not laid on for them.</P>
    <P>I came across an extraordinary situation quite recently.  I had to come to the assistance of one of my constituents who found himself on strike and who, because he could not pay the few shillings per week to send his child to school into the heart of the city, was threatened with prosecution.  He could not afford to do so because he was on strike, but nevertheless he was threatened with prosecution.  The fact that school accommodation was not available near the child's home was not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether the point I now intend to raise is really the problem of the Department of Education or the Department of Finance or, in fact, whose baby it is but certainly they have made a nice little football out of it.  I refer to the question of who intends to bear the cost of recruiting and educating catering workers for the catering industry.</P>

Representations have repeatedly been made to the Minister but unfortunately he cannot get his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, who can pontificate to trade union workers and tell them how to behave, to make up his mind on matters of this kind.  I would ask the Minister for Education to get on proper speaking terms with the Minister for Transport and Power and to try to rectify that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural Deputy who has been asked by certain parents to do so, I should like to speak of the inconvenience and hardships their children are enduring because of the closing of a two-teacher school in my area.  The Minister has spoken of transport for children under this scheme but it has not yet been given to the children I speak for.</P>
      <P>The closing of the school in question came as a bombshell to the parents, for the simple reason that, two years ago, a site for a new school was selected right on a field adjacent to the existing school.  I admit that the attendance at the existing school has gone down very much but nevertheless its closing came as a very serious shock to the parents in the area.</P>
      <P>Apart from that case, I stand up to protest on behalf of many parents in the areas of North Clare and the areas of Clare as a whole because whilst this plan might be applicable to the cities and the larger towns it certainly is not by any means applicable to our rural areas, bearing in mind the schools in the remote areas of County Clare and, I daresay, in the counties of the west of the country.  It would be interesting to see how the pupils of these schools have turned out in adult life.  One would find many ex-pupils of these schools at the head of Government Departments and of big firms in this city and in many places throughout the world.  It was in these schools that it is now proposed to close that these people received their early education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how one may protest or how parents may feel about it, this scheme will be put into operation and I would like to suggest to the Minister <Col N="1666" /> that before he moves any further, he should settle the question of transport, which is the vital issue in this matter. I make that suggestion first of all, because of the hardships that will be imposed on young children if it is not settled and secondly, because it will take a long time to settle the question. The question of the conditions of roads in rural areas is involved.  There are roads, particularly in remote areas, over which a minibus or car could not travel.</P>
    <P>There is another point which must be made for the sake of the children. Under the School Attendance Act, parents must send their children to school and the Act has been very helpful in enforcing school attendance. Under section 4 of that Act, there is a limit of two miles for a child of ten years.  Over that distance, if there are not reasonable transport facilities available to a child's home, school attendance cannot be enforced.  Therefore, the question of transport should be settled.  If it is not, there are many parents who will be very glad to keep their children at home, in the knowledge that they will not be liable to penalty under the School Attendance Act.  In such cases we might be doing harm instead of promoting education.</P>
    <P>I have been told that this scheme has been initiated for the sake of economy.  In my view, the child's interest should take precedence over economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the interests of the child must come before economy.  It will take years to perfect the new scheme when it is in operation. After a certain number of years it will be very interesting to look back and see where the economy has been. When we are talking about economy, we should ask ourselves who will bear the brunt of the economy.  I am sorry to have to say that it is the small farmer who will do so.  Time after time we have listened to expressions <Col N="1667" /> of sympathy with the small farmer and his children.  The alleged economy in this sphere of education will add another burden to those that they already have to bear.</P>
      <P>In my view, in schools where there are 25 or 30 pupils, the children get more attention from the teacher than is the case where there are 50 pupils in a class.  The Minister knows as well as I do that where there are 50 pupils in a class, they are not all stars.  It is only natural that the teacher, for the sake of the school or for the credit which will accrue to him, will push the brilliant child and perhaps in some small way&mdash;I do not say altogether&mdash; the backward child may be neglected. That does not happen in a school of 25 pupils where the teacher at all times will be able to help the backward as well as the forward pupils.</P>

That does not mean that I want to harass the Minister. I am merely explaining my position. I am definitely against the closing of schools.  I know that the Minister's scheme will be put into operation at <Col N="1668" /> some time and I would ask him to ensure, before the scheme is operative, that arrangements will be made for reasonable transport facilities for the children.  That is all I am asking for. I hope the Minister will accept that suggestion from me and will take my criticism of the scheme he proposes as being not too severe but well merited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Party's position has been made clear through our spokeswoman, Deputy Mrs. Desmond, on this matter.  We are in favour, provided these conditions are met, in this matter of the one- and two-teacher schools, of the provision of transport. We are in favour of the educational system moving towards the provision of comprehensive schools.  That has been our policy since its formulation three or four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion on the Estimate is a discussion on education generally but the present controversy has practically dominated the remarks made in this debate.  It is probably a good thing that there is this controversy at this time because it has certainly opened up the whole area of education.  One of the most depressing things about any discussion on education up to recent years was the total veil of silence about the facts in Irish education, about the drawbacks in Irish education and about the methods of remedying these drawbacks.  We have the report <i>Investment in Education</i> which gives all Deputies ample material to speak with some accuracy on educational problems.  The present controversy has at least heightened public interest and we should be grateful for the fact that there is this controversy and that it has concentrated attention on education.  Our main case is that we have in Dublin a lack of facilities.  In my own constituency, we have Bolton Street, which is the second technological college in the city.  It is short of places.  It is short of staff because it operates on an insufficient budget.  The building facilities are inadequate for the work it has to do. Other Deputies can refer to similar shortages in educational equipment in their constituencies.  I hope to speak <Col N="1669" /> at greater length on this when the main Estimate is before the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that at some stage the Minister will take a look at our industrial and reformatory schools.  I am extremely concerned about the lack of inspection either by the Department or any other elected body in regard to what goes on in these schools.  I have heard quite alarming reports about children who are undernourished.  There is no particular check on either the treatment or the education they receive. I give notice now that I intend to start a campaign in relation to industrial and reformatory schools.  I believe these have suffered because of lack of attention in recent years.  This is another of the dark places I would hope controversy would open up to the full light of public discussion.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the present Minister, or any of his predecessors, in approaching this problem of improving our educational system was ignorant of, ignored or was contemptuous of the tradition behind the one- and two-teacher schools.  I am sure the Minister is just as well aware as any of the rest of us of the contribution these schools have made to the development of the country.  But times have changed.  Standards have changed.  Standards have gone up.  We require more in the system today and the fact is one- and two-teacher schools cannot provide the formal education now necessary.  We have only to look at the recent report of the technical schools on our emigrants.  We are numbered in the coolie class.  It is no part of our function, and it is certainly not our aim, to turn out cheap labour for Britain.  The chief casualties as a result of the primitive form of education common in the rural areas are the unfortunate people forced to earn a living in Britain.</P>
    <P>If transport is provided, we can see no really sustainable objection to larger schools, staffed by a larger number of trained teachers, covering a wider variety of subjects and giving a far better service to the pupils.  I do not think anyone could say this is in the nature of an economy drive.  I believe it was a hard decision to take, remembering <Col N="1670" /> the ties that bind a school to its neighbourhood, but I think it is a decision any responsible Minister would have to take.  It is a decision in relation to which our Party solidly support the Minister in his attempt to move in the direction of comprehensive schools in the rural areas, provided conditions with regard to transport and other matters are met.</P>
    <P>There is a guarantee because the Minister has said that he is willing to examine every particular case in its local environment to see what should be done.  No doctrinaire decision has been taken to abolish a particular system and move into another without inquiring and without taking all the necessary steps.  Generally speaking, our Party are against any compartmentalising of Irish education.  We want to see each facet connected with the next.  We want ability to go all the way to university.  We want to see vocational schools improved and made more attractive propositions.  We want to see them relieved of the stigma of the poor man's university, something intended for those clever with their hands.  We want them to be what they should be, important instruments in our economy for the training of our labour force.  We want education to be made as freely available as possible to all sections of our community.  I hope to speak at greater length on this aspect, too, when the main Estimate is before the House.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking to-day is to assure the Minister of our support in his stand.  I should like to see&mdash;this is something that goes back a number of years; I was going to say when I was a mere trade union official, but there is nothing mere about a trade union official, and the Minister was a mere TD&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to see parents participating more in the education of their children.  We say in the Constitution that parents have the responsibility of ensuring that their children have a proper education.  I should like to see this become a reality. I should like to see parents taking a <Col N="1671" /> more active interest.  I should like to see parent-teacher committees and associations.  I should like to see parents taking responsibility and not just passing the buck.  I hope the Minister will see his way to encouraging all forms of parent interest.  I do not believe this will result in what has been alleged in the past: wherever it has been tried, only a few cranks come forward.  I believe you will get responsible parents who will be interested in the education of their children.</P>
      <P>I hope this controversy with regard to one- and two-teacher schools will not become merely the plaything of Party politics and a breeding of differences where there really are no differences at all.  Each case, we have been told, will be examined on its merits.  Fine Gael Deputies have referred to grievances.  If each case is examined and the comprehensive school system fully explained and matters relating to transport and so on are dealt with, I would hope the controversy would not develop into Party wrangling.  There is a valuable principle at stake and all of us should sink Party differences when there is something of benefit for the people. I hope, too, that the Department will not be held up by any vested interest. I hope it will act in the light of all the facts and bring the public with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the last speaker.  He appears to have got the central school mixed up with the comprehensive school.  His idea of a comprehensive school and mine appear to be at variance.  I do not know much about the city of Dublin but I know the country, and especially the West.  If the Deputy leaves the West to us, we will handle it.  A comprehensive school means to me a school drawing pupils from a ten mile radius and constituted of both secondary, vocational and technical education, where there would be a secondary and vocational or technical training, and that at a certain stage there would be a common Intermediate Certificate, and there would be a branching off there.  That is the idea I have anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> This entire matter of education requires very careful consideration and I am satisfied that it is getting careful consideration.  There is more in it than just the educational effort.  Economic and social problems must come into it, but we must subordinate the economic and social questions to the question of education itself.  I am a firm believer in the idea that education is the basic service in any country in the world and that upon it depends the efficiency of all other services.  If the basic service of education is faulty, it is reasonable to assume that all the other services will fall down.  Consequently, very serious consideration must be given to the lines of advance in education.  All countries in Europe realise the importance of advanced education, and if we are thinking of entering into the EEC, we must regularise our educational system and keep up with the standards of education in Europe.</P>
    <P>I was recently down in the Industrial Estate at Shannon Airport.  I went into one of the biggest companies operating there and asked the engineer who showed me around how our labour standards compared with those in other parts of the world.  The answer was very clear.  He said: &ldquo;Technically, hopeless,&rdquo; but for adaptability and willingness and quickness to learn, there was nothing in the world to beat us.  We are technically behind other countries.  The one person who can bring us up to world standards is the Minister for Education, and I am wholly with him in any efforts he makes along those lines.  If we want a dynamic community capable of tackling economic problems, we must have a sound, inspired system of education and I believe that any cutting back of money being spent on education would be a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>As the principal of a two-teacher school, I do not wish to get involved very much in this explosive question of the closing of one-teacher and two-teacher schools.  There is diversity of opinions on the matter.  I hope it will be solved eventually by the pressure of public opinion and I have an idea how that pressure will go.  I have been speaking to the Minister on one or <Col N="1673" /> two matters and I found him very approachable and understanding.  I hope I am right in saying that he seems to be prepared to treat each problem&mdash; and I suppose it will be a problem&mdash;on its own merits, that it will not be a matter of a blanket closing of one-teacher and two-teacher schools.  In respect of one-teacher schools, there must be exceptions.  One of the exceptions in my constituency would be non-Catholic schools which, I think, are all one-teacher schools and which are also providing transport within a radius of about six miles.</P>

      <P>That is a problem for the Minister.  There are also individual schools for instance, as I explained to the Minister last week, a school in a glen in my constituency. There is no proper road out of the glen.  When I have gone there, I have had to stop my car, put on a pair of wellington boots and tramp down into it.  They are all coal miners there and if the Minister decided to close that one-teacher school, which is a school built only about 12 years ago and which has modern facilities, including electric light, the children would have to walk further to meet the bus than they now walk to the school.  They would have to travel along a narrow, unprotected road over a mountainside, a tarred road now, meeting coal lorries in the vicinity of the coal mines. For about six to eight weeks of the year, that road would be closed due to snow and frost.  The name of that place is Glenkillamay, the last outpost of my constituency.</P>

    <P>I mention it because that is one of the places of which the Minister would possibly have to make an exception. There is a teacher who lives beside the place and there is no difficulty about a change of teachers.  In this entire matter there should be a restrained attitude, and I am quite satisfied the Minister will consider each case on its own merits.  I should like to go on <Col N="1674" /> record as saying that all credit is due to teachers in one-teacher schools who have taught up to sixth or seventh standard and who have produced some very fine pupils.  I know of one family that came out of a one-teacher school and they are semi-millionaires, if not millionaires, in the sporting line in America.  Generally, I do not see much hope for the one-teacher school. I think the Minister is correct, but he should deal with each on its merits.</P>
    <P>The two-teacher schools are a different problem.  It depends whether the school concerned is an old school or a new one.  If it is an old school, as I know some of them, perhaps 80, 90 or 100 years old and there is a teacher retiring, in my opinion, the Minister's attitude would be right, but where you have a comparatively new school with a teacher who has some years to go, I think the Minister will see the reasonableness of not making a blanket closing; he will wait until something happens.  You cannot close down new schools overnight with two teachers in them.  This is a general policy which I think will be staggered over years.</P>
    <P>The question of social needs and so on has been raised and there will be difficulty there.  The local school has been the centre of social activities in the parish unit.  At least in the west of Ireland, NFA meetings and meetings of that kind are held in the schools and generally the parish priests and curates and teachers are people about whom the whole parish appears to function.  A small point in that connection is that the local school convenient to a church supplies the choir and altar boys.  That has been mentioned to me by my manager.  What would happen there?  Where would he get his choir and altar boys for High Masses on school days?  That may not have been considered worth thinking about.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to mention the raising of the pupil-teacher ratio.  If the two-teacher schools are closed on a widespread basis, the pupil-teacher ratio in which would be about 20 to 25 at a rough guess&mdash;and according to <i>Investment in Education,</i> that is about the present figure&mdash;what would <Col N="1675" /> happen?  I know that in some two-teacher schools the ratio is up to 35 or 40.  What will happen with the closing of those schools?  Will the ratio go down or up?  That depends on the availability of teachers.  Some teachers would be released through the closing down of schools but a question arises in regard to remote areas where you have perhaps a married teacher living near the school who probably will not travel.  The modern tendency, in the West at any rate, is that the young teacher wants to get away and will not stay.  They want to get to Dublin, Cork or Galway to go to the university and get degrees such as H. Dip in Ed.  Then they are qualified for secondary or vocational teaching as well as national teaching.  That has been my experience and I can foresee great difficulty in getting national teachers to stay out in the country.</P>
    <P>I have a completely open mind on this matter and I should like to make a suggestion.  Where there is a proposal to close a one- or two-teacher school, I think there should be consultation between the manager, an inspector of the Department and the parents.  I believe this would avert a lot of trouble because in the long run the parents are the people most interested and they will have a say in this.  I should like to put this on record, since the efficiency of the one- and two-teacher schools has been mentioned. I looked back over the records in Sligo County Council for ten years and the two-teacher schools compared more than favourably with bigger schools in the award of county council scholarships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the debate in the past two hours and the feeling I got from the speeches on the other side was that the Minister was going to close down all schools in rural Ireland overnight.  Everybody knows that is not so.  We must all realise that the matter of money comes into everything, and while the Minister is trying to improve education facilities in rural Ireland and in the cities and towns, it seems right that in each <Col N="1676" /> parish of reasonable population, instead of having three schools, it should have one comprehensive school in the centre at which a child could continue his secondary or vocational education, if he so desired.  Does anybody see anything wrong with trying to bring secondary and vocational education to thousands of children in rural Ireland who have never had an opportunity of getting such education?</P>
      <P>I cannot speak too highly of our national teachers.  They have done wonderful work.  They are dedicated people but what the Minister is trying to do is to bring secondary and vocational education to children who never had a chance of getting it hitherto.  If that is a sin, the Minister is guilty of a grievous sin.  We are living in a democracy and I would die to defend the right of any man to express his opinion but we should be wise and practical about what the Minister, supported by the Dáil, proposes to do.  I pin my faith on one thing, that is, that if the Minister succeeds in achieving what he has set out to achieve, posterity will bless him. At the moment many a child has no opportunity but to go to a national school and then go to work as a labourer in some other country, unless he can acquire education at night.</P>
      <P>In north County Dublin, the children have to travel miles to get a secondary education.  They come from Garristown to Dublin, a distance of 18 miles, and they go from Garristown to Drogheda.  They go from Donabate to Skerries and from there into Dublin. That would not be necessary if we had a comprehensive school at Swords where a child could continue on from primary to secondary or vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to my friends of the Opposition today and I say seriously to them that they should try to help the Minister in this scheme.  No teacher is going to lose his job and the case of every school will be considered on its merits.  The last speaker made a case for some of the islands and said that it would not be possible to take away some of the one-teacher schools from them.  I pestered the previous Minister to leave <Col N="1677" /> a school on an island in Clew Bay. I went there on holidays and found that the local people wished to have the school retained.  I came back and saw the then Minister and he agreed to it.</P>
    <P>The human approach to these things will have to be considered.  If at any time the Minister finds that a particular one-teacher school is essential, a case can be made for that school and for the children of that area.  Nobody can deny that it is long overdue that we should be able to bring to our children in rural Ireland the opportunity which their parents did not have of going to a secondary or vocational school.  I appeal to the good people of our country to realise that that is the only aim we have set out to achieve.  If one were to stand up in any parish in Ireland and ask the people if they would like a comprehensive school in which their children could secure secondary or vocational education, every father and mother in that parish would give the scheme their wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>This is a long-term policy, the object of which it will take a long number of years to achieve.  I hope the economics of the State will so improve that we will be able to uplift our people all over the country and give them the treasure of a secondary or vocational education within the confines of their own parishes.  I am sure that day will come.</P>

      <P>Rightly or wrongly, this debate has been channelled into one issue, that is, whether or not the one- and two-teacher schools should be continued or changed, not to comprehensive schools as stated by Deputy Burke, but to a larger type of primary school.  In this regard the Labour Party nailed their colours to the mast a few years ago and I hope the booklet issued by the Labour Party at the time was of great assistance to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I hoped the Minister would have appreciated the effort and trouble that went into its preparation.  The only thing that really <Col N="1678" /> worries me here is the fear that there may be a tendency on the part of the Government&mdash;there is nobody in this House of ministerial rank for whom I have more respect than the Minister and I know that if he had his way, he would do the things we ask him to do&mdash;to use this controversy over the type of primary school to be built as an excuse for not doing anything now about the number of scandalously bad schools we have.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister would like to see our schools improved immediately but it would be unfair if we expected him to be able to do that.  We know that we cannot have these schools repaired or replaced overnight.  We must wait until the money for that work is available.  We appreciate that, but over the past few months I have heard frequent references to the fact that a new school was to be erected in some particular area, that the old school was in very bad condition, that the site of the new school had been marked and purchased and that then the Department said they were sorry but there had been a change in policy and that until their minds were finally made up, they cannot proceed with the school.  That has caused a lot of uneasiness and a terrific amount of disappointment, particularly in areas where new schools have been promised. I raised the question of one school with the Minister some months ago and he and I seem to have a different recollection of what was said.  However, I am prepared to accept what the Minister said as I cannot find the volume in which it was reported.</P>

I do not want to elaborate on this or other problems of primary education of which we are conscious until after Private Members' Time.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I had started to elaborate, in an objective way, I hope, on what I feel should be done in relation to this motion.  If the terms need broadening, or if the Minister feels that a different method of approach would be more feasible, everybody would be satisfied, as long as it was recognised that we have focused attention on what is rapidly becoming an amazingly serious national problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I tried to explain to the Minister, this is a complex problem in its ramifications for the people in the employment of CIE, in the nature of the service, and in the nature of the return that people are getting.  Above all, it has become something that we in this House must watch jealously because of its impact on the taxpayer.  In this debate I am actuated by a motive to get away as far as possible from who was right and who was wrong in the past.  We know that catastrophic mistakes have been made and that there have been all kinds of queer methods of recruitment.  As I said when opening this debate, we know that for a very large number of people, CIE has become the hub of their universe in so far as they are conditioned not only to employment in it but also in <Col N="1680" /> so far as many of their families have come from the second and third generation ranks to serve in it.  Over the years there have been difficulties about staff relations, considerable difficulty on the question of remuneration and, I would say, no company has a sorrier record in relation to pensions and other problems related to retired personnel than CIE.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start into the details of the mistakes that were made or who made them.  Rather I want to get the House down to the discharge of what I feel is its responsibility now, to get this Committee under way.  If the Minister has a better alternative, then as long as he can provide a realistic approach to a resurveying of the position and a coming to grips with the problem, he will get the unanimous and wholehearted support of this House in his efforts to put this company right.  Many years ago, even when a Government I supported were in office, I said that we would never get down to the basic problems of our transport system or solve them by bringing in alleged experts from outside to give us reports which only added confusion to the confusion already existing.  It was indeed in circumstances in which one might have hoped for an escalation into a practical and successful company that CIE was born.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Dublin transport company was a flourishing and effective company when it was amalgamated with CIE, that it had been able to manage its affairs in such a way as to be able to replace equipment, modernise its system and provide a good transport system for the people. We felt then that there might be some hope of making more effective savings in one direction, a more practical replacement of equipment in another, but all those bright hopes have ended in disaster and woe.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do?  What problem faces us in this House?  It is very clearly pinpointed by this motion because we have a moral responsibility and duty to the people to see that they get the type of service to which they are entitled, particularly when they are paying a considerable amount by <Col N="1681" /> way of subsidy.  We also have a bounden duty to give security to the people who have devoted their lives to the transport system.  I feel that a proper investigation of CIE affairs will not reflect any discredit on the run-of-the-mill worker, whether he be bus driver, conductor or maintenance man.  We will find that most of the waste of money is on a level above that, above the hardworking and exceptionally able types that we have in general in the manual grades, in the bus drivers and conductors.  The wastage seems to be in remoter offices and area control stations and in what I would like to call cullable and prunable administration.</P>
    <P>Whatever the cause, we have a duty to come to grips with it, to analyse the defects and postulate a solution. If we are led to believe that there are difficulties in the CIE freight section, that it is uneconomic and that the difficulties are virtually insurmountable, let us have a look at it and see is it practical to abandon it or what is the alternative.  Let us see what security can be provided for the workers.  If other section of CIE are in difficulties, let us have a frank appraisal of them.  Let us use our collective intelligence and, on the evidence that can be made available to this Committee, let us find out in what direction we are going, where that direction must be changed and how we can build a better future.</P>
    <P>If this matter is faced honestly and practically, if the workers are taken into our confidence and given a factual appraisal of the situation, they will give&mdash;as they always have&mdash;as much co-operation and understanding to the solution of the problem as any other section involved.  I say that without fear or equivocation.  We have had many unrealistic statements condemning the workers in CIE.  My plea is not for recrimination or vexatious argument, whether the Minister was right to close down this or that branch line, or whether that Government were right or this Government were wrong; all I want is that we get down to an unbiased investigation of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am sick to death of the kind of ministerial answer, the Pontius Pilate <Col N="1682" /> act of washing one's hands of one's problems because they are alleged to concern the day-to-day administration of the company.  We are sitting here like caged chimpanzees looking at a situation we know is deteriorating. Since this House is subscribing a vast sum towards this company, we should not be told in a casual and callous way we have no right to information. If we are to pull the company out of the slough into which it has fallen, we will have to do it on the basis of a thorough investigation, the restoration of public confidence and the restoration between all concerned within the company of confidence and goodwill. The taxpayer will have to get a proper explanation of the use of the money provided to make good losses.  The ordinary user of the system will have to get a proper service and an understanding of the limits of the service. The workers will have to understand the difficulties facing them.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, CIE &mdash; and I say this with a fair experience of travel&mdash; in so far as it is possible for it, is doing a first-class job.  I say without hesitation that many of the mainline trains and main route buses and tourist buses have set a standard we can be proud of and give a service we are justified in claiming to be on a par with, if not better than, that of many of the countries around us.  Try British railways or European railways at crowded periods and in times of difficulty and you will be very glad to come home and appreciate that CIE, in the circumstances, is doing a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>We have to get down to analysing these bulk costs and seeing where they can be pruned effectively without affecting the system itself.  We have to get down to restoring confidence in the company.  To have a general manager saying the company is bust and throwing cold water on the whole system is no help in this situation.  It is no help to tell the workers they cannot get any increase in wages because the company is bust.  It would be far better to get down to analysing the position, telling the workers what has happened and in what way they can co-operate in restoring the position <Col N="1683" /> and improving their future.  If we do that&mdash;and, to my mind, this Committee would be the ideal way of getting an objective, non-political atmosphere into this reappraisal&mdash;we would be discharging our responsibility to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is a practical and sensible way out of the difficulty, if we look for it on the basis of getting the facts as they exist.  We have in this Oireachtas people who would be ideal to conduct such an investigation.  With the co-operation and goodwill of all sections of the House and of the public, we could get from that Committee a factual reappraisal of CIE that would enable us to talk sensibly about tackling the problem and to get away from this unreal atmosphere in which the Minister is apparently sitting on some throne or rostrum far away from reality and without any responsibility. As long as this House has to foot the bill, as it has to the extent of millions of pounds at present, we have a right to ensure that not only do we know what is going on but that we will not allow criminal carelessness, bad administration and even vicious attacks on the workers.  We are not going to allow the company to be ground into dust and see a break-up that would cause hardship to many families and deprive pensioners of their security.  We have a moral responsibility and we must discharge it.</P>
    <P>I recommend earnestly that the Minister face this problem by taking the House into his confidence and setting up the type of all-Party Committee that could investigate fairly and objectively the whole issue.  Having done that, let us ensure that we in our time do something to make certain we have the type of public transport the country needs, that it will be a worthwhile service and that the workers engaged in it and their children will have security through the stability and solidarity of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>One hesitates to rise in this House to contribute to any debate on the transport industry because of the sorry experience we have had over the years in connection with that <Col N="1684" /> industry.  Over the years we have seen successive Ministers bring in legislation and we have heard rosy prognostications as to the effects that might flow from a particular Bill or motion. Co-operation has been sought from all sides of the House&mdash;and indeed, in the main, that co-operation has been forth-coming&mdash;but, in spite of the prognostications, the achievements have been almost nil.</P>
      <P>It would be as well for me at the outset to say what the Labour Party think of the motion before the House. We think it is a timely motion.  We think the House should interpret it as such.  Whether or not the House does, we are convinced that the people of the country, whether they be the users of public transport or the workers on public transport, or indeed the chairman or board or management of public transport, will welcome it because we think the time has come, even belatedly, to have another look at the affairs of CIE.  Because of that, the Labour Party propose to support this motion&mdash;not for all the reasons outlined in the motion and not for some of the hidden implications that lie therein, but on the general policy that we think this would be one step in the direction we have always advocated, namely, that this House, the elected representatives of the country, representing the people of the country, frustrated and debarred by the present Minister from raising even the smallest inquiry about CIE, desire to commit to a Committee of this House a general examination of the situation there.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say that many of the difficulties, indeed, the major difficulties, of CIE, happen to synchronise with the advent to this office of the present Minister for Transport and Power.  The people are really regarding it as a bit of a joke now, and small blame to them.  They can read in the daily papers that whenever their public representatives endeavour to make an inquiry in this House about CIE, not necessarily a critical inquiry, the Minister flips them off with the excuse that he is not responsible for the day-to-day activities of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many other of his statements, with which I propose to deal very briefly, the <Col N="1685" /> Minister has projected himself in sharp contrast with the Taoiseach on fundamental principles in relation to public transport.  We can see from his statements and from his activities in relation to public transport&mdash;some of them public and some of them private&mdash; that the Taoiseach, who can be judged on his record as Minister for Industry and Commerce, appears to have a different set of principles from those of the Minister who now holds the portfolio of Transport and Power. Indeed, in many ways I think the Taoiseach can be congratulated on the enlightened legislation he introduced and carried through this House, in successive Transport Bills.  Furthermore, he was always at pains to ensure, in any relevant legislation that was brought here, that he invited and encouraged, not just verbally but in practical ways, the co-operation of the trade unions.  Being a very wise man, the Taoiseach knew that, with the set-up of the transport industry here, which has largely to be subsidised, if you do not get the co-operation of the trade unions, you have little hope of success.</P>
    <P>In very sharp contrast to the attitude of the Taoiseach, we have the activities of the Minister today.  Co-operation, which is offered by the trade unions, is largely spurned.  The Minister appears to avail of every opportunity that presents itself to him to convey to the workers that they are not working hard enough, that productivity is bad, that they are really not pulling their weight.  Then he expects CIE to be viable.  He expects it to advance, to cut losses and even to break clear, when he avails himself of every opportunity that presents itself to him of insulting the workers concerned. I hope I am not unduly critical of the Minister when I say that, to people engaged in transport, he is now regarded as the iconoclast of public transport in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The people engaged in transport and, indeed, any section of the public who take an intelligent view of the problem of public transport will readily tell you that the ultra-conservative approach of the Minister does not tally not alone with the thoughts of many members of his Government but with legislation that has been passed by this House and which the Minister is obliged to carry out.  He avails of every possible device to get out of the spirit of the Transport Acts, to get out of the spirit of the legislation passed here.  He can do this cleverly at times by obeying the letter of the Act but abandoning the principle enshrined in the legislation passed by the Oireachtas and which he is expected to carry out.</P>
      <P>Speaking as one who has some knowledge of the relationship between the unions and CIE, all I can say is that, by a series of misadventures, mishandlings and deliberate spite, I think it is not unfair to say that the unions have come to the conclusion that the Minister is endeavouring to bring about a situation where there will be a headon collision between the board and management of CIE and the trade unions.  The negotiating machinery which worked for many years for all grades of CIE, before the advent to his present office of the Minister, is now dead.  I do not mind saying that that is done deliberately, as far as I can see, because of the policy that has been advocated by the Minister and because of the actions he has taken in spite of the spirit of the Transport Acts.  The Minister is so conservative and so anti-nationalised transport that he appears to be obsessed with the idea of not making the Transport Acts work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example.  Under the Transport Acts, the Minister is charged with having a properly integrated transport system by rail and road.  He is also charged, of course, in the Transport Acts, with having adequate salaries, pay and conditions for the <Col N="1687" /> employees.  The various unions dealing with CIE employees have negotiated the several rounds of wage and salary increases and, as well as that, they have negotiated, through the machinery in which the management of CIE participated, fringe benefits of one type or another.  They have negotiated status benefits.  But, lo and behold, the Minister, in his wisdom, instructed the unfortunate board of CIE that the cost of any of these benefits, which were gained through the negotiating machinery which happened since the ninth round of wage increases, could not be offset by an adjustment in their charges.</P>
    <P>That might be defended and justified were the Minister to be consistent in his attitude as far as other State or semi-State companies under his Department are concerned.  He says to CIE, in effect: &ldquo;If you give a status increase to your employees, you may not adjust your charges&rdquo;, while he allows another company under his charge, the British and Irish Steam Packet Company, within the last few days, to increase their charges on various commodities and freight from five to ten per cent.</P>
    <P>There was a time, of course, when the British and Irish Steam Packet Company was being challenged by people in this House with having foreign interests but it is under the direct control of the Minister now. While the Minister says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to CIE, he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the B &amp; I and then he turns his mind towards the air company.  We all know that the Minister is air-minded.  He turns to the air company which, again, is under his direct control, and allows an increase in charges.  He says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the B &amp; I and to the air company but he says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to CIE.  I wonder how the Minister would feel if he were on the Board of CIE and meeting that kind of frustration.</P>
    <P>With the very best will in the world, the board of management of CIE in all their endeavours have been bedevilled by the sins of the Minister, sins of commission and sins of omission. The board of management do not <Col N="1688" /> know from day to day what the Minister will say about public transport. The other day, when the Minister found it necessary to comment on a statement made by the General Manager of Córas Iompair Éireann, what he did in fact, was to disown the manager.  What the manager said was merely a repetition of something the Minister said a few weeks before that but when that was not politically expedient, the Minister had no compunction whatsoever in immediately welshing on the General Manager and disowning him.</P>
    <P>The public, of course, are baffled by this carry-on.  It can be appreciated that those of us in this House who are not within the inner circle are equally baffled.  We and the people whom we represent are entitled to ask the Minister what can we believe when the Minister, the Board and the Manager of CIE are speaking every second day in divers tongues.  Whom are we to believe?  When will somebody make up his mind as to where we are going as far as public transport is concerned? That is a fair question and I hope the Minister in replying to the motion will comment on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that for several months there have been suspicions and suggestions regarding the future of the road freight department of CIE.  Many public representatives, not including myself, have made reference to the fact that the feeling abroad was that the road freight department of CIE was to be disbanded. That is no secret at all.  Indeed, credence is lent to that because of the Minister's record on nationalised transport as against private enterprise.  Personally, I believe the Minister has already made up his mind to denationalise the road freight services of CIE.  He should consult the Taoiseach about it because when the last Transport Act was being passed here, the Taoiseach in no uncertain fashion gave his views on that matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will stop and think and try to envisage the hurlyburly and confusion that would result from denationalisation of the road freight services.  The services would be <Col N="1689" /> thrown back where the Minister would want them, into private hands, from which through successive Acts of the Oireachtas they were rescued down the years.  Once again, we would have the old private haulier employing nonunion labour&mdash;the Minister would not object to that but some of us on this side of the House would object; there would be no definite rates of pay, no definite hours of work, no fixed wages, no overtime, no conditions.  The Minister might describe that situation as private enterprise where the profit motive would prevail and he might feel, as he said on another occasion, that under such a system things would find their own level.  That view happens to be rather Victorian as far as we in the Labour Party can judge.  It smacks of the pre-1913 situation in this country.  I hope I am not wronging the Minister but I think the time has come when he should say in this House, in reply to this motion, that all these suggestions are not well founded.  He should debunk the rumour that he proposes to denationalise or in any way whittle down the road freight services of our nationalised industry.</P>
    <P>We come, Sir, to the closing of what the Minister calls uneconomic branch lines, feeding lines to the main lines, of CIE.  The Minister must have heard the current rumour.  I refer to the branch line between Mallow and Waterford.  The Minister was at a function in Mallow recently and, immediately after that, attended a function in Waterford.  Between the two functions, somebody must have whispered in his ear that people were suggesting that he proposed to close that vital line which feeds not alone Waterford but Rosslare and points east.  Indeed, a CIE spokesman, when questioned about it, said that no decision had been made but that a survey of traffic was being carried out to see if the line was economic or not.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the people in West Cork read that statement with unrestrained humour.  Before the decision to close the West Cork line was taken, there were many inquiries made in this House and directly of CIE as a result of which we knew that there was a team of workers and alleged <Col N="1690" /> experts and cost accountants and time and motion fellows and every sort of bucko you could gather from here to Donegal surveying the line.  The ultimate end of it, of course, was the stupid decision to close the West Cork line.  I say here that, as sure as night follows day, unless this House indicates its opposition to the policy of the Minister, and does that now on the basis of this motion, Deputy Kyne will no longer be able to travel to Dungarvan on the train from Mallow. There will be no railway line between Mallow and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Again, I hope I am wrong.  I say these things deliberately because I know I am interpreting the feeling of all concerned and I hope that, by saying them deliberately, I may tempt or provoke the Minister to make a statement as to what he intends.  I warn him in advance that it will be no use his replying and saying that he has nothing to do with it, that it is purely a matter for CIE.  The Minister is charged under the Transport Acts with seeing that a properly integrated transport system is provided for all our people.  It does not say under any section of the Acts that it must be economic in respect of any particular section of the country.  There is a social obligation on this House, apart from any consideration, to provide these services.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that on the occasion of the closing of the West Cork line and the closing of the Waterford-Tramore line, the Minister consistently and deliberately refused to see the elected representatives of the people living in those areas; in other words, the farmers, generally small farmers, the shopkeepers, the publicans, the parents of children travelling to and from school by rail.  All these had some opinion to express and they could only express that opinion through their public representatives.  But the Minister spurned any attempt made either individually or collectively by public representatives, or through the county council, to meet the people in a friendly manner.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us in local authorities would regard ourselves as <Col N="1691" /> experts on these matters but every public representative in west Cork had an entitlement to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look, this is the position as we see it,&rdquo; giving the Minister an opportunity to reply: &ldquo;And this is how I see it,&rdquo; and have the whole matter debated out in a democratic fashion.</P>

      <P>The motion stipulates that one of the terms of reference of the proposed Committee might be to examine the methods of recruitment to all grades of CIE.  I want to make one brief comment on that.  I understand Deputy Lindsay commented on promotions in CIE and I think he claimed that in order to get any worthwhile promotion, one needed to be a member of the Minister's Party. By and large, in respect of the ordinary grades, I do not think that is true. However, I know definitely that, in respect of some of the higher posts and in regard to the higher pundits in CIE, promotion was obtained because they were active members of the Fianna Fáil Party or because their father or their uncle happened to be the chairman of the local branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Minister ever go to the trouble&mdash;I am not accusing the Minister of any personal interest in this, and I want to make that quite clear&mdash; of checking on the allegations made with regard to promotions?  Did he ever get a census of the promotions resulting from the reorganisation of the administrative work and the staff? Did he ever inquire how these people got where they did?  I can assure the Minister that some duds were promoted, such duds that they had to be removed from office again.  They were, of course, removed under the Act which provided them with handsome compensation.  The fellow who was not fit for the job was promoted because he had Fianna Fáil connections.  He was promoted overnight into a position he was not capable of filling.  Subsequently he let down the management <Col N="1692" /> of CIE and the political bosses who supported his promotion.  He was removed and compensated under legislation passed by this House.  Many a decent man might have retired early to make way for younger men.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to CIE pensions. From time to time here the Minister has referred to the miserable pittance that CIE gives to the conciliation grade workers as being all right because they are drawing national health or the old age pension.  That is no business of CIE and it is no business of the Minister.  Any extra benefits these people draw they draw because they contributed to the social welfare schemes and what they get they get by right.</P>
    <P>I should, in conclusion, like to pay tribute to the vast improvements CIE has brought about in all spheres of its activities.  It has done that in spite of the Minister and in spite of the frustrations he has caused for it. Whatever unrest or dissension exists now amongst the staff of CIE, and it is widespread, results from the arrogance and incompetence of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  It is true that no public body in this country has been subjected to so much comment and so many criticisms as has our national transport system.  Scarcely a week passes without pronouncements in the newspapers from the Minister or someone else. Much of the talk and many of the statements have been marked by gross exaggeration and show a complete absence of factual information.  A worse feature has been noticable of late.  Our transport workers have been unfairly criticised by some.  They have been maligned by others.  There has been talk of the company going burst. There has been talk of denationalisation of the whole or part of our national transport system.  In view of all the wild talk and all the unfounded criticism, it is high time the record was put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House shows the correct approach.  This is the obvious way in which to carry out <Col N="1693" /> a detailed examination of the affairs of CIE.  A review of the company's affairs is not alone vitally necessary but a matter of extreme urgency.  I agree with Deputy Lindsay when he said last night in introducing this motion that we should approach this whole question in a calm, rational manner, with goodwill on all sides. There are many questions which have to be answered.  For instance, is the annual subsidy justified?  Can it be reduced without interfering with the services or with the employment of the workers?  Should economics be the sole consideration?  Is transport to be regarded as an essential public service providing facilities in areas where it is not economically profitable to do so?  And most important of all&mdash;a question which is most revelant to the debate on this motion&mdash;can economies be effected without interfering with the system?</P>
    <P>These and many other questions spring to mind, and many so-called experts have advanced theories relating to these questions.  However, as I have already said, there is a colossal amount of confused and ill-informed thinking about our transport system.  It is for this reason that a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann should be established forthwith to examine the matter and make recommendations relating to our transport system.  We must look at this question of transport from a national viewpoint.  We must consider the special circumstances of this country, the geographical factors, the physical, social and economic factors.  I agree with the other speakers who have said we have a good transport system. Definitely our rail services compare favourably, and more than favourably, with the rail services in Britain or on the Continent.  Our national transport system is a very large employer, one of the largest employers in the State.  I want to repeat what Deputy Collins has said, that if CIE is in difficulty, it is not the fault of the ordinary worker in the company.  From my experience, I am convinced that the employees of CIE are as fine a body of workers as can be found anywhere, not only in this country but in any other country, and I disagree entirely with the <Col N="1694" /> attempts that have been made to show our transport workers in any other light.</P>
    <P>I believe we have become obsessed with this question of a subsidy.  It is entirely wrong to keep harping on the subsidy without taking into account the many other factors that are involved&mdash;the service provided, the employment given and the many other social and economic factors.  To get a true picture in relation to the subsidy, we must examine the situation and compare the investment in CIE with the investment in other fields of economic activity.  I do not know whether there are any facilities available in this country for carrying out a comprehensive comparative analysis of State investment, but I recall that in the recent NIEC Report this fact was adverted to, the need for a scientific comparative analysis of State investment.</P>
    <P>The subsidy being paid to CIE must be put into its proper perspective.  That should be done without further delay, and I believe that setting up a Select Committee, as suggested in this motion, is the correct approach.  It is vitally important that we should review the situation before it deteriorates any further.  It is vitally important that public opinion should be properly informed in regard to this problem and that the various factors involved in providing a national transport system should be made known clearly and be based on all the factual information that can be obtained.</P>
    <P>In my opinion&mdash;and I am as much entitled to my opinion as any of the so-called experts who have been expounding on transport and on CIE&mdash; there must be room for economies in any large commercial concern of this kind.  I am quite sure that an examination of the affairs of CIE will reveal many places where economies could be effected.  Deputy Casey's reference to the possibility of the Mallow-Waterford railway line being closed reminds me that not very long ago the Minister for Transport and Power opened a new marshalling yard at Mallow.  Mallow was always an important junction.  Before and after the war, it handled traffic to the local factory, and during <Col N="1695" /> the war, in addition, it handled turf and so forth.  With the closing of the west Cork railway line and some of the branch lines in Kerry and with the possibility now of the Mallow-Waterford line being closed, the question arises: is the expenditure on this marshalling yard justified?  I do not know what it cost but I am sure it must have cost several thousands of pounds to erect it.  We could pinpoint another case last year where a bus service from Dublin to Killarney was introduced, despite the fact that during the tourist season there are five or six trains in both directions every day.</P>
    <P>I believe economies can be effected but I am also convinced that a certain amount of subsidy will always be necessary and, not alone that, but that it can be fully justified.  I see possibilities of CIE earning more money with the expansion of our tourist business.  There are many problems relating to transport of which the public are not aware and the time is overdue for a complete review of our thinking in regard to transport and the operation and organisation of our system.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this motion and if, in some respects, it is not feasible to do what it asks, to set up some other machinery to carry out this examination.  Finally, I appeal to him, for heaven's sake, to refrain from any more wild and exaggerated statements about this company and its future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene simply to endeavour to get from the Minister either confirmation or denial of the rumour that has persisted over the past year or year and a half that the Mallow-Waterford line via Fermoy and Dungarvan will be closed and that the service will be directed through Clonmel to Waterford. If that is so, as a member of Waterford constituency, I should like to protest in advance in this House and to inform the Minister that all of Waterford, east and west, and much of east Cork will be denied a service which, particularly in summertime, is of vital importance as the link between <Col N="1696" /> Cork via east and west Waterford and east Cork to Mallow with the mailboat.</P>
      <P>Irish citizens, their relatives and tourists generally use that service in ever-increasing numbers from early May to October or practically November. There will be no alternative by bus.  West Waterford and east Cork will become completely denied any service if that line is closed down. In County Waterford our experience in connection with the Tramore closure was that when we went to see CIE officials to protest against the closing, and in fact to put forward proposals as to why it should not be closed and about solving the difficulties about loss on the line, we were met with a pointblank refusal to discuss any such services and the only thing we were permitted to discuss was the type of alternative service.</P>
      <P>In wintertime, the Fermoy-Dungarvan link with Mallow is vital from the beet factory point of view.  Thousands of tons of beet, right up through west Waterford and east Cork, are conveyed to Mallow during the campaign period.  If that line were closed, it would mean that an extraordinary number of lorries, privately-owned or run by CIE, would come on the roads already overcrowded and harassed with too much traffic, to the detriment, first, of the livelihood of the people of the area and, secondly, of the ratepayers who have to provide the wherewithal to keep the road surfaces intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some economies the Minister could advise CIE personnel to investigate rather than endeavouring to cut off what should be a social service and should be so regarded.  Presumably CIE will never be a paying concern. When the British and Irish shareholders pulled out of the railways&mdash;it was for the very same reason that the B and I shareholders decided to sell to the State&mdash;it was because the time of the train as a profit-earning factor had passed.  Competition from motor cars, bus services and all the advanced techniques of travel have ensured that no longer can profits be made from a railway, but there are more important things than profits.  There is the social service for the people.  Not all the people have motor cars or can secure bus services.  The railway is still an <Col N="1697" /> important, and indeed the only, service available to many country people, especially in winter when snow lies heavy on the roads.  That was proved during the blizzards some two years ago which lasted for eight to ten weeks in the south of Ireland.  If rail services had not been functioning during that time, most of the industries would have been brought to a halt and many living in the country would have been without what they required to carry on business or even to live.</P>
    <P>I can suggest some economies in services so blatantly unnecessary that I often wonder why they exist.  For instance, why must we have hostesses on Irish trains?  Surely it must be the shortest railway in the world to have hostesses when one travels between Dublin and Cork.  Apparently, we need to be accompanied by a type of nursing young lady, to take care of the passengers. I have experience of travelling on that line and I was approached to know if everything was all right and I was told that if I wished, I could have tea or a meal.  Surely I was competent to know that much myself? I can understand the provision of nurses on cross-channel steamers and the need for hostesses or first-aid women on long train journeys in the US or even across Europe on the Orient Express but surely from Dublin to Cork, this is absolutely unnecessary. Or is it a case of jobs not for the boys but for the girls?  I understand many of our university students are recruited during the holidays for such work or, at least, if not now, they were in earlier days.</P>
    <P>Is it not strange also that if the hostesses are primarily there to take care of mothers travelling with young children who are, say, tired from a cross-channel journey, we do not have hostesses on the Rosslare-Cork express? There are no hostesses on the Rosslare-Cork express and during the summer months that train is packed with tired mothers whose children have been ill.  It is different from Dublin to Cork and surely that is unnecessary expense and waste of money.  It may be very trivial in the light of a £2 million subsidy but it is surely on things like that that there <Col N="1698" /> is necessity for a Committee to examine every possibility of saving money in CIE.</P>
    <P>In 1926 I could leave the town where I live at 7.45 a.m. and travelling by Waterford, could be in Dublin by 12 o'clock.  In 1965, it was impossible to do that.  The only service to Dublin today is through Mallow, leaving at 10.15 a.m. and arriving at 3 p.m., almost five hours travelling.  That is strange progress over the course of time.  A train leaves Waterford for Dublin at 8.10 a.m. but there is no connection with it from any part of east or west Waterford.  If that train were put back to 9 a.m. or 9.15 a.m., it would be available to travellers from all over Waterford and portion of east Cork.  Apparently that type of management does not enter into the scheme of things with CIE.</P>
    <P>Every day of the week except on Sundays, a bus leaves Waterford at practically the same time and serving the same areas as the train and in the opposite direction, there is no transport at all.  Surely there is a need for some Committee to investigate such anomalies?  We are told that there is a survey going on and it is rumoured that the members of that survey team have already made up their minds to close the Mallow to Waterford line. I would like the Minister, if that rumour is unfounded, to let the people working on the line know that so that they will be free in their minds and can continue working where they are working at present without having the fear of having to leave the places where they have set up their homes to seek employment elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion.  It is agreed that there is public disquiet throughout the country regarding the general functioning and management of CIE.  The employees of CIE are frustrated and have little security.  It is high time the House was told what can be done to help in a situation that seems to be gradually deteriorating.  If this system is to be allowed to continue to deteriorate as it is, the whole service will grind to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railways of any progressive country are of the utmost importance <Col N="1699" /> to its economy and for the future of this country it is essential that we should have an efficient and up to date railway service.  I doubt if we have that today with CIE in the doldrums as it is at present.  When replying to the debate on the Free Trade Agreement, the Taoiseach said that he was always 20 years ahead of his time.  It would be no harm if we quoted from what the Taoiseach said in volume 94 column 1635 when speaking on the Transport (No. 2) Bill.  The Tánaiste, as he was then, said:</P>
    <P>Are we to take no account of the fact that the Dublin transport company, by more efficient management, succeeding in replacing obsolete equipment with fresh equipment, and, not merely repaid loans but reduced capital liability while, at the same time, giving cheaper fares to the public as well as substantially improving the conditions of the workers?</P>
    <P>We know how far out he was in making that forecast.  We have not got cheaper fares.  The opposite is the case and our fares are supposed to be the highest in Europe.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if that is correct.</P>
    <P>As regards substantially improving the conditions of the workers, we know that is not the case and that there are fewer people employed on the railways today, that they are frustrated and that they have very little security.</P>
    <P>Continuing the quotation he went on to say:</P>
    <P>What was done in the case of the Dublin transport company can be done for transport as a whole in this country.  That is what we believe, and it is because we believe that that is possible....</P>
    <P>He continued at column 1637:</P>
    <P>We believe that, by an improved system of working, and by more efficient management, it will not merely be possible to effect the reequipment of the company with up to date equipment, but to do so, while at the same time providing cheaper transport....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> We have not been provided with efficient management since 1944 and certainly we have not been provided with cheaper transport.  I doubt if we have an efficient transport system at the present time.</P>
    <P>Our cattle industry is a very important industry.  To a large extent, the prosperity of the country depends upon it.  Our exports are vital and necessary, but go to the majority of fairs and markets in this country and you will hear criticism, and justifiable criticism, of the transport services available at those fairs.  It might not be no harm to point out that in 1942 the control of the GSR was taken over by the Government.  A chairman was appointed, a Mr. Reynolds, who was described by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce as the greatest transport wizard in Europe.  He was also Chairman of the Dublin United Tramways Company.  In 1944, CIE was formed, after the DUTC was amalgamated with it.  In 1947 CIE got into financial difficulties and Mr. Reynolds left the concern, taking with him a considerable amount of ready cash alleged to be due to him when his original company, the General Bus Company, was taken over by the DUTC.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government which came into office in 1948 passed a new Transport Act and appointed Mr. T.C. Courtney as chairman.  The company continued to make losses but it can be said that after the change of Government, the chairman did not get much help or co-operation from the incoming Government.  In 1958, a new Transport Act was passed in which the Government guaranteed any working losses by the company.  A new chairman was then appointed, Mr. Andrews, and it was again said that with his record, CIE would break even after a lapse of five years.  We know that that did not materialise, that all the Government's promises about CIE were unfounded and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Following the passing of the 1958 Act, a reorganisation was introduced and five area managers were appointed.  One was appointed in Dublin, and one in Cork, one in Limerick, one in Waterford and one in Galway, and the greatest criticism of everybody was that these area managers had very little previous railway or transport experience and that they were promoted because they were of the right political colour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That happened in Mullingar.  Ask some of those Deputies who were &ldquo;rooting&rdquo; for other doctors. Shortly after that, an area manager was appointed for Cork and&mdash;the Minister <Col N="1702" /> can deny this if he likes&mdash;I think he was a junior engineer.  A strike took place in the area which cost CIE £300,000 in hard cash, together with a permanent loss of traffic.  They have not yet got a lot of it back.  This strike was caused by the mishandling of the company's staff relations scheme and the relevant section dealing with disciplinary procedure.  Some time after the strike, this area manager was promoted to a post in Dublin where he could do very little harm.  He retired under the provisions of the 1958 redundancy clause.  I should like to know if the Minister denies that.  There were two vacancies in the Cork Goods Depot, the agent and the chief clerk, and the appointments were made through political influence.  Following these appointments, the work of the Depot went into very serious arrears.  I challenge the Minister to say whether it is not true that a considerable sum was spent on extra staff and in overtime to try to bring the accounts up to date.  Is it not true also that a very large sum had to be written off as irrecoverable due to the blunders which were made and because of political appointments?  Is it not also true that subsequently the chief clerk retired under the 1958 Act and the goods agent was removed to another post without loss of salary?  Are those statements not true?  From my information, they are true and they were due to the fact that people who knew very little about CIE but had political influence were promoted to important jobs and they fell down on those jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Let the Minister inquire into it.  It is quite true. Following the coming into operation of the 1958 Act, a large number of permanent staff were declared redundant at a time when CIE carried hundreds of temporary staff.  In view of the fact that CIE is subsidised by the State, it is surprising that the Minister for Finance has not got a representative on the Board of the company to keep a watch on unnecessary expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much about the closing of branch lines and we know that <Col N="1703" /> in the past when branch lines were closed the Board and the Minister&mdash; and the Minister should realise that he is a servant of the people&mdash;acted in a dictatorial and arrogant manner.  They refused to meet Deputies, Senators, county councillors, farmers, business people and others to discuss the closing of those lines.  It is questionable whether the wholesale closing down of branch lines and stations has proved a benefit to CIE.  Experience has shown that when a branch line or a section of a line is closed, the company does not get all the business previously handled by the railway on its road services and that it has the effect of giving more business to its competitors. As other members have stated, this should be regarded as a social problem, and I agree with Deputy Casey in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another serious matter for the general welfare of rural Ireland is that when branch lines and stations are closed the business of small towns and villages, which was previously handled by rail, is deflected through the road system operating to the larger cities and towns.  As a result these towns and villages miss the payroll of the railway stations.</P>
    <P>The old Great Southern Railways had two managers, a general manager and a traffic manager.  They had no deputies and they relied on an experienced and efficient staff to carry out their directions and to do the business of the company.  Today CIE has scores of managers.  I do not know how many, but in any event it is supposed to be top-heavy with them. The Minister can deny that later on if he wishes.  It has scores of managers who are provided with high-powered staff cars.  The result is that very often the ordinary staff have no idea of what their functions are.  All the head-quarters of the seven companies amalgamated in Dublin are fully occupied and this fact can be confirmed by referring to pages 55 and 56 of the telephone directory.</P>
    <P>Recently we read in the newspapers that a Mr. O'Higgins, the Dublin City Services Manager of CIE, appealed to <Col N="1704" /> the authorities to ban all private cars from the city centre and to leave the area clear for CIE buses.  It would be a very good idea if the Minister for Transport and Power and his Mr. O'Higgins would give a good example in this respect, and persuade the well-paid executives of CIE to set a headline in economy.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister is it true that the higher executives in CIE have free passes from their homes to their offices?  Is it not true that they prefer to use company staff cars to get them from their homes to their offices and back again each day?  Anybody can see the various district managers, area managers, freight managers and others arriving.  In many cases the car holds only one person.  His position and importance can be judged by the type of car he is in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was explaining to the House that in the short time at my disposal I did not propose to go into the matters under discussion too deeply.  I propose, however, to deal with some of the one- or two-teacher schools, the replacement of which is apparently being put on the long finger because of the Government's proposed change of policy.  A few years ago, we in the Labour Party nailed our colours to the mast as far as education is concerned. The document we produced was widely read, if not by the Minister, then by his officials, and it bears a remarkable similarity to most of the Minister's proposals today.  We are not quarreling with that.  We believe it is wrong to put on the long finger the replacement of old, unsightly and in many cases rat-infested schools with little or no sanitary accommodation because in the years to come the Government propose to introduce a system of primary education incorporating bigger schools to which children will be brought by public transport.  Where schools are urgently needed, particularly where the sites have already been obtained, the Minister should see to it that these schools are now erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew the Minister's attention to two schools.  One is at Woodpole.  It was almost ready to be started.  The site was available and preliminary <Col N="1706" /> planning carried out.  It has apparently been abandoned.  The second school is between Navan and Drogheda.  This school requires the special attention of the Minister and his advisers.  The Minister said the Government were not prepared to deal with all the schools in the country without an investigation of each case individually.  I take it that will be done.  This particular school at Knockcommon was the subject matter of questions in the House. At present it has 60 pupils.  The present building was built for 42 pupils. Apparently, the air space required for pupils was much smaller then than now.  At present it would only accommodate, according to the Department's regulations, approximately 30 pupils.  This is a typical example. It is proposed now, I understand, that that school should not be rebuilt.  It is in an appalling condition.  Apart from the building itself, the surrounds are very bad and the sanitary accommodation is primative in the extreme. It was proposed to rebuild the school this year&mdash;the Minister said August here and he told the reverend manager October, but I do not quarrel about the difference&mdash;but now, apparently, the whole thing is being put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>It is suggested the pupils should be removed to another school six miles away.  I am sure the Minister, even though city-born, will understand the situation where a school takes pupils from a radius of perhaps three miles. If Knockcommon school is closed, all the pupils will not automatically go to another school.  The problem will not be one of simply moving the teachers and pupils from one school to another. The pupils will be scattered among five other schools all equally distant from Knockcommon.  In a case like that, it would be a grave mistake to say it was a simple matter of transferring the pupils.</P>
    <P>Even if it is possible to transfer the pupils in the way suggested, the Minister must appreciate that the normal transport would be by bus or minibus. If a minibus is provided, the number of pupils using the service over a number of days might be small, but on occasions it might be greater than <Col N="1707" /> the bus could accommodate.  We have that experience from the services already in existence.  On occasions the children can be comfortably seated, but on other occasions they are piled higgledly-piggledly into the bus and have to stand or sit on anything they can.  In addition, there is the danger that pupils from four years old, little girls going to school for the first time, will have to travel with children aged from 9 to 12 and maybe up to 14 years.  Boys being boys, they are not the most gentle creatures&mdash;and perhaps it may be as well that is so.  That sort of experiment just will not work out.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that at present if small children go to school and either get ill or fall in the mud, as they so often do in the country on a bad day, they can either be sent home with a child who lives beside them or the teacher can arrange to have them taken home.  All this will be changed if the children are being brought a distance of anything from three to nine miles.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of County Meath, and the situation in other counties must, of necessity, be very much worse.  In addition, there is the problem of cost.  The Minister said the other evening there would be no direct cost, if I heard him correctly, but there would be a nominal cost for which the manager would be responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the manager wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We all had experience during our own school days, and subsequently when we grew up, of seeing little children in the country going to school with sods of turf under their arms and their fingers blue with the cold.  We do not want that sort of situation to arise again.  We do not want the situation to arise where nominally it is free&mdash;primary education in this country is guaranteed to be given free&mdash;where a nominal charge, no matter how small, will find its way back to the pocket of some unfortunate person who is finding it difficult enough to keep going at present.  I am quite well aware that the Minister <Col N="1708" /> would not wish it to happen but experience has shown us that those things can happen and the time to bring them to the Minister's notice is before he rushes headlong into a situation such as this.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem of the whole lot is what will happen when the children reach school leaving age.  I am quite sure the Minister, in his position as Minister for Education, must be aware that, for several reasons, very many children remain at country schools after they reach the secondary school age, the main one being that there is no secondary school available and, even if there were, their parents would not be in a position to send them to it.  Most of the teachers in the primary schools are doing an excellent job.  They are dedicated men and women.  They try to give that little extra bit of education to those children so that, when they go out in the world, they will at least have as much education as could be passed on to them at that level.  Does it mean, now, that those children who cannot travel by the minibus, or whatever the transport may be, because they have passed the primary school age have to stay at home?  Does it mean that some other type of organisation will be set up to ensure that they will be brought to a secondary school?  Can the Minister guarantee that these wonderful schools Deputy P.J. Burke spoke about here this afternoon and about which nobody else in this House knew anything, where there will be primary, secondary and vocational education all together, will be set up?  Perhaps the Minister would let us in on the secret, as well as Deputy P.J. Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was a slip of the tongue, and Deputy O'Leary made the same slip.  The word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; was used instead of &ldquo;central&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the type of school Deputy P. J. Burke was talking about at all.  He devoted his whole speech to this special type of school which will be located in north County Dublin.  Such schools do not exist and will not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> We might as well face up to it that there is a problem so far as the child approaching secondary school age is concerned and the Minister must attend to it.  Having given him all those arguments against certain of these schools, I want to reiterate that the Labour Party believe, in general, that the idea is a good one.  I am merely giving the Minister the points I have given him so that he can see the other side of the story, as we get it.</P>
    <P>The other question which arises, then, is that of secondary and university education.  I believe vocational education is a bright spot in the educational system of this country. Tremendous work is being done.  I believe the approach to it is very good.</P>
    <P>Most of the primary school teachers are doing excellent work under very bad conditions.  The biggest problem, as I see it, as far as the primary school is concerned, is that it is extremely difficult to understand how one teacher can take four classes, maybe in the one classroom, and try to carry them all on at the one time, all taking different subjects.  We can all sympathise with the teacher who is put in that position.  However, I would advise the Minister to move slowly in his change from one to the other.  If he is to wait until he is in a position to build bigger schools, an awful lot of the children in this country will get whatever education they do get under shocking conditions.</P>
    <P>The vocational education schools, in most cases, are modern buildings.  They are very well set up and their teachers are doing a good job.  They try to discover what aptitude the children have for a particular subject or craft.  I have great admiration for the work they are doing and the way they are doing it.  The problem of the night schools is another matter which will bear more comment when we come to the Minister's Estimate.  Suffice it to say that the problem of the shortage of teachers, particularly for woodwork and particularly in the rural districts, has to be faced up to sooner or later and some effort must be made to provide them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> The secondary schools are now becoming overcrowded even though a high percentage of the children of this country never see the inside of a secondary school.  We have scholarships. The Minister said last year, I think, that he would double the number of scholarships this year: I am sorry he is apparently not in a position to do that.  I hope, before he finishes his Estimate next week or the week after, that he will be able to do much more than double the number.  In County Meath, this year, there are 362 children competing for 60 scholarships. I think that neither the Department of Local Government nor the local authority are facing up to their responsibility while that situation is allowed to continue.  A number of the children will find their way into the secondary schools, but far too many of them will just have to look for a job.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Dunne who referred to the report in the newspapers this week about a young boy who said he was a milk boy and who was out at four o'clock in the morning for £2 a week.  He should be at school.  The sooner we raise the school-leaving age to 16, the better it will be for the youngsters of this country and for the future of the country.  The shortage of teachers, the shortage of schools and the shortage of money can probably all be used as arguments against doing it now but it must be done some time.</P>
    <P>Then, very few of those people find their way into the university.  The overcrowding in the universities in this country is chronic.  I do not say that a university degree is a necessity for success in life.  I do not care whether he is a minister, a bishop or whatever he may be, it does not need a university degree to be a success in life but it may give a person a better chance. However, he does not need it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to get on in life.  However, having said that, I would ask the Minister to pay a little attention to the situation which is becoming commonplace in our universities at the present time where <Col N="1711" /> some faculties have a lecturer who will insist that the students be present for every lecture dead on time or they will be marked absent and who, if he feels like it, will not turn up himself for that lecture, even though students may have travelled a long journey to be present.  The sooner that situation is ended the better for all concerned. It is scandalous that students may fail what, to them, may be a vital examination, not because they are not doing their work but because, through somebody's neglect, they did not get the attention to which they were entitled. I do not care what the university or who runs the university in which it is happening, the fact is that it is happening and it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>There is a very big amount of money involved in the Estimate for the Department of Education.  This Supplementary Estimate is not so great. Until we reach the stage that the Department of Education are able to make available the amount of money which they consider necessary to give a top-class education to all those in the country who are able to make use of it, I believe the country will not be doing enough for education and the country will not make the progress it should make.  The sooner we get a properly educated people, the sooner we shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the evils which have fallen upon us, particularly in the employment field.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Minister, for whom I have already expressed the highest regard, will do what he can to ensure that the children of this generation will get the educational facilities to which they are entitled. Despite what Deputy Burke has said about getting the blessing of the next generation, I say that the Minister will not get their blessing if he is content to plan for years ahead and is not prepared to do something for the children attending school today and who will be attending school next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are placed in the position that after 40 years of native government, we now find that the education of our children is considerably hampered by lack of <Col N="1712" /> schools, lack of teachers and lack of money, it speaks badly for the Government who have been in office for the greater part of that period.</P>
      <P>We are now discussing the most serious and most important Supplementary Estimate.  The subject of education and the educational facilities that are available and the facilities that we all desire to see is of supreme importance.  We all know that in the modern world it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain a position of any standing unless one is highly educated.  The day of the pick and shovel and the unskilled labourer is long past.  For practically every walk of life a person needs to be well educated.  Even for those who have to emigrate, it is important that they should be educated in order that they may be able to take their place with those whom we have seen to be better educated than Irish emigrants were in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very sad thing that parents should have to educate their children, very often at great expense, only to find that the children have to emigrate and seek a livelihood outside this country.  It must be borne in mind that many parents have spent large sums of hard-earned money in educaing and equipping their children for the battle of life, only to discover that there was no place in their own country where they could fit into a position of trust and responsibility.  It is very sad to see the number of Irish boys and girls, some of them having university degrees, who have to emigrate.  Of course, a boy or girl who has a university degree will get a better position abroad than would be available for persons not having a degree. I have seen in the Emerald Hall in Cricklewood, London, boys and girls wearing the Fáinne.  On many occasions one will hear an occasional word of Irish spoken there.  One will find that our boys who have had to emigrate in the main are working with a pick and shovel, work which the Englishman certainly prefers to leave to the Irish.  If our people have to emigrate, they should be sufficiently educated so that they may occupy <Col N="1713" /> positions above the pick and shovel level.</P>
    <P>None of us here desires to embarrass the Minister for Education in the very difficult job that he has.  On the contrary, every Deputy wishes to express his opinion, not in a destructive manner, but in a constructive manner, so that it may be of some help and guidance to the Minister and not an embarrassment.  The Minister is a young man starting off what we trust may be a long ministerial career.  One of the lessons of responsibility is the necessity for courtesy.  I should be long sorry for accusing the Minister of lack of courtesy but I most certainly accuse the Minister of not extending the hand of friendship to persons representing interests who are anxious to co-operate with him.</P>
    <P>We have known cases, for example, where vocational education committees have asked the Minister to receive them in deputation for the purpose of expressing views on matters of vocational education.  One vocational education committee has asked the Minister three times to be good enough to meet them for the purpose of making some emergency plans to meet the growing demand for space in schools. The reply was that the Minister was going to send out a circular some time, that this circular would be considered by all those interested in vocational education and that then, on the basis of that circular and having regard to whatever educational reorganisation was about to take place in the country, the Minister would see what he would do about it.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies have referred to the problems of their own constituencies. I am referring to the problems in mine. It is no harm to remind the Minister that the Laois Vocational Education Committee is faced with a serious problem in which he has given no help. At practically every meeting, one finds that the Minister has been referring back to some circular that has no bearing whatever on what the committee are anxious to discuss with him.  For example, in Abbeyleix, there is a vocational school which has been in existence only a few years and which is <Col N="1714" /> now booked out completely so that some of the classes have to be held in the Macra na Feirme hall in the locality.  All the committee were concerned with was to build an extra room.  The ratepayers and the county councils were prepared to provide the money. All that was required was the Minister's sanction and approval.  Not alone did he refuse his approval and sanction but he refused to receive the Laois Vocational Educational Committee.</P>
    <P>A vocational school is at present being built in Mountmellick.  The contractor is on the site.  The foundations were laid for an additional room.  The Minister's Department got in touch with the committee, having decided that one room less should be built, despite the fact that the foundations were laid for the extra room.  Later on, when an extra room will have to be added, there will be no possibility of adding it as cheaply or as economically as it could be added now while the contractor is actually on the site.  I point out these facts to the Minister so that he may be more helpful to the committee, remembering that the ratepayers of the county are prepared to support the raising of the necessary money by way of loan so that these facilities can be provided.</P>
    <P>The vocational school in Clonaslee is completely overcrowded.  The same problem arises there.  All that was required was approval to extend the school.  That approval was not forthcoming. The Minister may have his financial problems.  If he has, why not be honest with the committees and tell them that it is Government policy to clamp down and there will be no school extensions and committees which are anxious to extend and expand their schools will not be allowed to do so?  At the moment it is a matter of putting it on the long finger.  When proposals are submitted, unusual and extraordinary delays occur.  If the Minister has all the driving force and energy we are led to believe, I see no reason why he cannot give his approval in these perfectly straightforward cases.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as a matter of courtesy, he might be civil to the committees <Col N="1715" /> who are doing a big job, and a good job, free, gratis and for nothing.  Men are giving their time voluntarily, men dedicated to vocational education.  It is discourteous of the Minister to refuse to meet them and hear their views. To refuse to meet public representatives is not the act of a democratic Minister.</P>

      <P>I shall not argue that for the moment but I assure the Minister a further request will be made as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The programme relating to school building and school repairs generally seems to be at a standstill.  Not alone is it at a standstill but we are faced with a far greater problem.  A number of schools in the country have already been referred to by other Deputies. They can be described as hovels.  There is no ventilation.  There are no sanitary or toilet facilities.  There is no proper heating.  Some are rat-infested.  Yet, we talk about progressive education. In the town of Mountmellick, the parish in which I live, the schools are so overcrowded that the children are now being taught in the dilapidated town hall.  Before they moved in there, they were being taught in the local Catholic church.  The facilities are deplorable.  They are no credit to the Department of Education in this year of 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a shocking thing that so many of our young children should have to spend four, five and six hours a day in absolutely appalling conditions. The lack of proper toilets and sanitary facilities can only be described as unnatural.  Yet all this is allowed to continue and, judging by the pronouncements of the Minister in recent times, there is no hope of any immediate improvement.  Our national teachers and, in particular, the good Sisters throughout the length and breadth of the country deserve the greatest praise and our deepest gratitude for the way in which they carry out their duties in quite desperate and quite shocking conditions.  If they were <Col N="1717" /> not dedicated to their work, the education of our young children might constitute a greater problem than it does.</P>
    <P>It must be extremely difficult for these teachers to be teaching, for example, a class of children between four and five years of age, if there are between 50 and 60 in the class.  Nothing short of a person with extraordinary patience and with great love for children could remain for five or six hours a day in such a class.  In most of the towns throughout the country, there are overcrowded schools. The same care and attention cannot be given in overcrowded classes as can be given where the classes are much smaller.  Now the Minister is attempting to close down the rural schools, to bring the children into the towns, to make the classes bigger and more difficult for teachers to handle.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency in which there are very many good educational facilities.  I should like, if I may, to refer to a number of schools in my constituency.  There is a school in Edenderry where, I am sure, there are the best educational facilities in any town in Ireland.  It is very well managed and has highly qualified teachers.  Special attention is given and there is no overcrowding because sufficient accommodation is provided in suitable buildings.  In the town of Tullamore, educational facilities are available which are second to none in Ireland.  There is a similar state of affairs in Birr.</P>
    <P>Outstanding educational facilities are provided in every part of the counties of Offaly and Laois.  There is a college in Mountmellick conducted by the Presentation Nuns, and I am happy to say that many girls have qualified there and that the record of that college has been the best in Ireland on more than one occasion.  It is an all-Irish speaking college, and people have come from the four corners of this country to be educated by the Presentation Sisters.  We look upon it with great pride as one of the best colleges in Ireland today, and we trust that the proud record of success of the teachers and the nuns there will continue.  I understand that the Department has <Col N="1718" /> always been very helpful in all matters pertaining to that school.  I hope that the happy relationship that exists between the Department and these schools will continue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the one-teacher and two-teacher schools, I have a queer feeling that there is a motive behind all this.  We have seen that it is the Government's policy not only to denude rural Ireland of its people but to deny them all the facilities to which they are entitled.  Courthouses and Garda barracks in rural Ireland have been closed down.  Recently the Minister for Local Government refused to allow county councils to build cottages for agricultural labourers in rural Ireland. They must be built in groups and in towns.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious thing for any Government to decide where people should live.  It is a very serious matter for a Government to make laws or regulations compelling a family to live in a district in which the Government say they must live, or for a Government to say that the protectors of law and order must be available only where the Government say they should be available.  However, it is more serious still to see that the Government are now taking steps to send children not to schools to which their parents want them to go but where the Government say they should go.</P>
    <P>I want to object vigorously to the closing of two-teacher schools unless a case can be made for it.  If the merits of these two-teacher schools are considered by a public inquiry or otherwise, I venture to say that any impartial inspector conducting such an inquiry, having heard the evidence of the school manager and the parents, would come to the conclusion that no justification can be found for the closing of these schools.</P>
    <P>We have all been calling for an improvement in education in general. I should like to know who has called for the closing of these schools.  The parents have not called for it.  There has been no outcry from the general public or from the teachers in regard to the closing of such schools.  There has been no outcry from the school managers in this regard.  The closing of <Col N="1719" /> two-teacher schools in rural Ireland will be a very serious step for the future of this country because it is the thin end of the wedge to taking away the present system of managerial control of schools.  I want to say for the record that if any effort is made either now or in the future to take the management of schools out of the hands of the school managers, parish priests, rectors and others, I am certainly one who will, both in my Party and elsewhere, violently oppose any such action by the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say the Government are not going to do that.  I respectfully say the Minister would not dare do it at the moment but the fact that schools are to be closed down, the fact that schools are to be centralised is in my opinion, the first step towards State control of education.  It may be all right to have this step taken now when we have a Government who may have some little regard for the present managerial system of schools, but in the event of central schools being established and rural schools being closed down, we have no guarantee that in ten, 20 or 30 years, we will not have a Government in office who may see fit to take advantage of the first steps that are being taken by Fianna Fáil now.  I believe that the first steps that have now been taken are the toddling steps towards taking away from the school managers of this country the right to manage their own schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous, bad and unsound that any effort should be made by the Government to interfere in any way with the schools, except with the full approval and consent of the managers of the schools and of the parents.  Parents have a right to have schools in the locality in which they live.  They have confidence in the clerical managers.  While the Government may have power and authority to close Garda barracks or <Col N="1720" /> do away with courthouses, I think they are biting off too much in trying to deprive rural fathers and mothers of schools in which to educate their children.  It is a wrong step and the Minister is ill-advised.  The motives behind it are seriously ill-conceived and evilly-disposed.  I have no doubt that the Government have discussed all implications of education and I know there are members of the Government who would be only too glad to take the management of all our schools out of the hands of the Church authorities, if they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one way in which they can give school managers a serious telling-off, by closing down the schools.  One way they can get at the Church authorities is to dismantle and disarm them of responsibility for schools and the best way in which they can do that is to give them this pill coated with chocolate so that it will taste well. This is the first step.  When the Minister gets away with the first step of closing down rural schools throughout Ireland, he will probably, as time permits, deal with the question of the managers.  If the Minister gets away with the closing of two-teacher schools in rural Ireland, many of us in this House will live to see further steps taken, if Fianna Fáil are there, a stronger Fianna Fáil Government than are there to-day&mdash;God forbid there should ever be such, I do not want to set up as a political prophet but I most certainly prophesy that, as sure as the Government get away with this, so surely will they challenge the managerial rights of the Church authorities to manage the schools because this is one step towards the State taking over education.  I oppose <Col N="1721" /> it vigorously and strongly.  It is wrong in principle.</P>
      <P>In rural Ireland you have the parish as the unit.  I hope it will always be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the parish you have the homes and the school.  With the homes, you must have the school and Church to complete a parish.  We now find an effort being made by the Minister to destroy parish life, an attempt to deprive the parish of its natural centre, of the one facility which will maintain it as a parish, the school.  Can anyone visualise a parish without a school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many parishes where we have two-teacher schools of a very high standard but an effort is now being made by the Minister to destroy parish life in rural Ireland by depriving the people of the one facility to which they are entitled, a school which can be used for the benefit of the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the national teacher in a rural district is looked upon with the highest respect because he is often called upon to act as the parish leader.  He is responsible for building up good citizens, for the education of the children and their training outside their homes.  He takes the place of the parent during school hours and even takes as keen an interest in them after school hours as do the parents.  We have a great deal to be grateful for to our national teachers.  They have acquitted themselves excellently.  Where the school is the centre for debates, discussions and meetings of an educational as well as a political purpose, these schools are the centres of social life and should not be interfered with.  I have heard no sound reason from the Minister as to why these schools should be closed down.  One reason is reported in the papers in which the Minister is being quoted as saying that two-teacher <Col N="1722" /> schools were inefficient.  Does that mean the INTO are inefficient?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister no other way of giving them a slap in the teeth?  Are not two-teacher schools staffed by members of the INTO who have acquitted themselves well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy read what the President of the INTO said about the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we find that the Minister accused teachers of two-teacher schools in Ireland of being inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true, and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced beyond doubt that one reason why the Minister is closing these schools is that he wants a higher standard of efficiency in the large central schools.  If he wants higher efficiency, it means he must now have a low standard of efficiency or inefficiency in the existing schools.  That is an extraordinary slap in the teeth the Minister offers the INTO who have given their best, who have slaved five days of the week giving their services generally in the interests of pupils and who have got excellent results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be delighted to have the Deputy as champion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not offering to be the champion of the teachers but I must give credit where credit is due.  If I found there was any occasion to offer criticism, I should not be the last man in the House to criticise but I have no reason to offer a single word of criticism against teachers and particularly against those who staff our national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, or otherwise, my education stopped at the national school level.  My university was sixth standard national school.  That was the only education available to me.  I should like to speak for the tens of thousands of our people who could <Col N="1723" /> never afford to get any farther or could never go any farther than the national school.  I venture to say that as far as our national schools are concerned, in many cases the one- and two-teacher schools have produced some of the best and most outstanding men in this country and that of those who emigrated from this country and rose to high places in the United States, many were men whose education ended in the national school.  I do not set up myself as an authority on education but I visit every school in my constituency and many is the time I gave a can of sweets to the children in those country schools.  I remember one occasion when Deputy Costello was Taoiseach and he was visiting Shannon Harbour.  I was with him on that occasion and when I had presented the Taoiseach to the school manager and one or two others, I asked that in honour of the visit they should close the school for that day and the following day.  That was done. That is a two-teacher school and a very creditable one.</P>
    <P>Having got away with the question of inefficiency in two-teacher schools, the Minister suggests that transport will be available to take the children to the larger schools.  I would like to know what plans he has made in connection with this question of transport. Who is to pay?  Is the State to pay, or the parents of the little children?  Are the local authorities to pay?  Are the taxpayers to pay?  At the moment there are various systems of transport for pupils of secondary and vocational schools and where a father has three, four or five children travelling every day to school, it is a severe burden on working and middle-class people.  If we reach the stage that parents will have to pay transport charges for children from the age of four, it is going to be a very severe burden on them.  I do not agree at all with the transporting of children to school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has an unequalled capacity for confusing the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to have <Col N="1724" /> in the one bus, minibus or car, children of four years and upwards travelling with children of 13 and 14 years? Surely the Minister, as the father of a very excellent family, must know that you cannot comfortably transport a busload of children between the ages of four and seven years day after day to and from school without some general inconvenience?  I would like to ask him what very special transport facilities are to be available so that he can cater fully and in every way for children who may have to be transported from rural districts into the towns to these schools.  I am appalled at the whole situation.</P>
      <P>In this country we have 4,821 primary schools.  Of these, 3,194 are one-and two-teacher schools.  That is 66 per cent of all our schools and that means that 66 per cent of our schools are going to be closed down.  The first instalment is to be closed down right away and gradually they will be all closed down.  This is a very serious matter.  It is so serious that I feel that the Minister has not given it sufficient thought.  I raised the matter previously in the House by way of Parliamentary Question.  I did so as far back as 1st December, 1965, as reported in Volume 219, No. 5 of the Dáil Debates.  Previously I addressed a question to him on 21st October, 1965, in which I asked him if he would state the Government's policy in relation to the two-teacher and smaller schools in the country so as to clear up any misunderstanding in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the Minister's reply to that question most unsatisfactory.  It is a most serious matter to interfere with the location of schools and with the constitutional rights of parents to send their children to whatever schools they like.  Our people are entitled to have their schools in their rural areas and to have their children educated in them.  Surely the Minister will agree that in this country, where we have a sufficient school-going population, the parents and children are entitled, firstly, to the school and, secondly, to the teaching facility?  Yet this is what the Minister is denying them at the moment.  I asked the Minister if he had consulted the INTO in relation to <Col N="1725" /> this matter and with what result, if he had consulted the school managers and with what result, if he had got a letter from the Irish Hierarchy and with what results?</P>
    <P>On Wednesday 1st December, 1965, in volume 219, No. 5, I asked the Minister for Education:</P>
    <P>if he received a letter from the Irish hierarchy on 17th October, 1965 in connection with his education policy for the future, with special reference to the proposed closing of two-teacher schools in rural Ireland; if the Government considered this letter; if any decision had been taken on this matter; and if he will make a statement in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The Deputy must appreciate that in accordance with ordinary procedure and as a matter of common courtesy, I cannot give him the information which he seeks or make any comment on his question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>This is the place in which to have this thrashed out.  I asked the Minister did he get the letter and was the letter considered by <Col N="1728" /> the Minister and the Government and I did not get a favourable reply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not cross-question the Minister.  I will ask him, when he is replying, to be good enough to comment on the letter. Perhaps the Minister will now also tell us, in relation to the closing of the two-teacher schools, what transpired between him and the deputation which he received on behalf of the Bishops. Will he tell us if he sent any reply to the letter which the Irish Bishops sent him after the meeting they held in Rome and at which they discussed this matter?  This is a matter which vitally concerns every parent and child. I want to assure the Minister that there are no more highly qualified personnel to advise in relation to educational matters than the Church authorities.  Is the Minister now giving the deaf ear and turning the blind eye to the views expressed by the deputation which he received of certain members of the Hierarchy?  It is not correct for the Minister to say, as reported, that the Irish Hierarchy have expressed an opinion one way or another on this because the Hierarchy have not yet met to discuss the report of the deputation which the Minister received.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister received a deputation from the Hierarchy and the deputation was to report back to the general body of the Hierarchy and they have not yet had an opportunity of doing so.  Are those not the true facts of the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing from what the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. The Secretary of the Irish Hierarchy in a public statement has made it quite <Col N="1729" /> clear that the whole position arising from the receiving of the deputation by the Minister, will be discussed when the Bishops have an opportunity of doing so, but up to now they have not had the opportunity.  Therefore it is not correct for the Minister to claim that he has the opinion of the Irish Hierarchy in relation to this matter, because he has not.  They have not given a decision on it at all yet.  This, in my opinion, is a very serious matter and the most serious aspect of all has been that in public the Minister advised a certain member of the Hierarchy who expressed an opinion to test the legality of what he was doing in the law courts.</P>
      <P>I really thought that the Minister for Education in a good Christian Government would seek some other means besides advising a member of the Hierarchy to test this issue in the courts.  It is my opinion, and I am giving the opinion of a layman for what it is worth, that the Minister cannot legally or constitutionally close down these schools, unless this House passes an Act and that Act is approved and signed by the President and goes on the Statute Book.  I can assure the Minister that he is most certainly courting disaster if he pursues a policy of advising Bishops to go to court with him.  I think it is wrong.  The Minister may laugh, he may sneer or jeer, but he cannot deny the fact that in the public press he is reported as having invited the Bishops to test in the courts what he is trying to do in regard to closing these country schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely school managers, parents and teachers have a right to express openly and publicly their views on such a vital matter as the closing of these schools?  In relation to certain Irish Bishops, who have spoken more than once on the subject, I think they have a moral obligation to speak out on behalf of those under their care and to advise the Government if they see the Government are overstepping their duties in educational matters.  The Minister should be grateful to the deputation from the Hierarchy he received for giving him good and sound advice.  He should be grateful to the member of the Hierarchy he invited <Col N="1730" /> to take legal proceedings in the courts to test what he was trying to do. If legal action is taken, in my opinion, the Minister will lose it.  The Irish people have certain constitutional rights.  One of them concerns the custody, care and education of their own children and the educational facilities made available for them in their own locality.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the new system of transport with which the Minister hopes to replace these country schools will not work.  The sooner the Minister gets that idea out of his head, the better.  I am advising him in the most friendly spirit.  I am trying to add my voice to the other voices from this side of the House and to the prudent voices of wisdom and knowledge from outside the House of those who have already spoken.  The transport he has in mind will not work. The teachers have publicly stated so. It is generally believed that to have children travelling to and from school in buses both morning and afternoon is not right, is not good for their health and certainly not good for the general conduct and behaviour of young children.  The Minister should know that.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants co-operation from school managers, from parents, from everybody in relation to these educational changes he has in mind.  If he does, he should drop this idea of alleging that two-teacher schools are inefficient.  There is no truth whatever in that.  When you compare a class of 50 children under the Minister's new system with a class of 15 children, it is evident that special attention can be given to the smaller class.  The Minister referred to smaller schools not having as good a record in obtaining scholarships as the larger schools.  How can he compare the records of smaller schools with larger schools in that regard? In the larger schools, you have a larger selection for the teaching staff to pick from so far as scholarships are concerned.  They have a larger number from which to pick to sit for scholarships and win them.  A certain number of bright pupils are selected and given special training.  Naturally, where you have a large number of pupils attending, <Col N="1731" /> you have the greatest material available for scholarships.  It is very wrong, and an unfair comparison, that the Minister should give as a reason for closing down these schools that not as many scholarships are won by them as larger schools.</P>

      <P>A class of 25 most certainly can be given more individual attention than a class of 50. The Minister is on the wrong track. As I said at the outset, his motives are evilly-disposed.  There is something extraordinary hidden that has not yet been disclosed.  The use of the weapon of shortage of money to put over certain educational changes on school managers, Church authorities and others is wrong.</P>

      <P>I left it to the Minister.  The Minister was the first to mention Communism.  I guarded myself carefully against the mention of Communism. I would not like to refer to it; the Minister was the first to mention it.  Bearing in mind that the State are taking over, may I say, in a Communist fashion, the education of the people, the next step is the taking over of the complete lives of the people by the State.  That is why I feel the Minister is biting off more than he can chew in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as last October, I asked the Minister to be cautious.  He did not take my advice.  He has not been cautious in relation to this matter and has walked himself into trouble on a number of occasions.  Anybody who knows the Minister would most certainly be sorry that he has not seen <Col N="1732" /> the pitfalls.  I am warning him again now&mdash;I warned him in October, in December and this is the third time&mdash; to act with prudence, care and caution, that he is playing with fire in relation to this two-teacher school business. I will go further than that and say that he will not and cannot expect to get away with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from him the position in relation to Protestant schools which are scattered over a wide area.  There are a number of non-Catholic schools in this country.  The Minister's Department must have given a degree of special consideration to the non-Catholic schools that are two-teacher schools and that are scattered over a very wide area.  Instead of closing down some of these two-teacher non-Catholic schools, the Minister's aim should be to give them a greater degree of financial support towards their upkeep, heating and the proper sanitary facilities which should be made available for them.</P>
    <P>I have always felt, in relation to non-Catholic schools, that a greater proportion of funds should be made available to them because the methods of fund raising that may be at the disposal of the Catholic school managers are not suitable for the non-Catholic community because they are so limited in numbers.  They are entitled to a fair crack of the whip.  I have dealt with the matter before in this House.  Because the number of schools is so limited and because of the location of many of them, I have always felt that additional facilities should be made available to them.  They have not the population that the Catholic community has to subscribe to the upkeep of their schools in the fund-raising amenities available to Catholic school managers and for that reason the non-Catholic schools should certainly be in receipt of additional financial facilities to bring them to a very high standard or at least to bring them to as good a standard as can be expected.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister one other question.  I should like to hear from him if he has been notified by the INTO that they have favoured <Col N="1733" /> his policy.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7th February, 1966, page 3, we read this statement:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Mr. Colley, said in Galway that he had been informed by the INTO that they have favoured his policy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some more details about this when he is replying because I have received representations from certain branches of the INTO who have expressed their indignation at the closing of some of these two-teacher schools.</P>

      <P>There is one other point to which I should like to make reference.  I am prompted to refer to it by Deputy O'Leary's speech this afternoon.  He gave notice to all concerned that he intends shortly to raise the question of the care, management and general code of behaviour in reformatory schools and such places. Deputy O'Leary said he was not at all too pleased or satisfied with the manner in which the inmates of these schools are treated.  I do not know what he has in mind or what schools he has in mind, but before Deputy O'Leary proceeds to develop this matter further, I have certain things to say. I am sure we shall hear more about it when he raises the matter but I want to assure this House, the Minister and Deputy O'Leary that if he has in mind the reformatory in Daingean, County Offaly, it is managed, controlled and conducted by the Oblate Fathers.  I can safely say that it is one of the finest and one of the best-managed institutions in this State today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of over 20 years, I know that <Col N="1734" /> the work the Oblate Fathers carry out for those placed under their care and charge in Daingean is of the highest value.  Many of those discharged from that institution have written back very gratifying letters to the Oblate Fathers expressing their thanks.  Many of them, also, when leaving the institution, express their sorrow at having to leave and many of them express their heartfelt thanks for the special care and attention, the medical care and the medical attention, and the manner in which the Oblate Fathers took them unto themselves as if they were members of their own family, and particularly for the high standard of educational and sporting facilities which are all there for them in Daingean.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Leary has any doubts in relation to that matter, I have no hesitation in saying that the Superior in Saint Conleth's, Daingean, would welcome a visit by him and would bring him around the institution to let him see the fine, airy conditions and the very high standard of education and training which prevail there. On such a visit, Deputy O'Leary would have an opportunity of observing the noble efforts of the Superior and of his Fathers and Brothers who work so strenuously and so earnestly in the interest of those who are placed under their care.</P>
      <P>Many children have been sent to that institution.  They can be described as juvenile delinquents or as children who were allowed a free hand without any control by their parents.  They were not too long in Daingean until they were moulded into a new way of life.  The priests of Daingean took complete charge of the development of their character.  There are now amongst us today many fine, honourable citizens who would not be such a credit to their country were it not for the generous care, help and attention they received from the Oblate Fathers in their school in Daingean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy O'Leary's fears in relation to reformatories are unfounded so far as St. Conleth's, Daingean, is concerned.  I am sure it is not one of those institutions which he has under observation.  I can allay all <Col N="1735" /> his fears in that regard as I am quite satisfied that he need have no fear or worry in that respect.  I shall discuss the matter with the Deputy some time &mdash;he is not in the House at present&mdash; so as to allay his fears and lest he might have false illusions about the general conduct and administration of that fine school which is a credit to this country, to the county in which it is located, to the Oblate Fathers and to everybody concerned.  I have nothing but the highest of praise for it.  Certainly, I know intimately everybody connected with it and they deserve nothing but the sincere gratitude, appreciation and thanks of every section of our people.</P>

      <P>There is one question which I am very anxious that the Minister should reply to.  It was a question raised here by Deputy Tully in a very reasonable, straightforward and forceful way.  I presume the Deputy was speaking from experience in his own constituency.  While the Minister has all these changes and plans under consideration there are a large number of schools throughout rural Ireland in respect of which the general scheme of repairs and of heating and general layout is still under consideration.  It is a pity that in 1966 so many schools in rural Ireland should have no heating facilities, so many rural schools should still have earthen floors and so many should lack proper ventilation.  There is a large number of schools the managers of which have submitted requests to have urgent and important repairs carried out.  The general policy of the Department is to put these repairs on the long finger. The finger appears to be getting longer. There seems to be no response whatever <Col N="1736" /> to requests for general approval for the carrying out of urgent and necessary repairs.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to get on with the work of repairing the existing schools.  We are informed that the changes in educational policy may take a number of years.  In the meantime if nothing is done to these schools they will collapse and fall in on top of pupils and teachers.  That is not a desirable state of affairs.  That is not the proper atmosphere in which children should be educated.  I trust that steps will be taken to improve the position and that, in addition, proper toilet and sanitary accommodation will be provided in each school.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why many county medical officers of health have not taken a more serious view of the very limited toilet accommodation available in schools in which 60 to 80 children may attend.  Inspectors from Bord Fáilte insist on hotels providing toilet accommodation of a certain standard.  Is it not more important that inspectors would be available to ensure that proper sanitary arrangements are provided in all national schools?  I challenge Deputies to visit country schools.  The toilet accommodation available is far from what it should be.  The Minister and the Board of Works or whoever is responsible have fallen down in regard to the provision of proper toilet and sanitary accommodation in schools.  Something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude on this note. This is a very serious matter.  The Labour Party have made their position very clear.  They are with the Minister in relation to two-teacher schools.  I want to make my position clear. Deputy Jones has spoken for our Party with great eloquence and has explained our attitude in relation to that matter. I want to make a very serious appeal to the Minister to act with very great caution.  This is a very serious matter. in which there is more lively interest in rural Ireland than he thinks.  It is a matter in which parents feel they have a constitutional right.  I would ask the Minister to refrain from inviting Bishops and others into the courts. Nobody wants to go into the courts. <Col N="1737" /> The one thing that cannot be mentioned in many parts of rural Ireland is litigation.</P>

      <P>I need quote no further.  What the Bishop said was that it was unconstitutional and the Minister invited law.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Go into the courts and test this thing out&rdquo;.  That is a wrong attitude for any Minister to adopt. I beg of him not to threaten any more people with law, not to be inviting people into the courts.  Above all, let him invite anyone but Irish Bishops to take part in law proceedings.  That is something which the people are disgusted with.  The general public do not like that.  It is not proper behaviour on the part of an Irish Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise my voice in protest against that invitation to law.  It was wrong.  I do not think it was becoming of a Minister of State.  Above all, I do not think it was becoming of a Minister who is responsible for the care, education and upbringing of our children as good citizens.  I hope that the Minister will now be a little older and a little wiser and will take more care and be more cautious in his statements in relation to this matter.  I am sure that, at a later date, when he hears again from the bishops on this, as I am sure he will, when they consider and report back as a result of the deputation they had with him, he will act in accordance with their recommendations. <Col N="1738" /> I am convinced that he is now a wiser man than he was.  I would strongly advise him, as I did on two occasions before, to act with caution. This matter is arousing considerable interest amongst people throughout the country.  Our people have a constitutional right to schools and a constitutional right to send their children to those schools and are most certainly prepared to see that they will get what they are entitled to.  It is a terrible thing to deprive people in relation to schools.  The Minister is now biting off too much.</P>
    <P>I hope this controversy will be ended to the satisfaction of everybody concerned and that the Minister will drop the idea of closing these schools, that he will leave well enough alone, that he will try to repair the schools where necessary and provide heating facilities and help the teaching staffs.  For Heaven's sake, leave well enough alone.  Do not pull down Irish parishes. Rural Ireland is being denuded sufficiently without depriving them of the centre of social life in them which is the school.  I hope and trust the Minister will now see fit to end this matter once and for all by leaving the rural schools as they are.  It is the general wish of parents.  The local school is available for small children at their own doorstep.  This idea of transporting them will not work.  I beg of the Minister to allow the schools to remain as they are and to assist in their development and improvement in every way possible.</P>

Muna dtaithníonn an rud sin leis na Teachtaí thall, léidís an <i>Tuairisc Oifigiúil.</i>  Chífidh siad ansin go ndúirt an Teachta O'Donnell gur ghoid an t-Aire polasaí Fhine Gael. Dúirt an Teachta O.J. Flanagan gur thug se cuairt ar Londain le déanaí agus go bhfaca sé slua deoraí i Camden Town.  Bhí a chroí mór bog dhá shuathadh le comh-bhrón do na deoraithe a bhí ansin agus ag tnú le filleadh go h-Éirinn.  Ansin dúirt sé go raibh an tír dhá bánú ag Fianna Fáil, go raibh na bánta míne ag dul chun fiántais, go raibh na cnoic go lom is go h-uaigneach, go raibh na gleannta doimhne a thóg sean-chine i rith na mblian go suarach agus pór na nGael in imigéin agus iad go minic ag caoineadh agus ag tnú le filleadh ar dhroim na dtiule thar n-ais go tír a sinsear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail myself of the opportunity provided by the discussion on these Supplementary Estimates to make a few comments on matters relating to education in my own constituency.  County Dublin is expanding very rapidly but educational facilities are certainly not keeping pace with this development.  Last August or September in at least two areas that I know of there were large numbers of children who had reached school-going age but who failed to gain entry into any school.  The difficulty arising in these cases was only overcome at the eleventh hour by the use of prefabricated schools and by the wholehearted co-operation of site owners in making sites available in time at very short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This kind of situation should not arise.  There were hundreds of children involved and it should be possible to anticipate this additional need for school accommodation.  It should not require emergency methods and the situation should not arise in which there were no schools to which to send the children, unless they were taken long distances.  Children of tender <Col N="1742" /> years cannot travel long distances unless they are accompanied or driven by their parents.  There should be much greater liaison between the Department, the local authority, the school managers, the vocational committees and the secondary school authorities.  If this liaison existed and if there were proper co-operation, there would always be information available to inform these various authorities about coming needs, population trends and development trends.</P>
    <P>There should be a section in the Minister's Department compiling this information so that it would be available to the people concerned with a view to securing suitable sites in sufficient time to ensure that there will be proper building and that the school authorities will be able to provide the necessary schools in anticipation of needs.  The necessary schools should not have to be provided as a panic measure.  In one area of which I am aware, we have now ten wooden prefabricated schools.  Unfortunately these prefabricated schools have a habit of becoming permanent.  From what I am told, they are all right as an emergency measure but are not regarded as suitable schools for long periods.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a tendency on the part of the Department, when these schools are put into position, to say that they are not so bad, that there are areas which are worse off and that these prefabricated schools should be retained.  That is not good enough. They should be used only in cases of complete emergency, as a means of expanding existing accommodation where there are indications that the population may ultimately drop.  Where there is evidence that these are areas where the population will grow and where the demand is on the increase every day, we should ensure that when schools are built, they are adequate in size.</P>
    <P>I know of a situation in County Dublin where a primary school was built which was far too small, despite the protests of the people concerned that it was too small.  Every responsible representation was made to the Minister on the matter but all were <Col N="1743" /> turned down for no good reason.  A year later we had to put a prefabricated room alongside to accommodate the children.  That is false economy.  We have the same experience in relation to vocational schools.  In every area I know where these have been built in recent years, they have all been shown to be much too small in a very short time.  This is a shortsighted policy.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the consideration of the present position in relation to the provision of vocational schools in the country as a whole, although my concern is principally with County Dublin.  A decision has been reached to suspend all building of vocational schools until the Minister has finished his survey in relation to post-primary schools throughout the country.  That was a serious mistake on the part of the Minister.  It is a good thing that the survey should be made.  It should have been made years ago.  The information which the Minister requires and which the survey is designed to give him should always have been in the Department and available to him in relation to the future development of our educational facilities.  It is all wrong that the Minister should decide that all building should cease until he finds the answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>The situation will now arise which areas now in urgent need of educational facilities will be denied them for a much longer period because of this decision to stop all building until the Minister has all the information he needs.  In one area the Minister has refused permission to build at a stage when the lowest tender has been accepted.  He said it might be that the school might not be big enough.  The situation in this regard is always changing, and throughout this particular area, there is rapid development and population is pouring in.  It was quite obvious that this school would only be big enough for a short time for either boys or girls but why did he not let us go ahead and finish it? If the money was not there, he could have said so.</P>
    <P>In another area expansion has been going on for over 20 years and there <Col N="1744" /> is an enormous population.  At the moment there is only one suitable site in the centre of this area.  I approached the Minister's predecessor for permission for the compulsory purchase of this site and for some reason best known to himself, he refused that permission.  That site has not passed from us yet but it is going to pass because we have not got the facilities and the Department has not agreed to a compulsory purchase order.  We cannot get sites for the building of houses, not to talk of schools, without compulsory purchase orders.  The Minister is mistaken if he thinks we are going to get the sites for vocational schools unless he uses the compulsory powers he has.</P>
    <P>I am now referring to Walkinstown. This area has been built on for the past 15 or 20 years.  There are no vocational education facilities in that area and there is a growing population in it. Before the Minister started his survey, we in the vocational education committee in County Dublin gave him the best survey we could provide.  I think he had sufficient information to tell us what the future holds and to allow us to go on with the job of planning our school sites.</P>
    <P>I hope the present Minister will change his mind in relation to the use of compulsory purchase powers and even at this eleventh hour, change his mind in relation to this site and tell the Dublin Vocational Committee to go ahead and procure this site by compulsory purchase.  The position is that we have the site.  The developer who had the site had got permission to build 14 houses on it and he gave it to us on terms acceptable to the Department but because of a covenant in the lease, we were not allowed to build a school on it; but if we get compulsory powers that will be put right.  I think it is a great mistake to allow the site to go.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this situation because this site is passing away from us if it has not already gone.  It is a very serious matter if it goes because of the lack of these powers or reluctance to use them.  I have been all around that area; I know it intimately and I know that the prospects of getting <Col N="1745" /> a suitable site there are non-existent. I ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the grants for secondary schools.  When these grants were introduced, we were all very pleased, even though they were limited grants and introduced with quite a lot of trumpet blowing.  I only discovered recently that they are not grants at all, that where these grants are given, the <i>per capita</i> allowance is reduced over the years until the grants are recovered.  If I am wrong in that, I should like the Minister to correct me but if that is the case&mdash;and I am assured it is&mdash;it is wrong to describe these as grants.  They are only loans and that should be admitted straight away.  There is very little encouragement given particularly to the religious orders who have done a wonderful job in this country over the years in providing educational facilities for our people at very little cost to the State. It is all wrong that so much time should have to be spent by these religious orders in the running of functions of all kinds before and after hours and often wasting valuable time that should be spent in doing educational work in trying to work out how they can collect the money necessary to build and maintain these schools.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the building of ordinary primary schools and the time taken to build them.</P>
    <P>We have had very unfortunate experiences in County Dublin with the same contractor.  In one case I think it took him the best part of four years to build a small primary school and it had to be finished by the Board of Works using direct labour.  In the second case, in my own parish, it took between three and three and a half years to complete a small primary school.  In another case a still smaller school at Kilternan is still unfinished after three or four years.  There are still so many defects yet to be put right that it is really a disgrace.  This all concerns the same contractor.  In the middle of this, and in spite of it, this contractor is given a further contract to build a school in County Meath.  That is having an absolute disregard for the efficiency and speed at which national <Col N="1746" /> schools should be provided.  It is giving building contracts to a man or a firm obviously not equipped to do the job and who should not get this favour when he or they cannot be relied on to finish the schools.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the standards in small rural schools.  It is deplorable at this stage in our history that the Department should still prescribe for small schools an open turf fire as the system for heating.  How do we expect teachers to go to small rural schools if the standards there are so very much lower than the standards provided today for the larger urban-type schools.  In the urban schools that are being built now, there are very fine facilities such as central heating that can be turned on by a switch and is fully automatic.  When the children come in in the mornings, the school is warm and remains warm all day.  There is less sickness and greater comfort. When you go into these other primitive schools, some of which have been unimproved for years and have been allowed to decay and deteriorate, you find that an effort is made in the mornings to light the ordinary solid fuel fire, with all the accompanying cleaning. The poor quality of the heating facilities means they have no heat until it is time for the children to go home.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that children are attracted elsewhere.  No effort is made to make these schools comfortable or bring the standards up to date.  It is no wonder it is difficult to get staff to stay in them.  It would be easy enough to get staff to stay in rural schools if these were brought up to date and made comfortable.  In many cases it would not take an immense outlay to make them comfortable and more liveable.  It is often said that it is difficult to get teachers to stay in these schools and to accept the facilities that are there.  That is no wonder.  They must stay there all day with no living accommodation provided and none available in the area.</P>
    <P>If we want a doctor to stay in a remote district, we build a doctor's residence and in that way we maintain that service.  If we want to see whether or not these rural schools are a success <Col N="1747" /> or a failure, we should first modernise them and provide the necessary facilities even in a limited number of cases, just as they are provided in urban areas and larger schools and see what the effect would be.  I have an example in mind in my own constituency.  Not so many years ago there was a small rural school there with very primitive arrangements, to put it mildly.  Some Deputies referred to toilet accommodation. There was no toilet accommodation of any description.  This school has since been rebuilt.  It is a two-teacher school.</P>
    <P>When the primitive school existed, it was not possible to get people to accept a local authority house in the area.  We had empty houses there with no tenants for them, even though houses in the area as a whole were scarce.  Since the modern school was provided&mdash;it is still only a two-teacher school&mdash;we have a demand for services and at present money is being collected for a church in that area.  That is indicative of the part the school plays in a rural area.  It plays no small part in community development and community interest.  Many of these areas could be developed into very happy and worthwhile communities if we had regard to these facts.  The people will move away if the facilities are not there, but, if we make an effort to give them the facilities to which they are entitled, they will be attracted to these areas.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected, I suppose, that in a discussion on education at the moment emphasis would be placed on the controversy which flared up recently in relation to the future of one- and two-teacher schools.  There has been considerable argument and discussion. The controversy has flared up simply because bureaucracy has come up with a quick and, I suppose, what is regarded as more important still, a cheap solution to the problem, a solution which could, in fact, have very far-reaching consequences and widespread effects on the lives of rural communities. I am afraid the decision was taken too lightly and the reaction which has occurred as a result of the decision is obvious to everybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> The publication <i>Investment in Education</i> makes recommendations based almost entirely on economics.  Figures have been produced to show the savings that can be effected in the building of schools.  Figures have also been used to indicate the more economical use that can be made of teaching and other facilities.  Statistics have been produced to show that the small schools have been not nearly so successful as the larger schools when measured by the number of scholarships secured, etc.  In my view, these are all material measures and I do not think the problem can be fairly measured in that way.  There are other extremely important aspects of education which must not be lost sight of.  It is still true, I think, that the most important aspect of education is teaching children how to save their souls.  There is no evidence to show that by bringing children together in bigger numbers education towards that end will be any more efficacious.</P>
    <P>The problem has been very sensibly dealt with by Deputy Jones.  He urges caution.  He urges the greatest possible amount of discussion and agreement with the parents before any move is made.  I am sure that, if the Minister has not felt that way already, he must now be impressed by the fact that there is such pressure for the agreement of the parents before any sudden change is made.  When a man of the character and experience of Deputy Jones, a teacher and a parent, speaks as he spoke, then the Minister should listen carefully.  Deputy Jones feels very strongly about this matter and about the implications in the solution suggested to him.  This is obviously, as he said, a matter for pilot experimentation. He recognises, and rightly so, that there should be no move until the fullest possible agreement is secured from the parents.</P>
    <P>That covers the few comments I want to make at this stage.  Before I sit down, I should like to ask the Minister again to reconsider the decision made by his predecessor not to allow compulsory purchase powers for the securing of sites in County Dublin and convey to the committee his agreement now that this power should be sought and used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to denounce the speech we heard this evening from Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  I can only describe it as mischievous, of evil intent, and utterly irresponsible.  I cannot understand what is to be gained by such a speech.  I cannot understand what Deputy Flanagan thinks will be gained by trying to stir up trouble between Church and State. I do not think it can be denied that that was clearly one of his objectives. The suggestion that the closing of the one- and two-teacher schools, each case being considered on its merits and as the question of replacement arose, should be regarded as the first step in the abolition of the managerial system is so utterly without foundation that I am at a loss to understand what he hoped to gain by making the allegation.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly surprised really at anything Deputy Flanagan says.  His past performances leave one no excuse for being surprised.  What I am at a loss to understand, however, is why the Fine Gael Party should allow this kind of thing.  It surely cannot be in the interests of either the Church or the State that this kind of trouble should be fomented.  The only consolation I have is that, Deputy Flanagan's reputation being what it is, sensible people are not likely to take him seriously.  Nevertheless, it is disturbing that the Fine Gael Party should tolerate this kind of performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, Deputy Flanagan suggested that this policy is a first step on the way to abolishing the managerial system.  In fact, this policy, much more so than the previous policy of the Department of Education, lays great stress on the parish as a unit, because every possible effort is being made to ensure that children are not brought outside their parish in any amalgamation that may take place.  There are some cases where this is unavoidable but my Department is going to considerable lengths to avoid this. Many other aspects of Deputy Flanagan's speech were almost as objectionable <Col N="1750" /> but I do not think they merit any further comment.</P>
    <P>The main theme of this debate has been the policy in regard to small schools but a number of other matters were raised and I propose to deal with them first.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond showed some concern about the question of methods of teacher training and recruitment.  I share that concern.  I feel that we should try to devise a method of recruitment, in the first instance, which as far as is humanly possible will ensure that the people recruited for teacher training are people who want to teach, people who have a vocation.  We do naturally, and fortunately, under our present system get a very large number of such people, but it is true that we get some people who have not got a vocation for teaching and who obtain entry to the training college by reason of the fact that they obtained a very high place in the Leaving Certificate examination.</P>
    <P>A good deal of research has been done both in this country and abroad to try to discover what are the qualifications which make a good teacher.  So far the results have not been very conclusive. One of the few things that one can say with reasonable certainty and with scientific evidence to back it is something which probably most of us know and feel instinctively, that is, that somebody with a very high IQ normally does not make the best teacher, that the person who makes the best teacher usually comes from a stratum that is quite clever but is not in the top range of IQ.  Obviously there are a large number of other factors which lead to a person being a good teacher as distinct from a bad one and any assistance that can be got as a result of research in discovering what these qualities are will be of great importance to us in the future.  Nevertheless, I believe there are certain methods which we could adopt, even in our present state of knowledge on this subject, which would improve our methods of recruitment.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I set up a committee consisting of teachers, psychologists, inspectors and representatives from the training colleges to study this whole <Col N="1751" /> problem of recruitment and also the problem of training of national teachers.  I have set up similar committees in regard to the recruitment and training of secondary teachers and also of vocational teachers.  We need a good deal more information on this but it is a vital matter because the ultimate result obtained from our educational system must depend on the quality of our teachers.  If we cannot ensure the highest possible quality amongst our teachers, then we cannot ensure the highest possible quality of education.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I want to make it quite clear that I am not criticising the quality of our existing staffs of teachers.  What I am saying is that no system humanly devised is such that it cannot be improved.  In so far as we can manage it, we have an obligation to give the children of this country the best educational system we can give them and in pursuance of that aim, we should see to what extent we can improve the recruitment and training of teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond also referred to the question of group teaching and expressed some dissatisfaction with it. This method of teaching is being used in some of the women's training colleges at present and is in operation in some of our national schools.  Many of the reports on it are satisfactory but there may well be some substance in the complaint made by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, which is getting close to the objection made in regard to small schools, that the teacher concerned is dealing with different groups within the class at the one time.</P>
    <P>The problem, of course, is not quite the same because the teacher is dealing with groups in the one class as distinct from dealing with different classes. In order to determine whether or not this method of teaching is satisfactory, one has to do a good deal of research and testing and we have made arrangements in the Department of Education to conduct experiments to test the efficacy of group teaching.  Briefly, they will consist of classes chosen in four different areas and starting at the second class with a teacher who is <Col N="1752" /> convinced that group teaching is a good method of teaching, who is a competent teacher and who will carry on with that class right up to the sixth class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>What number of teachers will there be in the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The comparison will be on an equal basis.  We are also picking teachers who do not believe in group teaching to start at second class at the same time, as far as we can ensure it, with a class of similar background and similar educational attainments up to then, as near as we can make the two things comparable, with the same kind of school, to carry on with that class right up to sixth class. This is the only way of testing the efficacy of group teaching but you can see from this that it is going to take a considerable time and I think it will probably be 1971 before we have the results.  One thing that should be quite clear to anybody with any interest in or knowledge of education is that anything done in education is long-term. I might remind of that some of the people who talk as though we are about to close all the small schools in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond also expressed concern about the fact that when we raise the school leaving age to 15, we will have to ensure we do not have the children concerned simply sitting in the back of the class in the national school or perhaps teaching classes because they have completed the national school course.  Of course, she is quite right in saying that.  At no stage did we contemplate such a thing. In fact, what is contemplated in conjunction with the raising of the school leaving age is the provision of a post-primary course of three years, which we hope in the normal case will run from 12 plus to 15 plus.  We want to ensure as far as we can that, when our children leave school after their compulsory period of schooling, they will have more to show and more training for life afterwards than they can be given in most national schools.  There are of course some national schools where there are secondary tops and the <Col N="1753" /> children concerned can get a post-primary education, but there are not very many of these schools.  We want to ensure as far as we can that these children will get the full benefit from the raising of the school leaving age by getting a post-primary course suited to their aptitudes.</P>
    <P>This problem of the arrangements for post-primary education has been touched on by a number of Deputies. I want to make it clear that this survey of post-primary facilities to which Deputy Clinton was referring is an integral part of our plans for the development of post-primary education. We have two objectives.  They are somewhat similar.  One is to raise the school leaving age to 15 by 1970 at the latest.  The other is to ensure that every child in the country will get a post-primary education suitable to his or her needs and aptitudes.  We regard this second aim as a social aim, if you like, or it can be viewed as an economic aim.  Whichever way you view it, I doubt if there are many people who would disagree with realising those aims.  There may be a few, but very few.</P>
    <P>These are the objectives.  The question is: how do you go about achieving them?  It seems to me that any rational approach to this problem involves utilising the resources which we have in the country to the fullest. It is clear that the resources we have, when used to the fullest, will not be adequate to deal with this problem. Nevertheless, we must for a number of reasons ensure that we use our existing resources to the fullest.  I say a number of reasons because, firstly, we have an obligation to the taxpayer to ensure that money is not squandered in achieving this objective; and, secondly, in order to ensure that existing schools will get the fullest opportunity of partaking in this development of post-primary education, we must organise on the basis of existing schools.</P>
    <P>To do that, the first step is to find out exactly what our resources are and what our requirements are.  We can find out a good deal about this on the basis of a national survey.  This is the survey to which Deputy Clinton <Col N="1754" /> was referring.  The information acquired by that survey is in the Department of Education.  The processing of that information is not completed and will not be completed for some time.  Having completed the processing, we will then have a fairly accurate picture of what the situation is in regard to any area of the country. When I speak of areas at the moment I am thinking in terms of rural and semi-rural areas.  In that context an area means roughly an area of ten miles radius around a focal point, usually a particular town.</P>
    <P>In regard to each area we have to know&mdash;and we will know as a result of this survey&mdash;what the number of children requiring post-primary education will be in the immediate future or more long-term future and, on the basis of experience, what proportion of them are likely to require by their aptitudes an academic education and what proportion are likely to require a more practical type of education.  We also want to know what facilities exist for an academic or practical type education within that area, what facilities exist in the way of science laboratories, for instance, woodwork rooms and metalwork equipment.</P>
    <P>We can get this information fairly accurately on the basis of this survey. But the actual utilisation of resources depends on co-operation at local level. Furthermore, I am very conscious of the fact that in matters such as this only the people at local level in the field can really know what the problems are that cannot appear on any official survey or any official file.  There can often be personal difficulties arising in an area that will never appear in an official file.  It is for this reason I issued a circular some time ago to all secondary and vocational schools in the country setting out details of what we want to do, asking them to hold meetings at local level and offering the services of an inspector of my Department to clarify points and report back to the Department.  A number of preliminary meetings have taken place on foot of this in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The results so far I have found very <Col N="1755" /> encouraging.  I have found that there is both on the vocational and secondary school side a very earnest wish to co-operate to the fullest and to ensure that, as far as it can be done, the existing schools will serve the areas in which they are situated.  I have been very heartened by this reaction.  But it is at a preliminary stage.  Further meetings will be necessary.  I have no doubt that, as a few meetings take place, not alone will further problems come to light but further opportunities for co-operation which might not have seemed possible at first will appear.</P>
    <P>The main form of co-operation likely to be possible will be an interchange of teachers.  Where a vocational school has a teacher and there is not a corresponding type of teacher in the secondary school and the secondary school wants to provide that type of course, or <i>vice versa</i>, clearly there is room for utilising the teacher concerned there, and, to that degree, not alone serving the area better but also taking a step on the road to ensuring that teachers will specialise in the subjects in which they are qualified.  Until these meetings have taken place and the problem has been assessed at local level&mdash;we want to know exactly what the full requirements of particular areas are&mdash;we cannot really progress with the next stage of the plan.</P>
    <P>It seemed obvious to me, from what Deputy O.J. Flanagan said here this evening, that he had not heard of this circular or, if he had heard of it, that it did not mean anything to him.  He described it as something which had nothing whatever to do with the problem he was talking about, which was the extension of a vocational school and the building of another one.  It is obvious that it is vitally involved in that.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I might avail of this opportunity to say here that I have never refused to meet a vocational education committee.  On numerous occasions, I have met a number of representatives of vocational education committees and many other groups. What I said in the case to which Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred was <Col N="1756" /> that I felt discussion would be ineffectual until this circular had been received by the committee and considered: only through that, could they understand what we were trying to do and could assess the problems they wanted to see me about.  In the light of that, I made it quite clear that when the committee had got the circular and considered it, I should be only too happy to meet them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond also expressed some concern about post-primary schools.  I think she was thinking in particular of secondary schools that cannot get 150 pupils. She said that, under the regulations, they could not benefit from the secondary school grants.  This is true.  However, I want to make it clear that, in pursuing the plan for post-primary education, we shall try to assist existing schools which will be serving the area to build up so that they will at least be big enough to take 150 pupils because you need this number to provide an adequately wide curriculum. We shall endeavour, where possible, to build them up.  If there is a case of new schools, we shall want to have them situated and serving an area so that they will have this number of pupils.  There will be exceptions to this, of course: there always are.  There will be areas of the country which cannot be served in that way and, in such cases, the schools concerned will get the fullest consideration, sympathy and help from the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I think it would be about 30:1.  Some comments have been made about the introduction of the common Intermediate Certificate and, as will subsequently come, the common Leaving Certificate.  A few people, inside and outside this House, have recently endeavoured to decry this development by saying that it is intended to lower the standards.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no truth whatever in that allegation.  The <Col N="1757" /> suggestion has been made&mdash;and there is evidence of the suggestion&mdash;that the Department of Education will abolish honours in the Intermediate Certificate. Like some of the other statements to which we have been treated, this is only a half-truth.  The full truth of the matter is that the Department of Education consulted the recognised school associations in this matter, put forward certain alternative suggestions, asked for the views of the associations and has made no decision on this matter.  One of them was whether the association would think it a good idea to abolish honours in the Intermediate Certificate&mdash;but what you are not told is that an alternative suggestion was to retain honours but to increase its value&mdash;in other words to raise the standard of honours in the Intermediate Certificate.</P>
      <P>It should be quite clear from the fact that such a suggestion emanated from the Department of Education that there is no truth whatever in the statement that the Department intend to lower the standard of the Intermediate Certificate.  I shall be quite blunt and say I believe that most of the people who make this allegation really mean: &ldquo;We do not think the vocational schools are good enough and they will not be able to do this common Intermediate Certificate unless you lower the standard&rdquo;.  There is no intention whatever of lowering the standard.  Anybody doing that examination, whatever school he or she may attend, will have to reach that standard if he or she is to get that examination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to integration between secondary and vocational schools.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no intention whatever of integrating secondary and vocational schools.  What is intended is that there will be the maximum co-operation between them in the way I mentioned earlier and as explained very fully in the circular I sent to the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins quoted some figures in regard to vocational teachers.  I am not quite clear where the figures came from but, lest there should be any misunderstanding about it, I want to say that <Col N="1758" /> there are nearly two thousand permanent teachers in vocational schools in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to teaching through Irish in a way that she seemed to think it was not very much help to people as regards English.  I should like to remind her of two small facts.  There was recently a competition by the Council of Europe for an essay written in English in which the first place was won by an Irish girl.  It was a European competition and this girl who won the competition, writing the essay in English, attends an A school and is being educated entirely through Irish. At the recent Young Scientists of the Year Exhibition, the first prize-winner was a young lady also attending an A school and one of the two joint second prize-winners also was a girl educated entirely through Irish.  In the case of the first girl, her project was presented in English.  In the case of the second, it was presented in Irish.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  There seems to be some confusion about the transport schemes.  I want to make it clear that the transport scheme which applies in the case of amalgamated schools is completely different from the transport schemes which have been in operation for quite a number of years&mdash;and hundreds of them have been operated by the Department of Education for quite a number of years. Basically, they are subsidised schemes for which there is a reasonably substantial local contribution.  They should not be confused in any way with the scheme operating where a school is closed and amalgamated and where, in that case, the transport is completely free and paid for by the State.  I mentioned that there could be a nominal local contribution merely to preserve the manager's position.  There need not be a local contribution.  If there is, it should be nominal: there should be no question of asking anybody to contribute to it.  It is completely against what we want and I shall do my best <Col N="1759" /> to ensure that it does not happen that any child or parent will be asked to contribute towards the cost of that transport scheme.  It will be completely at the expense of the State.  Can I make that any clearer?</P>
