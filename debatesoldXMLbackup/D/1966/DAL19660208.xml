      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>For national income purposes, the Central Statistics Office estimates the aggregate wages and salaries in the State in each year. It is not possible to segregate increases in wages and salaries which occurred as a result of the ninth round from other contemporaneous increases, e.g. those arising from new employment. For 1964 the total wages and salaries of all employees are estimated to have been about £62 million, or 16½ per cent more than in 1963.  Preliminary indications are that aggregate wages and salaries in 1965 increased by a further £25 million or 5¾ per cent. Information regarding the total number of persons covered by the ninth round agreement is not available.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to compile estimates of the receipts <Col N="939" /> from emigrants returning home on holidays since such persons are not distinguished in the Sample Passenger Card Inquiry which is used to estimate receipts from visitors.  The categories distinguished in the Inquiry in respect of persons travelling to this country via Britain and the Six Counties are &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;, &ldquo;visit to relatives&rdquo;, &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo;. Not all the receipts from persons visiting relatives should necessarily be attributed to emigrants returning home on holidays while some persons classifying themselves as &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; may have emigrated from this country. Particulars of the receipts in each of the above categories in 1964 are given in an article in the March 1965 issue of the Irish Statistical Bulletin.  Corresponding data for 1965 are not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of money involved in loans cancelled by the Agricultural Credit Corporation on the ground that they were not taken up within three months since 15th July, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money involved in offers of loans cancelled by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, on the ground that they were not taken up within three months, since 15th July, 1965, is approximately £750,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in a reply I gave to a similar question on 28th October, in order to ensure that available capital is conserved for productive purposes, it was found necessary to cancel loan offers for unproductive purposes, that is, funding of debt, land purchase and <Col N="943" /> purchase of motor cars, where the offers had not been taken up within the time stipulated by the Corporation. Loans issued by the Corporation for funding of debt and land purchase in the financial year 1964-65 totalled £2.4 million.  Notwithstanding the decision made early in this financial year to approve no further loans for such purposes, the total of loans issued for those purposes from 1st April last up to 31st January last has already exceeded the figure for 1964-65.  It is quite clear, therefore, that if the Corporation had not, at the time it did, restricted future approvals to directly productive purposes, an altogether disproportionate amount of the funds available for the Corporation would have been expended on the relatively unproductive purposes mentioned and the Corporation could, at a time of general scarcity of capital, such as the present, have been charged with operating a policy prejudicial to agricultural development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>There are at present 19 claims awaiting hearing by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  I am not in a position to say whether these claims will be dealt with during the period of office of the present Chairman as this depends on such factors as the frequency with which the board can be convened and the time taken in presenting each case and arriving at a finding.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Chairman is appointed by the Government, on the nomination of the Minister for Finance in agreement with the staff side of the General Council.  The staff side will accordingly be consulted in advance of the expiry of the present Chairman's term of office.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice of the Arbitration Board to deal with staff claims in the order of receipt and the official side's counterstatements are also issued in this order.  Normally a number of statements of case and counterstatements are awaiting the Board's attention. This is the situation in regard to two claims at the moment; the seventeen remaining claims will similarly be dealt with in good time to enable the board to hear them when it is ready to do so.  The issue at this stage of counterstatements in cases far down on the list would not hasten the hearing of pending cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> Given the board's practice as to the order of hearings which has been agreed between the official and staff sides, I do not accept that there are justifiable grounds for dissatisfaction, particularly when regard is had to the unprecedented number of cases submitted for arbitration over the past two years and the length of time taken in the presentation of certain claims before the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number of fatal accidents on the roads during 1965; and what action he intends to take to put an end to slaughter on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisional figures now available show that in the year 1965 there were 344 fatal road accidents resulting in the deaths of 349 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, it is my intention to maintain a sustained drive on all fronts.  Legislation is being drafted to deal with such problems as that of drink and driving.  The programme of road improvement and maintenance carried out by the road authorities with the aid of grants from the Road Fund has a high road safety content and this aspect of their work will get special attention.  An Foras Forbartha has been requested to undertake a programme of research into road safety and has <Col N="951" /> initiated work on it.  As to the education of the public, the Deputy is no doubt aware of the many intensive road safety campaigns which I have conducted in recent years.  These will be continued, and I shall continue to enlist the support of voluntary bodies such as the Safety First Association of Ireland who are doing such excellent work in the field of road safety education. In this connection I might say that the pilot road safety officer service established by the association at my request in 1963 was recently extended and gives promise of achieving worthwhile results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the work that has been done up to the present but it does not seem to be having the desired effect.  Would the Minister consider introducing a speed limit on all roads, such as has been introduced in Britain recently, I think?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it would be to the benefit of increased safety on the road if there were more signs to ensure safety?  It seems to me that the expenditure is largely on removing corners and straightening roads, whereas if there were even distribution of signs to ensure safety, there might not be so many accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last supplementary question first, I think the Deputy will be aware that a great deal of road signposting has been done over recent years and is continuing.  I admit that its application may not be uniform throughout the country.  The general overall picture is that a complete signposting, incorporating safety and direction signs, is in hands and is progressing fairly well.  We do hope that in the not too distant future it will be completed to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Unremitting effort is made to dispose of lands on hands of the Land Commission as rapidly as possible and there are standing instructions to the effect that acquired lands be put into the possession of the approved allottees as quickly as possible. Where delay occurs, there are invariably justifiable and compelling reasons for it.  Dealing with this matter in the Seanad on the Committee Stage of the Land Bill 1963 (Vol. 58, Cols. 437 and 438), I had this to say:</P>
      <P>Senators from rural areas will no doubt be aware of the meticulous examination that must take place for the preparation of a scheme for division.  Indeed, Senators and Deputies would be the first to complain if all the people within the mile limit are not interviewed and their full circumstances taken into consideration before the scheme is prepared.  That takes time and in some counties, when there is a lot of land to be dealt with, the staff have to do the best they can with the work that is there before them.</P>
      <P>As I have said, in the general run of cases, the position now is that within two years schemes are prepared and the land is divided.  I make a special exception of the cases of land where migrants are involved because in these cases there are often improvement works that take a considerable time.</P>
      <P>At 31st March last the Land Commission had in their possession, apart from substantial areas of turbary and inferior quality land, some 59,000 acres of arable land.  That such an acreage, however, is not unreasonable can be gauged from the fact that the average annual allotment, involving all classes of land, during the past five years was upwards of 36,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like having lands in the <Col N="957" /> possession of the Land Commission for an inordinate time and my fixed ambition is to get the period down to 2 years: in pursuance of that objective I have arranged for the recruitment of extra inspectors and I expect some of them to be on duty during the present spring.</P>

      <P>I have received the representations referred to.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain that the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes are a separate and comprehensive code of superannuation catering for the conditions peculiar to military service, and the principles on which they are based are not similar to those of other superannuation codes.</P>
      <P>As regards the particular aspect raised by the Deputies, evidently the original scheme of 1937 took the line that married officers, who might be living in married quarters in barracks or living in private houses at places other than where they intended to settle on retirement, should be paid a retirement gratuity to assist them in setting up home afresh.  A single officer would not be likely to have as great a problem in this respect and hence no gratuity was provided for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many retiring single officers are completely dependent on the pension they receive as they are unable to make provision for their retirement out of the relatively small pay they get compared to the pay of married officers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <P>The number of persons in receipt of special allowances at the 31st December, 1965, was 8,546 and the expenditure from the 1st April, 1965, to the 31st December, 1965, was £521,121.</P>
    <P>During the period from the 1st April, 1956 to the 31st December, 1965, inclusive, <Col N="961" /> clusive, 8,620 new special allowances were awarded.  The difference between that figure and the net increase during the period is attributable mainly to deaths.</P>

      <P>The CIO in its reports made it clear that the examination of Irish industry which it initiated in the EEC context would be relevant to conditions of freer trade generally. In the context of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> a continuous review of industrial progress is carried out by the Department of Finance and my Department in consulation with both sides of industry. The results of this review for 1964 were summarised in the NIEC Report on Review of Industrial Progress 1964 and I understand that a similar report for 1965 will be issued shortly by the NIEC.  I think this system of review fulfils the purpose of re-examining Irish industry which the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision in regard to this matter is made in the Dogs Act, 1906, the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, and in Orders made thereunder.  As I have recently announced, it is my intention, with a view to strengthening the enforcement of the existing legislation, to make a further Order providing for the compulsory wearing by dogs in highways or public places of identification collars bearing the names and addresses of their owners.</P>
      <P>The Diseases of Animals Bill, which is at present before the Seanad, makes further provision for dealing with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that dogs are free to roam the countryside.  If he reads the papers, he can see that thousands of sheep worth tens of thousands of pounds are being attacked by dogs.  This is a huge loss to the small farmers.  Does he realise that on 25th May, 1965, he promised that legislation would be introduced before the lambing season? The lambing season is now half through.  The Minister might as well tie the tail of my coat on a dog as put a collar on a dog.  They should be earmarked. In the farming journal last week, it was stated that sheep are being slaughtered in their hundreds and no protection is being given to the unfortunate owners.  You promised on 25th May that legislation would be introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fair amount of legislation there already. The difficulty is effectively to enforce it.  The Dogs (Protection of Livestock) <Col N="963" /> Act, 1960, provides in regard to dogs worrying sheep that fines may be imposed on the owner or the person in charge of a dog.  If there is no person in charge the dog may be seized and detained by the Gardaí and destroyed if it is not claimed within seven days. It is also a good defence to an action for damages for shooting a dog if it is proved that the dog was shot while it was worrying livestock.  Those provisions are all there under existing legislation.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I can improve the position somewhat at this stage by making this order that a dog which is in a public place or highway will have to have an identification tag.  This will be a help to owners in certain circumstances to recover damages from the owner of a marauding dog.  Unfortunately, under existing legislation any such order must be confined to a highway or a public place.  This is not really getting us very far, so in the Diseases of Animals Bill to which I was referring when I gave that reply last May, we are providing that it will now be possible for me to make orders which will be more effective.  That legislation has gone through this House and is now on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  It is proceeding through the Oireachtas as quickly as I can put it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the question of protection, would the Miniister consider earmarking a certain portion of the dog licence in order to provide a fund to compensate farmers whose sheep are destroyed or injured?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will consider that suggestion, although I doubt if any such fund would be adequate. I really think that the ultimate solution to this problem is for the herd owners to be given the greatest possible legal power to protect their flocks, and secondly, to try to assist them so far as we can to secure legal compensation if their flocks are injured or destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="964" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right where the animals can be identified but I am familiar with a recent case in which considerable damage was done and considerable losses were involved.  If there were such a compensation fund, something might be available for the owner whose sheep were injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also another provision whereby the local authorities are able to make orders completely controlling the movement, if you like, of dogs during the hours of darkness, but I do not think that any local authority have so far been willing to exercise their powers under that particular statutory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this menace has become so serious that many farmers in the Dublin region have decided to get out of sheep altogether, and in view of the fact that legislation has obviously failed to overcome this, would the Minister take a more serious look at this than just insisting on collars being provided?  I do not think that is the solution either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a further step.  There is a provision in the 1960 Act under which farmers are given very wide powers to protect their flocks by shooting a dog or seizing it if it is worrying their sheep.  Of course the big difficulty about that is that this damage usually occurs at nighttime and it is obviously impossible for farmers to mount an all-night watch over their flocks.  This is a very difficult problem and I know it is a very serious worry to a great number of sheep farmers.  These are some of the steps which we are taking to try to improve the position of the sheep farmers, and if any others occur to us we will not hesitate to take them too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that until the dogs can be definitely identified it will not be possible to put an end to this menace. Would the Minister not introduce legislation providing that dogs must be eartagged or ear-tattooed?  A dog's collar can be taken off and I do not think we will be able to get the owners that way.</P>

    <P>Records of export subsidies are kept on the basis of financial years only.  In the case of butter the figures relate to sales on the export market and not to quantities actually exported in the particular financial year.  In the case of other products the figures include unpaid balances of subsidy on exports in earlier years.  The 1964/65 figures for non-butter products relate to subsidy payments on account only and are subject to finalisation.</P>
    <P>No subsidy has been paid in respect of exports of milk or condensed milk.</P>
    <P>Of the total subsidies set out £17,507,948 has been paid by the Exchequer and the balance from the proceeds of levies on creamery butter and milk.</P>
    <P>In addition a milk production allowance of Id. per gallon from 1st June, 1962 to 30th April, 1963, of 2d. per gallon from 1st May, 1963 to 30th April, 1964, and of 4d. per gallon from 1st May, 1964 to date has been paid from the Exchequer to creameries on all milk received for processing.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they consider that the existing arrangements are adequate.</P>
      <P>There is only one traffic point permanently manned and the pointsman there, who wears white sleevelets and white gloves, is easily discernible from all directions.</P>
      <P>Gardaí on ordinary beat duty do occasional point duty at 11 places at peak traffic hours and, during the winter months, they wear white sleevelets and white gloves; one of them, because of difficulties of visibility at his particular point, wears a white coat.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) the number of hit-and-run accidents in the past 12 <Col N="970" /> months, (b) the number of deaths resulting from such accidents, (c) the number of such accidents in respect of which prosecutions took place, and (d) the number in respect of which the offenders have not been apprehended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of hit-and-run accidents known to the Garda in the twelve-month period ended 31st December, 1965, was 719.  The number of deaths resulting from such accidents was seven.  Proceedings were instituted or are pending in 490 cases, including all seven cases where death was caused.  In seven other cases proceedings could not be instituted because the persons concerned were resident outside the jurisdiction.  The offenders have not been traced in the remaining 222 cases.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in reply to a similar question on 25th May last, although precise figures are not available, it may be taken that the great majority of these accidents were ones in which nobody was injured.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House recently, I have been, and am still, endeavouring to interest suitable organisations in establishing a special home in the south east region for the mentally handicapped.  Negotiations are still in progress which, I hope, will result in one or two institutions becoming available in that area.  These institutions would, I expect, cater for the South Tipperary and West Waterford areas which the Deputy has in mind, although, as a rule, residential institutions are not tied to a particular area or region.</P>

      <P>In addition to maintenance and clothing allowances, health authorities pay school fees for those boarded-out children who, on completion of their primary school education, continue in secondary or vocational schools.

What I have in mind is that, while retaining their distinctive character, the two types of school should pool their resources so that the special facilities of each school will be available to all pupils in the area, thus providing from the combined resources of the schools the post-primary education best suited to the abilities and aptitudes of all the pupils.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The incentive bonus is confined to the scheme governing the award of the Gaeltacht scholarships and is payable in respect of the first 90 girls and 60 boys who <Col N="979" /> pass the examination for these scholarships whether they secure scholarships. The island scholarships are open to pupils from all the islands whether they be in the Gaeltacht or Galltacht. I feel that it would be at variance with the spirit and purpose of the original scheme to extend it to non-Gaeltacht areas.  I might mention that the examination for the Gaeltacht island scholarships is the same as that for the Gaeltacht scholarships.  Therefore, there is no reason why a pupil from a Gaeltacht island cannot be entered for both sets of scholarships and thereby have an opportunity of qualifying for the incentive scheme.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The purpose of this amendment is to increase the benefits payable from forty shillings to fifty shillings in respect of injuries benefit.  I think there is quite a lot to be said for it.  It is not my amendment but I would certainly support it.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say against it.  I did not put down the amendment but in this year of 1966, in order to keep up <Col N="983" /> with the increase in the cost of living, I consider the amendment is no more than is reasonably necessary.</P>

That seems to be appropriate since we know no particular reason why the rate payable under this Bill should be different from that in respect of unemployment benefit or the disability benefit.  We are, in fact, proposing the same increase here of 40/-.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Tully is not present because this is his particular amendment.  It is proposed by this amendment that the sum of 13/- for a qualified child be increased to 22/-and amendment No. 47 proposes that the amount of 8/- be increased to 14/6.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the arguments that can be used here are the same as Deputy Fitzpatrick used in respect of the previous amendment. One can argue that the amount proposed by the Minister is thoroughly inadequate for a child and for that reason the 22/- is included in the amendment.  I do not know whether it is correct to link all those payments, particularly for dependants, with the allowances paid in other social welfare fields such as sickness benefit and unemployment <Col N="984" /> benefit.  It has always been the practice to give bigger payments to somebody who is injured on the job, the difference being that when a man became injured in some other place it had nothing to do with his job and when he became unemployed, it was not in any way an accident but was because he did not behave himself or some other reason.</P>
      <P>With regard to industrial injuries, we must recognise that the man must be compensated by reason of the fact that he was working and that he contracted disability or injury in these circumstances and therefore should circumstances.  These allowances are speak, or gifts from a fund that has been subscribed to by the employer or the employee.  This is compensation, compensation to a man who is disabled and who cannot work or who is partially incapacitated.  For that reason, I think the Minister should not link these benefits with sickness benefit.  This is compensation for injury, illness or some disease contracted during the course of his employment. This compensation should be more than is payable for unemployment or sickness.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to join with Deputy Corish and perhaps elaborate somewhat on the argument made by him. When workmen's compensation was last fixed at £4 10s. per week, I would believe that it then exceeded the rate of social welfare benefit payable, and perhaps the Minister could tell us what the rate of social welfare benefit was when workmen's compensation was fixed at that figure?  However, irrespective of what it was, as Deputy Corish has said, this measure we are now putting through is a measure to compensate a workman and his dependants for loss resulting from incapacity to work or from injuries received in the course of employment.  It is not being contributed to in any way by the State. It is something that the employers are paying for in the form of the equivalent of a premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to take the place of workmen's <Col N="985" /> compensation and, if this measure had not been brought in, I believe workmen's compensation would have had to be increased very substantially. It is common case that an increase in workmen's compensation is long overdue.  So far has that case been accepted that the Department of Social Welfare for some time past have been supplementing these benefits and bringing them up to the rate of social welfare.  Therefore, I say an allowance of 13/- in respect of a child qualified for the purpose of this Bill or for each of the two children so qualified for the purpose of this Bill or for each of the two children so qualified is really insufficient.  Certainly a sum of 8/- in respect of the third and each subsequent child is very insufficient.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the relationship of workmen's compensation to social welfare benefits now and when workmen's compensation was last fixed.  If the Minister can tell me that they have kept pace then I concede in advance that there is not as much weight in my argument as there would have been but there is still weight in it because this measure is to compensate workmen for injuries received, to which the State contributes nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed, of course, obviously in the Bill that a bigger payment is appropriate in the case of a person who becomes entitled to occupational injury benefit than the person who becomes entitled to ordinary disability benefit.  In fact, a bigger payment is being provided; that is, in regard to the basic payment for the workman himself.  While I have not got the figure at which the rate of disability benefit stood when the maximum rate of workmen's compensation was last fixed, it is a fact that the rate of injury benefit provided in this Bill is 115/- and the rate of disability benefit is 52/6, so that the rate of injury benefit we are providing here is, in fact, more than twice the rate of disability benefit.  Of course, in addition to that, there is the fact that if, after 26 weeks, the person concerned is still assessed as being 100 per cent disabled, he continues to get the 115/-in <Col N="986" /> the form of disablement benefit.  If, in addition to that, he is also incapable of work, he also gets the maximum rate of disability benefit; so that, in the case of a single man who has 100 per cent disablement benefit and is also unable to work, the rate of payment would be £8 7s. 6d.  We are dealing, in this section, with the increases in this amount in respect of children and there is no question of suggesting that 13/- is sufficient for a child; this is an increase of the benefit in respect of children.  It is quite reasonable that we should have here the same increases in respect of dependants as we have in other social insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>This amendment&mdash;the same as the last one&mdash;is apparently one of a series of amendments submitted by Deputy James Tully with a general view to having the rates in this Bill the same as those in Great Britain.  But, in this case, he has actually gone a little further because his proposal is that there should be an increase of 22/6 paid in respect of each of the first two children and 14/6 in respect of each other child; whereas in the British scheme&mdash;which he was apparently aiming at getting into conformity with&mdash; the 22/6 is payable in respect of the first child only.</P>
      <P>The payments in respect of injury are considerably in excess of the ordinary disability benefit payments and I do not see, then, why there is a case for these very considerably increased payments in respect of children also. Apart from that, of course, the provision for raising money to give such increases has not been made.  The amounts of contribution have been assessed on the basis of providing the rates of benefit envisaged in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But I still do not believe that the actuarial report would show what the Minister seems to suggest it would show, because of the fact that the incidence of industrial employment in Northern Ireland, as the Minister is aware, is very much higher than it is here where we are not so industrialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that the cost of medical care is being provided under this Bill and also the cost of paying disability benefit&mdash;in addition to disablement benefit&mdash;where the person is unable to work.  That makes necessary the higher rates of contribution in our scheme plus, of course, the fact that we have a different economic structure here.</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputy James Tully&mdash;as he knows himself and as he admitted the last day&mdash;is not quite consistent in trying to have the rates here brought into line with those in Great Britain because in the few cases, I admit, in which the rates are actually greater in our Bill, he should propose that they be reduced to the rates in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means by saying the industrial position here is different.  The industrialisation on this side of the Border is such that it does not warrant as high an accident rate as in the North.  As far as the question of reducing the amounts is concerned, there could be no suggestion that this be done because the Minister is asking the employer here to pay more than is being paid in Northern Ireland for a lesser amount, except in one or two cases and then he points out the amount is greater.  While there is an automatic adjustment in Northern Ireland with Great Britain, apparently something extraordinary happened here because the Minister admitted that the minority report recommended parity with Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  He says that the Government here propose to scale the amount since the report was made.  Northern Ireland and Great Britain did the same thing <Col N="988" /> but, in between, there seems to have grown up a difference of £1 in some cases.  I do not know how the Minister proposes to justify that, unless he says the cost of living here has not risen to the same extent as in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  However, I shall not labour this point because the Minister's mind seems to be made up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>It is purely a question of mathematics to show that the rates recommended by the minority have, in fact, been adjusted to compensate for the rise in the cost of living here.  As Deputy James Tully says, I have my mind made up.  The whole scheme has been costed on the rates in this Bill and it would not be possible to change the rates of benefit without also increasing the rates of contribution, but Deputy Tully proposes they should be reduced.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;to the appropriate amount of injury benefit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> The object of section 12 seems to be to increase the disability allowance if, as a result of loss of faculty, the beneficiary is incapable of work and likely to remain permanently so incapable. In the case of a beneficiary under 18 years of age, or, being over that age, a married woman other than a married woman living apart from and unable to obtain any financial assistance from her husband, it is proposed to increase the weekly rate by 40/- in the first instance and in the other case by 52/6.  The purpose of my amendment is not to increase it by any specified sum but to increase it to the appropriate rate of injury benefit.  That is, I think, a reasonable approach.  If the person is regarded as totally incapable of work and likely to remain permanently so incapable, then I think he or she should revert to the appropriate injury benefit rate.</P>

      <P>In the type of case that would be likely to arise under section 12, it very probably would be equal to maximum injury benefit or approximate to it.  This provision here is for an addition of 52/6 by way of supplement to disablement benefit so that a person qualifying under this section could receive the full amount of injury benefit plus 52/6.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment were accepted, it appears to me the maximum amount that such a person could receive would be the amount of injury benefit, or, in other words, 115/-.  This amendment would, therefore, in the majority of cases work out to the disadvantage of the worker.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> All I want is fair play.  As I see it, it does not matter whether a man is 20 per cent disabled or 100 per cent; if he is to be regarded as not able to work, he should be treated as 100 per <Col N="990" /> cent disabled and should be compensated accordingly.  That is the case I am trying to make.  I may not have used the best possible draftsmanship.  As is usually done in cases like this, I put down the amendment to draw the attention of the Minister to what I regard as an injustice or an inequity.  The man I am really worried about is the man who may be in receipt of only 23/- a week and still be totally unable to work.  If my mathematics are correct, that man would get 75/6 under this heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely not.  The disablement benefit is compensation for loss of faculty.  Unemployability supplement or disability benefit is compensation for not being able to work. Deputy Fitzpatrick has instanced two different cases.  The man in receipt of 100 per cent disablement benefit would have suffered some severe disability, probably the loss of two feet or two arms, and surely there is every reason for a differential in the amount payable in respect of that disablement as compared with a man who loses, say, one finger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is every reason for a differential in such cases. The likelihood of a person who is only 20 per cent disabled being incapable of work is not so great and the majority of people who would qualify for unemployability supplement would be those assessed as being 100 per cent disabled or very close to it.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what the Minister says.  There is, however, the classic case I quoted last week about the man suffering from asthma.  He was examined by the Minister's officials and found capable of work.  Two hours after he was <Col N="991" /> hardly able to walk.  The Department were asked to examine him at a later hour and they found that he was unfit for work.  But they had already decided on three occasions that he was fit for work.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is making the case that there may be certain circumstances in which someone may be declared only partly unfit or disabled and that person may, at certain times of the day, or perhaps throughout the whole day, be unable to do a full day's work.  While I agree with 90 per cent of what the Minister says, there is just a chance that not all cases may be so clear-cut.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at it to see if he can remedy it?</P>

If the Minister concedes that, then he and his advisers should, as Deputy Tully suggests, have another look at this and try to put in some safety valve to cover these hard luck cases.</P>

      <P>I do not agree he would be suffering hardship as compared with the 100 per cent disabled person because the 100 per cent disabled person would have a very severe degree of disablement as compared with the man suffering from only 20 or 30 per cent disablement.  I think it is reasonable to provide a higher rate of compensation in the former case.  The unemployability supplement is the same for all.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately there was not any other way of dealing with it and in view of the fact that the Minister and his advisers did not think it right to include it, there was no short way of dealing with it.  It proposes a special hardship allowance which operates in Northern Ireland and Britain and again it is a question of introducing parity with Britain.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.  This should stand up on its own whether or not the Minister is pre <Col N="995" /> pared to accept the remainder of the amendments which claim parity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this on Second Stage and I decided that this special hardship allowance which is provided in the British scheme was not appropriate to our conditions and, indeed, that it was not a very satisfactory provision from a number of points of view.  The allowance is in the following terms, a weekly rate of disablement pension of less than 100 per cent is increased by a special hardship allowance if, as a result of the loss of a faculty arising from injury at work, the beneficiary is incapable and likely to remain permanently incapable of following his regular occupation, or incapable of suitable work of an equivalent standard, or if he is continuously unfit for his regular occupation, or equivalent accupation, from the time his injury benefit ends.  It is subject to a certain maximum allowance, with the additional provision that the total of disablement pension and special hardship allowance cannot exceed the maximum weekly rate of pension.</P>
      <P>Obviously there are a lot of very difficult things to be decided there. Within these limits of the rate of allowance is the difference between the standard of remuneration in the beneficiary's regular occupation and that in any suitable occupation which he is able to follow.  In this connection the beneficiary's regular occupation is regarded as including the normal prospects of advancement and the standard is assessed having regard to such prospects of advancement.  There are a lot of theoretical questions to be settled there.  It is quite obvious that such a provision would be the one thing in this Bill that would give rise to interminable disputes and conflict between the claimant and the adjudicating authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature of this is that the sum of the allowance and the pension cannot exceed the maximum rate of pension and this means that it is only those who are disabled at a percentage less than the maximum who can possibly benefit from this and the amount of <Col N="996" /> benefit it would be possible to get under the special hardship allowance would increase according as the percentage of disablement benefit decreased.  Therefore, this proposed amendment could benefit only those who suffer relatively slight disablement.  An objection obviously to it is that persons with limited disability, able to resume employment but suffering from a reduction of earnings, either as related to their pre-accident work or to some theoretical amount calculated in accordance with all the presumptions I have mentioned, would be compensated both for loss of faculty by way of disablement pension, and loss of earnings, while a person severely disabled would be compensated only for the loss of faculty and if he were not able to earn as much as before then he would receive no compensation in respect of loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>Another criticism of the payment of this allowance is that since the amount of the allowance would fall to be reduced if a person's earning capacity should increase at any time following loss of faculty, then the allowance would be a serious disincentive to a person's desire to rehabilitate himself. That, I think, has been the experience in Great Britain.  As I said, the administration of this allowance would be likely to be very costly and to give rise to many disputes which would never be satisfactorily resolved.  The difficulty of determining equitably and in an acceptable way the beneficiary's pre-accident earnings and also his potential post-accident earnings, and to adjust these calculations where necessary by reference to the worker's prospects of advancement and other wage increases appropriate to his employment, would be excessive.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered this question of how to arrive at an equitable determination of earnings under the existing scheme and it seemed to be so great that the majority who were in favour of retaining the existing type of scheme almost felt compelled to recommend a flat rate of benefit.  In this regard I should mention that the rates of disablement pensions proposed are in fact closer to the average weekly rate of earnings in this country than <Col N="997" /> the corresponding rates of disablement benefit in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Another point which I think is relevant is that in addition to disablement benefit, we will pay the maximum rate of disability benefit, or the unemployability supplement, which amounts to the same thing, if a person is unable to work.  Therefore it would not be advisable to introduce this special hardship allowance here.  It would be a disincentive as it has proved to be where it is operating and it is not really necessary in view of the fact that disability benefit is paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill stands or falls by the proposal to include this special section.  The Minister was naive in explaining that the proposal could not give increases to those who were 100 per cent incapacitated and would apply only to those who were less than 100 per cent incapacitated, and in a peculiar kind of way he suggested that those who were 100 per cent incapacitated would have a grievance if somebody else was getting as much or almost as much as they were getting.  Of course, there is no such question in this at all.  This is simply an effort to try to level off the allowance of those who though they may not be 100 per cent incapacitated, are not able to continue their employment, and it will possibly bring in those with whom Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt earlier on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should tell the House&mdash; I am sure he has the information&mdash; what percentage of those in Northern Ireland and Britain who are receiving benefit are also receiving this type of benefit.  This is very significant because in concluding the Minister said the evidence in Britain was that the people were abusing it.  He did not use those words but that is what he meant; there was no incentive to return to work because of this benefit.  I do not think the Minister is correct there.  I think he will find&mdash;I am sure he has the figures before him&mdash;that a very high proportion of those who are drawing benefit in Britain are drawing this special benefit.  The Minister should not attempt to get out of it by saying it would be very costly when he has <Col N="998" /> previously made the case that it would only be a small thing applying to a limited number.  He cannot have it both ways.  Either it will be costly and will affect a large number of people or it will affect only a relatively small number of people and involve only a small amount of money.  The table says:</P>
    <P>Maximum increase under section 15 of weekly rate of disablement pension in cases of special hardship. £2 14s. 0d. or the amount (if any) by which the weekly rate of the pension falls short of £6 15s. 0d., whichever is the less.</P>
    <P>That answers the Minister's argument. I am quite sure that if this was not included in the British or Northern Ireland scheme, the scheme would not be considered the success it is.  In view of the fact that the Minister has admitted that this scheme was recommended by the minority report&mdash;I am interested in the fact that he has quoted only one recommendation from the majority report when it suited&mdash;and the fact that what has been happening in Britain and in Northern Ireland under their scheme has been used, and has been found very useful, in drawing up this scheme, the Minister should take cognisance of that.  If he does, he must admit that without this allowance that scheme would not be the success it is. This is something I am not prepared to withdraw.  Has the Minister got the figures I asked for?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say this: it is expected that the cost of this allowance in Northern Ireland will form 21.7 per cent of the total expenditure when the scheme is in full operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that, taking this 21.7 for Northern Ireland into account, it is still cheaper than what he is offering.  There must be a catch somewhere, if the Minister is charging more and giving <Col N="999" /> less and is not including this special hardship allowance.  There is a big discrepancy somewhere and I would be very interested to know where it is.  It does appear as if somebody is anxious not alone to have the scheme giltedged but to put in a sizeable amount on the side.  There must be, over and above a substantial amount of money which is being budgeted for by the Minister, and I should like to know why this is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully has been told that the principal item of the discrepancy is the cost of medical care which is not provided in Great Britain and Northern Ireland under their industrial injuries legislation but which we are providing here.  In addition to that there is the cost of disability benefit which will be payable in addition to disablement benefit in the case of people who are unfit for work.  That will involve a considerable amount because disability benefit will be 52/6d for the person himself plus the allowances in respect of adult and child dependants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this scheme is carrying hospital benefit and that is why the extra charge is being made.  Is it not correct that the system at present operating will be continued? Is it not a fact that, excluding a few exceptional cases, cases of injury attention in hospital will be dealt with as they are dealt with at the present time?  If that is so&mdash;and that is the information I got from the Minister's Department; they said the reason they were insisting on leaving it that way was that it was the best way to keep a watch on the expenditure&mdash;then the Minister's argument falls flat.</P>

      <P>I have told the Deputy already why it is being excluded.  I do not consider it is appropriate.  It is of no benefit to those who are really severely disabled and its main effect is to act as a disincentive to the workman in his efforts to rehabilitate himself and to take up employment or improve his earning capacity.  Once this is received there is immediately an incentive to retain it.</P>

They can get other benefits and resume work if they are able to do a certain amount of work, but this special allowance would not apply to the man able to resume work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would.  It would apply to the man able to resume work provided the work he got was not as <Col N="1003" /> remunerative as his pre-accident work or whatever his potential earnings in his pre-accident work would be assessed at.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to read the entire amendment, but it makes it clear&mdash;and this amendment, as the Minister is aware, is taken from the legislation on the other side&mdash;that what the Minister has just said is not possible.  It simply boils down to this: the Minister has, in fact, left out a very important section of the legislation which he has been following up to now with the exception of parity in payments&mdash;and he has gone within £1 of that in some cases.  In this case one of the most important sections&mdash;the Minister himself admits it accounts for 21 per cent of the cost in Northern Ireland&mdash;is being left out.  The Minister tried to base his argument on the fact that the charges, because they were covering medical expenses and hospital bills, could not be reduced. He said that was why other things were being left out.  Before this Bill is passed I will try to find out where the catch is, because catch there certainly is in it.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 16, line 29, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but the pension during the first 13 weeks of widowhood shall be £5 12s. 6d.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section reads:</P>
      <P>The widower of the deceased shall be entitled to death benefit if at her death he was being wholly or mainly maintained by her or would, but for the relevant accident, have been so maintained.</P>
      <P>(2) In the case of a widower who was, at the death of the deceased, incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and likely to remain permanently so incapable, death benefit shall be a pension at the weekly rate of ninety-five shillings.</P>
      <P>I wish to insert at that point:</P>
      <P>But the pension during the first 13 weeks of widowhood shall be £5 12s. 6d.</P>
      <P>The section then continues:</P>
      <P>(3)  In the case of any other widower, death benefit shall be a gratuity of two hundred and forty-seven pounds.</P>
      <P>(4)  A pension under this section shall not be payable for any period after the person to whom it is payable ceases to be incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the cases where Deputy Tully has not been very consistent.  For instance, in the previous section if he wanted to seek parity he would have proposed a reduction in the rate of widow's pension because the rate proposed here is 95/-as against 90/- in Great Britain.  The same thing applies here.  The basic rate, if I can call it such, is 95/-, which is higher than the rate in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <Col N="1005" /> Although Deputy Tully is very keen on parity, he does not propose to reduce that to 90/-.  I think, in fact, he got slightly mixed-up here when he proposed that the widower's pension for the first 13 weeks shall be £5 12s. 6d.  This, again, would not be the same as in Northern Ireland because it is the widows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to try to make a case for good-for-nothing husbands but I think this section as it is drafted could work an injustice.  It is provided that the widower of the deceased shall be entitled to death benefit, if at her death he was being wholly or mainly maintained by her or would, but for the relevant accident, have been so maintained. The section goes on to say in subsection (2) that if, at the death of the deceased, the widower was incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and likely to remain permanently so incapable, death benefit shall be a pension at the weekly rate of ninety-five shillings but, in any other case, he shall be entitled to a gratuity of £247.  I am usually not in favour of giving any Department an open cheque but I should be happier about subsection (2) if it read &ldquo;In the case of a widower who was, at the death of the deceased, incapable of self-support...&rdquo; and if we cut out the <Col N="1006" /> words &ldquo;by reason of some physical or mental infirmity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We meet the case very often of a man who has been not a very praise-worthy type of gentleman but we have the case of the man who has been supported by his wife for several years and who, although he may not be either physically or mentally afflicted, has just become a social misfit.  He has just become incapable of work because he has been spoiled, shall we say, by his wife for several years and he would find himself a complete misfit on the labour market.  I do not think such a man would come within subsection (2) of this section.  He would be thrown on the scrap heap where some people, perhaps, harshly, might think he should be thrown.  Nevertheless, I do not think that would be reasonable. He would not be entitled to anything under this section unless to a lump sum of £247.</P>
      <P>I should be prepared to leave the subsection to read: &ldquo;In the case of a widower who was, at the death of the deceased, incapable of self-support...&rdquo; and to leave it to the Department, subject to the appeals which I shall be talking about afterwards, to decide.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know people who have been walking to the office of the Department of Social Welfare for the past 20 years who are neither physically nor mentally afflicted.  They are social misfits.  They cannot get employment.  They get a couple of weeks at Christmas on the relief grant.  If they live the full working <Col N="1007" /> life to 65 or 70 years of age, they will never get work because they are social misfits.  They have no place in the labour market.  Nobody would employ them.  Yet, I do not think any doctor could certify them as either physically or mentally handicapped within the meaning of this subsection. I think there is a place for a pension for such an unfortunate within this section.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick. I am aware that there are such people in existence.  We have all, from time to time, met the fellow who marries and what he wants is a wife who will support him.  We have all met that type of person.  I think it would be wrong if we legislated in this House to provide that not alone should she support him during her life but that, as a result of her support, he would be entitled to a widower's pension. Some Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;and I think Deputy Fitzpatrick, also&mdash;asked that there should be a widower's pension just as there is a widow's pension.  We thought it very amusing to suggest that we should include in this measure a pension for somebody not because he was not able to find work but because he did not want to work and that, because his deceased wife showed an aptitude for providing for the home and was therefore able to keep them in comfort, when she went on to her just reward, he should continue to benefit by what she had provided.  I think that would be wrong.  I think the State would be very wrong to provide for those things.  Such persons would be entitled to certain assistance under a different heading in the code. I do not think we should legislate for that.  Those people have votes, just as everybody else has.  Thank God, there are very few of them in my constituency but, at the risk of annoying <Col N="1008" /> them, I would say I could not see eye to eye with Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument.  If they are in that position, then, if the wife dies, they would have to fend for themselves and the State should not be asked to provide for them.</P>

We know them all over the country.  They are to be found everywhere and, as I say, they become social misfits and dependent.  I think the question here should be dependency.  I will not accept for one moment that I am speaking on behalf of or advocating the case of the malingerer.  If a man is fit for work and will not work, the State has no obligation to him.  I am not suggesting the State should accept any responsibility for him, but I am saying that a man who, because of his mental incapacity&mdash;which does not fall within this section but is bordering on it&mdash; has become dependent on his wife should be entitled to the benefit provided in subsection (2) of this section.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 17, line 6, to delete &ldquo;twenty-four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;forty-eight&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If I read the section correctly, it provides that, in the case of a parent, death benefit shall be a pension at the weekly rate of 24/-.  I do not propose to make any long speech about this but it does appear that, in 1966, 24/-a week is hardly money at all and is certainly a very small pension to give to a parent of a deceased workman. The amount should be at least double that.  In the case of a parent over 70 years of age who was entitled to an old age pension there might be some excuse for curtailing the amount of the pension under this Bill but there is just the bald statement that in the case of a parent, death benefit shall be a pension at the weekly rate of 24/-. Perhaps there is an explanation for it. Perhaps a parent is entitled to some other benefit but if the parent is not entitled to other benefit I say with considerable conviction that I regard 24/- per week as totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most extraordinary provisions.  I am glad that Deputy Fitzpatrick has put down an amendment to the section.  My only regret is that the amount mentioned in the amendment is also an amount which should not be acceptable to thinking people.</P>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A parent of the deceased shall <Col N="1010" /> be entitled to death benefit if, at the deceased's death, he or she was being wholly or mainly maintained by the deceased, or would but for the relevant accident have been so maintained.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a parent, death benefit shall be a pension at the weekly rate of twenty-four shillings.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say if, in fact, some mistake has been made here?  Let me pose this question.  Take the case of a man living with his mother and maintaining her.  He has an income of £10 to £12 per week.  He maintains the household.  The mother has no other income.  The son is killed.  The mother gets a pension of 24/- a week.  Do I read the section correctly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the death of the son the income of £10 to £12 a week disappears and the mother gets 24/- a week for the rest of her life. She is living in a council house the rent of which may be anything up to £3 per week.  Where does the Bill lead to if that is the sort of provision it makes?  Surely, we should be able to do something better than that?  If there were other members of the family supporting the parent, if it were not a case of dependence, there might be something to be said but the words in the section are specific: &ldquo;if he or she was being wholly or mainly maintained.&rdquo; In that case the pension shall be 24/- per week.  That might have been all right when farm workers' wages were 24/- a week, in 1936, but for 1966 the provision is just ludicrous. If a mistake has been made I suggest that the Minister could have a look at it and insert something which would be a great deal nearer the 1966 ideas than the paltry sum for which provision is made here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully knows well that this is not a mistake. I cannot, of course, suggest that 24/-is adequate to maintain anybody but what was proposed by the minority of the commission in relation to this was a pension of 20/- a week.  We have increased <Col N="1011" /> it here to 24/-.  I thought Deputy Tully had made a very thorough examination of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland scheme.  If his examination had been as thorough as it appeared to be, he would know that the rate of pension payable to a parent in Great Britain is actually less than this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty shillings is the rate for one parent and if both parents were supported by the deceased workman the rate is 15/- for each, which would be a maximum of 30/-, whereas here we are providing a rate of 24/-for one parent and if both are entitled, they would both get 24/-.  Obviously, if there were no other support available to the parents concerned, they would have to get some other assistance as well from the State.  I would also point out that this benefit may be payable in addition to a widow's pension.  The total amount in that case in respect of adult dependants would be quite considerable.</P>
      <P>No mistake has been made.  The provision is in line with what is provided in other countries and, in fact, is better than what is provided in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and better than what was recommended by the minority of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation.</P>

      <P>The ambition of this House in putting through this piece of legislation should be to see that injured workmen are reasonably well provided for when they are rendered unable to work as a result of an accident and that dependants of deceased workmen who are killed in the course of their work will not be forced to seek home assistance.  I think that is a reasonable proposition, and that this 24/- a week is ludicrous.  I agree that even my amendment of 48/- a week is not sufficient, but at any rate it brings it up to the maximum rate of old age pension.</P>
      <P>It should not be beyond the capabilities of the Minister and his advisers to draft an amendment to this section which will ensure that a dependent parent is not left hungry.  If the parent is entitled to some other social welfare benefit, let it be a widow's pension or what have you, that could be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I know a case of a widow&mdash;it is an extreme case, admittedly; nevertheless it is a case&mdash;who was deserted by her husband many years ago.  She cannot qualify for a widow's pension because she cannot satisfy the Department that her husband is dead.  She is not as young as she was.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This woman is in Cavan, and she is doing her best to establish the death of her husband.  He was last seen over 20 years ago, I think, and he cannot be found.  That woman has one son and he has a fairly good job, but if her son dies, is she to be presented with the princely sum of 24/- a week under this Bill?  That is what she would get.  She would not get a widow's pension, and she would qualify for 24/- only under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be within the competence of the Minister, who is a full-time official, and his advisers, who are full-time officials, to devise a section that <Col N="1013" /> would ensure that a parent who loses a child who has been supporting him or her, will not be left hungry, and will not be left dependent on 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear sarcastic or offensive, but it should be possible to draft such a section without taking something out of an English Act of Parliament, or a Northern Ireland Act of Parliament.  You could put in all the safeguards you like.  As a matter of fact, that goes without saying because subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>A parent of the deceased shall be entitled to death benefit if, at the deceased's death, he or she was being wholly or mainly maintained by the deceased, or would but for the relevant accident have been so maintained.</P>
    <P>You absolutely must have dependency, and if the Minister is afraid that the unfortunate parent might have too much money if he or she is given a pension of, say, £3 a week, he can always put in subsection (4) of section 16, suitably adapted, providing that a pension under the section shall cease to be payable if the parent becomes capable of self-support through some other means.</P>
    <P>I really think subsection (2) of this section would not stand up to the light of day for five minutes.  The people of the country would be shocked if they realised that a parent who is dependent on a child who is killed in the course of earning his living is to get a pension of only 24/- a week.  I seriously and strongly appeal to the Minister to have another look at this.  I do not know what is involved.  I do not know whether a lot of money or not much money is involved, but whether much or little money is involved, if this section goes through as it is now, it will be a reflection on the Minister, on the Government, and on this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was wondering whether I had gone through the British Acts as closely as he previously thought I had.  I can assure him that if he wants to question me, I shall be only too glad to oblige him at any time.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said we should be able to write in legislation <Col N="1014" /> ourselves without referring to British or Northern Ireland legislation. While we should be able to do that, at the same time in view of the fact that a commission inquired into this question and produced some evidence which resulted in this Bill coming before the House, I feel there is nothing wrong in using their experience.</P>
      <P>It strikes me as rather peculiar that the Minister failed to include in this Bill any reference to special hardship allowances on the ground that the evidence in Britain and Northern Ireland was that they were not working properly and were costing a lot. He was perfectly entitled to do that if that was the evidence he had, which I doubt, but here is a case where he must know that the amount provided in Britain and Northern Ireland is entirely inadequate.  Surely in view of their experience, he should have been able to devise some better means of compensation than this?  If a man who is the breadwinner is killed during the course of his work and leaves a parent, say, his mother, who was entirely dependent on him, even if the rent of the house is £1, £2 or £3 per week, under this Bill the maximum which the State will give by way of compensation is 24/- per week.  Widows' pensions are not payable for 50 different reasons.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is suggesting is that where there is quite a happy family, where the son has a good job, with good wages, and is supporting his mother, and they are buying their own house, if that man is killed at work, all the State will give is 24/-a week, and the mother will be forced to apply for home assistance.</P>

      <P>This concept of compensation for the parents of a workman killed at his work has developed along certain lines.  Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the total amount available for adult dependants was a maximum lump sum of £900 and the most the parents could do was to share in that amount.  A commission sat on this matter of workmen's compensation for a considerable number of years and the minority recommended that there should be a pension of 20/- a week for each of the parents.  I am proposing to provide 24/- a week for each parent and in this matter I did not follow the British scheme.  If I had done so, I would have reduced the amount of 24/- in the event of both parents being qualified as the British have done.  In Britain, it is 20/- a week for one parent and if there are two, it is 15/- a week each.</P>

The majority of the commission recommended that in the case of a deceased married workman, the sum of £50 be paid to each surviving parent or, in the case of one surviving parent, £100.  In a case where the father or mother was wholly or mainly dependent on an unmarried workman, the recommendation was that a sum of £500 be paid to each parent.  This assessment of the liability of the workman to his parents seems to be fairly general.  I am being asked <Col N="1016" /> to adopt a completely different assessment. I should point out that there are other social welfare benefits available also.  If the parents are more than 70 years of age, there is the old age pension.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister now seeks to justify this miserable pension of 24/- a week by referring to the workmen's compensation code which we are replacing.  In some respects, that code has a very parsimonious outlook, a very miserable approach to the necessities of injured workmen and their dependants, but whatever was to be said about the inadequacy of the compensation provided for injured workmen, the lump sum never was adequate to compensate dependants for the loss of the workman.  The reason for that was that the code we are now replacing was a sort of patchwork quilt introduced first in 1934 when, as Deputy James Tully said, an agricultural workman earned about £1 a week.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At the most, 25/- a week.  Nothing has been done since, except on two occasions, to try to increase the benefits under that Act.  The amount was increased <Col N="1017" /> to 37/6 on one occasion and later to £4 10s.  I never thought the lump sum payment under that Act for adult dependants or indeed for juvenile dependants was adequate and in so far as those inadequate payments are replaced by reasonable payments under this Bill, I welcome it but I do not think the Minister believes 24/- a week is a sufficient payment for a dependent parent.  I know the Minister does not think so but what will he do about it?</P>
      <P>It is useless having the Minister standing up here and saying he provides a few shillings better than the minority report of the commission.  The value of money has changed very considerably even since that report was issued.  Any person living in a council house at the lowest possible differential rent in a town will pay about 14/-or 15/- a week rent and if he or she is mainly or wholly dependent on the child who has died, he or she will now be asked to live on 10/- a week.  It does not hold water; it does not bear investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it should be possible to make provision that where the parent is otherwise provided for, the pension should be reduced.  That is provided for in section 20 (1).  This subsection is a slur on any of the good provisions in the Bill.  I do not know of any benefit a parent wholly dependent on a deceased workman can get other than what is commonly known as outdoor relief, home assistance from the county council, and we all have experience of the generosity, speaking sarcastically, with which that fund is administered. One would need to be on the verge of death by starvation to qualify for home assistance from most county councils.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered what an increase to even the inadequate sum of 48/- a week would cost.  I do not know how many totally dependent parents there are but the Minister has actuaries at his disposal to find out.  Many parents could not be said to be wholly dependent or mainly dependent on married workmen.  I think the number of parents wholly and mainly dependent on their employed children must be comparatively few and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this subsection <Col N="1018" /> before Report Stage and tell the House what it would cost, how many people are likely to be involved and how he thinks a parent who was totally dependant on a deceased workman should supplement this 24/- a week.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I never suggested for a moment that 24/- a week is sufficient to maintain anybody. I was quite clear at all times that if there were no other sources of support available to parents in such circumstances, they would have to get some other assistance.  However, I think I did reasonably well in taking into consideration both what is paid elsewhere and what was recommended by both the minority and the majority of the commission.  In this respect I think the majority recommendations are relevant here.  The majority of the commission recommended that a maximum lump sum of £100 be paid in respect of surviving parents of a married workman and that as much as £500 be paid in respect of the parents of an unmarried workman.  That seems to recognise the fact that if a man is married obviously his commitment in respect of his parents would be less than if he was unmarried.  The proportion of his wages that would be available for the support of his parents would be less if he had a wife and possibly a family, to support.</P>

      <P>The total death benefit that would be payable in respect of a married man's adult dependants could be 95/- for his widow plus increases for child dependants and 48/- in respect of his parents.  I think the most I could undertake to do to meet Deputy Fitzpatrick's point would be to consider, between now and the Report Stage, whether I could increase this amount of 24/- in respect of the parents of an unmarried workman.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Minister would do that, it would probably go a long way because the unmarried workman is the person who is most likely to be wholly or <Col N="1019" /> mainly supporting his parents.  There is one last point I should like to make.  I think this is something which is particularly peculiar or dear to the Irish approach to this thing.  Most Irish people, in general, have a high regard for their parents.  They look after them and regard it as a moral obligation, apart altogether from a legal obligation. If we approach this matter from any other aspect, then we do less than justice to the mentality of the Irish workers who, as I say, regard it as a moral obligation, apart altogether from a legal obligation, to look after the welfare of their parents.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to have another look at the case of the parent who is wholly or mainly dependent on the children.  That will usually be the case of the unmarried workman.</P>

      <P>Might I add one small argument?  I know a case of a man who lives with his mother and sister.  The mother has been ill for quite a long time.  The father owned a small shop which had to be sold shortly after his death because they could not run it.  The son is a road ganger and earns slightly over £10 a week.  He supports his mother and sister who keeps house.  The rent is 21/- a week.  Is it suggested, if he was unfortunate enough to be killed&mdash;I hope he will not because he is a good supporter of mine&mdash;that they would be adequately compensated by getting 24/- a week?  What would they do with the 3/- left over?  Would they be expected to live on that 3/- after they had paid the rent because if they could do so, then the Taoiseach should interview them as well as the trade union representatives?</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 18, line 11, to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of this section gives the Minister power to prescribe that certain injuries or diseases shall be deemed to be industrial diseases or injuries coming within the provisions of this Bill.  I object to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because the section goes on to specify certain things which clearly make the disease in question a scheduled disease, as we called it in the old workmen's compensation code. This section is an enabling section which enables the Minister to prescribe an industrial disease for the purposes of the Act.  I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should read &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any great argument necessary. If the disease in question otherwise measures up to the old dermatitis standard we had, the Minister should then be obliged to prescribe it as a disease entitling the workman to the beneficial provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would prefer it.  From the point of view of the House and of the Oireachtas, I think, if we are saying that these are diseases which come within the beneficial provisions of the Act, we should say so; the House should say so and the Oireachtas should say so. Otherwise, there is a tendency in the opposite direction and that is what I am not too happy about.  I am not saying there is anything sinister about <Col N="1023" /> it but there is a tendency in Departments to pass legislation through this House and then hand it over to the Minister to implement or not implement, as he likes, by regulation.  I know perfectly well the Minister intends to make these regulations and I accept his word on that, but this is the House which is enacting legislation and we should only defer things to regulations which cannot conveniently be enacted or decided in this House; in other words, we should preserve as much as we can, for as long as we can, the supremacy of Parliament and the Oireachtas.

I mentioned, in the case of one section already, where the phraseology used was &ldquo;for such cases as regulations so provide&rdquo;, that it had not been decided whether in fact these regulations were necessary to be made at all.  If, in this case, we put in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; it might be argued that all the regulations mentioned were intended to be obligatory.  However, I have no objection in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, this is one of the most important sections of this Bill because it deals with the second type of thing which comes under workmen's compensation, that is, the list of diseases which are scheduled under the Act.  I wonder does the Minister intend to add to the list of prescribed diseases, or has he had an up-to-date list prescribed?  He may remember that last week I mentioned here, on another section, a situation of the man who is using chemicals for, say, controlling weeds and, because of the fact that on the <Col N="1024" /> tin from which the chemical is taken there is a definite notice saying it is not injurious to the skin, could be used freely, very little precaution is taken. Months afterwards the person starts to get dermatitis, or some other skin disease and, in many cases, it is impossible to trace it back to the use of the chemical.</P>
      <P>I have one case in mind where a foreign firm, supplying it through agents here, changed the type of chemical they had been using.  In fact when the chemical being used now was analysed, it was found it did not contain any injurious matter at all.  It subsequently turned out that they had changed it and the previous type of chemical was, in fact, very injurious and had caused dermatitis.  In this case the workmen's compensation under existing legislation failed.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that this sort of thing is adequately covered?  To me it appears that it is covered.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister's reassurance on another matter, that is, the question of the person who has been in receipt of compensation.  The Minister mentioned last week that it was covered in a certain way, that is, in respect of the person who, under existing legislation, is in receipt of compensation, either through an insurance company which goes broke or through a private individual who is not insured, who is carrying his own insurance up to the passing of this Bill and is paying workmen's compensation to an individual who has suffered an injury or some sort of disease and he goes broke. Is there nothing except the ordinary social welfare benefit?  There is no provision being made in this section, as I read it, to cover that type of case.  The person ceases to have any right to workmen's compensation and falls into the ordinary social welfare category. Would the Minister say if my reading of the section is correct, or is there anything he can do to remedy that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question, the Deputy may have no doubt that the cases he has mentioned will be covered.  The existing list will be extended to cover pneumoconiosis <Col N="1025" /> in all mining operations and Weil's disease.  The scope will be enlarged so as to cover dermatitis caused by inhalation, vapour or other external agent capable of irritating the skin, provided that the disease is due to the nature of the workman's employment.</P>

      <P>So long as it is by the nature of his employment.  Deputy James Tully may take it that, generally speaking, we will adhere to the Employment Injuries Convention of 1964.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of an existing recipient of workmen's compensation, where the insurance company concerned, or the employer, is no longer able to pay, the position at the moment is that such a person will only be entitled to the appropriate amount of disability benefit, less the amount of workmen's compensation to which he is entitled.  But from now on, he will be entitled to the full amount of disability benefit.  That is as much as we can reasonably hope for and it is an improvement in the position.  A person who is getting workmen's compensation will get the full amount of disability benefit in addition thereto.  If for some reason or other the amount of workmen's compensation is no longer payable, then he will have to depend on the disability benefit.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to entitle certain workmen to unemployability supplements. One class of workmen are those who:</P>
      <P>(a) are or have been on or after the 1st day of October, 1965, entitled in respect of any injury or disease to weekly payments by way of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and</P>

      <P>I want the Minister, through this amendment, to add another class to paragraph (a) of this section and that is the type of person who has been unsuccessful in a workmen's compensation application, unsuccessful because of some technicality which the Minister has brushed aside in this code.  The phrase &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo; gave rise to endless legal battles, some of which the workman lost and as a result was deprived of workmen's compensation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> In section 25, subsection (4), line 43, there appears to be something which needs alteration.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the foregoing subsections of this section, the weekly earnings of a person from insurable (occupational injuries) employment at the time of the relevant accident shall be the rate of his remuneration at that time for a full normal working week in the employment in which the accident occurred, overtime being disregarded for this purpose, or, if he was not employed full time in that employment at the time of the relevant accident, the rate of remuneration which would be provided by his employer for a full normal working week in that employment overtime being disregarded.</P>
    <P>I suggest that after the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; we should insert &ldquo;including bonus earnings&rdquo;.  The Minister is aware that quite a number of people in employment at present are in receipt of wages plus bonus earnings.  If we take this as it is written at present, it could happen that somebody whose basic wage was £10 a week and who could be getting bonus earnings of perhaps £5 a week, would have his benefit based on the £10 and the £5 might be completely disregarded.  The Minister should include bonus earnings in this.</P>

The interpretation of that term for the purposes of that section has been taken to include not only payments made specifically for services rendered but also payments, such as bonuses, which form a regular feature of the employment <Col N="1030" /> and which the worker may reasonably expect to receive.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should facilitate the provision of Tenant Purchase Schemes for Corporation tenants in Dublin, Cork and other municipalities, by providing the same subsidy facilities as are available to rural local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple, straightforward motion.  It is self-explanatory.  It seeks for tenants in corporation areas the same facilities as have been available to tenants of houses in rural areas since the Act of 1936.  Under that Act local authorities were empowered to provide purchase schemes.  If my memory serves me correctly, they were obliged, in fact, to provide these purchase schemes within a certain period. It was a matter, in the first instance, of, I think, six months from the appointed day; six months was the time given for bringing in a scheme to enable tenants, if they so desired, to purchase their own houses.  I am not quite sure what the time limit is now but I know that a scheme is normally introduced within a period of 12 to 18 months.  This legislation was extremely popular with the tenants of local authority houses and we have proof of that in the large number of such houses purchased in recent years. In my own local authority, we have between 5,000 and 6,000 houses.  More than 75 per cent are vested.  If we could proceed faster with repairs, we would have close on 100 per cent vested.  If that pattern is repeated <Col N="1031" /> throughout the country, there can be little doubt left in anybody's mind that this is an acceptable and popular scheme from the point of view of tenants.</P>
    <P>The importance of ownership cannot, I think, be over-estimated.  Whereever houses have been vested, it is quite apparent that a new interest is being taken in property.  Small repairs are attended to at the right time.  Windows and doors are painted before deterioration sets in.  Indeed, greater deterioration is only too often evident when it is the local authority that is responsible; long periods elapse between one repair and another, and between one painting and the next. The tenants who become owners of their own houses willingly accept responsibility and pride of ownership is demonstrated in many ways.  Ownership gives them roots and they become interested not only in their houses but in the area in which the houses are built.  They become part of a community.  We all know the kind of development that takes place.  We have residents' associations and all manner of evidence of a community spirit. That is very desirable.  It is something we should foster.  We have the evidence to show that this scheme works extremely well.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly how the finances of these schemes were worked out, but I know the total liability amounted to about half the rent plus the rates.  That was a decided advantage. There was, of course, the disadvantage that some difficulty might arise or incomes might drop for one reason or another but the payments had, of course, to be continued.  That is not a disadvantage where differential rents are concerned.  However, these disadvantages have, as I know, been overcome.  It is felt that there can be a certain amount of deterioration in these houses if some of the tenants have no proper sense of responsibility and allow the houses to deteriorate, irrespective of whether or not they own them.  However, that attitude is quite uncommon and we have very little to fear from that sort of difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> I can never understand why there is this sort of discrimination between the workingclass people in rural Ireland and the workingclass people in corporation areas.  I have never heard it explained.  I have never been able to understand what the resistance was to such a scheme, why it was provided for one type of worker and denied to the other type of worker.  Is it a question of cost?  If it is, perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us what sort of cost is involved.  Or is it a fear that perhaps a number of these houses might pass into the ownership of people who would not normally qualify for a local authority house?</P>
    <P>This purchase scheme has been in existence in the rural parts of the country since 1936 and the amount of undesirable traffic in this connection has been very limited indeed.  The local authorities retain the power to decide to whom the house is to be sold until the end of the purchase period.  If we start a scheme now for the corporation areas, it will probably be based on 50 years' purchase and by that time I hope the housing problem will be solved or certainly fairly well on its way to being solved.</P>
    <P>There will always be a housing problem but I do not think that at any time there will be any great rush on the part of people who are fairly well off to go into a workingclass area and buy a house there.  These houses are normally provided in schemes, and the person who is anxious to get into the middle of a workingclass scheme, although he is fairly well off is an unusual person.  Normally such a person would like his house in a different area.  There is very little evidence that any undesirable traffic would take place as a result of a decision to provide such a vesting scheme.</P>
    <P>All the evidence points to a demand for such a scheme.  For quite some time past I have been regularly confronted with this question: &ldquo;Why can we not have a purchase scheme?&rdquo; In Dublin Corporation areas, there is quite a lot of unrest and dissatisfaction about the proposition to raise rents.  These people who went into corporation houses some years ago and who have <Col N="1033" /> ever since paid the economic rent feel that the corporation have no right to decide to raise the rents of such houses when they become vacant.  They say that if it was the economic rent then, it should be the economic rent now and that with all these adjustments in rents that are taking place, they are, at the same time, denied the opportunity of ever becoming the owners of their houses.  They say they have paid the economic rent for years and that that should have paid off quite an amount of the original cost of providing the house, but there is no credit whatever given for that fact.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister why the introduction of such a purchase scheme has always been opposed and why he continues to oppose it.  Is it mainly because of the cost and, if so, would he be good enough to let us know the extent of such cost?  One cannot overestimate the importance of ownership and its effects on society generally and on the preservation of property.  People who have only a rented interest in a house feel they are birds of passage.  They are not particularly concerned about the house and they look to the local authority to do everything for them. There is quite a remarkable change throughout the country with which I am most familiar where houses are purchased.  There is a new sense of responsibility and a new sense of belonging to the area and taking an interest in the property.  I strongly recommend this motion to the Minister, and I look forward to his acceptance of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that this motion be passed in order that the tenants in our urban municipalities be given a chance to become owners of their houses.  There are a variety of reasons why this should be done and, as with every subject, there are arguments against it.  However, we believe that the arguments in favour, the benefits that would result from this tenant-purchase scheme, outweigh the possible disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> One of the advantages of such a scheme is that it would eventually release much capital, some of which could go to the relief of rates in Dublin and other urban municipalities and which could, therefore, allow more houses to be built, more capital expenditure, for the housing of less fortunate members of the population. In our urban centres we have this terrible problem of housing many of our citizens who are not able to do so themselves.  In that connection it is not generally realised that Dublin Corporation, to cite just one of the urban centres with which this motion deals, within the past very few years, have housed not far short of 50 per cent of the total population of Dublin, and indeed they may now have actually reached that figure.  I know of no capital city in the world that has carried out a programme of that magnitude. That is a wonderful achievement, and I am sure that our other cities in Ireland have played their part in housing their less fortunate citizens in the way that Dublin has.  Certainly, the figure must be beyond 40 per cent and may well pass 50 per cent of the total population of Dublin housed in municipal schemes of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>That shows the terrible problem the municipal authorities had to deal with, and the problem is by no means solved. One has only to look around Dublin at present and see the number of vacant lots.  The columns of various newspapers at the moment are full of letters about this problem.  One of the difficulties of dealing with it is that Dublin is mainly an 18th century city and the life of many of these houses has come to an end during our lifetime.  Although Dublin changed very rapidly over the 18th century, it did not change very much in the next 200 years.  Now, in the 20th century, it is in the process of changing very rapidly again.</P>
    <P>That imposes a terrible financial strain on the present-day inhabitants of Dublin and, indeed, on the inhabitants of the whole country.  All taxpayers have to pay part of this burden. I hasten to add at this point that in the long run housing does not cost the State money&mdash;they get it back&mdash;but in <Col N="1035" /> the immediate period during which the sinking fund is working, the taxpayers, whether they pay in the form of rates or in taxation by the central Government, have to bear this burden.  But, in the long run, the money is paid back.  This motion would mean that the people who were benefiting from these houses would be able to pay back for them, purchase them, and release money which could be used for the rehousing of people which, unfortunately, has to go on all the time.</P>
    <P>Another way in which money could be saved to the municipal authority would be in the saving on repairs. When the houses were owned by the individuals who dwelt in them, they themselves would pay for the repairs which now are carried out by the municipal authority.  Deputy Clinton mentioned the value the sense of ownership gives.  That is one of the real reasons why we here put this motion down.  Over the years, since the formation of this State, and even before that in most of Western Europe, it was found that, as you gave people opportunities to have what is often called a stake in the country, they became thereby better citizens.  Their families found they had a more coporate sense because things belonged to them.  They were not just looking at objects and buildings which other people owned. They themselves were the owners of things, and that gave them a pride in their own homes and in their cities.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a subject which has been very much in the public eye recently, that is this question of civics. We in this city think so much of it that Dublin Corporation have maintained civic centres, play centres and so on for young people.  I was at a meeting last night at which a Minister of State attended.  He praised them very warmly and praised the work they did in helping old people.  They used the play centres in the daytime for children, backed up with the family, and used them at night for old people.  There is a project on foot that that should be extended all over Ireland in our efforts to inculcate and broaden the sense of citizenship people have.  That sense has been found to be enormously increased <Col N="1036" /> by ownership.  With all the saving that results from that in decreased vandalism and destruction by &mdash;well, one presumes young people&mdash; ownership of a house and so on help to make our less fortunate citizens conscious that they themselves are equally important in the life of the community in general.</P>
    <P>When this ownership of individual houses took place, the municipality would find that a scheme to encourage and give advice to the new owners on repairs and so on would be something of benefit to all concerned.  Whatever trifling cost there would be in that respect would be more than amply offset by the saving in repairs the local authority would find it necessary to do.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are now pledged to increase many of their rents from 28th of this month.  This is not going to be very well received by a number of the tenants.  A scheme whereby the tenants could buy, where they could find the money, would be something that would show the Government were alive to the interests of all citizens who wished to better themselves.  It should be possible to work out a financial scheme whereby the repayments for the sinking fund would not bear too heavily on the purchaser. Those are details that could not be gone into here, but the rates which the individual tenants could bear are well known.  In conclusion, I would ask that the Minister go into this very carefully and that he be sympathetic to our motion in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, as I see it, is one to which any of us might wish to append our names, not with any great hope that it would be accepted but rather as a pious incantation that it might in some way do us some good and never do us any harm.  For the information of the House, local authorities have ways and means of providing purchase schemes.  Where these ways and means have been pursued by our urban authorities&mdash; the towns availing of them&mdash;quite a substantial number of the houses that are erected come under this heading. It would not back up the case being <Col N="1037" /> made by those who have put down this motion that we should take it that houses are not being sold at all or that they cannot be sold or that the conditions are such that nobody would be interested in them.  A decided interest has been evinced over the years in purchase schemes under the existing regulations and quite a considerable percentage of the houses offered have been taken up by way of purchase.</P>
      <P>It is not true that if we had very attractive purchase facilities by way of continuing subsidy, which we have not now, there would be a big inflow of capital to the local authorities.  That is not so.  It would not be any different from the procedure at the moment of the collection of rents and rates where the tenant is not a purchaser.  So far as the attraction of this is concerned, the home ownership element has been stressed very much.  They are availing of the present schemes to a great degree where they are provided under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard my purpose in housing to be to provide houses, not to dispose of them.  When we come to compare the method of operating purchase schemes in the urban versus the rural areas we find that there is a distinct difference in the circumstances that could, and I am sure does, account for the differentiation and treatment that has been allowed over the years.  In the rural areas, where the subsidy is continued, we are dealing with houses which are in many cases isolated and which certainly, even in groups, are still regarded as pretty well isolated.  If and when a house is vacated by a tenant it need not necessarily be occupied immediately by somebody who is ready and waiting for it, as is so much the case in the cities at present.  In the rural areas, purchase usually follows the provision of a house which almost certainly was specifically provided for a particular family.  That family have roots there.  They have been there for years, they are continuing there and those who come after them are likely to continue there as well.  If they do not, the probability is that if the tenant leaves the cottage it very often is not re-occupied at all.  This will not and does not happen in our built-up areas. <Col N="1038" /> I do not see any danger of that happening in the foreseeable future due to the fact that the demand is far in excess of the number available.</P>
    <P>The other aspect worthy of consideration in regard to urban houses is that where we have, as we have, a backlog of unsatisfied demand which it is the responsibility of the local authority to provide for in built-up areas, it is unwise in my estimation, to offer houses on terms that would be so attractive that scarcely anybody could afford to pass them up whether or not they really wanted their house long-term.  In a market where the value of the house would be far greater than the amount the person would be asked to pay, the incentive would tend to dissipate housing stocks built up over many years at great cost to the taxpayers and ratepayers and, to quite a considerable degree, they would be occupied not by people for whom they were originally intended but by others who would have no right to have such houses at all.  Instead of vacancies coming about by shifts in population&mdash; shifting from one part of the city to another or shifting out of the city to another city&mdash;to meet some of the still unsatisfied demand, by reason of these overall attractive purchase schemes, no such vacancies would ever occur or, if they did, the local authority would have no control whatsoever over who might occupy the house in the future. While this might not make any great difference if we had enough houses to go all round, against the background of the shortage of houses this liquidation of our stocks of houses is something not to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In the Housing Bill which we have got a fair distance through the House so far, there is provision for vesting schemes in the future.  The general terms of these vesting schemes will be by way of regulation.  These regulations can be changed if circumstances are such in the future that we might wish to change them and have good reason to change them.  There is nothing in the new Housing Bill which precludes us from giving all sorts of incentives if at any time we feel it is the proper thing to do.  It should be <Col N="1039" /> borne in mind that in the Bill before the House at the present time there is an overall power to make purchase schemes.  It is a broad power.  It is not defined in any great detail.  The detailed regulations will fall to be made under the power that is proposed in the new Bill.  It does not mean that this same Bill might not be used to make attractive the purchase of houses by tenants in the future if circumstances should change radically to bring about a new situation as against that which obtains at the moment.</P>
    <P>To be even consistent with the Housing Bill we are endeavouring to put through the House at the moment, I cannot see that we should pinpoint the sections dealing with the purchase schemes of the future and detail them in the way acceptance of this motion would do.  Rather should we leave the freedom and the overall power contained in the Bill untampered and untrammelled.</P>
    <P>Good though the intentions under-lying this motion are, I cannot feel disposed to its acceptance here and now.</P>

      <P>I think the position, in fact, is that long before the 1965 Bill there was no need for legislation to permit any Minister to continue a subsidy in respect of urban houses and it would be wrong if any impression were created that the Minister had conceded the need to facilitate urban purchasing by this section of the 1965 Bill.  It was there long before but again and again I have heard here and in Dublin Corporation people asking that there should be amending legislation so as to permit the Minister to continue the subsidy.  He does not need it.  This is purely the personal decision of the Minister and his colleagues in this Government and any other government.</P>
      <P>I must say that I am at a complete loss, as are Deputy Clinton and many other people, as to why it is that the Minister and his predecessors can go so far as to say that it is a desirable thing that people should purchase and own their own homes and then have a complete blind spot that they are unable to burst through and so they say: &ldquo;We agree with you all the way but we will not make it possible to achieve this agreed aim.&rdquo;  This, to me, is not understandable, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister spoke before me because I wanted to hear him justify this persistent refusal of Ministers for Local Government and their advisers to concede the way to make purchase of urban tenanted houses possible.  They concede the desirability in principle but they have not tonight or at any other time, socially, economically or morally, justified this refusal.</P>

He said, if I understood him correctly and I hope I am not improperly paraphrasing him, that it was necessary to keep in Dublin, for instance, this pool of 45,000 housing units of Dublin Corporation because we have what he called a backlog of people looking for houses.  Because we have 10,000 families looking for houses, we need to keep the 45,000 houses that are there: that it would be wrong to dispose of them while there were 10,000 families looking for them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prima facie</i> that seems a reasonable argument but let us examine it.  The average rate of vacancies in that estate of 45,000 dwellings is 250 houses per annum, so that it would take no less than 40 years to answer the needs of the 10,000 families now looking for houses.  That is reducing the Minister's argument to its practical possibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just, as a matter of record, say that in reply to a Parliamentary question, possibly put down by the Deputy, within the last fortnight, the figure given, even for this year, was around 500, not 250 and I would remind the Deputy that it was up to 1,600 not so many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is now confessing that it was 1,600 under his own administration but I am talking about the average.  I did not think the figure the Minister gave me was 500.  My recollection is that it was 250 and I was taking a ten year period and removing the calamitous experience that we had from 1957 to 1960 when the figure rose to 1,600.  I was removing that out of the reckoning and taking the average of 250 which could be regarded in a large estate of this kind as a reasonable rate of vacancies.  But, even if you go to 500&mdash;I will go as far as the Minister is now prepared to concede : I think that was not the figure he gave me in his answer last Thursday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not wrong. I think it was near the 500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to check the record here and the two can be read together.  But, even if you accept <Col N="1042" /> the Minister's figure of 500 as being the average rate, it would still take 20 years to satisfy the demands of the 10,000 families now looking for houses. Are we to understand that there will not be amongst them members of families who will marry and thus increase the demand?  Of course, there will be continuing change.  To suggest that we must keep these 45,000 houses in order to provide for applicants over the next 20 years, without making any provision for the 1,000 per year who will come on to the waiting list in each of these years, is to advance an argument that is clearly unworthy and the kind of thing which, if it is the only justification for refusing house ownership, is unworthy and ought to be scrapped.</P>
      <P>Even taking a 20 year period, we can expect to have another 30,000, even at the rate of 500 vacancies a year, so that you would have to project this into the future.  You will never solve the housing problem if you are going to do it by keeping 45,000 people out of their homes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that while we had a backlog of people awaiting houses it would be wrong to dispose of any of the estate of 45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not&mdash;at least I hope I did not&mdash;indicate that we were not going to build any houses, that the only way we were going to do it was by these vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am not suggesting that.  I am saying that the Minister agreed that we should keep this pool there and that it would to some extent&mdash;put it that way&mdash;solve the need for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Minister spoke of the obligation on housing authorities to provide houses.  He said there was no obligation on them to dispose of them. I think perhaps there should be an obligation on public authorities to dispose of houses.  First of all, we must <Col N="1043" /> accept that whether houses are built by the private sector or the public sector the input will increase.  It is desirable that it should increase.  The purchase of land by public authorities, the servicing of land by public authorities, with the town planning and all the other incidentals relating to houses, including incentives by way of grants, are likely to increase over the years.  I do not think that is any harm.  But the investment of that much more of public energy and public organisation and machinery in housing is surely not an argument for not permitting people in future to own their homes.  If we accept the validity of the Minister's argument it means that as the State increases its grants in housing it should reduce the prospect of ownership.  That, to me, is an undesirable development and contrary to the progress which has been made in any socially or economically advanced country.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution guarantees the right to private property.  It seems to me that ancillary to the right is the duty on the public authorities of this country to ensure that people have an opportunity to exercise that right.  The situation in Dublin&mdash;and in other urban centres I understand it is the same&mdash;is that some 50 per cent of the people will not have the right, until the State continues the subsidy for tenant purchase schemes, to purchase their own homes.  They will not have the opportunity to exercise the fundamental right of private property in respect of their homes.  They may have private property in respect of clothes, food, furniture but may not have the right of private property in the dwelling in which they have been born and in which they lived, in some cases until the end of their days.</P>
    <P>May I direct attention once again in this House to the words of the late Pope John in his most significant and valuable encyclical, <i>Mater et Magistra?</i> He spells out here the principle of the right to private property in words that I should like again to put on the record so that people considering housing problems may come across them and in the hope that they may yet bear fruit in the minds of the Minister and his <Col N="1044" /> advisers.  In his Encyclical at paragraph 113, Pope John said:</P>
    <P>But it is not enough to assert that the right to own private property and the means of production is inherent in human nature.  We must also insist on the extension of this right in practice to all classes of citizens.</P>
    <P>There is a social philosophy which I think must be accepted by all, but apparently it is not acceptable to the Minister for Local Government.  The right to own property is apparently accepted for certain sections of the community, but it will not be accepted by the Minister's <i>fiat</i> for the benefit of the less well off classes of people in Dublin and other urban centres.</P>
    <P>Again in paragraph 115 of his Encyclical Pope John said:</P>
    <P>It will not be difficult for the body politic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That includes the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the adoption of various techniques of proved efficiency, to pursue an economic and social policy which facilitates the widest possible distribution of private property in terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think it is important that we should not the order in which Pope John puts them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of durable consumer goods, houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Houses&rdquo; are second in order of priority.  &ldquo;Houses&rdquo; are immediately after &ldquo;durable consumer goods&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;land, tools and equipment (in the case of craftsmen and owners of family farms), and shares in medium and large business concerns.</P>
    <P>Pope John most correctly added:</P>
    <P>This policy is in fact being pursued with considerable success by several of the socially and economically advanced nations.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but not apparently in urban areas in Ireland, because the Minister for Local Government and his predecessors would not take the social and <Col N="1045" /> economic steps forward which are so morally justifiable and so socially desirable and which, I venture to suggest, will become an economic necessity in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that several urban authorities had introduced schemes for tenant purchase and that if others would only face the problem, they could do likewise and people would avail of them.  That is not strictly accurate.  I was not able to put my hand on the Minister's White Paper on Housing published about 18 months ago or more.  In it he acknowledged that the vast majority of people in rural Ireland did avail of house purchase schemes but that there was a disappointing trend in the urban centres.  I was able to come across one reference to this in volume 191 of the Official Report of 4th July, 1961.  The Minister pointed out that there were purchase schemes available for 16,893 houses in 71 urban areas up to 31st March, 1961, but only 1,640 houses had been sold.</P>
    <P>It may be asked: why would people not buy houses in urban centres?  The answer is perfectly simple.  The real difference between tenant purchase schemes with a continuation of State subsidy and with no State subsidy would be about 15/- to 20/- a week to the tenant purchaser.  Quite clearly a scheme which requires a person to pay an additional 15/- or 20/- is not as attractive as a scheme which could be made available if the Minister were to continue the subsidy.  I cannot see why the State is jibbing at this.  The State will not lose anything by continuing the subsidy for houses until they are bought.  The prospect is that most houses will be bought before the termination of the State subsidy, and there will be a saving to the national and the local purse.</P>
    <P>The accounts of Dublin Corporation, taking one year with another, show that housing expenditure is made up of four items and three of them cancel out very closely with two items of income.  The three items of expenditure I want to mention are capital debt charge, provision for rates on tenanted houses, and administrative <Col N="1046" /> salaries in respect of the management of housing estates.  The income which the corporation earn by way of rents on tenanted houses together with the State subsidy is almost exactly the same as the expenditure under those three heads.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth item of expenditure which is considerable and runs into £¾ million, in round figures.  This is in respect of maintenance of tenanted houses and the contribution, which has to be paid out of the general rates which are paid for by corporation tenants as much as anyone else, is just a little higher than that figure.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that if tenant purchase schemes were to be introduced and maintenance costs were no longer to fall on the rates, the contribution which is at present made by rates to the tune of 6/5d on every £1 valuation would disappear, or would almost disappear but not quite.  A proportion of the corporation estate is made up of flats and it is difficult to devise a scheme for the purchase of flat accommodation.  It is done in London and in other places, but I think it might be undesirable to do it here.  I do not think there would be much demand for the purchase of flats.</P>
    <P>If the State were to maintain the subsidy, the State would not lose anything, so far as we can see.  If purchase schemes were to become operative and acceptable to the tenants, then the rates would be saved the tremendous levy which is now imposed.  The effect of the 6/5d in the £1 valuation on corporation tenants works out on average at 1/- per tenant per week.  In return for that, the tenant gets a not very efficient form of maintenance and decoration.  In Dublin and in other urban centres, this maintenance works out at about £20 per house per year.  That seems to be a very small figure but the maintenance is in respect of the exterior only.  Considering that Dublin Corporation paint the outside of their houses only once every five years, it is a tremendous cost and one need not be a quantity surveyor, an architect or an engineer to know that most <Col N="1047" /> tenants could maintain their houses at very much less than £100 each in every five year period which is now being paid by them and by the general community of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>If we were to reduce this rate, the corporation tenant would have the advantage of £3 in the £1 valuation per year to go towards maintenance costs, and knowing them as I do, I am quite satisfied most of them would be able to keep their houses at that cost in a better condition than the corporation do for seven or eight times as much.  The Minister suggested that there is a tremendous ownership hunger in rural Ireland and that the like does not exist in any urban centre.  We can throw our minds to the outskirts of Dublin, to Finglas, where the county council have a large scheme in which 97 per cent of the tenants have availed of a tenant purchase scheme because the State subsidy was maintained and continued when the tenant purchase scheme came into operation.</P>
    <P>Surrounding this county council scheme there is a two-mile belt of Dublin Corporation dwellings in respect of which the State refuses to maintain the subsidy.  The result is that nobody in that belt owns as much as a room, or a tap, or a light, or a plug.  The workers in that corporation scheme travel to the same type of employment in the same buses as the county council tenants; their children go to the same schools.  Yet in one scheme there is 97 per cent purchase while in the other the tenants are prohibited from doing so.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, in the Kimmage-Larkfield area, there is an active tenant association who have been petitioning the corporation for a number of years to organise a tenant purchase scheme.  They are ready to pay for their houses a price far in excess of the cost of building those houses.  The houses were originally built for £400 or £450 and tenants are willing to pay prices in excess of those figures for houses which have not got the amenities of bathrooms or indoor toilets now available in all housing schemes.  Notwithstanding the willingness <Col N="1048" /> of the tenants, the corporation scheme is tied up.  The reason is quite extraordinary.  It is because the Minister for Local Government will not maintain subsidies for houses in respect of which subsidies are now paid.  In the Kimmage-Larkfield area and in other housing areas begun 30 or 40 years ago, the houses were built without payment of a State subsidy in respect of interest rates and here you have the grossly unjust situation in which tenants of houses in respect of which subsidies were never paid are denied the opportunity of buying out those houses because subsidies are paid on other houses.  This is an extremely unjust attitude and I ask the Minister to use his good offices with Dublin Corporation to ensure that houses in respect of which subsidies have not been paid are released for tenant purchase.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the impression&mdash; perhaps I am being unfair to him&mdash; that tenants' children may succeed to the tenancies of their parents.  I do not know whether the Minister intended to convey that this situation exists in urban areas but I can tell him in respect of Dublin that it certainly does not.  In Dublin, a tenant's children have no right of succession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad there is no mistake about that.  I am aware that in Dublin and in other urban centres, children of a tenant may not succeed to the tenancy.  All kinds of family difficulties arise consequently.  All kinds of hardships are deliberately created by the public authority and all kinds of demands for new houses arise because where an elderly couple &mdash;husband and wife&mdash;live in a house and all their children save one have departed, the parents cannot encourage their children or grandchildren to stay on in the house knowing they will have no right of succession.  The result is an increase in the demand for new houses and an increase in the pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we should take a new look at this problem and try to see the social and family benefits which <Col N="1049" /> would flow from the introduction of a proper tenant purchase system. Years ago, Dublin Corporation introduced a tenant purchase scheme in respect of new houses.  They were houses previously not occupied and were open to tenants who were prepared to pay to change from tenancy to ownership.  That corporation scheme was made available to their own tenants in other houses.  They built about 500 of these houses and of those 300 were taken up by existing corporation tenants though it meant moving out of their existing houses, which they had occupied for years, moving bag, baggage, furniture and families across the city to settle in an area which was strange to them and to get accustomed to new social habits and to send their children to new schools.  Yet 300 of 500 families did that.  I am quite certain a much larger proportion of people would purchase if they could remain in houses of which they had been tenants previously.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Government brought in a United Nations expert to report on the general administration of Dublin Corporation housing.  I have no great faith in experts from abroad: I am a great believer in looking at our own problems and thinking out our own solutions.  The UN expert, Dr. C. F. Abrahams, made recommendations but a lot of them have not been carried out, I am sorry to say.  One of the things he recommended was a tenant purchase scheme for Dublin people. iHe was quite clear that there were administrative, social and economic advantages to be gained from the introduction of a tenant purchase scheme.  He made no reference to State subsidy but this is undoubtedly the blind spot, the only difficulty, the only obstacle in the way of the introduction of a general tenant purchase scheme in Dublin.  The corporation on several occasions resolved to introduce a tenant purchase scheme if the State continued payment of subsidy in respect of tenant purchase houses.</P>
    <P>The debate on this motion has been useful and we hope that what it seeks will be carried out because we feel it has exposed just how slow the Department of Local Government are to provide <Col N="1050" /> the State subsidy in respect of tenant purchase houses.  We think it is futile to refuse to half the people in houses in Dublin the right to exercise the natural right to buy their houses. That is just what we have been doing. Though the Minister in his remarks today indicated he was not disposed to continue payment of the subsidy, I hope there will be a change of heart and that we will have a more humane approach to housing than we have had.</P>
    <P>Where you have 45,000 tenants with a multitude of conflicting human problems, you cannot possibly resolve such problems by the application of rules, regulations or administrative priorities. Administrative priorities may be just but they can from the human point of view be extremely harsh.  It is because of the defect we are creating in Dublin and urban centres where huge impersonal, inhuman monsters of housing estates are going up with little regard for the rights of private property and the bonds that unite families that we of Fine Gael are concerned to see that we have an extension of the right of private property and give a real opportunity to people to live in their own moneyboxes and to hand on to their children something of what they, in their time, have created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the terms of the motion are reasonable and I think that the Minister should not be too dogmatic about the decision which he says he has taken on this matter.  I suggest it would be a good idea if he had another look at it and considered it after he has heard the points made in the debate.  We know that in rural Ireland, for quite some time, since, I think, 1936, this system has been in operation.  The result is that many people who were tenants of local authority houses have become the owners of their own homes.  There was a certain amount of abuse because of the fact that people &mdash; I suppose there is one wise guy in every crowd &mdash;occasionally took advantage of the situation and having purchased their houses, sold them as soon as they possibly could and got out of the way. This sometimes resulted in the houses passing away from the class of people <Col N="1051" /> for whom they were originally erected. While I disagreed with it at the time, there is a certain amount of merit in the section of the Labourers Act, passed last year, which allows the local authorities to recover a portion of the purchase price from tenants of cottages who were selling the cottages without just cause.  They were selling them on a get-rich-quick basis.</P>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister has the fear which he has expressed here tonight that something like that could happen in the municipal areas, he should apply the same arrangements, that is, if somebody wants to sell his house, let him sell it to an approved tenant but some of the purchase price, or whatever market price is involved must be handed over to the local authority.  If this were put into operation, it would remove any danger there might be of tenants trying to get rich at the expense of the general ratepayer. I would not at all accept the contention which the Minister has made that many people would try to take advantage of the situation by selling their houses.  I believe the urban tenant is just as house-proud as the rural tenant and, in many cases, more so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Ryan of the loss on urban houses is an added reason why the permission to purchase with the continuation of the subsidy should be allowed.  One thing which has surprised me is the number of local authorities who are insisting that their tenants should purchase their houses without the benefit of the subsidy.  It seems rather extraordinary that while the Minister says that those authorities should retain possession of the houses because of the fact that that guarantees a supply of houses which can be passed on to tenants, when they become vacant, at the same time his servants, the county managers, have been saying to the same tenants that if they do not purchase in present circumstances, they are going to suffer a very substantial increase in their rents.  The Minister cannot be right both times.  Either the instructions which his Department have given to the managers are that the tenants who purchase under the <Col N="1052" /> present system should be encouraged, and if that is so, his argument here today is not valid, or he does not want the tenants to purchase their houses. He wants to retain in his possession, or in the possession of the local authorities houses which were built by local authorities for renting.  If that is so, then instructions to that effect should be issued to the local authorities.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He appears very anxious to do so according to the statement which he made in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>Every local authority has, I suppose, a record of the number of houses which have changed hands, the number which are surrendered&mdash;the keys have been surrendered by people who leave them&mdash;and the number of sales which have taken place over a period.  I am sure Dublin Corporation, and other corporations referred to here, and all the other local authorities are in the same position.  It would be a pretty sizeable question if a question were put down in this House at Question Time to find out what was happening in those places.  If the question were put down, and the information supplied, I wonder would the evidence be so strong that the number of tenancies changing hands in Dublin is such that the Minister is entitled to make the statement he made here.</P>
    <P>I do not know the conditions in Dublin.  I know the conditions in rural Ireland.  I know the conditions in the towns.  I know there are in very many houses in the towns in Ireland tenants, or the children or the grandchildren of the tenants who were appointed 60 or 70 years ago, and, this, to me, is evidence of the desire of the tenants to remain in the one house, in the same district, and, if they get the opportunity, at a fair price, to own completely their own houses.</P>
    <P>This is the strongest argument that can be made in favour of the motion. It is all right to hold up the bogey of the permission being given to have this carried out and all the tenants in a particular area rushing off to find the first person who will give them a fat price for the house.  I think I have given the answer to that.  The Labourers Act, which is being <Col N="1053" /> amended by the Housing Bill before the House, lays down that the tenant cannot get away with that any longer unless the local authority should choose to let him do so.  If that is so, and it is so, then there is no argument whatever against the continuance in other areas of the regulations which already apply to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know the argument might possibly be made that many of the tenants referred to here can purchase their own houses.  I have been asked to advise various bodies of tenants associations in towns throughout the country on whether or not they should accept terms offered to them.  One finds it awfully hard to advise somebody whose family have been living for 70 years in a house which cost about £70 or £80 to build and who are told by the manager that it is now good for a market value of £450, the whole of which must be paid by the tenant if he wants to become the owner of the house.  While many of us may agree that the price of property has been going up over the years, I do not think many of us can ever attempt to persuade somebody who has been a tenant for as long as I say or whose family have been tenants for 60 or 70 years, paying a rent which was considered a fair rent at the time, to pay, as they are now asked to pay, eight, nine or ten times what it cost to build the house, though in some cases, not one shilling has been spent on that house from the time it was erected, except by the tenant himself.  Yet, they are asked to pay that amount if they want to become owners of their own homes, while, as Deputy Ryan says, the man who lives a hundred yards down the road in a little council cottage, and who maybe has an acre of land attached to it while the urban tenant has nothing except a backyard of maybe a square perch or less, can buy it with the addition of the subsidy which is denied to the urban tenant.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to make a quick decision, as the Minister has, and to give a quick reply: &ldquo;This is the way it will be dealt with and there is no point in discussing it further&rdquo;.  The Minister, who has had experience of <Col N="1054" /> rural Ireland, even if he has not recently&mdash;although he was in the country last year&mdash;should have a check made through the Deputies of his own Party because, without casting any slur whatever on the officals of his Department&mdash;far be it from me to do that&mdash;I will have a bet with anybody that the attitude of officials in the Civil Service and the attitude of public representatives who, as somebody said recently, have to be elected to this House and have to stand before the people of their constituency from time to time to be elected are entirely different.  There is one way of finding out what any group of people really want, that is, by going down and talking to them, talking to them in their own areas and letting them explain what they feel themselves. I am not trying to cast any slur on officials but I am perfectly satisfied that the impression which officials get, looking from Dublin down to rural areas or even out to Ballyfermot from the Custom House or from O'Connell Bridge House&mdash;which is loftier&mdash;is not the same impression as the representative for the area will get if he speaks to those same people.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to consult with the Deputies of his own Party before this debate concludes because I think there is an awful lot in the proposal made by Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not know what attitude the other members of my Party will take on it, but I want to make it clear I am giving my personal view.  From my own experience, it would be a very good idea if we could persuade the Minister and the Government to continue the subsidy in cases where houses such as those are being purchased.  If we did that, we would give them the same right of ownership, at a reasonable cost, as is given to their bretheren in rural Ireland.  It amuses me to hear people talk about the &ldquo;three `Fs' &rdquo; which, apparently, apply to people who own farms but are not supposed to apply to people who own houses only. Apparently there is an idea that there are two different sets of people in the country; those who have land and a house, and those who have a house only.  I should like to see the same <Col N="1055" /> thing applied to the people who own houses only as applies to those who have farms and houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite some time since this motion was put on the Order Paper.  In one particular context, however, it occurs to me to be particularly appropriate at this stage. The country is in rather an economic mess and one of the means being advocated to get us out of that mess is the encouragement of national savings. We have a Government-sponsored committee actively working on schemes to encourage private individuals to increase the store of national savings.  In that context it occurs to me&mdash;striving to introduce some new thought into this debate&mdash;that implementation of this Fine Gael proposal is a very potent means of encouraging private persons of modest means to add to the store of national wealth. Implementation of this proposal would provide them with an incentive to add to their wealth by buying out their houses from local authorities.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister should not take too narrow a view of the proposal but, rather, should consider it in the light of the stand of the Minister for Finance in regard to our national finances.  It is significant that, in the past, it has been the savings of people of modest means which have created the national capital out of which development has been financed.  The sad thing is that nowadays the incentives to save which at one time existed, by reason of the rampant inflation and lack of physical inducements, are no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only would implementation of this proposal provide a very adequate incentive but it would, at the same time, fill the dual purpose of releasing moneys, at present earmarked in a certain manner, for the housing of more of the people who are clamouring for local authority housing.  The previous speaker, Deputy Ryan, made reference to the report of Dr. Abrahams, the United Nations expert, and, listening to Deputy Ryan, I suddenly recalled another report, that of the consultants employed by Deublin Corporation about ten years ago when <Col N="1056" /> I was a member of it.  It was a very controversial report which was never implemented, but one of the most striking features of it was the indictment which the consultants made of the high costs of the maintenance of corporation houses by Dublin Corporation Maintenance Department.  They had made a very close study of them and they proved conclusively, by quoting detailed figures, that to paint a corporation house every three years costs something like three or four times what it should cost.  In the calendar year, I understand the cost of maintaining Dublin Corporation houses amounts to the best part of £1 million and, mind you, they are inadequately maintained and not at all up to the standards which the tenants would wish.  The corporation, I have found, are cutting down more and more on the standard of maintenance.</P>
    <P>There are many yardsticks by which this proposal can be judged, in addition to the points I have mentioned, and perhaps the most important of all, in the context of today's situation, is the effect on the rates.  If the cost of maintenance is as high as I am told it is, any reduction in those costs would relieve the burden of rates.  That is something very much to be desired.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They are.  I move amendment No. 79:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 21, lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;overtime being disregarded&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 25 proposes to limit the benefits payable to injured workmen in order to ensure, as I understand it, that <Col N="1057" /> a workman will not be entitled to receive in compensation a sum greater than that which he was earning per week at the time of the accident.  With that sentiment I entirely agree but, in calculating the pre-accident wage of the workman, the Bill disregards overtime. I fail to understand the reason for that.  At the present time a considerable portion of a workman's pay packet is comprised of overtime.  That is especially so now with the introduction on a fairly widespread scale of the five-day week.  Under the legislation we are now amending, overtime was taken into account in calculating the pre-accident average weekly wage. I fail to see any good reason why it should not be taken into account now, especially in relation to this particular section which says, in effect, to the workman: &ldquo;We are putting a ceiling on the amount of compensation you shall receive and the height of that ceiling is the wage you were earning before the accident&rdquo;.  Surely, when speaking of a wage, we should refer to the effective actual wage, the net amount the man brings home each week.  We could only arrive, I think, at such a wage by including overtime in the calculation of the pre-accident wage.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister express an opinion also on the question as to whether or not he considers it fair that a farm worker, who, as the Minister knows, works for a very low wage, should suffer as a result of this section?  A farm worker has a low weekly rate of wage but he has to milk, or perhaps feed cattle, on Saturday afternoon and also on Sunday morning and Sunday evening. The result is his wage of £8 5. 0. per week becomes nearer £10 when the overtime is counted.  Does the Minister consider it fair that his compensation should be based on a rate of wage of only £8 5. 0. per week?  That is his wage for 50 weeks of the year or, in some cases, for 52 weeks. Consider that particular case.  Apart from those in higher paid employment who work a good deal of evening and weekend overtime&mdash;Sunday is not <Col N="1058" /> worked so much in this country&mdash;that is an aspect upon which I should be glad to hear the Minister express an opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously overtime earnings should not be included.  Inclusion would lead to inequalities in the case of men in similar employment because one man might, by chance, happen to be earning overtime at the time of his accident, while another may not have any overtime at all at the date of the accident but might have earned considerable overtime prior to the accident. It would not be appropriate to include overtime in an attempt to determine earnings.  It would likewise be completely inappropriate to try to assess overtime in assessing what a man could be expected to earn in some particular employment after an accident. I cannot see how that could be done.  With regard to the case Deputy Tully mentioned, in which the actual wage is the same for every week of the year, it should be possible to get over that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am dealing now principally with amendment No. 79, although I know that we are discussing all three amendments together because the principle is the same.  The Minister bases his argument against my amendment mainly on the ground that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to calcualte overtime or to know what a man was earning. In that regard I would suggest to him with the greatest respect that he should have a chat with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who takes overtime into consideration in assessing pay-as-you-earn income tax.  If that can be reasonably ascertained for taxation purposes, we should not have any great difficulty in making the same calculation for the purpose of conferring benefits.</P>
      <P>It is being inconsistent to say that the overtime earned by a workman should be subject to taxation and that he should have income tax on it deducted at source and be sent home with his pay packet minus the tax, while the same workman if he meets with an injury, is to be told when it comes to calculating his wages for the purpose of conferring benefits: &ldquo;Oh, we cannot take your overtime into consideration. That is really not an earning at all.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare should apply a uniform practice here. This section will affect only the lower-paid employees because the higher-paid employees will in any event be entitled to the maximum benefits under the Acts without taking overtime into account.  It is, however, the road worker, the unskilled builder's labourer, or the farm worker and other workers of that type in the lower income group who might have to call on their overtime in order to qualify for the maximum benefits under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year of 1966, employers have become accustomed to keeping records <Col N="1060" /> of one sort of another.  They have to keep records under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, which we are now replacing, to produce to the insurance companies; they have to keep records and make returns to the inspector of taxes under the PAYE income tax code and they also have to keep records for their own income tax returns.  Therefore, whatever other argument the Minister may put up for the purpose of rejecting this amendment, he cannot put up the impossibility or even the difficulty of determining overtime.  That can be calculated. If that argument is shot down, there is really no argument left to the Minister because surely overtime is a part of a working man's earnings.  As I said before, this does not really affect the highly skilled or well paid tradesman. It does affect the lower-paid categories of workmen who will be deprived of considerable benefits under this Bill if they are not entitled to take into account their overtime which is just as hard earned as any other part of their wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are being quite consistent in this.  We are not taking overtime into account, on the one hand, and on the other hand, we are not taking short-time into account either.  We are providing that the rate of remuneration to be taken into account will be the rate for a full normal working week, even if the person concerned was not in fact working for the full week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that specifically spelled out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, in subsection (4). In fact, amendment No. 79 applies only where a person was being remunerated otherwise than at a weekly rate.  That is what paragraph (a) provides.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>where a person was being remunerated otherwise than at a weekly rate, the weekly earnings of such person from insurable (occupational injuries) employment at the time of the relevant accident shall be the rate of remuneration which he would earn for a full normal working week <Col N="1061" /> in that employment, overtime being disregarded.</P>
    <P>I was not arguing that it would be impossible but that it would not be justifiable to take overtime into account, in view of the fact that purely by chance one man might be earning overtime and another might not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume from what the Minister has said that in the assessment of the benefit here, it is only the normal 42-hour, weekly wage which will be taken into account.  Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems rather unfair because every time employers or Government Ministers talk about workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> their incomes, they always talk about &ldquo;the take-home packet&rdquo;.  They never talk about the earnings for the normal week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, An overtime bonus is taken into account for the purpose of assessing income tax and as far as qualifications for a medical card are concerned, no worker's eligibility is judged merely on his weekly earnings for a normal working week during normal hours.  He is assessed on everything he gets during the week by way of overtime or otherwise. In respect of some employments, not a great deal of them, the weekly wage is more or less a retainer and a substantial amount of the earnings consists of overtime because it is necessary not for the workers but for the employer, that a certain amount of overtime should be worked.  It is unfair, particularly in view of the fact that for means tests and the like carried out by the Government and local authorities, all the weekly earnings are taken into account and not just the standard weekly wage for a set number of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose for which overtime is taken into account are, generally speaking, assessments which are made periodically.  For <Col N="1062" /> instance, for income tax purposes, it is the actual rate of pay at the particular time.  This is an assessment which is to be a continuing thing and it is only right that all workers in similar employment should be similarly treated. The only way to do that is to take the normal remuneration for a full week as the basis for deciding the amount of benefit payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other snag is the one I raised previously with the Minister.  He expressed the opinion that no official of his Department would read it in the way I am suggesting it could be read.  I should like to know if the Minister can go a little further with it.  I am referring to the man who is employed as a farm worker on a 50-hour, 5½ day week.  If he is milking cows, he must do so on a Saturday afternoon, which is his halfday, and on Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon.  The farmer employs him at the basic rate of £8. 5s. 0d. per week, but, as far as the farmer and the employee are concerned, the rate is £10 which the farmer gives him for the extra hours he works. The farmer must keep within the law and, therefore, he must assure himself that he is paying the correct rate of overtime but as far as the farmer and the worker are concerned, the rate of wages is £10.  If the worker meets with an injury in his employment, the rate at which compensation would be assessed according to this section, is the rate he would get for working the normal number of hours.  I think the Minister agrees with me that would be an unfair way to assess it.  Is there any way in which the Minister can ensure that in such a case the person can be paid compensation assessed at the actual rate he is getting rather than on the rate for his normal hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is clear that he is being paid overtime, overtime will not be taken into account.  It would be advisable to have something in writing in the type of case to which Deputy Tully refers.  If it is clearly in writing that this is the wage, that will be the figure used in assessing compensation.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister agree with me on this?  Under the Wages Board Acts, the basic week for a farm worker for eight months of the year is normally 50 hours.  If the farm worker has to work four hours on Saturday and four hours on Sunday for which he will receive an extra 35/-, will the Minister agree with me that if 58 hours is his normal week, it would be a correct interpretation to assess his compensation on the remuneration he gets for 58 hours rather than 50 hours?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was interested to hear the Minister saying that, in his opinion, workmen in receipt of the same basic wage should be paid the same compensation, irrespective of the amount of overtime they do.  I spoke of the difference between the Minister's approach to this matter of overtime and the approach of the Minister for Finance. Here we see yet another divergence of opinion between two Ministers.  Surely in this day and age we should encourage production, and the Government in various debates here have appealed for greater production.  If we are to <Col N="1064" /> disregard overtime in calculating the compensation the workmen receive under this Act, I say we are, to a considerable degree, discouraging a workman from doing overtime, because he will not get any benefit from it if he meets with an injury or contracts an industrial disease.</P>
      <P>That is running contrary to national policy and national necessity.  I may be told that it is only a token discouragement to workmen to do overtime but even a token discouragement should not be enacted in this House. We should do everything we can, within reason to encourage workmen and employers between them to produce more, because, as we are told, until we produce more, the economy cannot be righted.  I put that proposition to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

He should also appreciate that I must have a basis on which to assess what would be the remuneration for a full, normal working week in respect of a person who is working less than a full, normal working week, and it is reasonable to use the same definition both for the man on overtime and the man on short time.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This section gives me an opportunity to mention two amendments which I did not move because they took me by surprise and I said I would put them down again on the Report stage.  This section imposes a ceiling on the amount of benefit or compensation which may be paid to workmen under the Bill. It provides, rightly, as I have said before, that it shall not exceed his wages, but in subsection (3) of this section I find an extraordinary figure. It is stated that a person under the age of 18 shall not be paid compensation at a figure below 15/6d a week.  Is it accepted as a proposition that anybody in this country is being paid a wage of 15/6d per week?  If it is, it is a retrograde approach and brings me back to the old Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 in which there is reference to 75 per cent of the weekly wages down to a certain figure, below 16/-.</P>
      <P>The sum of 16/- was mentioned as a possible or probable wage in 1934. Here in this subsection we have 15/6 being countenanced as a wage for a young person in 1966 and 23/- as a possible wage for an adult in the same year of grace.  That is altogether out of keeping with modern thinking.  I had proposed to put down 40/- for 15/6 and 60/- for 23/-.  The writing into the Bill of antiquated figures like that is a mistake.  If anybody is being paid 15/6 for a normal week on a full-time basis, even if under 17 years of age, it is time something were done about it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is bad enough, but there may be something to be said for apprentices. However, the measure as it stands is not confined to apprentices.  In any other case, you must pre-suppose the person is over 18 years of age.  Something more should be written into this section to show that it applies only to apprentices.</P>

With regard to anybody whose rate of earning <Col N="1066" /> would be 23/-, there is no question of suggesting he is existing on the 23/-. The idea is that these minimum payments should correspond to the minimum disablement payments under section 9, where loss of faculty is assessed at 20 per cent.  The aim is to ensure that this will not in any case be lower than that.  The only people you can reasonably imagine concerned would be apprentices, some of whom, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, may not be receiving any remuneration at all. The intention is to provide that, even in cases such as that, they will get some benefit and that it cannot be less than the minimum amount of disablement benefit when the loss of faculty is 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>This is the section the terms of which the Minister and I were discussing earlier this evening when the Minister gave as his reason for certain charges that the payment of the cost of medical care was included.  I just want to clear my mind on this in case I am mistaken. Is it not true that, if a person is injured, is drawing benefit under this Bill and is entitled to medical treatment under the existing Health Acts or any future Health Acts, that treatment will be paid for in the normal way as it is at present and the only thing the Bill provides for is, for instance, if there is a difference of 10/-a day in the hospital charge, which he would normally be required to pay, that will be covered under this Bill? That seems to be the only change being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing I would like to have cleared up.  With regard to mental treatment, there is a lot of confusion at present because people who are normally entitled to free medical treatment find that if mental illness is involved, they are required to pay.  In particular, people with certain types of social welfare benefits have to surrender them to the mental hospitals.  If that is so, how will they be affected under this Bill when it becomes law?  Would the Minister <Col N="1068" /> care to make a comment on that aspect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully is right. Medical care will be paid for out of the Occupational Injuries Fund in so far as it is not covered under the Health Acts.  The estimated cost of it is £150,000 per year.  We will be coming to that later when discussing the amount of the contributions.  If a person is entitled to treatment under the Health Acts, then the cost to be met from the Fund would be only whatever the actual cost will be over and above that.  That would apply to the Mental Treatment Act as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 87:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides for the giving of notice by the insured workman to his employer or other prescribed persons. That is provided for in subsection (1). Subsection (2) provides that failure to give such notice without good cause may entail disqualification of the insured person from benefit for such period as may be determined in accordance with the regulations which the Minister proposes to make.  In the Workmen's Compensation Acts, we had the provision that notice had to be given and the same provision led to a lot of litigation and a lot of argument and trouble and very often ended <Col N="1069" /> up, when the courts could not see their way to get around the section, by the workman being deprived of benefit.  In administering this particular provision of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the courts did so with the greatest sympathy and leaned over backwards in an effort to get around it so as to give the workman his compensation. I hope that the same approach will prevail in the Department when this Bill becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) it is stated that the notice is to be given to the insured person's employer or other prescribed person.  I should like to know what the Minister has in mind there: I should like to know who the other prescribed person is.  Does he mean that there might be an obligation on the workman to report it to the Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to the foreman or to someone in authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is really on subsection (1).  My amendment is to delete subsection (2) which would disqualify the workman for failure to give notice.  I put down this amendment to give me an opportunity of discussing the matter and getting some information from the Minister.  &ldquo;Without good cause&rdquo;: these are a few little words which could lead to a lot of argument and a lot of discussion.  The courts always approach this from the workman's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that if the foreman was there and saw the accident happen, it would not be necessary to make any report or if the employer was there when the accident happened, and knew that the accident happened, there would not be any necessity to report it any further: certainly there was not, under the old law.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that these regulations will be drafted in such a way as to ensure that the insured person will be penalised only if his failure to report the accident prejudices the employer or, more correctly, prejudices the Department of Social Welfare or, more correctly, the fund: in other words, if it deprives the Department <Col N="1070" /> of an opportunity of having the workman examined by a doctor to see if he sustained the injury or if there was incapacity.  I should be quite agreeable to this provision to protect the fund against the workman who did not report the accident for a month or six months and then came in when he was better and thought he should make a claim.  That would be a ridiculous proposition.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that he will seek to disqualify the workman only for failing to give notice if the failure to do so prejudices the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, what is intended here is only to suspend payment until such time as the regulation has been complied with.  It is considered necessary to have subsection (1) complied with.  If the workman fails to do that, this gives us power to make no payment in respect of the period of failure to comply with the regulations under subsection (1) until such time as they have been complied with.  It would then be the intention&mdash; normally, at any rate&mdash;to pay the arrears that might have accumulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister already has a section under his Department covering ordinary disability benefit which has caused untold hardship, particularly to people living alone.  Even if they are taken to hospital and have been there for a considerable period and do not make a claim although there is no doubt at all about the certification of their illness, when they return home and make a claim the Minister's Department repeatedly refuse to pay benefit in such cases.  That is simply a matter of misinterpretation of the intention of the Act because the people who were ill never had any intention of doing anything wrong.  They are insured.  They are entitled to their benefit.  Because they were so ill that they could not claim the benefit, they are disqualified by the Department and they do not get their payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, it is even more serious. Consider the position of somebody who meets with an accident and is taken to hospital and is seriously ill in hospital. <Col N="1071" /> If he has nobody belonging to him then no report may be made.  What the Minister is saying in subsection (2) is that, in that case, his Department intend to suspend benefit until the report is subsequently made, if it is made. That is most unfair.  The insurance which has been paid covers them from the day they become ill.  It is simply a question of the interpretation being given by the Minister's Department in a case like that.</P>
    <P>Consider the case of somebody who becomes injured in his employment and who subsequently dies leaving maybe an old mother.  I think it would hardly be worth the mother's while from the point of view of what the Minister promises her, 24/- a week.  However, take a wife as an example.  They are so distraught that they do not report it.  It may be many weeks before the matter is put in order.  The Minister tells us that, in cases like that, he feels it is right that no money should be paid until the report is formally made.</P>
    <P>We are getting too tied up with this question of report.  The Department of Social Welfare was set up to look after people who are ill, amongst others, and in this case to look after people who are suffering from injury.  The first responsibility of the Department is to see to it that they will get something which will allow them to live or, if they die, that their dependants will get something to rehabilitate themselves until they are able to get some other means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>I think this subsection is an entirely unnecessary one.  I suggest that the Minister could very well accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion and take it out of the measure or, if he wants to keep it in, to say that if the report is not made within a month, six weeks or two months, a certain procedure will be followed, but he should specify some reasonable period.  He might also have a look at the disability benefit section with a view to preventing an abuse which is creeping into his Department in this connection.  I have great respect for the Minister and for his officials and for the way in which they do their <Col N="1072" /> work but this is one thing which is being referred to far too often now, with the result that unfortunate people are suffering hardship.  I suggest that if this section is left in the measure we shall have a recurrence of it for the next 20 years, at least.</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;in a case of failure without good cause&rdquo; is there and if the workman was not in a fit condition to report it, then that would be good cause for not doing so. But, in the case of the widow of a workman who is insured, surely the least that could be expected is that she would claim the benefit that would be due to her.  Normally, she would have to do that at the earliest opportunity herself.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 93:</P>
      <P>Before section 30 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the Principal Act, an appeal shall lie to an Appeal Tribunal in respect of entitlement to, and the amount of, benefit under sections 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23 and 29 of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2) The Appeal Tribunal shall consist of such judge of the Circuit Court or of the High Court as the Chief Justice may nominate and, at the option of the person bringing the appeal two additional persons, one to be drawn from a panel of persons nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and one from a panel of persons nominated by such bodies of employers as the Minister by order may select.</P>
      <P>(3) Appeals under subsection (2) of this section shall be heard in chambers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this amendment to be the most important amendment which has been put down to this Bill, not because I put it down but because it is an amendment which seeks to give the workman who is injured in an accident, who applies for benefit under this Bill and who is refused, an appeal outside Arus Mhic Dhiarmada.  At the beginning of the Second Reading debate on this Bill, I stated that there <Col N="1076" /> were certain good sections in this Bill with which I agreed, but that I was very fearful that the measure placed the workman at the mercy of the Minister and the Minister's advisers.</P>
    <P>There is no appeal under this Bill available to a workman other than an appeal to an anonymous appeals officer who hears the case behind closed doors, who does not give his decision there and then, who conveys his decision, perhaps weeks afterwards to the workman through the post, without giving any reasons for it.  I say that that is a state of affairs that workmen in this country will live to regret.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that in my approach to this Bill and in the approach of this Party to this Bill, we are not seeking to hold on to the old system of workmen's compensation for the sake of holding on to vested interests or for the sake of making money for lawyers, to put it bluntly.  So far as I am concerned, so far as the Party is concerned, we are completely agreeable to handing workmen's compensation over to the Department of Social Welfare subject only to the right of the workman who might have a dispute about very substantial benefits&mdash;several pounds a week for life&mdash;that sort of money&mdash;to appeal to an independent tribunal.</P>
    <P>Since 1934, the workmen's compensation code in this country was operated by the circuit court bench.  Probably before my time the circuit judge who operated it was known as an arbitrator and later still the applicant went before him as the circuit judge. Practically without exception&mdash;there is one exception I can think of but, naturally, I shall not go into names&mdash; the Circuit Court judges were fearful that they might do the workmen an injustice, and they approached it on the basis that if they were going to make a mistake it was better to make it in favour of the unfortunate workman than against him.</P>
    <P>By and large, subject to certain technical defences over which the bench had no control, the workmen got the most out of the workmen's compensation code.  If there was any real doubt and a judge felt that in <Col N="1077" /> strict law he might have to come down against the workman because of the oath he had taken, and because of what was written into the workmen's compensation code, he very often adjourned the case and said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I think you should get together about this,&rdquo; and there was a lump sum settlement.  It cannot be contradicted that that was the approach of the Circuit Court bench to workmen's compensation and injured workmen.  I repeat that under this measure this will all be swept away and the only appeal will lie to an anonymous official in the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not know how they are recruited, or where they are recruited from, but I imagine that they are sometimes recruited from within the Department. This reminds me of an income tax appeal being decided by an ex-inspector of taxes of 25 years' standing. That is a fact.  I know of income tax appeals that have been decided throughout the country by a special commissioner, and the special commissioner was a promoted inspector of taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He was brainwashed.  That is a better word.  I venture to suggest that the officials who will be acting as the supreme appeal tribunal in these cases will not have any judicial education and will have come to regard workmen as a malingering lot, as people who are swinging the lead, people who are trying to get something for nothing. Of course, they will allow cases, but if there is any doubt, I am very fearful that they will come down against the workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave an example in this House on <Col N="1078" /> another amendment and I think it is worth repeating here because it illustrates the point I am making.  I know a man who was earning £14 or £15 a week, I suppose, and he had a wife and seven children to support.  He met with a back injury&mdash;I know all back injuries are suspect&mdash;and he could not work.  Even with the benefits he was getting, he was losing a considerable amount of money.  Eventually he was told by the Department that he was fit to work, and to go back to work, notwithstanding the fact that he had been certified by the regional orthopaedic surgeon for that area as unfit for work, and notwithstanding the fact that the regional orthopaedic surgeon was trying to reserve a bed for him in the orthopaedic hospital, and was waiting until a bed was available to get him to come in and operate on him.</P>
    <P>That man had a wife and seven children and he was destitute.  A local county councillor had to take out his car and bring that man's wife to the home assistance officer from whom she received £3.  That may be an extreme case, but if that man were getting workmen's compensation under an order of the circuit court, it could not have been cut off until a summons to review was brought, and until the insurance company's doctor went into the witness box and said that man was fit to work, and subjected himself to cross-examination on his evidence, and until the medical evidence available on behalf of the workman was heard, listened to, and acted upon. That is the sort of thing of which I am afraid.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted on Second Reading that there is a well-known expression in the Department that &ldquo;the fund must be protected from fraud.&rdquo; It is very easy to develop a fund complex, a fund bias, an anti-workman bias.  The object of this amendment is to afford to workmen an appeal outside the Department of Social Welfare.  I want to tell the Minister now that he can make this appeal as informal and inexpensive as he likes.  Speaking for myself, I would even accept a district justice in lieu of the Circuit Court judge or the High Court judge mentioned in this amendment.  The right <Col N="1079" /> to unemployment benefit or disability benefit used to be decided by a referee, I think he was called, who came from the principal employment exchange in the area, and he was assisted by a representative of the workers and a representative of the employers.  I do not know whether that still prevails or whether it has been done away with. I think it has been done away with.</P>
    <P>Could anything be less formal than the amendment?  Could anything be less calculated to encourage litigation? I have said that the Minister can make this tribunal as informal as he likes.  He can have it heard in chambers.  Speaking for myself, and I can speak for my Party as well, he can even restrict the right of audience before that tribunal so long as it is a body before which the workman can go, armed with some assistance, whether it be his trade union representative or his solicitor, and lay his case before the tribunal and get a decision and the reasons for that decision.  The workman can be legally represented or he need not be.</P>
    <P>We know what the law is at the moment.  The workman has the right to go there and have his case heard. It is only just that he should have the right to have his case heard by somebody who is not part and parcel of the fund, who is not part and parcel of the bank giving him the money.  I do not say that in any offensive way. I know from experience that officials of insurance companies can very often develop the sort of mentality that nobody should get any damages. Would the amount of damages paid in the old days or the amount of compensation paid then be tolerated by an insurance official or be arrived at by somebody appointed by the insurance company that would have to pay the benefit?  Would they be tolerated by somebody who was responsible to the insurance company paying the benefit?</P>
    <P>This goes to the whole root of the measure now before us.  I do not mind if I am told this is what happens in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I am not influenced by that, nor is it <Col N="1080" /> necessary for my purpose to make the case that the appeals officers might act dishonestly or unjustly.  I am not making any of these points.  I make only the point that they will become biased in favour of the Department and that when they have any difficulty they will come down on the side of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an extension of the Social Welfare Acts and it is to be construed as one with the Principal Act.  Under the existing Acts, decisions are made by deciding officers and appeals go to appeals officers.  We are proposing to extend those provisions to occupational injuries.  The same thing was done when the old age contributory pension scheme was introduced&mdash;the existing arrangements in respect of decisions and appeals were extended.  I think it is relevant to say here that the minority of the commission were in favour of this type of machinery.  After all, among those who signed the minority report were three members of the commission who could reasonably be regarded as representing the workers' viewpoint specifically.  In paragraph 17 of the minority report of the commission, it is stated that administration would be by the same machinery as in the case of other social welfare benefits&mdash;by deciding officers and appeals officers.  This system is flexible, the report says, and has worked to the complete satisfaction of the insured population since it was introduced in 1952.  The minority report pointed out that the vast majority of disputes hinge on medical matters and under the existing system these matters have to be decided by judges, themselves unqualified in such matters, who have to depend on the views of the experts acting on the side of the parties in dispute and there are often conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that this system has worked well.  Under the Principal Act, provision is made in subparagraph (ii) of section 44 for the appointment by the Minister, if it appears to be desirable, of assessors to sit with an appeals officer.  It is not necessary for me to quote the section but the provision is there and this procedure is followed in relation to claims for unemployment <Col N="1081" /> benefit and could, if considered desirable, be applied to occupational injury benefits.  It appears to me that occupational injury benefit claims are more analogous to disability benefits where assessors are not necessary because, as the minority report commented, it is mainly medical differences that have to be decided on.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill it is not expected there will be any difficulty about admissibility of claims but if, after some experience of the operation of the Bill, this appears to be necessary, provision for the appointment of assessors is already there.  Deputy Fitzpatrick does not seem to appreciate that this question of compensation for occupational injuries will be an entirely different matter after the Bill has passed.  It becomes part of the social insurance system, the only difference between occupational injuries and other social insurance benefits being that in the case of occupational injuries there is no contribution by the State or by the employee. I have no doubt Deputy Fitzpatrick can remember many an exhilarating legal battle on the question of whether a person was entitled to workmen's compensation.  There will be no need for these legal contests in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo; has been clarified in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission so that the award of compensation for occupational injuries will no longer depend on the relative degrees of skill, energy and, indeed, on the experience of the workmen's compensation code on the part of the legal practitioners employed by opposing interests&mdash;the workman and the employer.  These two opposing interests are there at the moment: the workman who is injured and the employer who will be liable for any compensation awarded and is usually but not always covered by insurance for his liability.  If the employer is in one of the industries to <Col N="1082" /> which insurance is refused, then obviously the success of the workman's claim will be a very serious matter for him and the employer will be compelled by economic necessity to oppose the claim as effectively as possible.  If it is a matter for an insurance company, of course the profitability of the insurance company's operations depends on minimising the volume of successful claims.</P>
      <P>These two conflicting interests will not be there under this Bill so that there will no longer, in my opinion and in the opinion of the workers' representatives on the Commission, be any need for a judge to sit as umpire in a contest between two legal practitioners or two teams of legal practitioners. Neither is there any need for me to depress the amount of premium income that will be returned in the form of benefits by the necessity to finance this type of procedure.  Deciding officers and appeals officers will have no interest in the failure of a workman's claim.  I think it is completely unrealistic and unfair for Deputy Fitzpatrick to impute the motives he did impute&mdash;I am quite sure he did not intend any offence&mdash;to those officers.</P>

      <P>The workers' representatives are satisfied that they have been objective in the past and there is no reason to believe they will not be objective in the future.  It is entirely unjust to suggest they will have any ignoble motives in administering the scheme and, even if they have, normally <Col N="1083" /> the question to be decided will be whether the claimant will qualify for benefit from the occupational injuries fund or from the ordinary social insurance fund.  If the question that is to operate in the minds of deciding officers and appeals officers is to save the Exchequer at all costs, then it appears that if they are that type of person they will be more likely to opt for the occupational injuries fund rather than the social insurance fund.  In fact these people will have no interest one way or the other.  They will be there purely to decide a matter of fact and the workers' representatives were in favour of this procedure. My concern is to ensure that the maximum possible amount of the premium income will be returned in the form of benefits to the people who are insured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that our representatives on the commission supported the system which is included in the Bill.  Possibly they may not have had in mind some of the cases which a number of us are only too well aware of. I refer particularly to the type of case where somebody meets with an accident and applies for workmen's compensation. The person is either refused immediately or is paid for a number of weeks and the payment is then terminated, in which case he can apply to the Department of Social Welfare and get disability benefit if he is declared unfit for work and the Department are satisfied that that is the case. It is not possible, in that way, to do what could be done some years ago, that is, to starve them into going back to work.  If the person had no income from any source, he had to go back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department might say that the person had an income, that money had been offered.  If the workmen's compensation case succeeded, that was all right.  We have got the other case where somebody is drawing workmen's compensation and gets a supplementary amount from the Department of Social Welfare.  It may be a couple of shillings or a couple of pounds.  The <Col N="1084" /> Department decide that the person is fit for work.  The legal men here will agree with me when I say that many a very safe workmen's compensation case was blown skyhigh by the fact that the Department were paying a few shillings and in some cases paying nothing at all and declared that the person was fit for work.  The result of this was that the case for workmen's compensation was seriously weakened. The situation is bad enough in a case like that at the present time.</P>
    <P>Consider what will happen now.  If somebody applies for compensation under the new Bill and has been drawing it for a period and the Department decides that the person is no longer unfit for work, they cannot go back to the Department of Social Welfare, to the disability benefit section and say: &ldquo;You can pay me now until such time as I get this matter cleared up.&rdquo; Another section of the Department have declared the person is not unfit for work.  In that case I think our people on the commission must have completely overlooked that in that case the persons concerned can find themselves back to the bad old days and whether they are fit or not, they are starved into resuming work.  That situation can arise.  The Minister can say the ordinary right of appeal to the Department of Social Welfare operates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases the appeals officers have made a mistake. I have today instanced to the Minister a couple of cases where that happened. Now, if the appeals officer makes a mistake, it can be literally months before the second appeal is heard.  The Minister knows that and he knows of cases where I asked him here in this House why second appeals were not heard in a period of over six months. It means it will be a very considerable time before the matter can be investigated unless it is the intention to increase substantially the number of appeals officers dealing with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to see the compensation fund being put in such a way that in almost every case where somebody was slightly dissatisfied, he could <Col N="1085" /> go to the High Court and put the fund to expense.  It would be a mistake, although some people might agree with that.  It would not be very long until the subscription would have to go up or the amount paid out would be reduced.  It would have to be one or the other.  At the same time, there are not enough safeguards in the fund, as at present constituted, for the insured worker.  There should be some specific way to deal with the question of an appeal.  Perhaps the Minister might, in the light of the experience which he has had of the operation of this Act in Britain and Northern Ireland, say whether or not the system there is similar to what he is proposing.  If it is not, can he consider that this would be improved?  The one thing we must consider, in accepting this Bill, is that some person who is unable to work, due to illness or due to injury, is not starved into going back to work. There is a grave danger that that may happen and, if it happens in one or two cases in the year, it will be a very serious reflection on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully has most successfully demolished any argument the Minister has introduced here by referring to the remarks in the minority report.  The poor workman denied occupational benefit or disability benefit as a consequence of being denied the other one because of the findings of one side of the Department, has no option now but to go back to work.  He has no independent tribunal to consider his problem; he has no evidence which can be produced which may be contrary to that of the Department so that it can be used to determine whether or not he is to get benefit.  If I understand the Minister correctly when he speaks of the system of benefit referees or appeals officers, such people receive only the Departmental medical report and the advice, the opinions, of the injured person's own doctors or surgeons may not be available to the appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Chair, the Minister should not be addressing personal remarks of that kind.  The Minister's remarks are entirely wrong.  As the Minister well knows, I addressed the House for half an hour earlier to-day on the housing problem.  There is nothing a Deputy detests more than workmen's compensation proceedings and any lawyer with a reasonable practice does as well: from a monetary point of view, they are worthless altogether.  But it is extremely annoying when people are making objective contributions in this House to have a Minister for Social Welfare, or any of his colleagues, personally attacking them.  It would be bad enough if the attacks were justified; it is unpardonable when they are not, but just recklessly made without any justification whatever.  Perhaps it is an indication of the type of mind an unfortunate man will find himself up against&mdash;the almighty mind of an almighty State, be it a Minister, an appeals officer or an assessor.</P>
      <P>It may well be that those who put in those paragraphs in the minority report thought there was a safety valve in a Parliamentary question to protect the person who had been wrongfully deprived of a benefit.  But any person up against the almighty State knows that the process of a Parliamentary question is an almost worthless instrument and knows too all the almighty administration of secrecy which the State can build around itself from the prying eyes of the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had we an Ombudsman we might not need to spell out in this amendment, which Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> has put down for the Fine Gael Party, the protection which is so <Col N="1087" /> necessary to build in here for the individual. That is all we are seeking here.  An appeals tribunal would quite clearly be a very cheap way of administering justice, a more easy and simple way of providing some safeguard for the individual; its cost would be negligible and, compared with the benefit which it would confer, it is entirely justifiable.  Even if this appeals tribunal were never to reverse a decision made administratively, it would still be worthwhile because it would not lead to that inevitable sense of frustration which is bound to exist unless an independent tribunal is provided. We are well aware of several cases of conflict at present between the State on the one hand and the individual on the other.  It is a very frequent occurrence for differences of opinion to arise between applicants for disability benefit and the Department. It is very seldom that these are resolved to the satisfaction of the disabled person by any of the systems of appeal to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case&mdash;and I am sure many Deputies of this House are aware of identical cases&mdash;in which a lady was in receipt of disability benefit, whose medical condition was certified by her own medical doctor not to have changed but, notwithstanding that, she was determined, by the Departmental referee, as being again able to work, as a result of which she had the disability benefit paid to her discontinued.  After four or five months of persistent representations by herself and by a member of this House on her behalf and of the matter being processed through the Department until this final stage of appeal, she was declared to be disabled and was again given disability benefit but up to this day she has never been paid disability benefit in respect of the period during which some junior official in the administration held that she was fit.  She was a person who, fortunately, was married and had a husband to support her, at a certain level anyway, while she was denied benefit by the Department.  She was not forced, like the person to whom Deputy James Tully referred, <Col N="1088" /> to go back to work simply to avoid death from destitution.  She had somebody to maintain her but, had she not, she would have had to accept the findings of the official and resume work, although her own medical adviser said she was not fit to do so.</P>
    <P>All this dissatisfaction, all this worry is built into this Bill.  What we in Fine Gael are seeking to do here is to establish an outside tribunal so that that kind of situation will not be allowed to develop.  I am not suggesting that any applicant for benefit at present will be satisfied with the findings of the circuit court or, indeed, of the Supreme Court.  Most parties to litigation can disagree from time to time with the ultimate findings but I suggest that there is less chance of frustration with an independent tribunal than you have at present where the only tribunal is a Departmental one, no matter how independent or how noble it is alleged to be by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of people being denied unemployment assistance from time to time as a result of ministerial Orders which go out drawing attention to the large number of people who are drawing unemployment assistance and requiring that steps be taken to reduce the number, in order to reduce the claims upon the unemployment benefit fund.  Here you have an administrative decision; a Departmental decision to reduce the call; to reduce expenditure and this is translated into cutting off unemployed people from assistance willy-nilly and telling them to go into the labour exchange to prove that they have made application for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister resents Deputy Fitzpatrick's remark that people associated with the administration of State funds can be brainwashed.  He resents the suggestion that they can be occupationally influenced.  To suggest that is to state simply that an ordinary human experience, one's loyalty to one's work, one's loyalty to the institution one serves, is bound to govern one's approach to the claims against that institution.  That is not to say that a person would not conscientiously <Col N="1089" /> endeavour to give as much as morally seems justifiable.  That will certainly happen, but one's standards, one's capacity to assess, one's objective judgment will certainly be influenced by one's occupation and by the various influences that have come to bear on one's outlook over the years.  All the people the Minister has in mind for the administration of this scheme are such people and it is no reflection on them to say that, like all other human beings, they will be influenced by their own activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in a most unworthy remark, suggested earlier that my comments in this matter were guided only by the question of personal profit arising out of my profession.  He did not appear to consider that that was in any way a grossly unworthy remark though it was addressed to a person in his personal capacity, as you are aware, Sir; it was unjustified, but, at the same time, it would be fair for the Minister to say that my approach, like the approach of any other lawyer in the House, might be influenced by my own experience.  But it would not be simply a question of personal profit but a constant association with asserting the rights of individuals against insurance companies, against the State, against wrongdoers, and of defending the individual against the State in various sectors, civil and criminal, and of realising how the rights of individuals can be trampled upon, and of seeing attitudes of the State, approaches of the State, reversed by men in an independent judicial seat.  I am not ashamed of my reasonably limited experience in that field.  On the contrary, I am glad of it.</P>
    <P>I and other lawyers in this House have some understanding of the way in which the rights of individuals can be trampled upon.  That is why we are extremely anxious to see an independent tribunal administer the funds.  I personally have no objection if a rule is made that lawyers be not engaged to represent anybody before this tribunal but I think it would be unfair to the individual, should he wish to engage a competent person to argue the case on his behalf.  It might be preferable, and they might desire it, <Col N="1090" /> to have their trade union representative to argue the case, but the trade union concerned might wish to engage lawyers to do so, and they should be free to do so.  There is no reason why they should be denied the right because departmentally it would be inconvenient to be found wrong.  That is really what the Minister is afraid might happen if there were an independent tribunal.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme of labour exchanges was brought in many years ago in order to provide a supply of job opportunities and of people to avail of those opportunities.  What has happened?  The labour exchange has become a strictly accounting institution concerned only with making sure that nobody gets unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. That is the principal and primary function of our labour exchange today and that has been underlined in the NIEC Report and in the report on manpower policy.  It has been pointed out how an institution brought in for a purpose has developed over the years a narrow outlook and become simply a section of the accountant's department of the Department of Social Welfare.  The same thing will happen here unless there is an independent tribunal to ensure that the rights of the individual are sacrosanct and will be looked to before any consideration of the solvency or otherwise of the fund.</P>
    <P>At present the employer who reengages an employee who suffered injury in the course of his occupation embarks upon a hazardous activity if he dismisses the worker at a subsequent date because the worker is likely to resume his claim against the employer in respect of workmen's compensation. The result is that any disabled person or any person injured in the course of his work becomes almost a permanent employee.  He can get into a more privileged position than he had before he was injured.  In future, however, there will not be that fear on the employer if he dismisses an injured workman because there will be no claim against him.  There will be no insurance company obliging him to take back the worker in order to protect <Col N="1091" /> the company and a situation may well develop in which the worker is injured; he receives workmen's compensation; he is taken back by his employer; he is dismissed and the Department decides then that he is not unfit.  What redress has the worker then?  He has a case.  He cannot go to an independent tribunal.  This kind of case is part and parcel of the industrial and commercial life of the country and, unless you provide an independent tribunal, the worker will be at the mercy of the employer in a way in which he is not at the present time.  Some protection could be given for the individual if you had an outside tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the machinery at present of a deciding officer and an appeals officer is flexible.  I do not know whether the Minister's opinion of flexibility will be shared by people who have been unsuccessful in bringing their appeals before this gentleman but one's experience leads one to believe that rigidity is the significant element of these institutions and not flexibility.</P>
    <P>I missed the Minister's reference to the provision for the appointment of assessors and I should be grateful if the Minister would refer to it again but, from what the Minister says, the practice apparently is not to appoint assessors.  I do not know how often assessors have been appointed but I should like to know in what proportion of cases in which people express dissatisfaction assessors have been appointed.  The invariable reply to a Deputy if he makes representations on behalf of a person unsuccessful before an appeals officer is that there is no further tribunal, that the matter is closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister would lead one to believe now that assessors may be appointed.  I suppose the position is that the assessors must be appointed before and not after the appeals officer makes his decision.  Again, who determines whether or not assessors will be appointed?  Can the applicant insist?  If there were a system of free arbitration in which people would either have to agree upon an arbitrator <Col N="1092" /> or else have the arbitrator appointed by an independent tribunal, that would be all right.  Here, again, it is apparently the, shall we say, prosecutor in the dispute who decides whether or not there is going to be an outside assessor.  Quite clearly that is unfair.  Unless both parties can insist upon an assessor neither party should have the right.  It would be better to have this outside tribunal to which Deputy Fitzpatrick refers in his amendment.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister suggests that there would be no further disputes in future, or room for dispute, on whether or not injury has arisen out of or in the course of employment.  I should love to think that that is so.  The fact is there is a great deal of case law which has determined this in the past and all that has gone to colour the report of the Commission which sat on this and has also influenced the legislation, but in future we will not have any system of case law.  We will not have anything except the secret files of the Department of Social Welfare to give us a history of what is happening, to give any account of the disputes, to give any recital of the differences which have arisen in the interpretation of this Bill. Again, that is clearly unfair.  If we are to be socially progressive we should have the fullest possible information about the manner in which our social schemes are working.  We are not going to have that information.  It will be on the files of the Department, unseen by anyone except the Minister, his deciding officers and appeals officers, but never made available to the trade unions or the legal profession, or to people who might be able to assist the worker.</P>
    <P>If we had an appeals tribunal, we might not have its findings published, and in fact Deputy Fitzpatrick provides that the proceedings be conducted in chambers so as to reduce formality and reduce their cost, but at least the people who are assisting workers in making claims would have some experience and knowledge of what was happening and would be able to assist other claimants in the furtherance of their claims.  In denying the <Col N="1093" /> right of people to prosecute their claims at an independent tribunal the Minister is preventing society and the country from keeping abreast of developments in industrial accidents and in the interpretation of the law. All that is going to work to the great disadvantage of the people the Minister seeks to help in this legislation.  We in Fine Gael want to urge him, even though he is not prepared to accept this to-night, although perhaps later on he will, to listen to what we in these benches have said and also to what Deputy Tully has said and perhaps provide for some independent system of assessing claims later on.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 95:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 25 to delete paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>Section 31 in general provides disqualification for injury benefit or disability benefit and the suspension of proceedings.  It is the section which provides that a workman must submit to a medical examination, undergo certain treatment, and all that sort of thing.  I have no great objection to that, but we see in paragraph (d) that the Minister may by regulation direct the injured workman &ldquo;to observe any prescribed rules of behaviour&rdquo;.  That is going a little too far.  I do not know what might be included in that.  The Minister might want a workman to go for a walk every day, or is it intended that if a workman was fond of a drink and the Minister thought that he took one too many that he could then suspend the workman's benefit?  That is going very far in endeavouring to prescribe how an insured person shall live, shall spend his time and, I suppose, what he shall eat and certainly what he shall drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These may be taken as extreme cases but I will content myself with saying that I am not satisfied with a <Col N="1094" /> provision which enables the Minister to direct a workman to observe set rules of behaviour which the Minister shall prescribe.  Certainly these are rules which would want to be laid on the Table of the House, although I do not think there is any such provision in the Bill but I have put down an amendment to say that they should be laid before the House.  I shall not go any further with my argument at the moment but I should like the Minister to tell the House what he really has in mind by this paragraph.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If Deputy Tully would go through this section with me, I think he would find that there is something more in it than meets the eye, and something more than what the Minister says.  Paragraph (a) says that the workman is to submit himself from time to time for a medical examination for the purpose of determining the effect of the accident, and so on.  That is quite reasonable. Paragraph (b) says that he is to submit himself from time to time to appropriate medical treatment for the relevant injury or loss of faculty.  That is quite reasonable too.  He should co-operate in trying to get better by submitting himself to the proper medical treatment.  Paragraph (c) says he must &ldquo;attend at such places and times as may be required for the purposes of the said medical examination or treatment.&rdquo; Paragraphs (a) and (b) could be described as provisions for treating him and (c) is a provision which compels him to submit himself for medical examination to see if he has recovered, but then paragraph (d) reads: &ldquo;to observe any prescribed rules of behaviour&rdquo;. Certainly any ordinary person reading these four paragraphs would have to relate paragraph (d) to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  If the Minister could assure me that that was a paragraph that would only ensure that a man is not working and &ldquo;drawing&rdquo;, as they say in the country, at the same time, I could understand it, but in the context in which it is there, it means no such thing.  I would ask the Minister to tell us whether this is a transplant from the English Act and, if it is, if he has studied it carefully and if he knows exactly what is intended to be covered by the regulations it is intended to make under paragraph (d).  The House is entitled to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that it is sought under these <Col N="1096" /> regulations to insist that a man will observe such rigid regulations as may be prescribed in order to compel him to get well, that he will live a model life, that he will do what he is told, and that if he wobbles a bit to one side &mdash;I do not mean as a result of visiting the &ldquo;local&rdquo; but if he does not carry out to the letter the prescriptions given to him&mdash;his benefit will be cut off.  I am convinced that whatever the Minister's intention is, the people who framed this section and who put paragraph (d) after paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), had something like that in mind.</P>

If they are respectable, if they are fair, if they have been found in practice not to lead to any injustice, why not put them into the Act, or has it been found necessary, from time to <Col N="1098" /> time, as people devise ways and means around them, to add to them?  I am not one of those people who think that Acts must be made so dull that one cannot put in little things like that dealing with human behaviour.  Our elders in other generations did not find it necessary to exclude things of a personal and domestic nature from legislation. Under an Act of 1842 it is an offence to beat a rug after a certain hour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an offence to carry a privy through the public streets.  It is also an offence to move furniture at night-time, after darkness.  These Acts were not faulty Acts because they spelled out these things.  I would prefer to see the limits of the Minister's power spelled out here rather than put in something which allows him to prescribe that people must follow certain rules of behaviour.  I have in mind a man who has now gone to a better world and who could have been the mythical man who walked the crooked mile because of arthritis which set in and which rendered him incapable of following his normal occupation.  I can say I know no better house decorator, since he was able to work in his own time, in his own way.  Now because of these prescribed rules which required him to say where he was I suspect the poor man had to have white lies recorded from time to time.  I only hope he has not had to spend too much time on the halfway mark in the next world as a result, but his doctor recommended that this man should do that kind of work.  He regarded this as the kind of thing necessary to stop the man locking altogether and becoming absolutely incapable.  I know that one must assume that Ministers will act reasonably and that the officers of the Minister will act reasonably, but I have the greatest reserve in giving to the Minister the power he seeks here. It is not good enough to say: &ldquo;We did it in the past and it has not been abused, and therefore we should not try to mend our hands.&rdquo;  I believe there is a great deal of merit in Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1101" /> This has been a bone of contention between myself and the Minister throughout the Bill.  In Northern Ireland the amount required to finance occupational injuries is 1/11d, which includes Exchequer support of 20 per cent.  Here the proposed amount is 2/1d.  There is no public hardship allowance included in our Bill.  It is included in Northern Ireland, and the Minister admitted this evening that it accounted for approximately 21 per cent of the cost of the Northern Ireland scheme.  In addition, the Minister made a case, which he subsequently withdrew, that because there was a different way here of financing hospital and domiciliary treatment for accident victims, this should also be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is small in proportion to what is being covered by the scheme here.  For an extra £150,000, which is all that can be counted against the scheme, we are dropping the special hardship allowance granted in Northern Ireland and we are in fact adding an extra 2d to the charge.  I said when we discussed this earlier, and I repeat now, that there is a catch somewhere in this Bill.  There is a catch in the actuarial report which has produced those figures.  To say they were rigged would be too hard, but I would say they have been manoeuvred in such a way that the Exchequer expect to gain much more out of the scheme than they propose to pay out.  While saying that, I admit the Bill appears to be a very big improvement on what <Col N="1102" /> we have at present.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot charge more than is being paid elsewhere and pay less out.  That, in effect, is what he is trying to do.  If there is a further explanation which the Minister has not so far given, I should like to hear it now, but, if there is not, then there is no justification either for the higher charge or, alternatively, for omitting the special hardship allowance and the increased amount which would give us parity, except in one case, with Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In his report to the Commission on Workmen's Compensation, the actuary estimated that the annual contribution income for a scheme on a funded basis similar to the industrial injuries scheme in Northern Ireland would be £1.9 million.  This scheme in general terms is similar to that scheme, similar to the scheme that was costed by the actuary, but there are a number of variations from the minority scheme as costed by the actuary.  In the first place, the main benefit rates are about 18 per cent higher than those recommended by the commission.  Injury and disablement benefit are to be paid at the same rate to women as to men, although it was recommended in the minority report that the women's rate should be only two-thirds of the men's rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. It represents £250,000.  Then there is the question of the women's rates. Under the Bill, they are the same as men's, although the minority scheme recommended two-thirds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is £170,000 extra. There is the cost of medical care which, although it was recommended in the minority scheme, was not costed by the actuary.  That is £150,000.  Then there is an increase of £10,000 in respect of increased rates of dependants' allowances which are being provided in the Bill.  As against that, there is a decrease for the omission <Col N="1103" /> of the special hardship allowance of £400,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The estimated cost of the actuary was £1.9 million. I do not know that the assessment of the special hardship allowance is exactly 21 per cent but it is very close to it: I think it must have been assessed at 21 per cent.  In addition to that, we have the cost of disability benefit.  That is estimated to cost in the region of £400,000 a year.  Therefore, the overall amount required to be met by contributions is roughly £2.5 million.  That is an additional expenditure over what was estimated by the actuary for the minority scheme of £600,000 and, in order to cover that, 5.5 pence were added to the contribution for men and 5.4 pence to the contribution for women, bringing the total weekly contribution to 2/1d for men and 1/6d for women. There are in fact a number of differences between the scheme as proposed and that recommended by the minority, which was similar to the Northern Ireland one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We find it difficult to agree that there should be a flat rate contribution of 2/1d in respect of men and 1/6d in respect of women irrespective of the type of work that is being done.  This particularly applies to men.  The employer of a clerical worker has to pay 2/1d in respect of what is a comparatively harmless occupation and the employer of a man on woodworking machinery or in a quarry also has to pay only 2/1d.  Like the case of the sliding scale for compensation in respect of injuries bearing a relationship to the amount of wages being earned at the time of the accident, we think this contribution here should bear some relation to the type of work being done.  The Minister says that that would be difficult to work out but I think it would be more accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of difficulty so much as a question of principle.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick is asking is to get back to the principle of risk rating, which applies at the moment.  There are two points of view. One is that it is good.  On the other hand, the whole principle of social insurance is the principle of spreading the risk over the whole field.  Taking it all in all, I think that this is a good idea.  If we are to have risk-rated contributions, some of the most important industries in the country, including agriculture, would have to pay a much higher premium than they will have to pay under this social insurance system. I think that this whole principle of spreading the risk is one that is justified and is in the best interests of the economy as a whole.  In fact, some very important industries have found it impossible to get insurance at all for this risk under the present system.  I think one of the main benefits of the Bill is that that is being done away with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply workmen's compensation, accident or injury at work, is included here.  It still does not let in those people the Minister has been referring to who are finding it difficult to get insurance because many of them find the difficulty not in respect of ordinary workmen's compensation but on the question of injuries.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that recently the tendency in compensation cases has been to get the case under common law and quite a number have succeeded in doing that.  I agree that spreading the risk was the proper thing to do but I would also like to point out that it is an extraordinary situation that we have very few dangerous industries, nothing comparable to the coalfields in Britain or the big industries there, nothing even comparable with the big industries in Northern Ireland, and yet our charges are higher than they would be if we did have all those things here.  I do not want to revert to the previous amendment but it does appear as if the person who prepared the actuarial report did have at the back of his mind that he was dealing with the same type of risk as exists in Britain and Northern Ireland. That is where the big mistake is made.  Spreading the risk was the only thing to do.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that agriculture has been one of the highest risks as far as accidents are concerned and that the risk has been increasing because of numerous tractor accidents. It is difficult to reconcile that with the rate of wages paid to agricultural workers as compared with the rate paid to industrial workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the actuary based his costs entirely on Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  He had a certain amount of statistics available to him as to the nature of claims here.  I do not know.  As Deputy Tully says, it is by experience that we will find out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Perhaps what I am going to say now <Col N="1106" /> might more properly be said on the Final Stage of the Bill but it arises out of what Deputy Tully says.  I thoroughly agree that it would be very wrong to give the impression that the employers are now having shifted from them over to the Department of Social Welfare their obligation to compensate their employees for accidents sustained in their employment.  No such thing.  As Deputy Tully says, they will still have the very onerous liability of common law liability.  That is the onerous liability. That is where one sees thousands of pounds&mdash;£15,000, £20,000 and more&mdash;being awarded. The employers will still have to insure against that and I venture to suggest that the number of common law actions will increase.</P>
      <P>I should like to pose this question to the Minister: when we had social welfare benefit properly so-called paid by his Department and when the employer was liable to pay workmen's compensation, when a workman applied for disability benefit he immediately got a long form from the Department pointing out to him his rights against his employer and inviting him to investigate and explore them to the full.  As a matter of interest, I wonder now, when the social welfare and workmen's compensation liability properly so-called are being housed under the one roof, will the Department of Social Welfare send out a somewhat altered leaflet informing the workman that he may have rights at common law against his employer and inviting him to explore those to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights at common law would not affect the worker's right to benefit under this Bill.  In fact, it is the other way about.  There is provision that in assessing damages at common law account must be taken of whatever benefit is available under the Occupational Injuries Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be of no interest to the Department to do so.  The obtaining of damages at common law <Col N="1107" /> would not relieve the occupational injuries fund of any expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another snag.  I am sure the Minister has adverted to it.  At present if somebody meets with an accident at work he applies for compensation and very often is paid compensation even though subsequently a claim at common law is taken and sustained.  That will not happen now.  The Department may perhaps get cluttered up with applications as to whether a case is a common law case or a workmen's compensation case.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if that does happen great care will be taken so that the person will not be left awaiting a decision.</P>
