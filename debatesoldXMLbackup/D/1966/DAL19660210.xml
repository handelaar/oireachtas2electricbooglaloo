    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 44:</P>
    <P>In page 37, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The report shall include observations as the housing authority may, by resolution, consider should be notified to the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy James Tully.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last night, I was discussing amendment No. 44 which I moved. The object of the amendment is that when a report is being issued to the Minister for Local Government under this section, it will include the observations of the members of the local authority.  It has come to our notice that managers, when making reports on housing matters to the Department of Local Government, even at the request of the members of the local authorities, simply send the request with their own observations.  Since there will now be a statutory obligation on the local authority to send in a report on the housing situation, we believe that unless this amendment is accepted, we shall have a continuation of that situation where the manager will make his own comments, which may not be in line with the comments of the members of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is made mandatory on the manager to include the comments of the elected representatives, the Minister for Local Government will at least know what the elected representatives want.  Otherwise we may have the situation where a manager reports that there are applicants for 150 houses in an area but that there is no land available and that those people are not so badly off for houses at all; whereas the representatives of the local authority may have pointed out <Col N="1295" /> several times to the manager that there is an adequate supply of land available if certain steps are taken and that, in fact, most of the applicants for housing are people who should be housed by the local authority.  That is the reason we have put in this amendment, the purpose of which is quite clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The need for it mainly arises from the fact that on a number of occasions over the years, the Minister for Local Government has given a quiet directive to the county managers that money is scarce and that they should go slow on building. It has been my experience over the past ten or 12 years that if the estimate of the elected representatives of the housing needs had been taken, we would be much further towards a solution of the problem than we are today.  There are many more ways of choking a dog than with butter and it is amazing the number of difficulties that can be put in the way of a housing authority if the manager, backed by the local officials, decides that he is not going to build at the rate decided upon by the local authority.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to put us in the position that the Minister can come in here and attack county councils for having failed to do the job when, in fact, they have never failed to keep up the pressure but have failed to get their representations through to the Department. It is imperative, if we are not to be put into a false position, that we should have the opportunity of putting forward our estimate of housing needs. There is nobody in as good a position to estimate the housing needs of his area as the local representative.  He knows the people.  They are coming to him, writing to him and are on his doorstep while the county manager and his officials are sealed away from all that.  The Minister should accept this important amendment which will at least give the contrast of views as between the estimate of the local representatives and that of the officials of the council.</P>

      <P>We agree in principle with the motives behind the amendment but we do not think it necessary to have it included in the Bill.  There is nothing to prevent local authorities passing a resolution requesting the manager to do what they feel should be done.  The proposition here is that the managers will not go as far as the local representatives wish them to go.</P>

      <P>If the manager did not send up the views of the council, the council could do so itself.  There is no difference in the south between the managers and the councils.  The manager sends up a report of what the council decides and what they require him to do.  If he did not do that, through what channel could the views of the representatives be sent up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is much merit in this amendment.  Much of the criticism for lack of progress in housing falls on the local representatives but when a communication is sent from the manager to the Minister the local representatives do not see it and do not know what is in it.  It is quite evident that it is the views of the manager and not those of the local representatives that are taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to the adoption of the building programme is that the adoption of a programme is the right of the elected representatives.  The report referred to here will be an integral part of the programme.  If a council adopts a programme and a report goes with it to the Minister, it follows that the council should and will be aware of what that report is.  The report could scarcely be compiled without their knowing its content since they would know what the programme is as they are the housing authority.  Such a report could scarcely be compiled and omit the views of the council as they are the elected representatives.</P>
      <P>If the council have any fear that that should happen, the manager is obliged to inform them as to the manner in which he proposes to compile this report or any other report for submission to the Minister, under subsection (2) of the City and County Management Act, 1955.  If they have a manager whom they suspect of holding strong views contrary to those adopted in the programme, they can require him to inform them of the nature of the report he proposes to send to the Minister. As Deputy Healy said, normally in matters of this kind, a manager would without doubt represent the views of the elected members as well as his own rather than try to omit the views of the elected body which led to the adoption of the report concerning the programme.</P>
      <P>Many circulars will undoubtedly have to be issued subsequent to the enactment of this Bill in whatever form it finally takes.  We could specifically mention that we wanted to make sure the views of the elected members would be reported.  I do not think they need have any fears that their views will be omitted or ignored.  The adoption of the programme is their function.  Without their agreement, there really cannot be a programme to report upon, nor would there be any special report such as mentioned in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not that I am against the idea of a report reflecting the views of the members as well as the manager, but I <Col N="1299" /> cannot see how the views of the members can be kept from the Minister. Further, members of local councils are always free to send resolutions to me or any other Minister on all matters, even those not dealing with their council at all.  Many of them do indeed pass resolutions on matters as far removed from their business as the moon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was any fear of the modes of communication breaking down, they would still have this last link with the Minister.  I am quite sure they would use it if they had to, but I do not think they will have to in this context.  That is the reason I feel the amendment is unnecessary, not that the intention of it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact he was a member of a local authority for a long time, the Minister must not be aware of, or probably has forgotten, some of the things that can happen. It is true that the programme must be approved by the members, and that, following that, the report will be made to the Minister; but the Minister must understand the report is made by the manager or on the manager's orders. The result is that the manager can send in a report with his own observations. If the Minister thinks that cannot happen, he should check on what happened in County Dublin not so long ago when the views of the elected members were completely ignored and a contrary report sent in with the recommendation that houses should be built.  The same kind of thing can happen again.  The elected representatives will not be aware of the fact that it has happened unless the report is rejected or the Minister is not satisfied. Then, when an inquiry is made, a letter may subsequently be found saying that this idea of the elected representatives is a lot of hooey and that the manager does not agree with it at all.  The fact that the members draw up a report does not mean that the manager either accepts or approves it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Deputy Healy referred to the situation in Cork.  He is in the happy position of having a good manager who believes it is his job to carry out the wishes of the elected representatives. Some of the managers&mdash;not all of them because a number of us are dealing with county managers who are ordinary, sensible people&mdash;have still got the idea that they are little tin Caesars who can do anything they like, that God created a special type of person to be county manager who knows more than everybody else.  The result is that the report will come in with the county manager's view and not with the views of the elected representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 38, line 2, after &ldquo;require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and the housing authority may, if they think fit, include in the programme, an order of priorities relating <Col N="1302" /> to any one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  particular projects;</P>
    <P>(b)  projects in particular areas;</P>
    <P>(c)  projects to provide housing accommodation for particular categories of persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a housing authority may include in a building programme an order of priorities relating to particular projects in particular areas or projects to provide housing accommodation for particular categories of persons.  The amendments, for instance, would enable members of a housing authority to require that more emphasis should be given to particular areas in a county which apparently had been neglected for one reason or another in previous housing drives of the particular authority.  The amendment goes some way, not all the way but certainly some way, towards meeting the case made by Deputy Tully in amendments Nos. 54 and 55.</P>
    <P>In his two amendments, Deputy Tully proposes that a housing authority should be enabled by resolution to decide to provide houses or building sites in any area or within a specified time or direct the county manager to take steps to acquire an immediate number of building sites.  If, in the unlikely event of a manager failing to comply with an order of priorities laid down in a building programme, the members of the authority could require him to do so under section 4 of the 1955 Act.  In other words, if amendment No. 49 is accepted, the Bill would then read in such a way that should the manager fail to act on the priorities as indicated under the power of amendment No. 49 then section 4 would come into operation to require him, by the members' resolution, to do whatever he had failed to do that was an omission from their priorities as adopted.</P>

      <P>This does go a portion of the way to meet amendments Nos. 54 and 55.  We had in mind the position where there is not an adequate number of sites available. We believe that if sites can be made <Col N="1303" /> available the manager should make them available.  I have a recent example of where housing sites were badly needed in an area where a small farm became available which would almost have met the requirements.  The matter was brought to the notice of the county manager and he was asked if he would take the necessary steps to try to acquire this small farm.  He did not do so.  The farm was sold, with the result that there are now no sites available in the area, nor are there likely to be sites for a considerable period.  We want to make it a specific responsibility of the manager to do this.  The Minister has gone a good deal of the way.  Is there any possibility that he would reconsider the matter with a view to going the remainder of the way before the Bill goes to the Seanad?  Níl sé ag éisteacht liom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that what the Minister is proposing in amendment No. 49 is sufficient to meet the case.  It is all right to say that the local authorities or the housing authorities can insist on priorities being decided but that is not sufficient if the effort elsewhere is insufficient. In an area like County Dublin, particularly, or similar areas, into which people are moving very rapidly, if we are to keep in touch with the housing needs at all, and if we are not to have an ever-increasing backlog, the first thing that is fundamental is sites.  We should be able to anticipate that sites will be needed in the various areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, more or less, what our development programme is, say, for ten years ahead.  We know where we will extend services and what is likely to be the shape of the development in those areas.  Unless the members of the council are in a position to insist that at least a certain area of housing sites is reserved and made available in all these areas, we shall never catch up on the demand that is there.  We hope there will be considerable industrial development as well.  Side by side with this, unless we have these areas secured for the council, we cannot decide to build houses&mdash;and, when we go to look for sites, they are just not <Col N="1304" /> there or they are extremely expensive. It is good business to move in, in advance of development, and to ensure that we have got sites to meet our housing needs.</P>
    <P>If it is left to the county manager and the officials in the council, all the time they will err on the side of caution. You will have this excess of caution leaving us in the position we have been in for years now so that, when we had the &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; to build we had not the sites and when we were ready to look for sites there was no money. That is the present position.  That is the start and unless we have these sites we cannot build the houses.  I think Deputy Tully's amendment is essential if we are to get the power that we need to supply the housing needs in areas into which people are moving fairly rapidly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> This amendment is in a sense very relevant to the previous amendments, particularly as it specifically relates to the consideration that must be given in the preparation of a building programme to the provision of adequate and suitable sites.  The amendment is specifically directed towards the provision of adequate and suitable sites within the building programme and, read in conjunction with the amendments which the House has adopted, it will give us the full power that has been sought inasmuch as the matter of sufficient sites will then be, as proposed under this amendment, a specific requirement.  That is highlighted by the amendment being put down as a special amendment, to emphasise that, lest anybody might read the Bill as originally drafted as substantiating a view that the sites did not really come within the same terms or with the same emphasis as would the provision of the actual houses.  This, added to the previous amendment, gives the nearest thing to what was required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy in relation to those are certainly covered reading the two things together and they would emphasise the question of sites being a consideration in the preparation of a building programme, which building programme and its adoption is a matter for the elected members.  Taken together with 55, which makes it a reserved function, the two things give what is sought generally by Deputy Tully and other Deputies in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>The only thing is that there seems to be a new procedure here.  Normally, when a Bill is before the House and amendments are introduced which seem to be reasonable, the Minister accepts the amendments. It seems to be a new procedure whereby he introduces amendments of his own which he says are similar to the amendments put down by Deputies and which should be accepted instead. <Col N="1306" /> If that is the way he wants it, that is quite OK with me.</P>

      <P>Could I say a word on the staffing problem that is raised in this amendment?  At the moment elected representatives are powerless in relation to staff.  The county manager can simply throw up his hands and say: &ldquo;I cannot carry out this programme. I just have not got the people to do it.&rdquo;  It is quite right at times to say that it is difficult to get these people.  It is also right to say that the Minister may rob the council of some of the staff.  It is right to say that the Department of Local Government can take some of the best people on a council's staff, pay them more money and refuse to allow the local authority to pay them when there is difficulty in getting staff.  Then the manager can say that the council has lost its best people and that he cannot go faster than he is going.  At the same time, the Minister is criticising the county council and everybody says the councillors are useless.  The councillors are helpless.  The manager says: &ldquo;I have not got the staff and cannot proceed with the job&rdquo;.  There is nothing the council can do except to keep pressing the manager to get the necessary additional staff.  I do not know whether or not there is any way around this.  I know it could be wrong that councillors would be in a position that they could tell the manager: &ldquo;You must employ ten more people in that department&rdquo;, but they should be in a <Col N="1308" /> position to say to the manager if he says he has not got enough staff: &ldquo;That is your problem and settle it within a reasonable time because you cannot keep trotting up to us the excuse that you have not got staff.  Are you making sufficient effort?&rdquo;  We cannot know whether he is or not.  There should be some way of dealing with it.  That is the main problem posed in amendment No. 53 and the Minister should in some way meet it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton has almost put his finger on the bell in regard to the situation that I know obtains, which is, that far from managers being required by the council to recruit staff, the procedure is the reverse, that far more cases occur where managers propose to recruit staff which the council very often do not agree that they need.  In so far as poor Deputy Clinton's county council is concerned, if we are to take the logical line from the argument that the Minister is stealing these people by offering greater incentives and leaving the council in the position that they cannot get on with their work, what about my county and counties west, which are being steadily drained of the best they can get and train by Dublin and other counties in the east?  According to that we should not be able to do anything.  Yet we struggle on.  That has been going on for generations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It explains the new revival.  It is true that this sort of filching goes on all the time but, remember, this is part of a system which staff as a whole insist upon and have insisted upon down the years, of open competition for all these jobs so that they would have clear and equal opportunity for promotional purposes, whether that promotion is sought for greater status, greater pay or their own personal wish to be in the city or on <Col N="1309" /> the east coast or in the more attractive parts of the country from the point of view of schooling, universities, and so forth.  This is the situation.  I do not see any likelihood of a change in that situation in future.  While Dublin County Council may feel slightly inconvenienced occasionally by the fact that some of the good people whom they have attracted from other counties over the years are further attracted into the Department, it is the system and there is not much that we can do about it.  I would say, in passing, that the Deputy should think of the greater difficulties of other counties.  The further west you go, the greater the difficulty in this regard.</P>

      <P>Not lessening, no.  The Deputy should go west for a while and find out what the actual position is. Some people employed in some western counties have more to do in a week than some of the Deputy's employees do in the equivalent post in a month.  That is well known.  It is one of the reasons why we in the western counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If Dublin county find themselves in a difficult position, just have a thought for us who find ourselves in a much worse position because the same factors are operating as have operated over the years.  Staff are taken from us and disappear into the east.  That is happening for various reasons and not just because of promotion or money.

      <P>No.  Everyone was behind the council, but they did not get on with the job.  Now that there is movement, it is true that there is restriction on money, but there is no restriction on staff and Dublin county and city are getting not just their share, as I am sure some of my colleagues from other areas believe, but more than their share.</P>
      <P>My first observations are, I think, the ones that are of most weight.  Far from having to require, request or drive managers into employing staff, this is one way of stopping them employing staff they do not need.  That is my experience of the situation.  In regard to vacancies, the council is not just out in the wilderness.  If a vacancy exists the Local Appointments Commission are requested to fill it and, if they are not requested, the council should be aware of the fact.  They are aware a vacancy is filled and they should likewise be aware if it has not been filled.  It is not true to say, if a vacancy is not filled, that the manager comes back and says he tried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to Deputy Clinton's argument, which was that the Department swipes these people and the council is left short.  The manager says he has tried and could not get staff and I gather from the Deputy that something can be done about this.  It is the job of the Local Appointments Commission to fill the job at the request of the manager and his council.  If they do not succeed in filling the vacancy it is not fair to blame the manager.  There is no other way in which to get a man if he is not available.  He just is not there.  He does not offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing we can do about that.  The Deputy will agree that, while all of us think our <Col N="1311" /> own job is the more important, at the same time it will be generally conceded, though not in some specific cases, that in the Department we require the best people who have had experience in the local services in order that we may in turn provide a better service for the local council. That is a natural sort of evolution and, while I am sorry in a way that we should deprive councils of these people, the fact is they offer and they are regarded in many cases as the best men. The councils are left short.  That is the order of things and it is likely to continue.</P>
      <P>The real problem is the fact that the filling of some of these vacancies has proved very difficult, if not impossible, particularly in recent times in relation to highly skilled technical people.  We cannot overcome that difficulty overnight. It is not within our competence to do so.  I would not think managers have all that difficulty in getting staff and my ambition would be to stop them employing staff they did not really want.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression when speaking earlier that amendments Nos. 54 and 55 were being taken with No. 49.  It was my own fault and not the fault of the Chair.  Amendment No. 53 appears to bear no relation whatever to the other amendments and I do not know how it came to be mixed up with these. Amendment No. 53 is the one which deals with staffing and I am sorry if I failed to refer to it when speaking earlier.  The amendment says:</P>
      <P>In page 38, between lines 27 and 28, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) A housing authority may, by resolution, require a county manager to employ such additional staff (as may be specified in the resolution) to carry out the building programme within a specified time and the manager shall forthwith carry the resolution into effect as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton has put his finger on <Col N="1312" /> portion of the problem and the Minister apparently appreciates what the situation is.  But that is not the whole story.  When the recent Planning Act was passed a situation arose in which more work had to be done in regard to housing and most of the county managers took the easy way out.  They recruited their planning staff from the housing office of their own county. The result was they left a number of vacancies in the housing office.  These were filled eventually.  Whether the people who filled them are or are not as efficient as those who went before them is not the point at issue.  They were new to the job and that naturally held things up for a considerable period.  Deputy Clinton says the managers say they are unable to get the staff they need; even if the council are forcing the manager to go ahead with the job he says, particularly with regard to technical staff, that he cannot get them.  That is a problem in many counties and not alone in Donegal and others.</P>
    <P>Councils find they cannot get engineering staff at the present time. The engineering staff which they have is put to normal work and it would be very difficult to get any additional staff for housing.  This has resulted in a number of schemes in various counties being held up, whether or not the money is available.  The amendment suggests that the housing authority may insist on the county manager getting the staff.  We believe that in many cases county managers are not getting extra staff.  They are conscious of the fact that they want to keep the rates down and if there are a large number of people looking for houses and getting houses and if they have to employ extra staff for housing schemes, this will increase the rates.  The county manager could say that the staff just is not available.  I asked the Minister what happens when an officer is appointed and does not turn up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that if the county council feel that the manager is not doing all he should to get staff, he should be forced to do so by the county council. The manager tries to save some money simply by refusing to find the staff and the only way to deal with that is to give authority to the elected representatives to order him to find the necessary staff.  Then he cannot say that there is no staff available which is a better excuse than saying that the Department would not provide money.</P>

      <P>There are two points involved.

The Minister can ask any of his colleagues and I am sure they will tell him that most managers do not want to employ extra staff and do not want to replace members of the staff who leave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 38, between lines 52 and 53, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever in any urban area or in any non-municipal town area (or in any rural housing district defined by the housing authority) the authority has no land suitable for the purposes of sections 56 and 57 of this Act it shall be the duty of the authority to acquire land as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>(2)  Within one month after the passing of this Act (and thereafter in the months of May and November in each year) the manager of a housing authority shall, in respect of each urban area, non-municipal town area and each rural housing district, report the following particulars to the authority:</P>
      <P>(a)  the area of land and site capacity.</P>
      <P>(b)  the number of applicants for houses and sites, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the number of houses provided by the authority in which more than one family resides.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is to bring up to date the amount of land available for housing, the number of people looking for and entitled to houses and it will cut out what the Minister at present specifies, that sites in advance of need should not be provided.  If we attempt to take over land which is in advance of the immediate need, the county manager will say that we are not entitled to do so.  The Minister may shake his head but we have had instances of it in County Dublin where the Minister said that the area of land was unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The county managers could be forced to take over sites in advance of need, particularly in areas where it is likely that there will be a need for a number of houses later on and where land may come on the market now and if sold, may not come on the market again. There were one or two cases of this where areas of land amounting to ten or 20 acres were being sold and while four or five acres would meet the need, the county manager said he would not be entitled to take over the whole lot. The result was that the land was sold and now no other land is available or likely to become available.  This means that extra money has to be paid for sites.  In the village in which I live, a farm consisting of three fields was being sold.  The council at the time estimated that 34 houses would be required and they bought land which would cater for 44 houses.  There was a third field which the council refused to buy and which they were offered for £450.  The council eventually built houses on the two fields, the demand kept growing and last year they had to buy the third field for £1,650.  That is a typical example of where money could be saved if the right to buy land in advance of the need were accepted by the Minister and county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have partly discussed this amendment on other amendments and Deputy Tully has discussed it fairly comprehensively.  I know that the Minister may feel that some of the recommendations made by the elected representatives of County Dublin sounded a bit ridiculous or a <Col N="1316" /> bit unbalanced.  Housing needs today have to be anticipated and the position often arises where we might want 20 acres and the only place where we can get them is on a farm of 55 acres.  I am quoting an actual example in this.  The man says: &ldquo;I will sell the lot but if you take 20 acres, you will leave me with an uneconomic unit&rdquo;.  If the housing need in the area is great, and this is the only site suitable or available, the council should have the right to buy the farm.  The way to dispose of the balance should be made easy and there should be co-operation and consideration of these difficulties not only in the Department of Local Government but in the Land Commission as well.  There should be an easy way to subdivide the land and sell the balance to adjoining farmers, perhaps to bring their holdings up to an economic level, or give them land which they could use, and at the same time ensure that the housing needs of the local authority in the area would be met.</P>
      <P>I do not think that by and large the elected representatives are likely to go completely mad on this question or that they are going to insist that every big farm that becomes available should be purchased by the county council in anticipation of needs that may not arise in the next 100 years.  If we know that an area is going to become a development area in the foreseeable future and that land is available there, it is reasonable that the council should insist that a real effort is made to buy land, and they should have the authority to dispose of whatever they consider surplus to their requirements in the normal way.  They should also be facilitated through the Land Commission in relation to subdivision and all the other measures necessary in order to implement this type of provision. The amendment has a lot to recommend it and the Minister should very strongly consider accepting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be very wise to accept this amendment. I have in mind the position in Cork over a long number of years where we have been less fortunate than other areas, due to the fact that <Col N="1317" /> we have a county manager and two assistant county managers; the position of assistant county manager has become vacant and the temporary man does not take the same interest in the housing problem.  Time and again we have asked the assistant county manager for North Cork to make provision for houses.  The answer he always gave us was that he would have to see the county medical officer of health or have a survey made of the locality in which we were interested. The result is that a considerable amount of land has passed away which could have been acquired by the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is a little place convenient to the town of Mallow, and the Minister's colleague, Deputy Corry, came in here time and again and pressed the Minister in relation to housing around Mallow, and rightly so.  We find that outside the urban boundary of Mallow, it is hard to get sites because builders acquire all the available sites, and the parcels of land that are in the locality are not large enough.  If we were in a position to examine the housing programme, as is suggested in this amendment, so as to know exactly what the commitments in respect of land and housing requirements were in the area, we would be safeguarded in regard to the housing of our people. This amendment is a step in the right direction and as a member of a local authority over a long number of years, I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept it.  It is necessary and it is the only way by which the local authorities can act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The official view here is that the amendment is unnecessary. Section 56 provides that the local authorities may erect houses.  Section 57 provides that they may provide building sites, but they can neither build houses nor provide building sites if they have not got the land, and they are entitled to purchase land in keeping with their building programme, whether it is a five-year or a ten-year programme.  Under the 1946 Local Government Act, they could acquire land by agreement.  Under section 76 of this Bill, they will be able to buy <Col N="1318" /> land by compulsory acquisition for the purpose of providing sites for the erection of houses within their own area.  Deputy Clinton talked about his baby out in north County Dublin. Whether it was reasonable to allow them to purchase 260 acres when their needs were only seven acres is very doubtful, but if the local authority have a genuine building programme, they must have land and they are entitled to acquire the land under this Bill.</P>

      <P>We shall have to send for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs again because there is something wrong with the lines of communication.  What we have been talking about and what the Parliamentary Secretary has been discussing are miles apart.  Section 56 (1) says:</P>
      <P>A housing authority may erect, acquire, purchase, convert or reconstruct, lease or otherwise provide dwellings.</P>
      <P>That refers to dwellings.  It has nothing whatever to do with sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to sites in advance of need.  That is an entirely different thing from what the Parliamentary Secretary has been talking about.  Section 57 says:</P>
      <P>A housing authority may provide sites for building purposes on land acquired or appropriated by them for purposes of this Act and in connection with the provision of such sites may construct roads and lay out open spaces ...</P>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the amendment.</P>

      <P>Let us see what section 76 says: &ldquo;A housing authority may be authorised to acquire compulsorily&rdquo;&mdash;this is coming nearer to what <Col N="1319" /> we seek but it still does not meet it&mdash;&ldquo;for the purposes, and in accordance with section 75, of this Act, land not immediately required for those purposes, provided that the Minister is of opinion that there is reasonable expectation that the land will be required by the authority in the future ... &rdquo;  Here again this is something we want to do away with.  How would the Minister know whether or not the local authority would require the land in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to give the elected representatives on the local councils the right to say, as they alone know, where land will be required or is likely to be required in an area.  We do not believe that if a farm is up for sale the elected representatives should have to wait to tell the manager that there is land available, to wait until the manager writes to the Minister and until the Minister sends his reply in the usual way and will not decide upon it even within three months, and eventually the land is sold.  We are trying to give authority to the local representatives, when a farm is being sold, to say to the manager: &ldquo;We think we need that land in the future.  You go out and make arrangements to acquire it.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in an area in County Meath where in 1943, there were only 450 people living.  This is 1966 and there are about 1,250 people living there.  Inside the next ten years, if land is available, that area could double in size because it is a convenient <Col N="1320" /> area.  It is designated as a building area but the land is not available. If the Minister wants to be sticky about it, the manager cannot tell him that he requires sites for a further 300 houses in that area although the council are satisfied and have passed a resolution that 300 houses should be built in it.  The whole catch about this is that as the Bill is framed, if the local authority wanted to acquire sites in advance of need, they must, first of all, ask the county manager.  The county manager will ask the Minister. If there is a farm being sold, by the time the Minister gets round to it, the farm will be gone.  We are trying to shortcircuit this.</P>
      <P>We are also asking that twice a year the manager should report to the council the area of land available in the district, the site capacity of that land, the number of applicants for houses and the number of local authority houses in which more than one family resides.  It is true to say that there seems to be no record of our housing needs at the present time.  Some years ago the Minister asked a number of local authorities to comment on this and by the time the last reply came in, the first replies were altogether out of date.  In county Meath 1,600 houses were required.  In County Mayo, the number was 400.  Nobody believed that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The first estimation was that there were 460 houses needed and figures supplied now could still include a great number not originally included.  The whole thing depends on standards.  Each local authority should be able to say with certainty that certain particulars have been kept up to date and that they know where they stand at any time. If these figures are obtained now and not obtained again for ten years, the whole thing will have to be started from scratch all over again.  There is great merit in this amendment and we intend to see, as far as we can, that it is included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to apply the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860, to the service of a summons for the purpose of getting possession of a cottage or dwelling to sections 62, 66 and 105 of this Bill and to section 24 of the Labourers Act, 1936, as amended by section 101 of the Bill.  Section 87 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1860, provides for the service of a summons either personally or by leaving the same with some person being in occupation of such house or part of a house or tenement or, where the tenant of such house or part of a house or tenement was not residing therein, by serving the summons personally or by leaving the same at the place of abode of the tenant so holding over as aforesaid four clear days before the day appointed for the hearing of the matter of the said summons provided that if the person so holding over cannot be found and admission into the premises so over-holding cannot be obtained and the place of abode of such person shall not be known, the posting of such summons on some conspicuous part of the premises shall be deemed to be good service by such person.  This provision, I should say, is necessary in cases of difficulty in recovering possession of premises because of inability to serve the necessary summons because the defendant <Col N="1325" /> is not there or has gone abroad, and so on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 12 and 13, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A housing authority may acquire by agreement any land situate within or without their functional area although the area or tract of land offered for sale by auction or by private treaty is in excess of the reasonable requirements of the authority for immediate and further need, and, having reserved sufficient land for immediate and further needs, the housing authority may dispose of any surplus land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A housing authority may acquire land which is not suitable or convenient for the purposes of this <Col N="1328" /> Act provided that the land is acquired with a view to an exchange of that land for suitable land.</P>
    <P>(3)  The power conferred on a housing authority under this section shall be in addition to their powers to acquire land under section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two principles involved in this amendment.  The first is the right of a local authority to acquire land very much in excess of needs and to resell any portion of the land which they may not require.  I understand that in many cases if this had been permissible under existing legislation the local authority would have had cheap houses.  They could have bought land.  They could have used the portion they required for housing and could have sold the remainder at a handsome profit.  Because of the fact that it was not covered by legislation they were unable to do this.  They lost the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  Because they required a small portion, they were unable to get the big portion.</P>
    <P>The second point is that it would be possible for a local authority to acquire a portion of land which may not be suitable for housing but which if acquired could be exchanged for a portion of land which would be suitable for housing if somebody was prepared to give them an exchange.  There are specific cases where such an opportunity occurred and had to be let slip because of the fact that the legislation did not allow of its being done.</P>
    <P>The terms of the amendment are specific.  We believe that there is no reason why the Minister would not accept it.  It would improve the legislation before the House and ensure that local authorities will not be left without sites because of the fact that the only land available or likely to become available is greater than they need.  It cannot be suggested that the land will be left on their hands.  The amendment would allow them to resell it at a reasonable price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have more or less covered the points in the amendment <Col N="1329" /> in referring to the various problems that have arisen from time to time in an area where it is difficult to ensure that sites will be available always for the building of local authority houses. The manager can say, and in fact has said: &ldquo;It is not our job as a local authority to deal in the buying and selling of land&rdquo;.  That is a very ready answer to give the members of the council who see an opportunity of acquiring land adequate to the needs of the council not only for the present but for ten years ahead.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not an amendment that is particularly attractive to a Minister because a Minister gets very little credit for allowing money to be spent or spending money on sites.  The only thing he gets credit for it the production of houses.  If the houses are provided, there is no immediate credit for the provision of sites either for the members of the council or the Minister. There is no politics in it, let us say.  Nevertheless, it is a means of satisfying the housing needs.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;You did not do it when the money was available&rdquo;.  We want to be in a position to do it when the money becomes available and we cannot be in that position unless we have the sites.</P>
      <P>It must be accepted that you can buy cheaper sites if you buy a whole farm than if you go in to buy a field or small plot.  You can get a bargain in a big farm.  A local authority can provide that sort of money at the time the farm comes up for sale.  They can buy a big farm at a cheaper price. Invariably they are in a position to resell the portion that they believe is surplus to their requirements, say, over the next ten years.  They can sell it in parcels if they are facilitated in sub-division by the Land Commission and thus improve adjoining holdings.  It is an advantage very often to the adjoining holders who would not be in a position to buy the big farm but would be in a position to pay a reasonable price for a portion of it.  It would meet not only the needs of the housing authority but local needs of uneconomic holders at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the fear may be lurking <Col N="1330" /> in the Minister's mind that if he accepts the amendment and it becomes part of the legislation county councils will go mad and buy every big farm that comes on the market, regardless of cost.  I do not think there is any foundation for that anxiety or worry because I do not think it will happen. Occasionally a crackpot councillor may make a proposition in order to satisfy his vanity and show the local people that he was able to get the council to buy a particular farm but that will always be met by common sense in the council.  A proposition will not even reach the Minister unless it is a reasonable proposition that the council consider worthwhile, not only in relation to present needs but looking five or ten years ahead.</P>
    <P>It does not follow that the land so acquired will be in any way misused in the meantime.  It can be properly used and can bring in an income to the council and provide an important amenity for local people also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see the concern that has been shown by the Deputies who have spoken about this matter of site acquisition for forward needs.  I am glad that Deputies are in favour of this idea.  At the same time, I would remind them that I have been seeking to have this done for quite a considerable time.  Of course, it is necessary to have some idea of how much land one might want in order that there may be realism in regard to acquisition for forward needs.  The law has been there and has been completely ignored by housing authorities, the law that required them to have an annual survey of their entire situation in regard to housing. It was not done despite the fact that it was the law that it should be done.</P>
      <P>Starting in 1960, and not with 100 per cent success since then, to say the least of it, I have been trying to get local housing authorities to see the wisdom of the law which has been there for a long time which dictated that surveys should be carried out and kept up to date annually, for the very good reason that local authorities should know their needs as nearly exactly as could be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> In any event, there now seems to be a growing appreciation of the wisdom of that sort of assessment and survey in relation to the forward purchasing of sites for future development, not only taking into account the immediate situation as revealed by surveys, where these have been properly done, but other calculations which can only be regarded as informed guesses as to future demand.  These needs must be taken into consideration in regard to site acquisition if we are to have the programming, which is a very big element in this new legislation, the rational programming of building related to requirements not only as of today but projected into the future under all the various headings that can be of some use.</P>
    <P>We need not rely only on what is proposed in this Bill.  The House will recall that there are very definite and very wide and useful powers in relation to which I wrote to local authorities by way of circular letter on 25th May, 1965.  I shall quote the relevant excerpt:</P>
    <P>When the assessment of needs has been made and the resultant programmes prepared steps should be taken immediately to select and acquire sufficient sites to enable building to proceed on the basis planned in the programme.  Site acquisition should be proceeded with well ahead of the programme requirements. Particular attention should be paid to the difficulties which may be experienced in the first years of the programme in this respect.  Account should also be taken of the delays which may be involved by the probable need to resort in some cases to compulsory purchase order procedures.  Continuity of the building programme can only be assured by making certain that sites are available ahead of requirements for some years to come.  The new powers available to local authorities for forward site acquisition in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, should be fully utilised particularly in towns and larger villages <Col N="1332" /> where suitable sites should be acquired if necessary ahead of environmental services so that the benefit of the provision of services accrues to the local authority, its tenants, or to house purchasers.</P>
    <P>That is on housing site acquisition.</P>
    <P>The Act to which I have referred, though it does not deal with housing, deals in a very full way with the various matters raised by the Deputies supporting these amendments.  Practically everything advocated in the amendments can already be done and has been advocated by me in the circular letter to which I have referred. In addition to that, we have the more immediate and direct provisions of this Bill.  By agreement, local authorities may now acquire land without really knowing for what purpose they want it and there can be no question of their being tied down ever again.  By voluntary agreement, a council can acquire land without actually knowing the purpose to which they will put that land.  The difficulties outlined by Deputies have very little realism now. However, in section 76 of the Bill there is provision that, for the reasonable requirements of the council, compulsory acquisition powers are given. Reasonable requirements can be pretty wide.</P>
    <P>If all these things are taken into account, it will be readily appreciated, I think, that far from there not being freedom available to local authorities in this matter, there is a greater degree of freedom now than they ever had before.  Indeed, I cannot imagine them requiring any more freedom.  It is difficult in discussing a measure like this to divorce oneself from what the practice is.  It is difficult to transpose oneself from the present into the future. It is difficult to imagine what will be capable of being done when this measure becomes law.</P>

      <P>(1)  Any land acquired for the purposes of or appropriated for the purposes of or under this Act by a housing authority may be sold, leased or exchanged subject to such conditions as the authority may consider necessary having regard to the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully will find in that section that selling, leasing and exchanging will meet his requirements. Where land is needed, it is merely a case of the local authority having power to acquire it.  By agreement, they can acquire land for practically anything and they can also acquire land compulsorily.  Where it is necessary to acquire ten acres but the acquisition of that ten acres requires the acquisition of 20 acres, the local authority have power to acquire the full 20 acres in order to get the ten acres.</P>

If, in order to get that land, <Col N="1334" /> there is no other way of getting it than by buying more than is needed, and provided no other suitable land is available, then the local authority can go ahead and acquire the land.  If this is the only land, the only way is to buy much more land than you want.  As I say, you have that power, the power to acquire more land than you need. If this is the only way to get what you want and there is no alternative, the law empowers you to take whatever course is open to you.  Then you can have recourse to section 87 and you can sell, let or exchange.  I think we are fully covered there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain areas in which extensive tillage is carried out on smallish holdings which happen to be in an area in which the services necessary for houses exist.  These people would be quite satisfied if they could get an exchange of lands further away from the services and perhaps get the advantage of a small additional portion of land to compensate them for going a bit farther out.  That is the sort of exchange which Deputy Tully has in mind because immediately certain circumstances come to mind in which that type of problem exists for us.  If that power were there, then even by agreement we could make arrangements whereby we could give somewhat larger plots of land to these extensive market-gardener type of producers and in exchange, get a field conveniently situated for housing nearer to a village or town.</P>

      <P>At present it is a good argument that land is being used for extensive tillage if an attempt is being made by a local authority to <Col N="1336" /> acquire it, even though services are right beside it.  I am suggesting that if the circumstances warranted it, this power should be given to the local authority.  Does the Minister think it is already there?</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to follow somewhat the same reasoning as I mentioned in regard to buying more land than you want.  Where it is the only way, I would be prepared to follow the same lines.  If this is the only way in which you could get it, then you take steps accordingly.  It is hard to spell out the various devices in which one might find oneself in following this reasoning.  It is the reasonable and sensible line to follow, that you want something and there is only one way of getting it and therefore you take the only way open to you.  It seems reasonable and even if this sort of shuffle is required, then you must continue the shuffle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of areas adjacent to towns where some old crotchety person owns the most desirable piece of land and is making little use of it.  It could be readily developed and would supply the needs of a large number of people if the local authority could acquire it. I want to ensure that such a person cannot use the argument that it is being used for tillage and prevent its acquisition.  Land like that is fairly well protected, even by the courts.  If somebody attempts to get land like that for sites, the courts take a very lenient view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 84:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 25 and 26, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Before allocating any land for the purposes of the Land Acts the Land Commission shall inform a housing authority of the area and location of such land and the manager of the authority shall place any such communication before the next meeting of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a housing authority informs the Land Commission that the authority needs land in any specified area for their powers and duties and certifies <Col N="1338" /> that all or part of the lands in the hands of the Land Commission is suitable, the Land Commission shall first make an allocation of suitable land to the housing authority before allotting the lands for the purposes of the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever any local authority has land surplus to their needs that local authority shall, before disposing of the surplus land, offer the land to the housing authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is to ensure that when the Land Commission acquire a farm, before they allocate it, they should notify the local authority that the land is being allocated in order to make it possible to have sites made available on that land. There are in County Meath, for instance, a number of big farms which have been taken over by the Land Commission and allocated to various tenants.  Occasionally the local authority find that a farm has been taken over in an area where the local authority badly needs sites and sometimes they are able to contact the Land Commission in time and get the Land Commission to allocate portion of the farm for housing.  On occasion, however, it has happened that the Land Commission have taken over the farm and reached the stage where the allocation of the farm has been planned and when the local authority ask for the sites they are told there is none available.  Another case is where the Land Commission take over a farm and, while it does not happen often, it does happen, the farm is allocated before even the local people are aware that it has been fully taken over by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas in County Meath&mdash;and I am sure the same thing applies all over the country&mdash;in which because of their proximity to towns and to the city, land is very valuable. Around the Dunboyne-Clonee district the Meath County Council have been asked for £2,000 for an acre of land on which to build a county council cottage.  The Land Commission have acquired land in that area and there is no reason why they should not be <Col N="1339" /> asked, in cases such as this, to make sites available for housing before any other matter is considered.</P>
    <P>It will not break the Land Commission's heart to notify the local authority, when they take over a farm in the functional area of that local authority, that they have acquired that farm.  A simple letter to that effect, or a stencilled or printed letter which could be used again and again, would suffice.  The local authority will then know that land has been taken over by the Land Commission and can apply for sites if they require them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to require that housing should be regarded as having priority over everything else in land use.  There are circumstances arising in every local authority area where the Land Commission are operating. They go in and buy a big holding and they can get land that would be suitable for housing at a much lower price than it can be bought in the normal way when it has to be purchased in small parcels.  This priority should be acknowledged, and the local authority should get the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;We need a certain area of this land for housing.  We need some of it immediately and we estimate that over the next five years, we shall need so much more.  Therefore, we would ask you to reserve a certain area for us where it would be easy to service houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That again is just a question of setting up a system whereby there can be co-operation between the Land Commission and the local authorities. Local authorities may have land surplus to their needs.  We have examples of this and when the approach is made there is a reasonable response and it is accepted that the first call on the land should, perhaps, be to meet housing needs. However, it would be an additional safeguard if it were written into legislation that the Land Commission were required to offer this land first to the local authority to meet housing needs. Everybody acknowledges that housing should have priority over other forms of land use in any area.</P>

However, since the Committee Stage, we have been in communication with the Land Commission and we have had a careful look at this matter ourselves.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been in touch with the Land Commission and we are assured by them that up to the moment they are fully co-operative in all cases where they are approached in regard to land adjoining any town or any local authority area for housing or other local authority purposes.  I take it they are quite prepared to be as co-operative in the future as they have been in the past.  If it were a question of their not being co-operative in any circumstances, they do allot the land eventually.  I might add that we are still in consultation with them and with other bodies as well to the effect that we want more closely-knit co-operation in this matter of land use, land disposal and so forth.  We are trying to bring about a rational approach to the disposal of land, whether it be by Government agency, by a board, and so on, so that it will not be found that a sale has taken place without the knowledge of the local council who wanted the property, which has been sold to somebody <Col N="1341" /> else and is gone for ever.  We want to get around to this and I think we can more by co-operation than by compulsion. If it ever comes to the point that it is thought that this approach is not sufficient, then we shall have to be on the look out for a suitable measure under land legislation to have it enacted as a specific legal requirement rather than attempt to achieve it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only snag in the Minister's suggestion is that if the land is allocated or divided, it will be much more difficult to acquire a portion of land from a 20, 30 or 40 acre farmer than from a Land Commission estate where there might be 200 or 300 acres involved.  If the Minister would be prepared to indicate to the Land Commission that it is the view of this House that when they take over a farm in the area of a local authority, they should drop a note to that local authority to say that they have acquired the farm, it would meet a lot of our arguments.</P>
      <P>It must ultimately be included in some legislation that the local authorities have the right to acquire land from the Land Commission for housing. I am sorry that the Minister thinks it cannot be included in this Bill.  Even though the Land Commission can claim to have been reasonably co-operative, the position is that if the local authority find out immediately that the land has been acquired and request the Land Commission to make sites available and can prove that they need the sites, the Land Commission will, after a pretty lengthy time, make the sites available.  If the Land Commission get the farm and get an opportunity of dividing it before it comes to the notice of the local authority, then the local authority are out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Land Commission take over a farm and if the local authority ask for sites, even before they divide it, the Land Commission can still dicker. They can say that they do not consider it a suitable place to have a house erected.  I am amazed at the tendency of people who come from a <Col N="1342" /> congested district to object to a county council cottage being erected in close proximity to them.  If the Minister can indicate to the Land Commission that he and this House consider it desirable that this be done, it would meet the point for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the idea as necessary but from our communications with the Land Commission, I understand that the local authority cannot fail to be aware soon after acquisition that this has happened.  It is drawn to their attention for the purposes of rating and valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The Land Commission may take over a farm now and the fact of its being taken over will not come to the notice of the local authority for a considerable time.  It has been known in the case of farms taken over by the Land Commission that the local authority continues to serve the notice for the rates on the original owner, although the Land Commission have possession of it.  It can be up to a year or 18 months before the matter is brought officially to the notice of the local authority that the land has been acquired.</P>

      <P>This will include among the matters which the Minister may deal with on appeal the question of whether works are required by the section to be carried out.  Amendments Nos. 107 and 108 are to meet the case made by Deputies on Committee Stage that more guidance should be given in the type of work a local authority would be required to carry out in order to put the cottage into good structural condition for sale or vesting.  These two amendments provide that in deciding on works to be carried out the local authority must have regard to the needs set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill and also that the authority need not carry out work which it would be reasonable <Col N="1348" /> to expect could be carried out by the tenant of a dwelling under them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 108 is in fact a reversion to the Minister's original attitude when discussing this Bill on Committee Stage.  At first the Minister wanted to have nothing except &ldquo;good structural repair&rdquo; included.  He made the comment that anybody who was the tenant of a cottage should be expected to carry out repairs which he would be able to carry out.  We pointed out from this side of the House that very many people in the tenancy of cottages, because of their age, infirmity or other reasons, would be unable to carry out any repairs to the cottage.  I was under the impression the Minister had accepted that view.</P>
      <P>He subsequently agreed with me that the section referred to the conditions laid down that a housing authority should have regard to when considering whether a house was unfit for human habitation.  This is on page 78 of the Bill.  The Minister agreed with me it was reasonable to assume that a local authority should require their own houses to be kept in the same state of repair as a private individual who owned his house would keep his house in repair.  A council cottage before being vested must satisfy the conditions laid down in the Second Schedule to the Bill, which are:</P>
      <P>1.  Stability;</P>
      <P>2.  Resistance to spread of fire;</P>
      <P>3.  Safety of staircases and common passages including the state of paving in any yard or open space appurtenant to the house;</P>
      <P>4.  Resistance to moisture;</P>
      <P>5.  Resistance to transmission of heat;</P>
      <P>6.  Resistance to transmission of sound;</P>
      <P>7.  Resistance to infestation;</P>
      <P>8.  Water supply, sanitary arrangements and drainage;</P>
      <P>9.  Air space and ventilation;</P>
      <P>10.  Natural and artificial lighting;</P>
      <P>11.  Facilities for preparing, storing and cooking food;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> 12.  The extent to which the house does not comply with any standard or requirement (other than a standard or requirement relating to any matter hereinbefore mentioned) of building bye-laws in force in the area under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1964, or building regulations in force in the area under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted that.  If he does not mind the use of the expression, I think it is sharp practice on the part of the Minister and his Department to introduce on Report Stage this amendment which in fact appears to nullify completely the guarantee he gave to the House on the previous occasion.  It appears as if the anxiety now is to get back to the original arrangement whereby, if a house is not in good structural repair, what happens after that is a matter for the tenant and not for the local authority. I pointed out to him at the time that houses in good structural repair might be in a bad sanitary condition.  Most of the round towers in this country are in good structural repair but nobody can say they are in good sanitary condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that up to 80 per cent of the appeals by tenants to him against the state of cottages vested up to now have been upheld by him.  He is including in this a section which requires a deposit to be paid by a person who is asking to have a cottage re-examined, and which he will forfeit if his request is found to be unjustified. It is most unwise to attempt to put in a subsection such as this.  I want to say that as far as we are concerned, we will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 108 is objectionable and unacceptable.  It only helps, as far as I can see, to reinforce the objectionable subsection (4) of section 104, the subsection to which we referred on Committee Stage. It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition <Col N="1350" /> regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure.</P>
    <P>We felt that that was an unreasonable provision and strongly objected to it at the time.  Now, the Minister comes in here today and says he is setting out more or less to meet these objections. In fact, I hold that this amendment reinforces the position and gives all the necessary ammunition to a county manager who wants to do the very minimum.  Mind you, the inclination has been not to overdo cottage repairs.  I know some have been extremely costly, mainly because they were left for far too long without getting attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this goes through, it will enable the local authorities to do a very poor job on cottage repairs and a position will eventually be arrived at in which these houses will deteriorate because of the inability of the tenant-purchaser to look after these repairs and to take charge of them because of the cost of them and because of the difficulty in having them carried out.  Nearly all the local authorities have, I think, a ready-made organisation for this type of work.  It would cost them less and it would be much easier for them to attend to this type of repair.  The interpretation of this is what beats the tenant completely:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a housing authority to carry out any works as respects which it would be reasonable to expect that they could be carried out by a tenant of a dwelling provided by the authority under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is to decide what it is reasonable to expect could be carried out by a tenant of a dwelling provided by a local authority under this measure?  It is reasonable for a tenant to put in a pane of glass or to paint the front door or something of that sort.  It depends on who is interpreting what is reasonable <Col N="1351" /> and what is not reasonable.  Again, experience goes to indicate that responsible officials can be reasonable on the wrong side, often.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was raised on Committee Stage I made a contribution to the debate.  I rather hoped that, by reason of the case made at the time, the Minister and his Department would realise that what they were doing in this new Housing Bill was to take from county council tenants a fundamental right which they had enjoyed under the old Acts of appealing against the kind of repair job carried out to their cottage if they were dissatisfied with that kind of repair.  In the present case, if the tenant vesting his or her cottage is dissatisfied with the kind of repair carried out, he or she has a fundamental right to appeal to the Minister, within 30 days of receipt of the notification from the authority, to have a determination, as it is called, carried out.  These determinations, these appeals against vesting repairs, are floating into the Minister's Department by the thousand every year.  It is a right which tenants widely avail of.  It is disturbing in the extreme to realise that, of these multitudinous appeals, some 80 per cent are being upheld in the Minister's Department as being valid and justified and, arising from the further inspection which is carried out, additional repairs are recommended and the local authority are obliged to go back in each instance and carry out these additional repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, we have agreed and positive evidence concerning the inadequacy of the repairs at present being carried out for vesting purposes.  Instead of solidifying the tenants' rights in this matter, the Minister proposes to filch from them the rights they enjoyed in respect of adequate repair.  He wants the tenants to be satisfied now, under amendment No. 108, with repairs of a structural nature only.  This amendment provides that nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a housing authority to carry out any works as respects which it would be reasonable to expect that they could be <Col N="1352" /> carried out by a tenant of a dwelling provided by the authority under this Act.  We all have experience, as members of housing authorities, of how county managers will construe this particular section.  The Minister must be very conscious of it that, in future, it will mean that the comprehensive repair job which was carried out in the past will not be carried out in the future.  The house will be inspected for mere structural defects.  If there are any evident, these will be repaired.  However, the replacement of timber that may be deteriorating or rotten in respect of doors, windows, floors and ceilings will not be included.  The remedying of smoky chimneys, as the Minister realises, is a constant complaint as well as the overall necessity to make the house generally habitable and comfortable.  All of these detailed repairs which the tenant was used to having carried out in the past, and had a right to appeal against if he was not satisfied, are now being set aside.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister should do this.  I appreciate that it must be a great embarrassment to him and to his Department that such a high percentage of appeals are being upheld&mdash;up to 80 per cent&mdash;and I repeat that this is a clear indication of the inadequacy of the repairs carried out.  It is rather a pity that that situation will now be worsened by permitting the managers of housing authorities to carry out mere structural repairs.  &ldquo;Structural repairs&rdquo; means virtually nothing.  As Deputy Tully has said, an old round tower could be said to be structurally satisfactory but that does not necessarily mean that it is fit for human habitation.  Adequate repairs and the sanitary services that a family require in these modern times should be provided.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of deep regret to us that the sentiments we expressed on Committee Stage in respect of this matter have not been conceded.  Indeed, we felt we had the Minister with us in respect of maintaining the rights of the tenants under this section but he seems to have departed altogether from that position.</P>
    <P>He has now gone back under this <Col N="1353" /> amendment to structural repairs.  That is to be deplored.  I can only hope the Minister will see the wisdom of conceding our wishes in this matter.  We are not asking anything new.  We are merely asking that the provisions contained in the old Act will be continued in this Bill, preserving the right of tenants in respect of adequate repairs. When we say adequate repairs, we mean all those things which are of a costly nature and normally outside the scope of the average tenant by reason of lack of skill or finance.  They have been done up to now.  If a local authority has not been doing them the Minister has compelled them to do them by the many determination orders he has made.  It is extremely surprising that the amendment proposed by the Minister today does not improve in any way the position originally outlined in the section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to remind the Minister of the situation that exists particularly in rural areas where elderly persons occupy local authority houses.  Some of these people at this stage are living on old age pension.  In a number of cases, the houses they occupy are old.  What to an engineer dealing with a district might appear minor repairs which ought to be done by the tenant could impose grievous hardship on the tenants.  For instance, portion of a floor may have become rotted through damp.  Window sashes may have become defective.  Such things may appear to be minor matters to an engineer having the burden of repairs to be carried out in an area but to the individual they would be serious matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that he had a volume of appeals coming into his Department.  We are all aware that you can get unreasonable people who feel that much more should be done than could reasonably be expected.  As originally drafted, the section gave much more discretion and was more open.  A county manager must depend on the information given to him by his engineering officers responsible for cottage repairs who have the burden of work to be done <Col N="1354" /> for an entire area as a result of the repair programme not having been properly carried out over the years. There would be a falling back on subsection (4) of the section in regard to matters not related to the stability of the structure.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that in respect of the matters to which I have referred, particularly where elderly people are concerned, he should act in the interests of the tenants just as he has to act in the interests of those providing the money for the repairs. The Minister's powers should be exercised in respect of the tenants.  The provision was more reasonable as drafted.</P>

      <P>After all our amendments on this and earlier Stages, it makes the hackles rise when one has to listen to Deputy Treacy talking about something which obviously he does not know anything about and did not take the trouble to read and to Deputy Tully accusing me of going back on what I said on an earlier Stage. Here is what I did say in reference to this subsection (4) that is being talked about in the discussion on Tuesday, 30th November, Volume 219 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I think I had better restate what I said earlier on this matter, lest it may not have been understood or, indeed, heard by some of the Deputies here, that is, that in so far as subsection (4) of the section is concerned, my intention, expressed to the House earlier, is that this subsection will be amended so as to bring about the situation wherein repairs which will be required to be done before vesting, and which cannot reasonably be expected to be done by the tenant, will be included.</P>
      <P>Further down, in the next column, I said:</P>
      <P>This proposed change in subsection (4), in whatever form of words may be thought necessary by the draftsmen, will bring about the situation that repairs, other than those which can reasonably be expected to be done by the tenant, will in fact be carried out by the local authority.</P>

      <P>All I am saying&mdash;and I am not going to repeat it; I have already repeated it twice&mdash;is that I am living up to what I said there.  If Deputies do not believe me they can seek it out and they will find that that is so.  They will also find in regard to further matters about which there is this wailing about what might be reasonably expected to be done by the tenants themselves, that this is a realism that should long since have been brought into the matter of repairs to these houses provided at public expense, badly maintained because of the lack of public moneys through the rates.  There are all the little things that one would do if he had any regard for the premises in which he lived being neglected by those well able to do them and then expecting the local authority to do them.  A great deal of the trouble is due to the fact that a number of councillors go around telling people what they should look for, in case they would not look for enough.  That is a practice not to be condoned.  It should be discouraged rather than encouraged.  It is a practice of, I hope, a minority of councillors, but it is certainly the established practice in many cases at the moment: what can one get the people to crib about; what can one get for nothing, by some device or other, even though whatever it is could be provided much more cheaply by oneself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give an indication of the attitude of mind, I have heard it said that things can be done more cheaply because local authorities have these readymade gangs to go around and do these jobs.  I saw a public body the other day doing the job of opening a window that was stuck because of bad painting by the same organisation a short time before.  A gentleman arrived and looked at the window.  The window was on the ground floor and easily accessible, both inside and out. But the job could not be done without some help and the gentleman went away and came back with two men <Col N="1357" /> carrying two ladders and a bag of tools.  He supervised the ladders being put up inside and out and the two men opening the window.  If that is typical of what one can regard as efficiency, then we may have another think coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Deputy Corish's question given on 25th January, 1966, which indicated the Government's intentions on future policy in relation to public transport and CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I would also remind the Deputy that under the Transport Act, 1964, CIE are in receipt of an annual grant of £2 million to enable the Board to discharge its duty under the Act of conducting its undertaking so that after allowing for the grant, its operating expenditure shall not be greater, taking one year with another, than its revenue. In so far as the Board's expenditure may exceed its revenue plus the grant it is incumbent on the Board to effect economies by reducing unremunerative services or by other means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report in the newspapers&mdash; and if I am not mistaken, it was in the <i>Evening Press,</i> the Minister's Party organ&mdash;of an alleged statement by the Chairman of CIE to the effect that CIE was broke?  Does he agree with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When the General Manager of CIE used the word &ldquo;broke&rdquo;, what he really meant was that the revenue and expenditure of CIE in the present year are such that it would be impossible for CIE, without raising fares and rates, to incur any further liabilities.  It was perhaps a wrong word to use in the circumstances but that is what he meant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated now and previously that the Government propose to restrict the subsidy to CIE to £2 million.  In the light of the just demands made by the unions representing the workers which CIE will have to meet in part, if not in entirety, does he seriously consider that that figure is adequate to meet the situation in which CIE will shortly find itself?  If he does not consider that it is adequate, can he indicate what is the future of CIE to be?  Is he further aware that there is considerable discussion in the country as to the mention which has been frequently made of the possibility of CIE reverting to private ownership for road haulage and that there is considerable interest in the city of Dublin in the <Col N="1366" /> suggestion made by CIE spokesmen&mdash; and if I do not make a mistake, by the Minister himself&mdash;of the possibility of the municipalisation of the Dublin bus services, with a consequent reduction in fares for Dublin workers which is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy evidently forgets that in relation to Dublin city transport, while there is a profit, the profit amounts to some one-seventh of a penny per passenger journey.  I informed the Deputy, when he asked a previous question, that the loss on the Dublin city suburban services run by CIE is greater than the profit made on the Dublin city bus services, so that the question of there being a large profit available to CIE as a whole on the Dublin city services does not arise. In regard to the second question asked by the Deputy, I made a very detailed statement in regard to the whole position of CIE, and I do not think it necessary for me to enlarge upon that now.  I did not say that any services of CIE would be municipalised.  I spoke of what could happen if CIE got itself into an extremely serious financial position arising from a considerable disruption of the service.  That situation has not arisen.  Therefore, I do not propose to speak about it now. What I was speaking about was a very remote possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in a press release of 6th January last the Minister indicated that if Dublin city services were to be operated as a unit without the need of cross-subsidisation, as he put it&mdash;in other words, without Dublin bus users being required to subsidise the rest of the country&mdash;there could be a reduction of city fares?  Did the Minister not state that in a press release of 6th January last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if the Deputy reads the statement as a whole, he will find that that related to a complete examination of the system in which all factors would be taken into account, not only the bus services but the railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If those services were entirely separated.  The fact that CIE suburban services are losing money at a rate greater than the profit cleared by the Dublin city services would also have to be taken into account in any decision the Government might have to make if that very serious and, I hope, unlikely eventuality should arise.</P>

If so, will any compensation be forthcoming to workers who undoubtedly will become redundant because of such a change?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the urgent need for an electricity supply at Fuhir, Castletownbere, County Cork, particularly in view of the fact that a farmhouse guest scheme for tourists is to be set up in the area; and if he will take steps to ensure that a supply is provided as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Castletownbere rural area in which the townland of Fuhir is situated is one of the largest rural areas in the country.  I am <Col N="1368" /> informed by the Electricity Supply Board that construction work under the post development scheme is going on in the area for some months and it is estimated that it will take two years to supply all the householders who require electricity.  The construction crew is at present working in that portion of the area which has already been recanvassed and supply is being extended to the householders who have accepted terms.</P>
      <P>The region around Fuhir has not yet been recanvassed and it will be at least 12 months before supply can be extended.</P>
      <P>Most townlands in the Castletownbere area are connected with the tourist industry in one way or another and for this reason it is felt that the Board's programme for the area should not be disrupted.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous questions, the ESB are prepared, subject to the exigencies of planning requirement, to consider especially premises in which tourist business is carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that on the occasion of a recent visit to Berehaven, he expressed himself very strongly in favour of developing the Berehaven Peninsula as a tourist area, and he assured a large audience there that any help or assistance he could give towards that development would be gladly given?  Arising from that statement and in view of the fact that the people in Berehaven are doing everything they possibly can to develop this area as a tourist area, will the Minister not change his view as expressed in the reply to this question, that Fuhir must wait for two years before ESB service is provided?  Surely he will agree that the ESB service is the first essential for the development of an area such as Berehaven for tourist purposes?  The Minister stated that no part of the country had greater potential than Berehaven for tourist development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the whole of the area, the Beara Peninsula, <Col N="1369" /> as being an area for tourist promotion. I will ask the ESB to see if this particular area deserves some priority treatment in relation to the claims of the whole area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the people in this area are endeavouring to develop the farmhouse holiday scheme in which the Minister is so interested.  In view of the expressed interest of the Minister in this district and his recent visit there, I would ask him to get the ESB to interest themselves in this area.  The people down there require his co-operation.</P>

      <P>In the five year <Col N="1373" /> period from 1st January, 1961, to 31st December, 1965, 77 compassionate gratuities were paid in respect of employees of the Department of Defence who died in service and who had not less than the minimum service required by the relevant statutory provisions for the grant of a gratuity. No gratuity was awarded in respect of four employees of the Department who died in service.  In these cases, although the employees had the necessary qualifying service, they left no dependents in favour of whom an award could be made.  Records are not available to show the number of deceased employees who died in service and in respect of whom an award was not made because they had less than the requisite service, or to show the number of employees who died after leaving the service of the Department.</P>

It is not a matter of distinction between bridges and culverts; the work in the channel requires expensive excavation in rock.</P>

      <P>I informed the Deputy on 14th December that particulars of the interest rate on house-purchase loans currently charged by each authority are not available in my Department, but that they normally lend at ½ per cent above the prevailing Local Loans Fund rate.

The qualifications for election to local authorities referred to in paragraph I were removed by the Electoral Act, 1963, as were some of the disqualifications in paragraph 2.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully alive to the gravity of the road accident problem, but I am not aware that the position in Dublin is as described by the Deputy.  Provisional figures now available show that in 1965 the number of persons killed in road accidents in the Dublin Metropolitan area was 82. Compared with the 74 people killed in the same area in 1964, this figure shows an increase of about 11 per cent. Despite the increase in fatal accidents, the overall figure for accidents in the area declined slightly from 1,061 in 1964 to 1,049 last year.  As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply last Tuesday to a somewhat similar question by Deputy L'Estrange in which I set out the steps which are being taken in the matter of road safety. I might add that I hope the public will react to the disquieting figures of road deaths and injuries by the exercise <Col N="1383" /> of care at all times when using the roads; this is essential if we are to master the road accident problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the question relates to continuity of employment for pension purposes.  The Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, provides that a pensionable servant of a local authority retains his pensionable status continuously until the servant himself terminates it by giving notice in writing in the month of April of any year to the local authority that his name is to be removed from the register of pensionable servants, or until he dies or otherwise ceases to be a servant, and the local authority decide not to so employ him again.  Absence from work on any particular occasion, whether due to illness or otherwise, and regardless of the duration of the absence, does not alter this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case referred to in the question the county council sought land for housing on an estate purchased by the Land Commission.  Following discussions between officials of the Land Commission and representatives of the county council, the Land Commission agreed to make a 30-acre parcel available. At the same time the Land Commission indicated that, if the county council found that they required more land, they would be afforded an opportunity of making an offer for the 60-acre parcel (which includes a large house).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Letters from the county council to the Land Commission within the past six months were dated 14th September, 1965; 13th October, 1965; 6th December, 1965; 31st December, 1965, and 28th January, 1966.  Replies issued by the Land Commission were dated 23rd September, 1965; 21st October, 1965; 27th October, 1965; 13th December, 1965; and 8th February, 1966.  In general the letters from the county council sought information as to price required and terms of sale for each of the two parcels and, in the case of the 30-acre parcel, asked for modification of a condition which the Land Commission had proposed in their letter of 27th October, 1965.  The Land Commission's <Col N="1385" /> letters to the county council have replied to all the questions raised in relation to the 30-acre parcel&mdash;and the condition which the county council wished to have set aside has in fact been set aside.  As regards the 60-acre parcel, the Land Commission have explained that this property, if not purchased by the council, will probably be offered for sale by auction&mdash;in which event the prior disclosure of the reserve price would most likely prove a disadvantage.  In these circumstances, the Land Commission have stated that they ought not name a price at this stage.  If, however, the county council decide that they would wish to acquire the property, subject to agreement on price, and if they then decide what price they would be willing to pay, they can come to the Land Commission with a proposal and it should not be difficult to ascertain whether agreement is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Defence has not met since 10th July, 1958, because a meeting of the Council since that date has not been considered necessary.</P>
      <P>In the earlier years the statutory authority for the Council provided for at least one meeting of the Council every six months.  Since 1st January, 1955, however, the Defence Act, 1954, which contains the statutory authority for the Council, the purpose of which is to aid and counsel the Minister, provides that it shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It may be mentioned that in the earlier years it was the practice to ask the Council to consider many proposals ranging over a wide variety of aspects of the Department's work but, with the build-up over the years of a code of legislation, regulations and administrative procedures, the necessity for asking the Council to meet at frequent or regular intervals no longer arose.  In recent years, as I have said, the need has not arisen to convene formal meetings of the Council of Defence.

If it be, as he said, that he meets these persons individually, why does he not meet them collectively in order to get their joint advice?

      <P>It would not be exactly true to say that there has been an alarming decrease.  In one particular fertiliser, nitrogen, there is a decrease of some significance, which is very disappointing indeed.  The others are more or less holding their own.  I agree that that is not enough and that we should have increased consumption of more fertilisers.  We are taking a few measures to try to stimulate consumption of these fertilisers through the advisory service and in one way and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. However, for the information of the Deputy, I could point out that there is a decided case which indicates that ownership of the milk passes to the receiver when he has examined it and found it suitable.  In connection with that case, I should mention that it refers to the delivery of milk by an independent supplier to a non-creamery premises, in other words to a private premises.  The situation could conceivably be different where a creamery milk supplier was supplying milk to a co-operative of which he himself was a member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, that is not correct, though the position is that a member of a co-operative society is, speaking generally, bound by the rules of the society and disputes in regard to matters of this sort between a member of the society and his fellow-members would, in the first instance, have to be decided by the rules of the society.  Most of these rules provide, of course, for arbitration.  Whether or not a member dissatisfied with the outcome of this particular process would have access to the courts is not really <Col N="1397" /> for me to determine.  I might say, on the general issue, that the whole idea of a co-operative society, creamery or anything else, is that the members themselves get together to control their own production.  It is the members who own the co-operative.  It is the members who decide how it is to be run and, if a member has any complaint about the way in which his milk is received, or treated, that is a matter for the member and his fellow members working through their committee.</P>

Surely it is reasonable that money collected in this way at very little expense&mdash;I have had experience of it; after being in with the Minister for Health, I came out and it was only at Butt Bridge that I noticed I had £1 on the windscreen&mdash;should be set aside for providing parking spaces?</P>

      <P>The greatest problem arises in the vicinity of large built-up areas where an offending dog, even if seen at fairly close quarters, often cannot be recognised or identified as to its owner.  Even if actually shot dead or captured, this particular difficulty is not always overcome though the proposal to require dogs to have identity tags, as announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, should assist in these cases and should also make some dog-owners more careful than they are now.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps add that, in the experience of the Garda Síochána, many farmers who suffer loss will not give evidence to support a prosecution as it frequently turns out that the dog-owner is somebody known to them who had no suspicion that his dog was responsible.</P>

      <P>There is no question of its being a white elephant and I want to reject the implication in the Deputy's remark.  This is a technical matter which is being actively worked out with the architects and contractors.

      <P>Payments to my Department by the sponsors totalled £28,800.  My Department's disbursements in respect of the tour totalled £28,400.  The difference, £400, falls somewhat short of the sum which would be required to cover fully pension liability in respect of the members of the Band.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if a new subpostmaster has been appointed to Drumcondra Road subpostoffice, Dublin; and, if so, if he will state the name of the person appointed, his age and qualifications; whether suitable premises are available; if so, where; whether the present acting post-mistress applied for the position; and, if so, why she was not appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Thomas F. Gray has been appointed subpost-master of Drumcondra Road subpostoffice. When applying for the appointment, Mr. Gray offered suitable premises in Lower Drumcondra Road near the present suboffice which he expected to be able to provide. It now transpires that he is unable to provide these premises and he is endeavouring to secure alternative premises in the area.  It would be contrary to established practice to state the qualifications of any of the candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the main qualification of the person appointed is that he is a Fianna Fáil city councillor, the chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin North-Central? Further, is it a fact that the present acting subpostmistress is having the bit taken out of her mouth because she has in effect run this sub-post office for her predecessor for five years and now the Minister is moving the post office from the premises it has occupied in the past 30 years?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that he is removing the post office from the premises in which it has been for the past 30 years and appointing a person who has no suitable premises? Furthermore, is it not normal Post Office practice to insist on a suitable premises being provided within a matter of weeks of the appointment? This man tried to bully the present tenant into giving him the office as a sub-tenant and she refused.</P>

      <P>The helicopter cost £60,000, and the Department of Defence have informed us that the rate is £67 per hour, which includes £22 10s. for depreciation of the helicopter, £20 for its care and maintenance, £13 for overheads, £5 for fuel and oil, and the balance covers the cost of the crew and other incidentals.  The helicopter, which costs £60,000, has a normal life of only five years and a residual value at the end of £15,000. Therefore, the depreciation over a period of five years is £45,000, which on the basis of 400 hours usage per year works out at £22 10s. per hour.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="1417" /> to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>My general intentions in regard to the institutional care of the aged were set out in the recent White Paper, which indicated that the county homes should be developed as long-stay hospitals, and that they should be adequately staffed and equipped to deal with the rehabilitation or care of patients.  Where only shelter and maintenance are needed, as distinct from medical care, it is intended that they will be provided in accommodation separate from that for the chronically ill.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to indicate the detailed arrangements which will be made.  I have established an interdepartmental committee to consider matters in this field and I have asked it to keep in mind the points raised by the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>Whilst entitlement to hospital services under section 15 of the Health Act for a person other than a farmer or insured worker is determined by his annual means, his actual contribution towards the cost of hospital services provided for him may vary from nothing up to 10/- per day. It is open to a health authority, in assessing the amount of any such contribution, to take into account both the current and normal financial circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to general medical services under section 14 of the Health Act, that is, the medical card, depends on whether or not a person is in a position, by his own means, to meet the cost of such services.  Here also the person's overall financial position may be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility in individual cases for services under sections 14 and 15 of the Health Act, 1953, rests with the health authority concerned, subject in the case of applications under section 15, to the person's right of appeal to the Minister as regards the amount of annual means.  I have already informed the Deputy that if he will furnish particulars of any case in which he considers that an unreasonable attitude has been adopted by the health authority in seeking a contribution towards the cost of hospital services, I shall have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Dunne has given notice he wishes to raise the subject matter of Question No. 39 of 1st February, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question on 1st February I asked the Minister for Local Government what progress, if any, had been made towards the provision of swimming pools, community centre and physical culture facilities at Ballyfermot, Dublin.  I understand the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that I may raise the question of swimming pools on this occasion.  I do not know why he does not permit me to refer to the other matters mentioned in the question. However, for the moment this will suffice.  In reply to my question the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The provision of swimming facilities in the Dublin area, including a pool at Ballyfermot, is still under examination ...</P>
      <P>I went on to press the Minister on this point.  I indicated to him that this area of Ballyfermot&mdash;which, I think, I mentioned before in this House &mdash;is the most densely-populated working class area in Ireland.  It has been said it is bigger than the city of Waterford.  The population of Ballyfermot is nearly twice that of Waterford. The estimated population of the Ballyfermot housing scheme is in the neighbourhood of 40,000.  It would be reasonable to say that half of these would be children under 17 years of age.  I remember I was a black-haired stripling when Ballyfermot was started to be built.  That was a long time ago. I was not long out of school, contemplating the road that lay before me. In all that time, almost 25 years, this huge area has lain completely unserviced from the point of view of what can be described as no more than minimal amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is mentioned in the question, there are absolutely no facilities in that area for a community centre, no place <Col N="1430" /> where the people have a right to meet. The De La Salle Brothers occasionally are kind enough to afford the use of their premises for meetings.  But there is no municipal meeting place and no public parks as such&mdash;no place where the youth can go for gymnastics and, more especially, no swimming pools to which young people can have recourse in summer time.  If the youth feel like taking a dip, they have to go to the canal or the seaside.  The seaside is distant, and the canal is dangerous.  I have long felt that bathing in the canal is something which should not be necessary, but there is no other recourse for the youth of the city than the canal, which is rat-infested and obviously dangerous to the health of any person using it for swimming.  I do not think anybody would venture to think of using the Liffey for swimming, although some hardy souls do so annually in the Liffey swim.  How they survive, I do not know.  I know one person who did it, and he did not get over it for many years.</P>
    <P>This question of the urgent need for the provision of a swimming pool at Ballyfermot is a symptom of the neglect which is evident throughout the entire city in the matter of the provision of swimming pools.  Any city of a size comparable with Dublin in practically any other country in Europe will be found on examination to have a number of swimming pools for the youth, usually run by the city authorities.  In this city of ours, we have two municipal baths, Tara Street and the Iveagh, for a population estimated by the Central Statistics Office at 550,547.</P>
    <P>It is not as if this matter has only been raised by me last week.  As a matter of curiosity, I went through the Index to the Dáil Debates to see how many times I have raised this before during the past five years.  This is apart from the number of times I raised it between 1948 and 1957 in the course of debates here on housing and in answers to questions.  For the past five years, I find I have asked Dáil questions in relation to this matter. One was on Thursday, 20th June, <Col N="1431" /> 1963, as reported at column 1444 of the Official Report.  Here is the quotation:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Swimming Pools.</P>
    <P>19.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of plans for the provision of swimming pools by Dublin Corporation in the districts of (a) Ballyfermot and (b) Walkinstown; and whether he will indicate the location and date of provision of this desirable amenity in the areas named.</P>
    <P>This was in 1963.  In reply, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any definite plans for the provision of swimming pools by Dublin Corporation in the districts of Ballyfermot and Walkinstown.  Plans have been submitted to my Department for the provision of a swimming pool at Crumlin. ...</P>
    <P>I asked him, then, if he was aware of the urgent need for the provision of a swimming pool at Ballyfermot and Walkinstown and the Minister indicated that, to a large extent, he agreed with what I had to say.  That was on 20th June, 1963.</P>
    <P>On 24th October, 1963, as reported at column 288 of the Official Report, I asked the Minister the following question:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Swimming Pools.</P>
    <P>60.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government what steps, if any, are being taken by the local authority to provide adequate swimming pools at Ballyfermot, Walkinstown and other densely populated Dublin suburban districts.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was much the same as the previous one.  It made reference to the prospect of a pool at Crumlin.</P>
    <P>The next question I asked was Question No. 39 on 21st April, 1964. It reads as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Dublin Swimming Pools.</P>
    <P>39.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government if he is <Col N="1432" /> aware of the need for an adequate swimming pool with lifeguards, for the use of children in Ballyfermot, Dublin; and whether he is aware of any plans for the provision of this amenity.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was in the same strain.  He was aware of the need for increased swimming facilities in Dublin.  There was a suggestion of a proposed pool at Crumlin.  Dublin Corporation, he said on that date&mdash; 21st April, 1964&mdash;intend to provide further pools in areas remote from the sea and this was receiving the consideration, he said, of the corporation at that time.  I asked the Minister to take an interest in the matter and again mentioned the problem of Ballyfermot and the need for special attention for Ballyfermot because of its population. He said there was no need for him to be asked to do that because, if he had his way, the pools would already be there.</P>
    <P>On 9th June, 1965, I again asked the Minister about the matter.  Here is the relevant quotation, as reported at column 499 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Ballyfermot (Dublin) Swimming Pools.</P>
    <P>51.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government what steps, if any, Dublin Corporation are taking to provide swimming pools and an assembly hall at Ballyfermot, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of providing a swimming pool at Ballyfermot is included as an item in a planned programme for new swimming pools which is in the early stages of investigation by Dublin Corporation, and that the selection of a suitable site for the purpose is receiving attention.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer also to that part of my question which had reference to the need for an assembly hall.  At any rate, it would appear that, on that date&mdash;June of last year&mdash;something was happening at long last.</P>
    <P>Again, on 28th October, 1965, as reported at column 740 of the Official <Col N="1433" /> Report, I asked Question No. 13 and the relevant quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Dublin Swimming Pools.</P>
    <P>13.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is satisfied with the present position regarding swimming pools in the Dublin area where only two pools exist to meet the needs of 600,000 people; and, if not, what steps he is taking to remedy this position.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the present position in Dublin city area.  In March last, when I announced details of the £16,000 prototype indoor heated pool, a proposal had been received from the corporation for a pool at Crumlin estimated to cost £164,000.</P>
    <P>He said he requested the corporation to reconsider the proposal in the light of the developments regarding the prototype pool and in connection with the suggestion that a number of low-cost pools might be provided for the city area with the minimum delay.  He then said that the corporation submitted a proposal for a pool costing £48,750 and that that proposal was under examination.  This, I take it, was based on the prototype pool to which he had referred.  That was in October of last year.</P>
    <P>The other day, on 1st February, 1966, I asked the Minister the sixth question since 1963 &mdash; something over two and a half years.  As reported at column 509 of the Official Report, the relevant quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Ballyfermot (Dublin) Amenities.</P>
    <P>39.  Mr. S. Dunne asked the Minister for Local Government what progress, if any, has been made towards the provision of swimming pools, a community centre and physical culture facilities at Ballyfermot, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The provision of swimming facilities in the Dublin area, including a pool at Ballyfermot, is still under examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> I pressed him on that and asked him when he would reach finality in the matter.  He said, and this is the most that could be wrung from him:</P>
    <P>We will continue the consideration to its conclusion.</P>
    <P>That sentence shows what can happen to a man who stays too long with civil servants: it is a classic piece of Civil Service English.</P>
    <P>In my view, this shows an absence of a proper appreciation of the urgency of this problem.  I suppose the Minister is entitled to say that the corporation have not been doing what they should do in this matter.  In so doing, he is, by imputation. criticising his own colleagues on the corporation, as well as the members of all other Parties, and the officials of the corporation. I have not been a member of the corporation and I do not think I should indulge too much in criticism of that body.  I am a member of this House, however, and I have raised this matter several times.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the provision of a swimming pool in an area such as Ballyfermot must lie at the Minister's doorstep.  While the Minister, in answering my questions, expressed sympathy with the idea, he has taken no definite steps to expedite the provision of this pool.  Even last week, he said he was pursuing the consideration to its conclusion.  In other words, it is lolling on the job&mdash;that is the best description I can apply to it&mdash;taking it easy, dallying with it, as if it is a matter of no importance.  The approach seems to be &ldquo;We will get around to it some time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister that the people in Ballyfermot are entitled to have a swimming pool, staffed by lifeguards who would teach swimming and look after the children who would be using the pool.  It is a very simple request.  In this area of Ballyfermot is contained a very large segment of the labour pool of Dublin. To a very great extent, Dublin depends on Ballyfermot to keep the wheels of industry going.  The least the Government and the Minister might do would be to make an effort <Col N="1435" /> in regard to the provision of a swimming pool.  I asked him today to give me an assurance that he will get in touch with the corporation and tell them to get on with this job and to let us have a swimming pool in Ballyfermot, for a start, and then to let us wipe out this scandalous situation which exists throughout the city where with a population of over half a million, we have only two small pools which can accommodate only a small fraction of the people who want to make use of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would stress that in Dublin city, with a population of over half a million, we have only two small swimming pools.  It is a terrible reflection on the Government and on the City Council that there should be only two swimming pools in Dublin city, each accommodating only 60 to 70 people.  These swimming pools are taken up almost exclusively by clubs so that an individual wanting to avail of one of them finds that it is open to the public only for a couple of hours each day.  The clubs take over the swimming pools from 6 p.m.  These clubs do a wonderful job but only those children who belong to a club can avail to any extent of the swimming pools.  There are many clubs on the waiting list who cannot possibly be accommodated. It is a terrible indictment of a Government who profess to do everything in the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>The situation is that children in outlying districts such as Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Drimnagh and Crumlin must bathe in rat-infested canals. Every summer in the holiday season there are drowning tragedies because these children cannot swim.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to a number of people in these areas quite recently. One group told me that they anticipated a swimming pool being provided in Crumlin over 20 years ago. These are adults who have never learned to swim and whose children of school-going age have not proper facilities for swimming in this city of well over 500,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> I would ask the Minister to tackle the problem urgently realising that the 17 Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin Corporation will be assured of the support of the Labour and Fine Gael councillors if they sincerely want to have swimming pools provided in Dublin city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is in relation to Ballyfermot specifically. One can scarcely discuss that matter without also referring to the position in regard to swimming pools generally in Dublin, which has been mentioned here.</P>
      <P>The history of swimming pools or rather, the lack of them, in Dublin, goes back a great deal further than even Deputy Dunne has indicated. That the position is as it has been for all these years reflects no credit on anyone, whether it be in this Government or any other Government or in the corporation or in control of affairs down the years when facilities for swimming could have been provided at a particle of the cost of providing a pool today.</P>
      <P>A proposal for Crumlin, at £164,000, was the first firm proposal made to this or any other Government in all the years, despite all the talk that has gone on about what should be done.  It so happened that, due to my disappointment with the lack of progress in the provision of pools in Dublin or anywhere else, some six or eight months prior to the receipt of that proposal from Dublin Corporation for Crumlin, I had gone down through my Department to try to find a way to provide pools at a somewhat more reasonable cost than the cost of the Crumlin pool and other costs that we had been hearing about from other towns throughout the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result was, as the House knows, that we got what could be regarded as probably a utility pool, but at any rate a pool, with a swimming area as big as that proposed for the Crumlin pool in the original plans, that is, a 25 metre indoor heated pool, for a figure which, on the invitation of tenders, proved to be even less than the figure that I had indicated, namely, £16,000. <Col N="1437" /> Therefore the first firm proposal for Crumlin, at £164,000, naturally, was called in by way of asking the corporation to reconsider the proposal in the light of the new prototype pool costings that we had arrived at of £16,000 and after some discussions, negotiations, and so forth between corporation officials and officials of my Department, we received on 5th October last a revised pool type and plan costed at £48,000.  This, on the face of it, was a very big change from £164,000 and still incorporated a 25 metre pool.  But I must say I am disappointed with that figure of £48,000 Though there may be improved finishes, improved ventilation and accommodation and so forth it seems to me, from the non-technical point of view, as being still too high when we consider that basically it will provide nothing more than the type of pool that can be provided for £16,000.  I am not going to stick my neck out and say that I am dead right and that the £48,000 pool cannot be chosen but I have this feeling about it.</P>
    <P>There was also a decision taken just over a year ago by the Planning and Development Committee of the corporation indicating the various sites where they would wish to have pools. These would be Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Finglas, Cabra, Ballymun, Rathmines, Terenure and Rathfarnham.  They have further decided in the City Council that Crumlin would be the first and Finglas second.  No order of priorities has yet been arrived at in so far as any of the subsequent pools on that list I have given are concerned.  In addition to that, while Ballyfermot is definitely mentioned in this swimming pools programme, no site, to my knowledge, has yet been selected and, as I said, no firm decision has been taken as to the order in which the pools will be built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that Crumlin was first and, added to Crumlin, were the other six centres, and out of these six the City Council decided in May, 1965, that the pool that would be next in order of priority subsequent to or simultaneously with Crumlin would be the Finglas pool and as to the remaining five, no determination has yet been made as to the order of building.</P>

      <P>The City Council made a selection of the six additional areas. Those additional to Crumlin, and including Ballyfermot, were approved by the City Council in March, 1965, and the City Council has further approved of the sites at Finglas and Cabra and recommended that a pool be provided at Finglas as a first priority after the Crumlin pool.  This is the information as I have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not terribly important in so far as the overall situation is concerned because it is the overall situation that I am most concerned about.  If we take the £48,000 pool as the criterion&mdash;it is only as a typical pool that we got it from the corporation on 5th October &mdash;but if we take it and I think it would be fair to take it, this £48,000 pool would be the pool regarded as typical in relation to cost.  If we multiply £48,000 by seven we get roughly £350,000.  My problem will be&mdash;but <Col N="1439" /> not yet finally determined for the coming year&mdash;that I will be faced with the question as to whether I am prepared to make available any part or all of £350,000 for swimming pools, when at the same time, I might as a result of that have to restrict the number of houses it would be possible to build in this city.  That is the hard fact I might find myself facing.  The House will, I think, be prepared to concede that this does not leave the matter easy of solution for me.  We cannot just decide to build swimming pools in Dublin as fast as we can against that background.</P>

      <P>I am saying that, if I am asked for money to the tune of £100,000, £200,000, £300,000 or £250,000 to build seven swimming pools in the city of Dublin&mdash;remember, I should like to see these pools provided &mdash;then I may have to restrict housing by a similar amount of money.  That would be the very difficult problem facing me.  The general consensus of opinion would, I am certain, come down heavily on the side of houses.</P>
