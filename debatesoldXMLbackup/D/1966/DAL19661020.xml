      <P>Last night, I sought to point out certain inadequacies and deficiencies in the social welfare code. If proof is required of these inadequacies and defects, one has only to point to the fact that when the Government contemplated establishing a distinct Ministry of Labour, it was decided, as a first essential, especially on the &ldquo;say-so&rdquo; of the trade union and labour movement in this country, that if the matters appertaining to a Ministry of Labour were to work effectively, then matters appertaining to employment carried out by the Department of Social Welfare should be taken into the ambit of the new Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> None of us is satisfied that the Minister's Department has ever shown any real regard for the working classes of this country.  The labour exchanges, as such, became misnomers. There was evidence of attempts to deprive our people of benefits rather than to assist them to secure these benefits.  Labour exchanges became places where a standing army of unemployed, ranging from 50,000 to 90,000 persons on occasions, signed on, in humiliation and degradation, for a period of time, generally a short period of time, until they eventually gave up in despair and went to Britain.</P>
    <P>A realistic effort was never made to create employment exchanges out of these buildings.  One could sign on there indefinitely over a period of years and not be offered a worthwhile position.  The fact was that no jobs were available in this country for the officers of these employment exchanges to offer to people signing on there.  If positions were offered, they were of a most menial kind, and good employers, at any rate, had not to resort to employment exchanges.  They were able to recruit for the various positions they had to offer outside of this medium altogether, usually through the press or through connections within the job itself.</P>
    <P>It came as no surprise to us that many of the functions which were the charge and the responsibility of this Minister and of his predecessors over a long number of years have now been taken from him and have been passed over to a new Department.  I believe that the new Department&mdash;the Depart-of Labour&mdash;will have more respect and more regard for the dignity of labour in Ireland and take positive steps to ensure that suitable work is found for them, suitable training methods provided and proper rates of compensation and benefit paid to those who are obliged to sign on in these employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Certain it is that the Department of Social Welfare has for too long been tied up in means tests of a most niggardly kind.  A concept of doles has activated the minds of the administrators <Col N="1678" /> of this Department and those of us who have experience of signing on remember well the humiliating experience it was.  It was a situation in which it was forcibly borne home to one that there were two classes and two different kinds of world in this little island of ours.  There existed between the decent unemployed on one side of the counter and the secure officials on the other a barrier, a barrier constructed of iron bars through which the decent unemployed looked and through which they were expected to make a public confession of their inability to secure work or to hold on to it, a public confession of the innermost secrets of their private lives, their family and domestic affairs. It was a clear case of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.  One suffered on there for as short a time as possible until eventually, in despair, one decided to emigrate.  These labour exchanges, we always said, were the last places God made in this country.</P>

      <P>Have these been transferred to the Department of Labour now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and I wish to express our satisfaction that these have now been taken out of the hands of Social Welfare and passed on to the Ministry of Labour.  We hope that labour in Ireland will now get a better deal under this new Ministry than it got under Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I adverted to the inordinate delays which take place from time to time before social welfare benefits are paid.  There can be a lapse of weeks, sometimes months, before payment comes through.  This applies more particularly in the case of disability and sickness benefit than it does to any other type of benefit.  First of all, there is the confusion arising as to the nature of the ailment and whether it is a case more properly for workmen's compensation than for disability benefit.  This leads to a great deal of delay until such time as the matter is resolved.  There is also the routine delay of processing the claim.  That takes a few weeks.  In the interim the sick man, his wife and family are left without any income whatsoever and must fend for themselves until such time as payment <Col N="1679" /> comes through.  They are usually forced to resort to home assistance.  This home assistance is paid on the stipulation that it must be refunded to the local authority.</P>
    <P>After some weeks of waiting, during which one may have drawn four or five weeks home assistance of, perhaps, £4 per week to maintain a small family&mdash;that is as much as one can hope to get&mdash;the cheque eventually comes through from the Minister's Department; a deduction of the full amount of the home assistance paid is made at source in the Department and the unfortunate recipient, instead of getting the anticipated £20 or £30 benefit, gets only half the amount.  This can have a most disastrous effect on a family that budgets for a certain amount of money per week and finds that the amount forthcoming is much less than anticipated. I would ask the Minister to seek some means of ensuring, especially in cases of hardship, that the home assistance paid is not deducted at source in the Department and refunded to the local authority without at least ascertaining whether such deductions are likely to cause grave hardship.</P>
    <P>I have a specific case in mind, the case of a widow whose husband died in tragic circumstances, leaving herself and her seven young children to fend for themselves.  She applied for a widow's contributory pension, a rather straightforward case since the husband had been insured over a long period of years, but it was four to five weeks before the claim was processed and the award duly made.  In the meantime, she was obliged to seek home assistance.  She was paid £4 per week by the local assistance officer to maintain herself and her seven young children.  When the cheque eventually issued from the Department, the full amount of home assistance paid, £20, was deducted at source.  This had a disastrous effect on that family budget.  This widow had been involved in costly funeral expenses. The amount of home assistance paid to her was totally inadequate to maintain herself and her <Col N="1680" /> children and she was obliged, of necessity, to secure credit.  The deduction by the Department of Social Welfare of the home assistance paid worsened this widow's domestic problem out of all proportion.  This was a case of hardship.  It was a case in which the home assistance should not have been taken back.  In such cases the Minister should exercise his prerogative to ensure that the local authority does not insist on moneys of this kind being refunded or returned to them, thereby causing the kind of hardship I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing me some concern is the fact that it has come to my knowledge, especially in recent weeks, that a large number of recipients of disability benefit, sickness benefit, and so on, have been cut off benefit on the ground that they are allegedly capable of work.  These are situations in which doctors differ fundamentally and it is said that when doctors differ patients die.  Patients may not die in this instance but they do virtually die of starvation as a result of these decisions.  I know of cases, some of which have been already communicated to the Minister's Department, in which recipients of disability or sickness benefits have been called before the examining doctor in the Department and after what some of these patients alleged to me was a rather haphazard and sketchy examination, they were told within 24 hours of thereabouts that their disability benefit was being discontinued, that the examining doctor from the Department felt they were now capable of work.  This is a serious decision to come to.  It is a serious reflection on the patient and it implies that he is a malingerer and a chancer and that he is pretending to be ill when, in fact, he is sufficiently well to go to work.</P>
    <P>It is more alarming, however, if you find that the patient's doctor is of the confirmed opinion that the patient not only is ill but that his illness is of such a serious nature that he will not permit the patient to return to work in any circumstances and that he forbids the patient to <Col N="1681" /> resume work.  Here we have a conflict of opinion of two professional men.  I submit that one doctor's viewpoint is as good as another doctor's.  Whether it is because of an economy drive in the Minister's Department, or a result of the cheese-paring methods which they adopt from time to time in Departments or, as somebody suggested to me, as a result of an instruction from the Minister or some of his senior executives to adopt a get tough policy in respect of disability benefit patients, there has been in recent weeks an alarming growth in the number of people who have been disallowed disability benefit because the Department's doctor felt they were capable of working.</P>
    <P>I can give specific instances.  There is the case of a man in my constituency who all his life was hardworking and industrious and was hardly ever sick. He is employed permanently by our county council as a machinery man and commands a pretty high wage.  He is in an insurable position.  Earlier this year he developed a back ailment and was obliged to rest on the instruction of his doctor.  He sought disability benefit and was paid it for a short period.  Then he was called before the examining doctor in the Department and was promptly informed that the benefit was being disallowed on the grounds that he was capable of working. The man informed his own doctor who carried out a further examination. The doctor then said that in no circumstances would he permit the man to resume work.  He indicated the nature of his ailment which was a serious one and which would become progressively worse if his back were abused in any way.</P>
    <P>The man remained out of work despite the fact that he received no income from any source.  He remained out for a number of months and then again applied for disability benefit and was again turned down, despite the fact that I pointed out to the Minister's Department that this man could not possibly be malingering, that he was still seriously ill and that he had to sacrifice a wage of £14 a week and is now obliged to live on the wind. Normally his rate of benefit would be <Col N="1682" /> about £4 or £5 for himself and his wife. Is it seriously contended by certain officials in the Department that any sane workman would forego a wage of some £14 and jeopardise his superannuation prospects and possibly his senior position in that job for £4 or £5 a week?</P>
    <P>This is what is happening and there have been a number of such cases.  I would ask the Minister to look into them and satisfy himself that the patients are not being unfairly treated as I believe they are.  I believe that where there is a clash of medical opinion there should be some speedy method of solving the problem rather than allowing it to run on indefinitely and cause hardship over a period.  A number of cases to which I have adverted have not yet been resolved and I have not yet been informed by the Department that payment of the benefit is being resumed.  The failure to make this payment is the cause of great hardship, distress and anxiety to the sick men concerned and to their families.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer briefly to some of the benefits to which insured persons are entitled, particularly in respect of dental treatment, the provision of dentures, spectacles, contact lenses, hearing aids, etc.  These are very desirable services which many of our people avail of.  It is vitally important, however, that the services we provide should be of the very best quality that the medical profession can provide.  There should be no doubt left in the minds of our people that the service provided is any less, by one iota, than that provided for people who are capable of paying for these services.  I do not think that this can be truly said in respect of the provision of spectacles.  The spectacles provided are of the very minimum standard of quality.  In order to secure a reasonably good pair of spectacles, and especially a decent frame, one is invariably obliged to pay extra money because the spectacles which the Department offer are objectionable in the extreme.  Up to a short time ago they consisted merely of two pieces of wire held together at the bridge of the nose.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see to it <Col N="1683" /> that there is an improvement in the hearing aids supplied by his Department as well.  The amount of money which the Department make available to the applicant is such that the person finds it very difficult to find the balance.  We have had cases from time to time of those people coming to us and asking us to assist them to get these hearing aids.  The local health authorities have come to the aid of those people in finding the balance of the money for the provision of dentures, in particular, glasses and hearing aids from time to time, but they only do so provided the applicant is the holder of a medical card and the applicant's name is on the medical register.  It is not good enough if the cost of these appliances is such as to put them beyond the ability of our people to avail of them.  I would ask the Minister to consider increasing the allowances in respect of the provision of dental treatment, dentures, spectacles, hearing aids, etc. and to see to it that there is an improvement in the quality of these appliances also.</P>
    <P>Last night I referred to what I consider to be the greatest defect in the Minister's administration during the past 12 months, the position after we secured the reciprocal agreement with the British Government and the Minister's counterpart in Britain whereby recipients of British pensions in this country would secure any increases that were granted to those people over there.  I pointed out that up to then increases in British pensions, war pensions, disability pensions, retirement pensions and the like, were not applied to recipients of those pensions who were domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also pointed out that the reciprocal agreement made earlier this year aroused jubilation in the hearts of all of us, and particularly in the hearts of those recipients of British pensions who found on various occasions previously that those increases did not apply to them.  Many of the recipients of British pensions received a great uplift a few months ago when, as a result of Mr. Harold Wilson's decision <Col N="1684" /> to increase pensions over there, those pensions were increased here by as much as £1 a week.  This was a great windfall for the people who secured this £1 a week increase in their British pensions.  It is to the credit of the Minister, his staff, and all who encouraged him over a number of years, that this state of affairs was brought about.  The jubilation of those people was, however, quickly turned to grief and sorrow when it transpired that consequent on getting this increase in their pensions from Britain there was a re-investigation of all claimants involved.  A drastic reduction then took place in their Irish pensions.  A great majority of those Irish pensions were withdrawn altogether.</P>
    <P>We sought this reciprocal agreement for the specific purpose of winning this extra money for our people from the British Exchequer so that those people could improve their standard of living. It was a particularly deplorable and shabby thing, having secured the extra money from Britain, that the Minister's Department should have acted in this mean and niggardly way, by attacking the Irish pensions and reducing them by an average of 30/-. They even cut them altogether in some instances.  On 23rd of June last, I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister and asked him if he would state the number of persons in receipt of social welfare benefits who had those benefits reduced consequent upon the increase of British pensions paid under the reciprocal arrangement with Britain and what was the average reduction in these benefits.  The Minister, in reply, said that 1,504 non-contributory pensions had been withdrawn or reduced and that the average reduction, including pensions withdrawn, amounted to about 30/-.</P>
    <P>Old age pensioners in this country receive pensions up to 47/6 per week. I know of an unfortunate woman who was in receipt of a British retirement pension by reason of the fact that her husband spent the best years of his working life in that country, having been denied the opportunity of a livelihood here at home.  As a <Col N="1685" /> consequence of his work, sweat and labour and his early death, she enjoyed a retirement pension of something less than £3 per week from Great Britain.  Harold Wilson increased those retirement pensions by £1 per week and by the reciprocal agreement entered into by our Minister and his counterpart in Great Britain, this woman secured an extra £1 per week, bringing her pension to £4 a week.  Consequent upon that, she was called on by the local welfare officer.  She was instructed to return her old age non-contributory pension book to the Department and she has not seen it since.  The pension of 47/6 which she enjoyed was withdrawn completely because our means test for non-contributory old age pensions states that people who have incomes exceeding £3 per week are not entitled to any pension whatsoever.  That woman got an extra £1 a week from Harold Wilson and Seán Lemass reduced her pension by £2 7s 6d a week as a consequence.</P>
    <P>This is what happened in most of those instances and it was a great tragedy for the people concerned.  I cannot describe for this House the anger and dismay of those people over the past few months as a result of what has happened.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that this means test applies to all categories of persons and if the income exceeds £3 per week, irrespective of the country from which that income is received, those people are not entitled to any pension.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>This money was coming from a foreign source.  In this House we fought to bring about that increase to improve the lot of these people. They were, in my opinion, moneys which could be regarded as being in the same category as emigrants' remittances. They are an integral part of our invisible assets and, as such, should not have been reckoned as income and should not have been taken into account.  It was a flagrant breach of the whole spirit and intention of the reciprocal arrangement that the Minister should have acted as he did.  It was <Col N="1686" /> a violation of the real spirit and intention of this agreement, that having secured this relief from Britain, we should have undone it in its entirety and in such disgraceful fashion.  If it is not too late, and if it is within the power of the Minister, I should be glad if he would set himself out to redress a flagrant wrong perpetrated by his Department, perhaps unwittingly and unintentionally.  But, because of the means test contained in the social welfare code, this has happened.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention of this House that that should happen.  It was never the intention of the negotiators of the reciprocal agreement that it should happen.  That being the case, I will ask the Minister, either by order or some other means, to redress this wrong, to correct the injustice done to the thousands of widows and old age pensioners who are in receipt of British pensions whose Irish pensions have been drastically reduced or withdrawn altogether in recent months.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that our economy is anything but viable.  There is an acute shortage of capital but I submit the Department should not be so badly off as to covet the pensions of this the most unfortunate, the most poverty-stricken and the most destitute section of our society, the non-contributory welfare section and the assistance section.  To interfere with the pensions of these classes of persons was deplorable and the Minister has gathered into the coffers of his Department some £6,000-£7,000.  It may not sound a lot of money but this £6,000-£7,000, or possibly £10,000 has been collected at the expense of the most destitute section of our people, the old age non-contributory pensioner and the widow on a non-contributory pension. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to redress this wrong.</P>
    <P>Some of the other anomalies I have adverted to from time to time.  One is the provision of free fuel in certain areas to the exclusion of others.  I have raised this matter in the House from time to time by way of Parliamentary Question.  I have adverted to it in my remarks on the Minister's Estimate.  If we are to have a cheap fuel scheme, <Col N="1687" /> why should we select certain towns in the administration of that scheme? Why should it be restricted?  The poor are to be found nowadays in rare abundance.  They cannot be confined to hell or to Connacht or to any particular area.  We have them in all our towns and villages, in proportion to their size.  I know of no reason why cheap fuel should be granted to certain towns.  It is as difficult for the poor to live in my constituency as in the neighbouring constituency which enjoys a free fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to knock down the barriers of selectivity which apply in the administration of the free fuel scheme.  If it is to be continued, it should be continued on a fair, impartial and broad basis throughout the whole country.  I think the origin of the selectivity of the zones for the application of a free fuel scheme goes back to the war years and the non-availability of turf in certain areas. Those days are long since past and the Minister should have it looked into in the light of the present situation, and if the scheme is worth continuing at all, it should be applied to the whole country.</P>
    <P>I have adverted, Sir, to the payment of home assistance and hope that, especially in cases of hardship, the obligation to refund might not be insisted on in future.  There are people who find themselves temporarily in financial distress and who are glad to avail of home assistance and who would want in conscience to refund it.  That is understandable, but the health authority would be justified in seeking no return of these moneys in certain cases.  I have mentioned cases of acute hardship where, in my opinion, it is wholly unjust, and I hope the Minister will have regard to these cases.</P>
    <P>I want to talk briefly about the administration of home assistance, which is a function of the Department. I have never been satisfied that we have shown the same regard for people in distress as we should have as a Christian society.  I would like to see greater respect for those unfortunate people who are obliged to seek assistance <Col N="1688" /> from the public purpose.  Let us all be satisfied that we Irish are a proud race.  We are slow to seek assistance, to wear our heart on our sleeve.  When people seek home assistance, they are really at rock bottom, really in distress.  That is not to say that we have not a hard core of wise boys who are prepared to cash in on every opportunity available.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that assistance officers have a difficult task and have to cope with a difficult element at times but it is a far far better thing, if we are to err in the administration of home assistance, the relief of acute distress and the relief of destitution, that we should err on the side of charity.  We should be prepared to be done down at times, as we will be, in the allocation of money.  I would like to see an overall improvement in the approach to these unfortunate categories of persons.  Is it not a fact that these people are obliged to go along to an office which may also contain the local dispensary?  It is usually in the local dispensary these moneys are doled out and there is, in most instances, no degree of privacy whatsoever. People are obliged to make a public confession of their sad state of destitution within earshot of all the people in that compartment, the people queueing up and in some instances people in the outer hallway and in the adjoining rooms.  They can hear what everyone is saying and what is being said by the assistance officer to the unfortunate applicant concerned.</P>
    <P>There is, of necessity, in these cases a searching interrogation carried out in which the innermost secrets of the private lives and domestic affairs of these unfortunate people are laid bare before all concerned.  I submit that it is intrinsically wrong and unchristian that that should be allowed to happen in a public place and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure the strictest privacy for people who are obliged to go on an errand of this kind.  The strictest privacy and the strictest secrecy should be maintained.  It is not good enough that those people should be interrogated in a public place or that they should be paid out in a <Col N="1689" /> public place within the hearing or in the sight of other groups of people. There is evidence of those people being interrogated for home assistance and paid out not merely in dingy, draughty rooms and dispensaries but at the crossroads of this country.  I am appealing for a better deal for those, the least fortunate in our society.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder, Sir, that you find a build-up of antagonism towards the Minister's Department by the mass of our people, our working-class people, our labour and trade union movement in particular, when you see indignities being inflicted on our people by way of the allocation of home assistance or the does in our employment exchanges. It is no wonder that build-up of antagonism and opposition is such that it has forced this Government to hand over the affairs of labour exchanges in the future to another Department altogether.  That, whether the Minister likes it or not, is a serious indictment of the maladministration of the Department of Social Welfare and the way it has treated decent working-class people who found themselves out of a job or in distress in the past.  This is an indictment of the maladministration of the Minister and the officials who looked down upon these unfortunate people and treated them as second-class citizens and made the position for them so utterly intolerable that eventually they gave up the ghost in trying to survive in this country and quit altogether.</P>
    <P>I said last night in my opening remarks that the great founder of our Party.  James Connolly, always maintained that there were two types of freedom; that political freedom meant nothing for us in this country unless it was backed up by economic freedom as well.  He maintained that the freedom of a nation was governed by the freedom of its lowest class and the only freedom the lowest class of people in this country enjoy is the freedom of breathing fresh air and some of the air is contaminated. After that they have freedom to starve and pass away silently as a result of malnutrition.</P>

      <Col N="1690" /> When we talk of social freedom we want to see true freedom, the freedom of decent standards of life.  Those of us who work for a living&mdash;and mark you, we are getting fewer; we are reaching the stage where we have too many old people and too many children and too few adult people at work to maintain the aged and the young&mdash;those of us who are still of adult age and responsibility and at work are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to help our less fortunate brethren.  I say again as contributors to the social welfare code that we are prepared to pay a higher contribution if only we can be assured that these unfortunate people, the sick, the aged, the infirm and the widowed will get a better deal.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party maintain that it is a primary function of an Irish Government, a Christian Government to say the very least, to protect our people in sickness, infirmity and old age from which none of us is immune.  We should so organise our society that these unfortunate people are backed by the full resources of the Christian State which they helped to create in their working days.  The people we plead for now in old age are the people who helped to win for us the partial freedom we enjoy today of 26 Counties.  Those are the people who are being rejected by an Irish Government.  We ask that the full resources of the Christian State be placed behind those people, that they should get a better deal and a fairer share of the wealth of the nation which they helped to create and in which they are entitled to participate.  If they did not have the opportunity to work and to put up stamps for contributory pensions there is no reason why they should be condemned to non-contributory pensions and the obligation of odious means tests, odious means tests of the lowest kind.  We talk loudly and secure political kudos by increases in social welfare benefit and I believe there are other increases coming. According to the news this morning the Minister has thought fit to increase pensions still further.  It is only now these increases as a result of the last Budget are being put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had these public declarations and, mark you, it has always been a good political gimmick to cash in on the sufferings of the people to whom I referred, to mention from time to time all you are doing for them and to secure the widest possible publicity for increases in the benefits of these people.  We have had the statements of the grandiose increase of 10/- in these pensions last year; we have had the many references to the increase of 5/- in these pensions this year; and, seemingly, it is only now that the increases are being applied to certain of these people.  It is all right to talk about the increase of 10/- or 5/- for the old age social welfare beneficiaries: it goes down very well for the time being.  It is good politics, but it is mean politics, despicable politics, especially when you analyse these projected and alleged increases and find that there goes with them a means test of such a kind as to make it virtually impossible for the vast majority of people to secure the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> It is as difficult for a person in receipt of an old age or widow's pension to benefit by this 5/- increase as it is for the camel to get through the eye of a needle because there goes with this increase a stipulation that it applies only to people with no means whatsoever. Having regard to the experience of the Minister's officers, it is a relatively easy matter for them to find some form of means in every household concerned.  Even the most destitute person would, very likely, have some other means, however small, possibly a home assistance allowance, a small allowance from a charitable organisation; and it may well transpire that these allowances will be taken into account to deprive that destitute person of the increase for which the Minister is seeking such lavish publicity, both for himself and his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments I wanted to express on this Estimate. Before concluding, I want to refer to a trick, to a device, which the Department still continues to perpetrate on our unfortunate people which I think ought to stop.  It is presumed by the Minister and his Department that there is adequate work available from May to October, work opportunities in such abundance and of such a kind that nobody should be unemployed, especially in rural areas.  But all these unfortunate people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, in particular during the months from May to October, are disallowed peremptorily on the ground that work is available in the rural areas.  Nobody takes any precaution to ensure that work is found for these men, or that work is in fact available.  An order is made withdrawing benefits between May and October and the unfortunate people concerned can fend for themselves after that.  They may be fortunate enough to get a little work in the rural areas but, usually, there is none available.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must know very well that machines have replaced men on the land, that there is an exodus of human beings from the land, that they are running at the rate of 20,000 and 30,000 per <Col N="1693" /> year in recent years, that there are no employment opportunities whatsoever, that one man can do the work of ten labourers of the past.  Yet this archaic and outmoded regulation is still in operation and all these people in the rural areas are disallowed unemployment assistance during the summer months from May to October on the pretence that they can get work.</P>
    <P>There is a far more serious aspect. Apart altogether from depriving these people of their sustenance, of their means of livelihood, you are removing considerable thousands of people from the unemployment register at our labour exchanges and, lo and behold, there is a considerable drop, supposedly, in the number of unemployed during these periods: supposedly there is work, and benefit is disallowed on the pretext that work is available. These people become a forgotten section, relegated to a limbo of forgotten beings between May and October.  Of course in this country, with its high cost of living and the difficulty of maintaining oneself and one's family for even a week, clearly no responsible family man could fight this kind of penal clause, so these people invariably emigrate to England.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party deplore this sharp practice of cutting off a vast number of unemployed people, disallowing them benefit on the pretext that during the summer months work is available on the farms, sowing seed, tending crops or harvesting grain.  This is not so, and the Minister knows it. I would ask him to explain what happens to these thousands of people in the interim&mdash;who cares whether they live or die, whether they come or go, whether the fact is that this is a means of manipulating unemployment figures and that the records we have been getting from his Department are not true records of the actual standing army of unemployed at any given time.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell with any degree of certainty how many people are emigrating each year; it is a speculation. Some say 40,000 and others say 20,000.  This is deliberate on the part of the Government who, if they wanted to assess the number, could <Col N="1694" /> very easily do so.  This kind of manipulation and tricking about with unemployment figures is bad enough, but the human misery that goes with it is our primary concern.  It is understandable that many of the functions and duties which this Minister had in the past are being taken from him and handed to another Department.  It will be a very bad Minister and a bad Department which will not do more for these people than he has done for them in the past.</P>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments I wanted to express on this Estimate. In respect of these categories of persons, we in the labour movement have a very simple, humane and Christian philosophy.  We liken the nation to the family.  As in the family, the rich, the powerful and the strong do not prey upon or oppress the weak.  In the Christian family, the store and value of all is shared by all.  The weakest physically or mentally shares equally with the most gifted, the most healthy, the most physically strong.  So should it be with the nation.  Those of us who can afford to contribute to the betterment of the less well off people should do so.  That should be the approach of any Christian Government, and that should be the approach of those of us who wish to see equality in Ireland, and to see in Ireland the happy homes which I know are the desire of all our hearts.</P>

      <P>When the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare comes before the House, most Deputies take a particular interest in it because, as in my own case, we seem to spend a large proportion of our time as public representatives making representations on behalf of people who find some difficulty in understanding the operation of the social welfare code.  It is only reasonable that we should take a particular interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House very long on this Estimate but I want to compliment the Minister on the humane approach he has always adopted towards these problems.  Any time I have had to approach him or officers of his Department with difficulties which my constituents had in <Col N="1695" /> relation to the various benefits under his Department, I have never had any cause to feel that justice was not being done.  Of course&mdash;and I know the Minister subscribes to this idea&mdash;we in the Fianna Fáil Party will probably never be satisfied with the amount of benefit which we can make available to the more needy sections of the community.  Indeed, our ambition is to provide a comfortable standard of living for those less well off people who have to depend on State assistance at certain stages of their lives, through no fault of their own, I might add.</P>
    <P>I have explained that I do not want to speak for very long on this Estimate because I know it is in capable hands. I have no complaint to make with regard to any particular case.  They have all been dealt with very fairly by the Minister and his officials, but there is one matter which I have already raised twice in this House, which comes under his Department, and which has to do with the payment of unemployment benefit to employees who become disemployed as a result of strike action by other people in the factories in which they work; in other words, where a strike is called in a factory and people who have no act or part in the actual strike become disemployed.  It is most unfair that they should be deprived of unemployment benefit when they are put out of their jobs through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has every sympathy with me and with the men who find themselves in that position. There was some confusion between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Minister's Department over who was waiting to hear from whom.  The Minister stated quite clearly in reply to a query by me on the Supplementary Estimate last February that he was waiting for word from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions since June, 1964.  On that occasion Deputy Tully interrupted to inquire was he right in the date he had heard the Minister state, and the Minister confirmed that he had said, June, 1964.  Deputy Tully and I both said that was too long to wait.  The strange thing is that Deputy <Col N="1696" /> Tully who on that occasion expressed those feelings and that opinion came into the House on 29th June and accused the Minister of being the cause of the delay in settling this matter.</P>

It is only a small thing.  The Minister said on several occasions that he is anxious to improve the situation and, if possible, improve even on the system which operates in England at present.  The system which operates here, I understand, was originally the brainchild of the late Deputy Norton and was brought in by Labour Party representatives. <Col N="1698" /> They now know that it did not cover the position properly.  We in Fianna Fáil know that the position is not properly covered and I know of certain men in my constituency who had to walk the streets of Galway while the Irish Congress of Trade Unions kept the Minister waiting for a memorandum and these men were thereby deprived of unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to finding the Minister very helpful in dealing with matters brought before him by the Deputy.  I am sure other Deputies would say that any Minister would be helpful but one of the objections we in Fine Gael have &mdash;and it is shared by the Labour Party&mdash;is the way in which social welfare is administered.  It should not be necessary to bring something before a Minister or officials of his Department. Naturally a Minister will pay attention to something brought up by any Deputy and particularly, perhaps, when it is brought up by a Deputy of his own Party, but the point I want to make is that the machinery of social welfare administration should move smoothly without oiling by Deputies or other public representatives.  In saying that I am not attacking the officials in any way.  They do their duty well in this Department as in other Departments but the complexity of our social welfare system is such that almost inevitably anomalies arise which have to be smoothed out by public representatives.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what Deputy Treacy said about the widow who had £3 a week from the British Government and £2 7s 6d from the Government here and who, when the increase of £1 a week came in the British pension, bringing it to £4 a week, was knocked off the £2 7s 6d pension, leaving her £1 7s 6d worse off than she was before the increase.  That appeared to be the mathematics of Deputy Treacy's statement.  I do not doubt the Deputy but I have been a long time in public life and I, therefore, put in the provision that if the statement is correct that this woman now gets £1 7s 6d less as a result of the £1 increase in the British pension, then there is something wrong with our machinery which should be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> There would be some logical basis for it if her pension here was reduced although that would be very hard and I would not approve of it.  I do not say it should be done but merely that I could understand it, but the complete loss of £2 7s 6d because of the £1 increase from England is very difficult to understand, if true.  I trust it is an administrative slip and not deliberate policy on the part of the Department or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The increases that were announced last night have been mentioned.  The Minister was pleased at this and some of the Deputies thought that perhaps they should not be mentioned.  Some of them thought Fianna Fáil were cashing in on these increases and in my opinion, there is no group in the House better able to cash in on any increases given than Fianna Fáil.  Notwithstanding that, I submit to the Minister that we do not get sufficient information concerning social welfare benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean the Irish citizen.  There should be notices put up in post offices and published in the newspapers of the benefits available to citizens by way of pensions and other allowances. I have always thought there was something very cheeseparing about our attitude to the people in this respect. Deputies have referred to the social welfare classes as being second-class citizens.  Of course that is not so, but what we pay in the way of old age pensions and other benefits to sick and old and poor people should go to them as a right and not as a handout for which they should be suitably thankful.  That is not the way we should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the efforts made here to tell the people that it is their right as citizens to get certain payments when they reach a certain age, they do not seem to be aware of it, and Deputies, councillors and others concerned who are not perhaps public representatives but participate in charitable undertakings, find that a <Col N="1701" /> great deal of their time is taken up informing these unfortunate sections of the population what their rights are in connection with social welfare schemes.  That could be remedied by a much wider dissemination of information as to the benefits to which they are lawfully entitled as citizens.  Such information should not just be given through the radio when an increase has been granted because the information then appears to be in the nature of an endeavour to gain political advantage for something which is the citizens' due right.</P>
    <P>On many occasions there are undue delays in payment of benefits.  That is something which again falls into the category of apparent handouts to people, though it is their right. People should receive these benefits not when the Government wish to pay them.  These payments should not be held up for any length of time.  Delays in this respect cause a great deal of fright and worry to elderly people who, particularly widows, are peculiarly prone to fright when they think they will not get the benefits.  Consequently, there should be as little delay as possible in payments.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme has been mentioned.  I came across a case, and I had to intervene, of old people who were entitled to benefits under the scheme but who, owing to illness and old age, were not able to go to the depot to get their fuel.  I had to deal with a case of an elderly woman who was prepared, poor creature, to pay for the free fuel being brought from the depot to her little flat.  However, she was too bedridden to make the necessary arrangements to get in touch with the man who did such jobs for her.  That is a flaw in the administration that should be looked into.  I must say that when I got in touch with the Department, they were very helpful about it.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to here is the difference between the contributory and the non-contributory pensions. In respect of a husband, wife and children, the contributory pension is £5 7s 6d and the non-contributory benefit is £2 17s 6d.  It is a very wide <Col N="1702" /> difference.  Again it depends on how we look at the problem.  The problem of poverty does not stop at or recognise contributions or lack of contributions: a man and his family will not be less hungry in 1966 because the man did not make contributions or could not make them or was not allowed to make them in past years. Hunger will attack non-contributory as well as contributory beneficiaries, but the contributory pensioners get about £2 10s more per week.</P>
    <P>I know this is a difficult problem for any Irish Government to solve because we are a nation with a large proportion of elderly people, probably the highest percentage of elderly people among the nations of Europe. Poverty in certain areas has been and is a big problem.  Therefore, this question of how much we can contribute has to be related to the burden which is placed on the working members of the community.  It is a problem that affects every able-bodied man and woman who is gainfully employed. All of them carry an inordinately heavy burden.  We have a duty to look after old and sick people and we must do it to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>In connection with pensions generally, there is the big question of the pensions for retired industrial workers, and some day our machinery here will come round to dealing with the problem in a nationwide way.  It is something with which we could very well start to deal as a nation.  It would cost money, but, at the same time, it would guarantee the future for a lot of our old people.  It would take people off home assistance and so on and give them a right which they do not feel they have at present.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speak too long on this subject but it is one which is of vast importance to us.  Over on this side of the House we feel it is a continuing process, that the benefits are rather slight compared, in many cases, with the need and the poverty which they hope and help to alleviate.  They do not entirely alleviate it and we feel that this should be done to a much greater extent.  We also feel that the machinery should be made clearer and less complex, that all the time this <Col N="1703" /> country should be working towards the position in which people increasingly know exactly what their rights are and that there should be no question that elderly and sick people feel, on the one hand, they are in receipt of a form of charity of which they are slightly ashamed, or, on the other hand, that the receipt of benefits is dependent on getting the ear of some local representative in Dáil Éireann or the council.  It should be made clear to the people that these are rights which nobody can take away from them, rights which nobody wishes to take away from them.  The Minister and his Department should increasingly keep that before the members of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to most of the debate here and I feel that nearly all the points have been covered, but there are a few things which strike me as worth mentioning. First, there is the case of people who are self-employed, not in insurable employment.  Take the case of a husband who dies leaving a widow with young children and in difficult circumstances.  Because he has been self-employed, she is not entitled to a contributory widow's pension, and because of her circumstances, she will be forced to seek employment.  Even then, when she has three years' stamps, she will not be entitled, as I understand it, to a contributory widow's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just because this woman's husband was self-employed, she should not be deprived of a pension.  There should not be a hard and fast rule; each case should be examined on its merits.  The widows of self-employed persons should be entitled to receive some sort of contributory pension.  They go on for years struggling to bring up young children, and even when they reach 65 and when their services are dispensed with in whatever occupation they have been, they must wait until they are 70 before they get a very meagre pension.  Furthermore, in relation to these contributory pensions, these people are paying money and should get their pension at 65.  It may <Col N="1704" /> cost the State a lot of money but it is something that is well worth doing. People who are used to a way of life and used to a certain amount of money cannot suddenly do without it at 65. I know of many cases like this all over my constituency and it worries me a lot.  These are people who had young families when their husbands died&mdash; they may have married late&mdash;who were in good employment but who spent all they had in educating their children, and then find themselves at 65 without a shilling.</P>
    <P>The treatment given to the old, the sick and the disabled in this country must seem to foreigners, to people who look at our system, quite a disgrace. It is said here and everywhere else a country can be judged by the way it treats its weaker citizens.  Certainly if this country were to be judged on that basis, we would rate very low with the rest of Europe.  We have arrived at the situation where top executives retire at 65 with golden handshakes, while the ordinary man and woman who work just as hard as these top executives retire with nothing.  This is a situation which should not be allowed to continue, and it is a situation that I feel we as a responsible Opposition should point out to the House.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the method of assessing people's means for old age pensions.  I am not sure that it is an easy thing for a Minister to decide how a person's means should be assessed, but the way in which it is done at the moment is degrading, to say the least of it.  A man is dragged before a committee and must disclose to everybody his means or lack of means.  The system is geared to encourage a man or woman to be untruthful in disclosing means.  This is not good.  Every little thing is taken into consideration, and a man or woman must literally bare his or her soul before the pensions officer and committee before he will get a few shillings a week.  This is a degrading system.</P>
    <P>I know things are difficult now and that there is a yardstick for the granting of pensions.  However, the Minister must realise that at the moment, in rural areas particularly, times are <Col N="1705" /> extremely difficult, and pensions officers should now be instructed to be a lot more lenient during the months or years, or however long this crisis lasts.  In the past farmers who were entitled to some pension had it gauged according to their valuation.  The farmer with a certain valuation of two years ago was in a very different position from that of the farmer with the same valuation today.  Two years ago the cattle trade was at its zenith.  Now it is worse than it was during the Economic War.  Even though a man may have a few cattle, their value has so depreciated that he is probably wishing to the Lord that he had not got them because he has to feed them during the winter and is probably a lot worse off than the man who has no cattle.  For that reason, when being assessed for pension purposes, for these few months or years, or as long as this crisis lasts, these people should be given every sympathetic consideration so that they will be allowed these vital few shillings, because I am afraid a few shillings is all that they will get, to eke out an existence in their old age.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think that we pay too much to certain classes and not enough to another class.  The ideal thing would be to reward everyone who arrives at the age of 65 with some sort of pension.  I recognise that in this country we cannot do it but those who are getting a pension should get it with some sort of grace and should not have to get on their hands and knees and go to every TD and every country councillor and get them to try to make a case for them to get a few shillings.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that strikes me in regard to holders of medical cards.  The medical card system is the only one we have.  It has been criticised long and loud here.  I feel in many cases it is unfair but I will say this much for Galway County Council, that they do try to meet all requests.  Persons in County Galway who have medical cards and find themselves in need of dentures apply in the normal way.  They have their teeth extracted and I have known <Col N="1706" /> cases where persons have waited for six years for dentures.  After a year, not to mind six years, the shape of a person's mouth has altered.  So, when the dentures finally come, they do not fit.  As one dispensary doctor said to me: &ldquo;A lot of dentures in this town are left on the dresser&rdquo;. Surely that is a shocking waste of State money?  Could some system not be devised whereby these people would get their dentures almost immediately? I understand from dentists that it is vital to get the dentures as soon as possible because otherwise the mouth changes and the dentists make dentures and they do not fit.</P>
    <P>There is a similar point to be made in connection with people looking for spectacles.  In my constituency I find that people wait months to see an oculist and more months waiting for spectacles and when the spectacles finally come the standard is very poor. A lot of money is put into the health services and I think a lot of it is very badly spent.</P>
    <P>I understand that in various counties they have different standards of assessing eligibility for medical cards. In my constituency, when people invest in a television set they lose their medical card.  That is hardly fair.  It is very easy for a person to hire out a television set.  It costs about 10/6d or in some cases 9/6d a week.  Life in rural Ireland is very difficult and surely a man and his wife and family are entitled to spend 9/6d a week on enjoyment.  We give an awful lot of lip service to rural Ireland and to the need to keep people on the land but we will never keep them on the land if we make it more difficult for them to exist on the land.  I would prefer to have my family looking at television at night where at least you would have them under your eye, than out along the roads or making plans to skip it to England, as happens in a great many country areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to have a word with the local authorities with a view to eliminating that disqualification.  It is not as if <Col N="1707" /> these people pay £100, £90 or £70 or whatever the price may be, for a television set.  They would not have that amount of money in their wildest dreams.  They merely save this 10/6 or 9/6 a week in order to have a few hours enjoyment at night.</P>
    <P>There is very little else that I want to say.  All that needed to be said has been said by various Deputies.  I would like the Minister to think particularly of widows whose husbands were not in insurable employment.  I know cases of great hardship.  The hardship could be easily eliminated and it would not cost the Exchequer a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of women whose husbands disappear.  The number would be very limited.  These women are not widows; they are married.  They are eligible for nothing. Where it is proven that the husband cannot be traced for X years these people should be entitled to the benefits that widows are entitled to. There was a case in my constituency of a woman with seven children.  Her husband had vanished.  Only for her kind neighbours, she would be starving. She is not a widow.  She is sure she is not a widow, although she has not seen or heard from her husband for years.</P>
    <P>The number is so limited and there is such hardship involved that some case should be made for these women. The Minister should have some discretion so that these people could be treated as widows and given the same pension as widows get.  In point of fact, they are living in the same circumstances as widows and very often are in desperate need.  I think this could be done at very little cost to the State and it should be done.</P>

      <P>In my constituency I had a case recently of a man, his wife and a partly disabled son.  The husband was not working; he was drawing social welfare benefit.  The mother was working as a cleaner with CIE.  On assessment of the family income, the son was entitled to about £1 or 22/6d a week.  The father died. The incomes of the mother and son were then jointly assessed and as a result the son was declared not to be entitled to benefit.  That entailed great hardship on the mother who was trying to support herself and this disabled son.  That is a case that should be looked into.</P>
      <P>I received a reply from the Minister recently to the effect that contributory old age pensions are payable only to persons in this country or in England or in the Isle of Man.  It is disgraceful that something which a person and his employer contribute to and of which the State contributes only a small part should be denied just because persons happen to be living in certain places.</P>
      <P>The greatest pity of all are the non-contributory old age pensioners who have to live on a miserable pittance and whose pensions are reduced.  Quite recently, when British pensions were increased in the case of persons resident in this country, our own Government made a corresponding reduction in the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter which I should like the Minister to clarify in connection with the increase which is to be given to old age pensioners in November. There seems to be doubt as to who will be entitled to this increase.  Only this morning I was at a meeting of the Dublin Old Age Pensions Committee. Everybody there who heard the announcement on radio and television yesterday were of the opinion that all non-contributory old age pensioners <Col N="1709" /> were to get this 5/- increase.  We contacted the Minister's Department this morning and they informed us that only people with no means will get it.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position and, instead of misleading these people into thinking they are to receive an increase of 5/-, let it be publicly known that only a small proportion will receive it.  It is pitiful to listen to the stories of some of the people we have there.  Were it not for the UKB, quite a number of them would find themselves completely destitute. I appeal to the Minister to consider the plight of the old age pensioners and to be as sympathetic as possible in the matter of increasing their present miserable allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have but a few points to make.  One has been mentioned already by many Deputies.  It is the disgraceful situation whereby, when the British Government increased pension allowances to people living in this country, those people in many cases had their Irish pensions withdrawn. This has been very noticeable in my constituency and most areas around the Border counties.  Some people have worked in the Six Counties and have therefore qualified for British pensions. In addition, much emigration has taken place from Donegal to Scotland.  Many people who qualified either for a 100 per cent State pension, or a reduced pension because they were in receipt of a British pension, found themselves worse off when the British increase took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a deplorable situation.  I know it is out of order to mention legislation but I feel the Minister must consider seriously the possibility of increasing the statutory limit in relation to non-contributory widows' and orphans' and old age pensions.  This is the stumbling block.  Anyone in receipt of more than £3 per week will not receive a State pension.  Those people of whom I now speak, who until recently were in receipt of a British pension of £2 10s, have received a reduced Irish pension.  If they receive anything less than £3, they qualified for some Irish pension.  But simply <Col N="1710" /> because an alien Government, who provided their husbands with work when this Government failed to do so, saw fit to increase their pensions, the Government here reduced the allowance for their dependants.  The Minister should now seriously consider increasing the statutory limit to, say, £6 per week.  I have been trying to find out when the statutory limit was fixed at £156 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a shock.  May I ask the Minister, through the Chair, what was the statutory limit prior to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £143.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>So we have an increase of £13?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It corresponded to the increase of 5/- in the rate of old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we are at cross-purposes? I am talking about the higher limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that automatically goes up.  When there is an increase in the maximum rate of old age pension, the means scale is automatically extended to bring in a higher category for the minimum rate.  Every increase of 5/- automatically increases the upper limit by £13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a lesser percentage of the national cake is being paid out to social welfare recipients now than ten years ago, perhaps the Minister might see fit to increase the upper income limits, particularly to facilitate people whose husbands worked in Great Britain and who until quite recently were in receipt of a British pension and an Irish pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to cite the case of two families.  Let us say the father of one family obtains insurable employment in this country and, on reaching the age of 70, qualifies for a contributory old age pension; or, if it happens that he dies before his wife, she qualifies for a contributory widows' and <Col N="1711" /> orphans' pension.  If that man reaches the age of 70 and draws a contributory old age pension, he can go into business and earn as much as £1,000 a week and the Department cannot take a halfpenny from him.  There is nothing wrong with that.  He is entitled to his contributory pension.  If he dies earlier, his widow is entitled to her contributory pension, even though the family may be earning £1,000 a week. The Department cannot reduce that lady's pension by one penny.  Again, that is quite right.</P>
    <P>But, now, take the case of the father of a family who had to seek work in Great Britain.  He could not obtain it here simply because this Government did not provide a job for him to support his wife and family at home. His wife and family remained here while he was in insurable employment in Britain.  Say he died in Great in Britain.  He was entitled to a British contributory pension but, because he worked in Great Britain and did not qualify as a contributory pensioner in the Republic, the Department either reduced or withdrew completely the pension that lady was drawing up to that time.</P>
    <P>Here are the two arguments I would put before the Minister.  I think it is unfair that this should be the position. I have one particular case in mind of a lady in Donegal whose husband, because he could not obtain work from any of the local places where people normally obtain work, was self-employed, in a manner of speaking.  At no time during his life in this country did he stamp his cards.  He tried to provide a living for himself and family as best he could.  Times became difficult. This gentleman was forced to emigrate to Great Britain to seek a livelihood.  He worked there for three or four years.  Then, unfortunately, there was an accident and he lost his life.  His widow was in receipt of a British pension.  She had four or five of a family and was also in receipt of a non-contributory widows' pension from this country.  Once the British Government increased that lady's pension, the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="1712" /> saw fit to withdraw her pension completely. In fact, she got an increase of £2 12s a week from the British Government and she lost £1 6s to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister may deny it but this is a loophole by which the Department are saving money.  I see no reason why that lady had to have her pension reduced. There must be many cases like this in the entire country because of the transfer of labour force from here to Britain and, later on, when some of them prosper and come back, these things are bound to repeat themselves as often perhaps as I could mention them.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Minister should increase the statutory limits so that people in this particular dilemma can be assisted.  Quite some time ago, because of the number of complaints that public representatives in County Donegal were receiving, it was necessary to table a motion at a meeting of Donegal County Council to the effect that Donegal County Council request the Minister for Social Welfare to increase the statutory limits so that recipients of old age and widows' and orphans' pensions would not lose their Irish pensions because of an increase in the British pensions.  For certain reasons, some members of the county council would find it very embarrassing to support that motion and then ask the Minister to reject it.  As there are about ten ways of choking a cat, the Fianna Fáil members of the council modified the motion to read:</P>
    <P>That the Department of Social Welfare be requested not to take Irish or British contributory pensions into consideration when assessing means of applicants for old age and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>That was sent to the Department of Social Welfare some two or three months ago.  It was sent on the understanding that members of the county council who supported to original motion would support this one unanimously provided that if this one failed the Fianna Fáil members of the county council would then unanimously support the original motion which was <Col N="1713" /> tabled and which had been redrafted to the satisfaction of the members of the council who could not support it. There is a letter from the manager of Donegal County Council in which he states that, apart from an acknowledgment dated 16th June, there has been no further communication from the Department.  This indicates the lack of interest that the Minister and his Department have in the people for whom I am making a case now.</P>
    <P>I see no reason in the wide world why the Minister could not have read this resolution which was unanimously passed by the county council in Donegal which is controlled by the Fianna Fáil Party and which was sent to the Minister on a date prior to 16th June last.  Why the Minister and his staff could not have read that, could not have decided its feasibility and either accepted it or declined to accept it, we are not told but he should at least have let Donegal County Council know the position relative to the application made to them.  The reason is, of course, that once this was refused, members of the county council who originally could not support the motion as tabled would then be committed by word of honour to support the original motion which, in effect, was to request the Minister to increase the statutory limits forthwith. When the Minister is replying, perhaps he will inform me as to his intention in relation to this matter because, no doubt like many other Deputies representing Border constituencies, the problem that has become most familiar to deal with in the quite recent past is this particular problem.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that people in receipt of contributory pensions, pensions they have subscribed to over a long time of employment, are justly entitled to a contributory pension, having obtained that contributory pension they can also be in receipt of superannuation.  They can have a private income of up to £1,000 a week and the Department cannot do a thing about a reduction in their contributory widows' pension or the old age pension. Consider the position of the person <Col N="1714" /> who was forced to leave this country to seek employment in a neighbouring country and who tried to protect his wife and family by the same pension rights only under another Department, namely the British Government.  Simply because his wife and family elected to stay in this country, or because he could not find a home for them in Great Britain he allowed them to stay in this country, we find that not alone did we chase him out of this country because we could not find a livelihood for him but now we are fining the dependants because he did not come back here and stamp a card.  This is an appalling situation.  No Deputy could speak too strongly on it in this House and no person could bring enough pressure to bear on the Minister to have this upper income limit adjusted so that the matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of all.</P>
    <P>I know I may be boring the House with this but, on one occasion during the summer months, the son in a family in similar circumstances called at my home to inquire why his mother had been reduced in her widow's pension. This was not the first case in relation to which I had an inquiry; I had inquired into other cases earlier.  Now this young man had to emigrate and he came back on his holidays here with his English wife and young family.  He simply could not understand why an Irish Government should treat his mother like this.  Difficult as it was for him to understand, his English wife found the whole thing quite beyond her comprehension.</P>
    <P>In the kind of society in which we live, this sort of situation should not be tolerated.  The Minister may be trying to do the best he can but no government should be allowed to get away with the idea that it is Government money these people receive by way of pension.  The function of a government is to make sure that those in the poorer sections of our society&mdash; this is particularly the function of the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;receive ample help to enable them to live a life which is not just that of a beggar. The Government collect the money from the people to distribute it in the <Col N="1715" /> way the people want it to be distributed.</P>
    <P>Those of us who discuss these matters with the general public are well aware that nobody objects to an old age pensioner getting a decent pension at 65 or 70 years of age.  Nobody objects to a widow and children getting a decent widow's and orphans' pension to enable her to make a living for herself and her dependants.  I cannot understand why a government should be reluctant to collect money from those who are quite prepared to pay for these services.  If I were a member of a government I believe I could publicly defend any increase in taxation to help the poorer sections of our community to live a little more comfortably than they do now.  Most of the benevolent societies founded 50, 60 and 70 years ago are now societies without a function.  Some have been disbanded. Those societies evolved because a group of men came together and organised themselves and their friends in order to solve a problem.  Each contributed 5/- or perhaps 1/- per week and, when a member fell ill, the society stepped in with financial assistance.  As the need became more obvious, men in public life realised it was not right that a certain section should accept responsibility for another section; they realised that this was the responsibility of government and society as a whole should accept responsibility for those in need.  That is the way in which Departments of State developed in relation to social welfare and it was on these rocks that the foundations of these Departments were laid.</P>
    <P>If that argument is correct, and I have no reason to believe it is not, I cannot understand why the Minister for Social Welfare cannot go to the Cabinet and say: &ldquo;Each and every one of you is a public representative. Each of you has been in contact, as have all the Members of Dáil Éireann, with the man in the street, with the family in the thatched cottage, with the industrial worker, with the big business man, with all the people who make up this nation, and all are agreed that the old age pensioner is entitled <Col N="1716" /> to a pension irrespective of means.&rdquo; Certainly 95 per cent are agreed that not alone should the pension be paid at 70, without a means test, but that it should be paid at 65.</P>

      <P>I submit to your ruling. I do not know whether it was the present Minister or one of his predecessors, but it was certainly stated by a Minister for Social Welfare that, in due process of time, the number of pensioners in receipt of contributory pensions would increase.  The number of pensioners in receipt of non-contributory pensions will, therefore, grow less.  That was eight or nine years ago and I do not think it would impose too great a burden now to give a pension at 70 years of age irrespective of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Department have saved approximately £150,000 as a result of increases in British pensions. This is a staggering amount, in view of the fact that some pensioners would have had their pensions reduced by 2/6 a week and some pensioners would <Col N="1717" /> have had their Irish pensions withdrawn completely.  This money could be put to better use by the Minister if he would now redistribute it to the people from whom he has withdrawn it.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly but I would ask the Minister to inquire why his Department have not replied to Donegal County Council in relation to the motion I mentioned earlier and, having found out why, I should be glad if he would inform the manager of the council so that in turn he might present the views of the Minister to the council.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is next attending a Cabinet meeting and discussing next year's Budget, he should make a demand for more money to pay to recipients of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit.  If he comes to the House looking for support for this increase, he will, provided there are no strings attached, undoubtedly receive the support of the Fine Gael Party.  I would point out that a smaller percentage of the national cake is now being distributed among these people than was being distributed to them ten years ago.  I should also like to say that I am not at all satisfied with the way in which people who were in receipt of disability benefit, and whose claim to such benefit is disputed by an inspector of the Department, are transferred to unemployment benefit and, indeed, to unemployment assistance.  On many occasions I have had to ask doctors to give me medical certificates to produce to the Department to prove that people were still disabled and therefore entitled to draw disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a particular case of a father with a family of ten who has not worked for the past seven or eight years and who would like to work but who, because of illness, cannot avail of work which may become available. Occasionally this man loses his right to the disability benefit.  I would venture to say that certainly on two occasions in the past 18 months he has been refused this benefit.  He has attended a board and someone&mdash;I do not know whether the man was a qualified doctor <Col N="1718" /> or just an inspector from the Department&mdash;asked him a few questions without giving him a medical examination. He came to the conclusion that the man was fit for work, despite the fact that he attends a dispensary doctor once a week.  When this man is disqualified, he arrives at my door, and I telephone the doctor who has no need to examine the applicant and in the next morning's post, I receive a letter certifying that he is suffering from a certain complaint. When this is sent by me to the Depart ment, the man's benefit is restored.  I cannot see the logic in this.  This man is either entitled to disability benefit or he is not and he is either fit for work or he is not.  If a dispensary doctor, who knows this man because he is his patient, is prepared to certify that he has a particular complaint, surely that should be accepted by the Department as ample evidence without all this manoeuvring and sending down someone&mdash;as I say, I am not even certain that he is medically qualified&mdash;to decide whether the man is capable of working or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we are discussing is in relation to fitness and I accept from the Minister that the man is a medical referee and a doctor.  However, I have attended doctors on occasions and any time I attended a doctor he examined me to ascertain what was the compaint.  He did not ask me a few questions and say to me: &ldquo;Everything is OK; go home.&rdquo;  These are the things that happen when a recipient of disablement benefit attends one of those boards.  The person whom the Minister describes as a medical referee simply asks a few questions.  He makes up his mind that this person is either fit for work or is not fit for work, despite the fact that the local dispensary doctor each week is issuing a certificate to the Department that he is unfit for work.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to labour this point but again one of the most significant, and one of the most obvious, things which confront me as a public representative is the number of people in every Department of State who perform work which, as I said in another debate, is non-productive.  This costs a lot of money which could be spent in a much better direction to keep the people, whom the Minister describes as medical referees and other individuals, from going around performing acts which are non-productive.  The Minister should clear away some of the cobwebs in his Department and put those people into a more productive occupation.  As I was saying, the people not alone who are in receipt of disablement benefit but who are genuinely transferred to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, discover that for possibly a month, they receive no payment whatever from the Department until one section gives the all-clear to the other section that the money should be paid.  Here again simple legislation could be introduced or an order could be issued by the Minister to the chiefs of the different sections stating that this should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, in fairness to the Minister and his Department, that I have spoken to colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and have also inquired from Deputies in the Labour Party <Col N="1720" /> regarding this matter, and I find that this is not a picture which can be painted of the entire country.  Apparently it is only something which happens in certain areas.  My area is one of those in which it happens.  I know of people who have been in receipt of disablement benefit over a period of five or six months.  They are then certified as being fit for work and they draw unemployment benefit for a period.  The time-lag between the last payment of disablement benefit and the first payment of unemployment benefit is far too long.  Those allowances are little enough but very often the recipients must go to the local grocery, the local drapery, the butcher, any local businessman or make arrangements with the rent collector and say: &ldquo;Will you wait until next week until the unemployment benefit comes through and I will then be able to pay you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not the reason the Department of Social Welfare was set up in the first place.  It was set up to help those people and to collect money for distribution amongst them as fairly as the Department saw fit, not to bring them into the position that they have to go on bended knees to local businessmen to ask for extended credit until they receive from the Department the money to which they are justly entitled.  The delay is not so great when the transfer is from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance but still there is an unnecessary delay.  Maybe the officials involved in the particular set-up in Donegal are doing the best they can.  Maybe it is a question of the distance between Dublin and Donegal that is the reason for this delay.  The Minister should take steps, whatever the reason for the delay, to ensure that it does not happen again or that it ceases forthwith. I am quite satisfied that if simple steps were taken by the Minister, this matter could be adjusted to the satisfaction of all.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that if the Minister comes into this House some time after April next and indicates that he proposes to increase social welfare benefits because of the cost of living and because it is necessary to increase <Col N="1721" /> them, provided there are no strings attached, in regard to increases on bread, butter, foodstuffs, clothing and footwear, he will receive the support of the Fine Gael Party.  He will certainly receive my support and I will agitate to the best of my ability, within the framework of my own Party, to see that he gets the support of that Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal very briefly with four aspects of social welfare, social work, the social science graduate, the old age non-contributory pensioners and social security generally.  It is my belief that there is very little appreciation of the social science graduate and indeed of the social worker in this country.  The figures speak for themselves.  Every year 60 people graduate from our universities and colleges.  Most of those people, in the main, emigrate either to Britain or Northern Ireland, and to Northern Ireland in particular where their services are snapped up immediately on graduation.  I believe there is not a proper recognition by the Department of Social Welfare of the need to induct those qualified people into the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tendency today is to look on our social services as pieces of administrative machinery for doling out entitlements of one kind or another. We have not reached the stage at which we can look on our social services as agencies for dealing with cases of family breakdown, the support of many old people, the mentally ill, <Col N="1722" /> deprived children and with personal problems of children and young people in need of protection or, if I may add, in need of control in some instances.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that in this community of ours where there is so much emphasis on the religious and ideological importance of the family unit, there are not children's departments and family welfare departments in our local government administration. These two offshoots of the Department are so self-explanatory that they do not need any explanation from me but the point is that one gets the feeling that the work of the Department of Social Welfare is confined to doling out of all sorts of benefits and nothing else.  The function of relieving our deprived children is at the moment being carried out by various district groups, Catholic and Protestant, and of course there is little co-ordination between them.  I do not want to suggest that these groups are not doing a good job.  They are doing a first-class job but it is the lack of communication between the groups that is bad.  This applies to an area in which our social workers' problems in dealing with the maladjustment of families are greatest.</P>
    <P>These qualified social workers make tremendous contributions in many ways.  There are of course many mal-adjustments in families living in poor housing conditions.  All these can be deemed to come under the aegis of the social worker, the qualified social worker.  This is what I am trying to get across.  In recent times public attention has been focussed on the mentally ill and the care of the aged.  In my opinion, not sufficient public attention has been focussed on the possible provision of children's services about which I am speaking.</P>
    <P>The position, as I am sure every Deputy knows, is that all this legislation concerning children is contained in the 1908 Children's Act.  This is known as the children's charter.  It deals with infant life protection, protection of young children, juveniles, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave this point; I shall go off the matter altogether.  I return to my them of the social worker which I believe is very much to the point.  Another aspect of the Department is that there should be provision for the employment of a qualified social worker for a given figure of employees in various firms. There are firms who do employ the social worker, or social welfare officer, but there are many who do not.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that a social welfare officer is employed in firms for a given number of employees. Equally, the social worker has an important part to play in the implementation of the recently established manpower policy.  The manpower policy and the Occupational Injuries Bill might be seen as the beginning of a modern charter for our workers.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Minister to consider this whole question of the social worker and the social scientist in the context of the recent manpower policy and the Occupational Injuries Bill.  The whole point of my argument is that there is not enough public attention focussed on the drain from our universities in relation to social science graduates.  However, as I seem to have caused the Chair some worry, I shall not go back on that subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>You are becoming restless, Sir.  I shall go on to the question of old age non-contributory pensions. This scheme came into operation in 1908 and it was introduced to help certain members of the public on low incomes.  The scheme was financed out of funds of the Department of Local Government and Public Health of the time.  During the early years, the rate of pension was 10/-.  Those were the days of the setting up of the State. Compulsory health insurance came in 1911.  The National Insurance Act of that year compelled insurance for illness for most manual and non-manual workers below a certain income level. The distribution of benefits was given over to societies, including many of the well-known private insurance companies. The central administration of <Col N="1725" /> the scheme was provided by an Insurance Commission.  By 1933 there were 65 firms dealing with weekly contributions.</P>
      <P>I believe, Sir, this makes for inflexibility. Benefits are low and they impose a drastic reduction in living standards on people who are unemployed and people who have to try to live on these particular benefits.  It would be well to bring to the attention of the House that in most European countries this system has now been abandoned or, alternatively, these countries have introduced a flat rate contribution system.  They have introduced a graduated rate of pensions and benefits where contributions are a percentage of earnings.  Contributions are related to previous living standards.  Such a pension scheme is not a provision at a basic minimum but is in relation to previous standards of living.  The increasing popularity of this class of scheme is becoming recognised in this country. When these schemes become fully available, then we will have come to the realisation of social security.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the qualified social welfare workers&mdash;I entirely agree with the desirability of having those people but I would point out to the Deputy through the Chair that there is very little even a fully qualified social welfare worker can do for malnutrition and most of our people on social welfare are suffering from malnutrition. The whole approach of the Government to social welfare is, as the Deputy said, to dole out just barely sufficient to keep body and soul together, just barely enough to keep the breath of life in an old person.  For a Party who have enjoyed government for so long, they have made no new approach to this problem.  The system that operates at present with regard to social welfare is one which has been in operation since 1911 and with people in the Fianna Fáil Party who express, on chosen occasions, such progressive views, it is rather surprising that they have not looked at this question since 1911.</P>
      <P>One realises the magnitude of the problem with which we are faced with regard to social welfare when one considers that at any given time, one-sixth of our population, taking into consideration the recipients' dependants, live, or rather exist, on social welfare&mdash; one-sixth of our population.  It was described at some length yesterday just how a person exists on an old age pension.</P>
      <P>The proportion of our national income devoted to social welfare is the lowest in Europe, with the exception of Spain and Portugal.  I do not think there is any Deputy, irrespective of what Party he belongs to, who would feel too happy with just running neck-and-neck with countries such as Spain and Portugal.  This is after Fianna Fáil government for so very many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot these days about poverty and the war on poverty in very prosperous countries.  I think the people of this country would be satisfied if the Fianna Fáil Party even <Col N="1727" /> started a skirmish on poverty with regard to the people who are on social welfare.  I feel the vast majority of the people would be prepared to support the Government in this so even from the point of view of political expediency, at which Fianna Fáil are quite apt, I think they might have a look at this.  It might be worth their while to have a look at it because there is, make no mistake about it, a growing consciousness on the part of the people of the unchristian, inhuman way in which we have treated our old and our sick.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party do not just get up year after year, week after week, and talk about those things.  We have been prepared to prove our sincerity.  Every time the Government included in their Budget an increase in social welfare, we displayed our sincerity by voting for that part of the Budget which would bring some sort of relief, even the meagre relief the Government proposed, to those people. We need not be judged only on our words; we can stand over our record. I do not think, with all due respect to Deputy Andrews, that the Party of which he is a member can say the same.</P>

    <P>If the Minister would take his courage in his hands and face up, in a realistic manner, to this question of <Col N="1728" /> social welfare and tell the people: &ldquo;We will do this and we will tax that to do it&rdquo;, not pull a gimmick and stick in a couple of millions for some scheme but tell them: &ldquo;We are taxing this and raising revenue by this means and the money we realise there will go towards a real increase and a real rise in the standard of living of those people&rdquo;, he would get the necessary support from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my opening speech, the Estimates which we have been discussing here are, of course, out of date by now. These Estimates were based on the social welfare services as they existed prior to the Budget.  Consequently, they take no account of the changes made in the Social Welfare Act passed here before the Recess.  I mentioned, also, that we would have to have a Supplementary Estimate at a later stage in the financial year in order to deal with the position as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had quite an amount of the usual type of unreal criticism from some Opposition Deputies who completely disregard the fact that in order to distribute money to those people who are depending on social welfare, this money must first of all be levied in some form or other on the general public or some sections of the public. I can see no reason why, when advocating improved social welfare, Deputies should be so reluctant to refer to the very relevant fact that the necessary money must be compulsorily collected from the members of the community who are engaged in production.  Not alone are the Government entitled to redistribute income in this way, it is their most fundamental duty to do so and I have no apology to make for the fact that a large part of the revenue collected by the Minister for Finance is collected for redistribution by my Department, and that I collect a further substantial sum myself by way of social insurance stamps.  Some Opposition Deputies, apparently, will never learn that the people are not fools, that they are capable of appreciating that the money for expanding social welfare must be provided by them, and that they will treat with suspicion <Col N="1729" /> so-called policies which deal only in promises of improved benefits without any reference to where the money is to come from, or without any plans to ensure that the community will be in a position to finance such promises.</P>
    <P>I want to start off by saying I am completely in agreement with the viewpoint that the rates of some of the schemes administered by my Department are far too low and that it should be one of the most urgent things on the national conscience to raise them to a satisfactory level.  But, while we have had a lot of talk here and elsewhere about these inadequacies in some of our social welfare schemes, I can see no sign on either side&mdash;in the continuous struggle with regard to the distribution of the national income&mdash; of an appreciation of the fact that a higher proportion of this income must, in all justice, be acquired by the State for redistribution amongst those who have suffered any of the misfortunes covered by social welfare schemes. Deputies would be more helpful&mdash;I agree that a number of Deputies were not too unreasonable in their comments &mdash;if they emphasised to the general public that the time has come when more of the incomes received by them as rewards for the part they have played in increasing production must be re-allocated to people who, for one reason or another, are not able at present to make any personal contribution to the improvement of the economy, although they may have made a substantial contribution in the past.</P>
    <P>Admitting there has been a recent economic setback, it is fact that we are recovering from this and it is demonstrable that since 1957 this Government have been reasonably successful in fostering economic growth. We have now, in my opinion, reached the stage where the most important function of the Government is to ensure that the increased prosperity is equitably distributed and generally utilised for the common good.  I do not accept the view that there is any good reason why this increased prosperity should remain in the hands of those to whom, because of their position in the economy, it accrued in the first <Col N="1730" /> instance, and I aim to try to acquire an increasing proportion of it for the expansion and improvement of the services administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I have shown time and time again that, at every stage since the change of Government in 1957, there has in fact been a continuous gain by each of the social welfare schemes over the cost of living.  In the earlier stages, when it was so vitally necessary to concentrate on restoring the economy which had been almost wrecked by three years of Coalition Government, the rate of improvement was slow but it was a steady and consistent improvement. Last year we made a major advance, which resulted in an increase of over £10 million in income maintenance payments, and this clearly indicated that the Government recognised their fundamental function of ensuring that the standard of living of those who had to depend on social welfare must be increased at a more rapid rate than other sections because of the leeway to be made up.  The increase of £10 million in the total of income maintenance payments was a major exercise in the redistribution of income to take in in any one year.</P>
    <P>This year, while worthwhile and costly improvements have been made, I freely admit there has been&mdash;by Fianna Fáil standards, and I emphasise by Fianna Fáil standards&mdash;something in the nature of a pause, or I should say, a temporary reversion to the pre-1965 rate of progress.  Of course, the recent enactment of the Occupational Injuries Act alters that picture of a comparative pause to one of considerable progress in regard to social welfare in this year, but it is obvious that the more rapid advance towards an adequate social welfare code, which commenced in 1965, must be resumed as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;enactment&rdquo;&mdash; yes.  It has not been brought into operation yet; the administrative arrangements necessary to bring it into operation are proceeding.  It was possible to proceed with them when the <Col N="1731" /> long passage of the Bill through the Dáil and Seanad was completed and I would hope to have the Occupational Injuries Act brought into operation by about 1st April next year, which is the target date set at the moment.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputies on the other side of the House, I see no reason at all to feel in any way inhibited in saying exactly what this means, that is, this resumption of the more rapid rate of progress commenced in 1965.  I feel in no way inhabited in saying exactly what that means to the members of the community who have not themselves to depend on social welfare.  In so far as what is often referred to here as the crushing burden of taxation is concerned, it must be accepted that the tendency of my Department will continue to be increase that load.  I certainly accept that and Deputies should realise that demands made here for improvements are, in fact, demands for increasing the load of taxation.  I recognise the importance to the community as a whole and to those depending on my Department in particular, of continuing conditions conducive to economic growth but in my opinion, the most authentic test of the success of a Government is the skill with which it channels the maximum possible amount of the national income to social purposes without inhibiting economic expansion.  That, of course, has a very important part too.  I accept it as reasonable that we as the Government should be judged by this standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always been able to show a good record in this respect.  I believe we will be able to maintain that record. It is largely because we have been able to show this record that we have been returned, as Deputy Cluskey said, so many times as the Government.  I do not see any other reason for State activity in promoting economic expansion than to make it possible to improve the all round standard of living of the community as a whole by the provision of remunerative employment for as many people as possible, and by the development of all our social services.  That is the only justification <Col N="1732" /> I see for a fostering by the State of economic activity.</P>
    <P>There is no reason I can see why the State should be active in this regard in order to enable individuals to amass large fortunes.  The State's interest is in the improvement of the standard of living of the community as a whole, with particular reference to those people who happen, through no fault of their own, to have to depend on the services administered by my Department.  I am reluctantly compelled to recognise the effectiveness of the profit motive in generating economic activity, but I have no hesitation in saying that the Government play a big part in the success or otherwise of profit-making undertakings, and therefore, the Government have an indisputable right to acquire a reasonable proportion of the profits of profit-making undertakings for distribution in the form of social welfare.</P>
    <P>No one here has advocated increased taxation, but everyone who has spoken has advocated expanded and improved social welfare services.  I feel entitled to interpret this debate, as Deputy Harte said I should interpret it, as a unanimous call on me to ensure the acquisition of more of our resources for improving the performance of my Department.  I willingly accept that as my function in the Government.  I have already referred to the general belief that the scope for increased taxation here is small.  In my opinion, it is a regrettable fact that increases in social welfare inevitably have to be so directly related to increases in taxation.  To a certain extent this is because all categories of State employees have, in the conciliation and arbitration schemes, a built-in method of not only foreclosing on revenue buoyancy but also making increased taxation inevitable, since their claims are not decided in the context of the budgetary problem as in the case of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I cannot promise that social welfare will cease to be a contributing factor to any future taxation increases there may be but I think it obvious that if we are to make a worthwhile improvement, other methods of finance <Col N="1733" /> will have to be considered.  For instance, we will have to consider moving towards a more normal relationship between the proportion of direct State contributions to total expenditure on social welfare, and the proportion contributed by the employers and workers.  As I have said, I have shown many times that we have always ensured that social welfare payments have more than kept pace with increases in the cost of living. However, since Deputy Ryan has only recently taken over as the Fine Gael spokesman on social welfare, and since he has been following the line that little, if any, improvement has been made, it would be good and helpful to place the position on record, so that he will be able to avoid making statements which cannot be substantiated.</P>
    <P>The latest cost of living figure before this Government came into office in 1957 was that for February, 1957.  The figure stood at 135.  In August, 1966, the latest figure which is now available, it stood at 187, an increase of 38.5 per cent.  In 1957, the maximum rate of the non-contributory old age pension was 24/-.  That was payable to people whose means did not exceed £52 10s per year. The maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension from the 1st of next month which will be payable to people with no assessed means will be 52/6d, an increase of 28/6d, or 119 per cent. For those whose means do not exceed £26 5s per year, the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension is 47/6d, an increase of 23/6d, or 95 per cent.  For those whose means do not exceed £52 10s per year the rate of non-contributory old age pension payable is 42/6d, an increase of 18/6d, or 77 per cent.  In the case of all those three categories a maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension of 24/- was payable in 1957.  So, covering the period in which the cost of living increased by 38.5 per cent, the increases in non-contributory old age pensions have ranged from 77 per cent&mdash;which happens to be exactly double the increase in the cost of living&mdash;to 119 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is <Col N="1734" /> aware that an increase on a very inadequate base is not comparable at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Tully that we started from a very inadequate base, and, as I have said, we have not yet reached an adequate situation.  I am merely saying that we are making progress, and I can assure Deputy Tully that we will continue to make progress.  In addition to that substantial gain on the cost of living, we have also provided in regard to non-contributory old age pensions, additions in respect of dependent children which, strange as it may seem, have caused quite a considerable improvement in many cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-contributory widows' pensions, in 1957 the maximum rate payable to widows whose means did not exceed £52 10s per year was 22/6d.  From 1st November onwards, the maximum rate which will be payable to those who have no assessed means will be 51/-, an increase of 28/6d, or 127 per cent.  For those whose means do not exceed £26 5s, the rate of non-contributory widow's pension is 46/-, an increase of 23/6 or 104 per cent.  For those whose means do not exceed £52 10s, the rate of pension is 41/-, an increase of 18/6 or 82 per cent.  This means that over a period in which the cost of living rose by 38.5 per cent, the rates of non-contributory widows' pensions have been increased by from 82 per cent to 127 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as Deputies known, there have been many easements of the regulations and extensions of scope in regard to this pension.  In regard to unemployment assistance, a scheme very seldom mentioned, and certainly one which never received any attention from any Government other than the Fianna Fáil Government, the improvement appears to be even more spectacular, but that, I fully concede to Deputy Tully, is because the base from which we started was even more inadequate and this was largely so because of neglect by Coalition Governments.  I cannot understand how Deputies seem to think that if non-contributory old age pensions are dealt with, we have <Col N="1735" /> salved our conscience.  While there is every reason to demand improvements in the rate of non-contributory old age pensions, younger people who find themselves depending on unemployment assistance are equally in need of consideration.  I could never understand why unemployment benefit never took part in either of the two increases which were given during the two Coalition Government times.</P>
    <P>In 1957 in urban areas, unemployment benefit for a single man was 18/- per week.  It is now 39/-, an increase of 21/- or 117 per cent.  In the case of a married person the rate in 1957 was 28/- and it is now 72/6, an increase of 44/6 or 159 per cent. In rural areas, for some reason which I would not attempt to justify, the rate is lower and the improvement is even more spectacular.  The rate was 12/- in 1957 for a single man.  It is now 33/-, an increase of 21/- or 175 per cent.  In the case of a married person, it was 20/- in 1957 and it is now 64/6, an increase of 44/6 or 222.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Before leaving that subject, would the Minister comment on the question I asked about introducing a disability assistance scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I often get the impression that Deputy Tully&mdash;I do not say he has any other way of getting information&mdash;can read my mind to a certain extent.  We have cover for all the contingencies laid down as requiring cover under income maintenance schemes by the ILO on both insurance and assistance sides, except that, on the assistance side, we have nothing that really corresponds to disability benefit.  We have the disabled persons maintenance allowances scheme but that does not compare with disability benefit in the same way as unemployment assistance compares with unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have felt for some time that this is the only real gap in the structure of our income maintenance services. I am not saying that these services are <Col N="1736" /> entirely satisfactory otherwise but this is the only gap I see, and I would certainly hope at some time to fill that gap satisfactorily.  In the White Paper on Health, the Minister for Health announced his intention to change the method of assessing means under the disabled persons maintenance allowances scheme, to bring it more into line with the assessment of means for the other schemes such as unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case I am discussing with the Minister for Health whether or not this scheme should come under the aegis of the Department which deals with all the other income maintenance schemes.  If it does, my object would be to bring it into conformity with the unemployment assistance scheme so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it would be very difficult in the case of self-employed people to have a scheme of payments for short-term illnesses because, unlike employment which is remunerated by wages, the income does not always completely cease in the case of short-term illnesses.  Whatever is done in this respect will probably, initially at any rate, have to be confined to long-term illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going on to show that we have ensured that social insurance benefits more than kept pace with increases in the cost of living.  In the case of unemployment benefit and disability benefit, the rate for a single person in 1957 was 30/-.  That has been increased by 22/6 to 52/6 or 75 per cent. In the case of a married person, the rate in 1957 was 45/- It is now 92/6, an increase of 47/6 or 106 per cent. The contributory widows' pension is of course paid at the same rate as the single rate for unemployment or disablement benefit and has increased in the same way.  This again has happened in a period when the cost of <Col N="1737" /> living figures increased by 38.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to contributory old age pensions, we have taken care to ensure that they have made a relative gain on the increase on the cost of living.  The scheme was introduced for the first time in 1961 and so it is only with the position since then that it can be compared.  In November, 1960 the cost of living figure was 148; in August this year, it was 187, an increase of 26.3 per cent.  The original rate of contributory old age pension in January, 1961 was 40/-.  It is now 60/-, an increase of 50 per cent and the married rate has been increased from 68s 6d to 107s 6d, an increase of 57 per cent, in a period when the cost of living increased by 26.3 per cent.  In addition to that, we have introduced additional allowances for dependent children in both non-contributory and contributory old age pension schemes. The result is&mdash;there are now one or two cases only, exceptional cases, but cases of need nevertheless&mdash; where the maximum rate of old age pension in the course of payment is £5 7s 6d per week and in the case of contributory old age pensions, there are one or two maximum rates of £9 17s 6d being paid.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1957, when there was, of course, no contributory old age pension scheme, the maximum anybody in these circumstances could have received was 24/- per week.  It is clear, therefore, that in addition to ensuring that the maximum rates of payment have more than kept pace with increases in the cost of living, we have also succeeded in developing and expanding the social welfare services in many cases.  In 1957 the maximum income, irrespective of the number of dependent children, above which no non-contributory pension was payable was £104 15s a year.  Now a person with two dependent children could have an income not exceeding £208 15s per year to qualify for the minimum rate of pension and this, of course, would be increased by £13 per annum for each child in excess of two.  If that man's wife were also still alive the minimum rate of non-contributory <Col N="1738" /> old age pension would be payable on an income not exceeding double that amount, £417 10s, with increases for each child in excess of two.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think I have shown without going into great detail that not only have we been ensuring that the cost of living has not gained on the rates of payment of social welfare benefit but we have been also expanding the cover of the different social welfare schemes.  Of course I agree that if we take in isolation the period since the last general increases were granted, a case can be made for further increases based on the increase in the cost of living, apart from the fact I have admitted that there is a fundamental case for increases in the rates of payment themselves which are, as we are all agreed, too low in the absolute.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured from our record of attention to this matter that we shall not allow the cost of living, for the first time since we took over in 1957, to gain on the rates of social welfare benefits.  While I admit there is a special need to increase social assistance rates, the figures I have just given do not substantiate Deputy James Tully's assertion that social assistance improvements have not kept pace with improvements in social insurance benefits.  There is clear evidence in the figures of the increases given of my appreciation of the more urgent need for improvements in the rates of social assistance given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan had some interesting and attractive suggestions for new forms of assistance such as the provision of assistance in kind and so on in addition to monetary payments. There are many such things which could be done but Deputy Ryan and others also pointed to the necessity which we all see for substantial increases in many of the rates of benefit payable under the existing schemes. The fact is that the desirability for innovation and expansion is always in competition for a limited amount of money with the urgent need for improving existing rates of payment. Despite this, there has been no recent <Col N="1739" /> year when there was not some substantial expansion of the cover of social welfare in addition to increases in the rates of payment.  I shall not lose any opportunity to develop a more comprehensive social welfare code but, unfortunately, it is always necessary to make a choice as to how money available to me is spent.  Certainly there is no shortage of ideas as to improvements that could be made.</P>
    <P>A lot of the debate was taken up dealing with the question of the effect of the recent reciprocal agreement with the British Government in regard to pensions on recipients of British pensions who are also in receipt of non-contributory pensions here.  I should like first of all to point out that it was known while the negotiations were going on that some of those people had come into the means category which qualified them for social assistance here because of the failure up to then of the British Government to pay increases awarded to their pensioners living here.  Because these increases were not being paid to British pensioners living in this country, the Irish taxpayer had to carry that burden.  It was known that there would be a saving on non-contributory pensions in this country when this reciprocal agreement was put into effect and the savings estimated from this source, in so far as it was possible to estimate them, were taken into account in the improvements granted in the Budget and in the Social Welfare Act of this year. The Act had some further improvements not mentioned in the Budget.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, the improvements provided in this year's Social Welfare Act are not included in this Estimate and so the effect of the saving on non-contributory pensions has not shown up in this Estimate but will show up in the Supplementary Estimate which I shall be introducing later in the financial year. It is not asking too much of Deputies to try to understand how it came about that some reductions in these non-contributory pensions had to be made due to the fact that the reciprocal <Col N="1740" /> agreement provided, among other things, for the payment by the British Government of increases granted to their pensioners this year, increases which had been with held up to now.</P>
    <P>When that agreement came into operation, the pensions payable by the British Government to people here immediately were increased to the amounts which would be payable if those people were residing in Britain itself.  I cannot understand the attitude of Deputies who request that because this money comes from outside the country, it should not be assessed as means, while contributory old age pensions provided under our own scheme are assessed as means, and in fact, rule the person out entirely for a non-contributory pension.  I cannot understand why it should be suggested that this type of income should be disregarded while pensions earned in ordinary industrial employment are not disregarded or while the savings gathered by a self-employed person over his whole lifetime are not disregarded.</P>
    <P>Surely the suggestion here, if it is to be carried out logically and justly, must come down to this old demand for the abolition of the means test.  There is no merit whatever that I can see in the suggestion that this type of income should be ignored and other incomes taken into account in regard to the means test.  Deputies either see the need for and the equity of having the means test when the amount of money available for social assistance is limited, or they do not.  It must boil down to the fundamental question whether the limited amount of money it is possible to extract from the community for this purpose should be given out regardless of means or should be related to the needs of people who otherwise qualify for it.  When the amount of money is limited&mdash;and surely everybody here must realise that for the foreseeable future at any rate it will be limited&mdash;it is fundamental that this money should be distributed on the basis of bringing the &ldquo;havenots&rdquo; as far as possible up to the same level as the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy made a demand for the abolition of what he described as <Col N="1741" /> the niggardly means test.  I cannot remember all the epithets he used; to amuse myself when he was talking I jotted them down, but they all mean the same thing.  A call for the abolition of the means test is a demand on me to give this limited amount of money that is available on an equal basis to those people who have ample means and those who have no means whatsoever. It is a fundamental thing in the distribution of social assistance that it should be given on the basis of means.</P>
    <P>There has been, I admit, some confusion in regard to the amount of money which, because of this reciprocal agreement, became available for redistribution by my Department.  The estimate I gave on 14th June last was that £268,000 would thus become available.  That was on the basis of what appeared to be likely to happen at that time, but it now transpires, when I think we have reached finality, that the total is approximately £195,500.  As I said, it surely would be anomalous to treat those who got their British pensions increased as being still in receipt of lower pensions while persons being awarded British pensions now would naturally be assessed on the basis of the full pension.  I regard the suggestion to abolish the means test or to change it as an abominable one and I certainly cannot understand how any member of a Party who claim to have the interests of the less fortunate members of the community, particularly at heart, could demand of me that I distribute this limited amount of money on an equal basis regardless of means. The suggestion that I should give an old age non-contributory pension, which admittedly is at an inadequate level, at the same rate to people who have an income of £4 per week from another source as to those who have no means is, in my opinion, an antisocial suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the requirement to cash social welfare benefits at specified post offices.  I think he exaggerated the difficulties in so far as the people cashing them were concerned. I would like to make them more freely exchangeable, but there <Col N="1742" /> are many objections to doing this.  One that springs to mind immediately is that subpostmasters can be required to cash these cheques as a separate transaction which forms part of their remuneration, whereas other traders would be obliging customers by cashing them.  Cases have been known of people who insisted on payment in kind rather than in cash, and we all know of cases where, for instance, children's allowance books have been held by traders as security for credit. That is an undesirable thing.</P>
    <P>The collection of children's allowances, in particular, in densely populated areas is a problem which I should like to see solved.  It is rather humiliating and degrading for people to have to queue up to obtain these allowances and it does involve a certain amount of hardship, especially in bad weather.  However, it is a difficult problem to solve and there are many reasons why the present system is adopted.  Certainly if I can find any way of avoiding this, I shall do it.  Of course, as has been said, it is not compulsory to collect this money on the first day of the month.</P>

It is difficult to find a more suitable way of doing it but, certainly, if I can arrive at any solution of the problem, I will.</P>

      <P>Although my Department is aware of a small number of Irish residents who have been employed for this purpose by the organisers of international conferences, we have not within Ireland a sufficient number of fully qualified simultaneous interpreters to provide for all possible requirements which could include all five official languages of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The need for such services here is very sporadic and, therefore, does not offer prospects of a career in Ireland for fully qualified professional simultaneous interpreters.  International bodies holding conferences here normally provide their own interpreters. To the extent that interpreters are not available here it has been found possible to obtain them from abroad as required.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by CIE that the present position regarding compensation payable for land used in the building of the new railway at Silvermines, County <Col N="1744" /> Tipperary, is that the Board has not yet received all the claims from the persons upon whom Notices to Treat were served.  Notwithstanding this, the Board is dealing with all claims which have been lodged to date and the relevant papers are at present in the hands of the Board's valuer for the purpose of considering the claims which have been lodged.  On hearing from the Board's valuer in the matter, the Board expects to be in a position to open negotiations with the claimants regarding the amount of compensation to be paid.</P>
      <P>The amount of compensation is a matter for negotiation between the Board and the claimants in the first instance and failing agreement in any case the amount of compensation in such case will be determined by arbitration under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
      <P>Under the provision of the relevant Railway Works Order the Board is obliged, where it has entered and taken possession of land being compulsorily acquired before ascertainment of the compensation for the land, to pay to the occupier of the land interest on the amount of the compensation at the rate of three per cent per annum from the date of entry until payment of the compensation.</P>

      <P>The sale and chartering of vessels is primarily the concern of the Board of Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months the company sold one vessel on which a crew of 44 had been employed.</P>
      <P>The company had previously sold another vessel in August 1965 and this vessel was chartered immediately under her new name from the purchasers as a matter of convenience to complete certain commitments.  This charter terminated on 13th June, 1966. So far as the company are aware no Irish seamen were employed on the ship during the period of the charter.</P>
      <P>These vessels were disposed of because they were uneconomic and no longer suitable for the company's trade. A large dry cargo bulk carrier of 34,000 tons d.w. is at present being built at Cork Dock Yard for delivery to the company in October, 1967.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in relation to the bakery trade up to 90 per cent of the firms engaged do not qualify for registration for wholesale tax because they do not use a minimum of £100 of taxable material per month, with the result that all these small firms will now be obliged either to stand the tax on materials purchased for the making of bread and cakes or to pass the tax on to the consumer; and if so, what effect this will have on the trading position with smaller firms as against the larger ones or on the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Finance (No.2) Act, 1966 provides that a person manufacturing exempt goods may register for the purposes of the wholesale tax if he uses taxable goods in substantial quantities as materials.  Registration allows the person concerned to buy his materials free of tax but involves him to some extent in the keeping of records and in the making of returns, and renders his books liable to periodic inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners originally took the view that a fixed sum of £100 a month would be a reasonable figure to set as the limit above which manufacturers should be allowed to make tax-free purchases of materials, and so become eligible for registration.  Subsequently, however, in discussion with the Revenue <Col N="1748" /> Commissioners, many of the smaller manufacturers expressed concern at the effect on them of a limit as high as £100 a month, and the Commissioners then issued instructions to the Collector-General and to inspectors of taxes to the effect that small manufacturers should be allowed to register if they show that in their circumstances their purchases are substantial in relation to the size of their business.</P>
    <P>The Deputies may rest assured, therefore, that any small confectioner or baker who has been refused registration will have his case reviewed sympathetically if he resubmits his application with an explanation of his circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if that will enable him to be treated in the same way as traders who hitherto did business exceeding £100 a month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the purpose of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that any system which differentiates&mdash;it does not matter what the differentiation is&mdash;in relation to the tax as between the bigger person and the smaller person is not sound, that it should be the same for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Anomalies occur in all tax systems but, in so far as they do here, the Revenue Commissioners have been doing their best to eliminate the anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the position is that a tax is imposed by the House with the intention that it should be of equal application to all?  It seems to me from the Minister's reply&mdash;I do not know whether he will agree with me or not&mdash;that, in fact, what we have done is handed over our discretion to the Revenue Commissioners so that they can adjudicate and decide whether or not purchases are substantial in relation to the size of a firm's business or not.  Surely the Minister will agree that that is a matter that should be settled here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to settle every detail of that nature that <Col N="1749" /> would arise and write it into legislation but, in the long run, the tax would have to be paid and the tax usually transmits itself down along the line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Little Report and having regard to the provision for the food processing project made in the current year's Public Capital Programme, Erin Foods, Limited, is now engaged in a development of the UK market and an expansion of its existing range of products. The company's objective is the creation, within a reasonable time, of a substantial self-supporting food processing industry directed mainly to export.  The success of the company's efforts towards expansion will, of course, benefit those supplying it with raw materials.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in a reply to a question from the Deputy on 6th October, it is the intention to introduce further legislation as soon as possible to deal with the provision of additional Exchequer investment in the food project and a number of related matters, and this legislation will provide an opportunity for a full discussion of the point raised in the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the allocation from the Capital Budget this year not indicate a lesser sum being spent on the promotion than that suggested in the Little Report and is this not a reason for disagreement with the former General Manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  The Capital Programme naturally envisages the amount of money expended over a period and related to the anticipated sum fixed then.  But, as well as the sum of £45 million shown in the Capital Programme, a further sum in excess of £1 million is provided by way of refinancing in the current year. <Col N="1750" /> The company have asked to have until the end of this trading year to see what supports they should seek and what other objects they should set themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's decision has been based so far on the Little Report.  There are certain recommendations there that appealed to the Government.  Naturally, they had to put these to the company. The company have asked for this period until the end of the present trading year in order to see in what direction they ought to go.  That is not unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisional figures available from the Garda Síochána show that for the first nine months of 1966 the number of hit-and-run offences reported is 635.  Although I understand that in a great majority of these cases no personal injury was involved, nevertheless I fully agree with the Deputy as to the seriousness of this offence and the need to educate the public in this respect.  My Department have just completed the production of a series of road safety films, one of which is entitled &ldquo;Accident Procedure&rdquo;. This film is in two parts&mdash;one dealing with the duties of drivers involved in accidents and the other showing the case of driver who, having hit a pedestrian, is tempted to drive away and evade his responsibilities. This series of films will be released for the forthcoming December Road Safety Campaign and in due course it is hoped that they will be seen in all cinemas throughout the country and, it is hoped, on television.</P>
      <P>The duties of drivers involved in road accidents are laid down in section 106 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  This section is summarised on page 31 of the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; a booklet of which all drivers are expected to have a sound knowledge.  It will be noted that, not merely does the offence involve severe penalties, but special powers are made available to the Garda under section 106 and also section 107 of the 1961 Act to enable them to apprehend the hit-and-run driver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Claims to unemployment benefit made by the two persons referred to in respect of 1st October, 1966, were disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that the claimants did not satisfy the primary statutory condition laid down by section 15 (1) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, for entitlement to such benefit, that is, that they were unemployed on that day.</P>
      <P>The claimants, if dissatisfied, have the right to appeal against the decisions to an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the two cases I have mentioned are simply test cases?  In fact, the adjudication of his Department concerns dock workers as a whole in every one of our ports.  Apparently, his Department have irregularly invoked regulations denying the right of port workers to sign for a Saturday morning on which they are not employed.  I would like the Minister to explain to me the anomaly whereby <Col N="1755" /> dockers employed on a weekly wage basis are entitled and facilitated to sign on Monday for the Saturday, whereas dockers employed on a tonnage basis are not allowed to do so?  Would the Minister explain to me how this differentiation exists? From a study of the regulations under the Acts, I cannot understand it, and certainly the dockers cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Deputy said these are test cases, the claimants would be well advised to appeal to an appeals officer, as I suggested in my reply.  This is a problem arising out of the fact that many people now have a five-day working week.  In cases where a full five-day week has been worked and the work is resumed with the same employer on the following Monday, Saturday is not regarded as a day of unemployment.  On the basis that wages payable in respect of the five-day week include an element for Saturday, the contract between the employer and the employee subsists over the weekend.  However, as I said, the claimants have a right of appeal to an appeals officer.  I shall not decide the appeal here.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that it took a month and two days to send out an appeals form.  Notification that it was intended to appeal was received on 22nd July and the appeals form was sent out on 15th August.  I am informed that this did not hold up the progress of the appeal because the second medical examination was carried out on 16th August.  With regard to the acknowledgment, it is not the practice to acknowledge receipt of these forms.  What the Deputy refers to as an acknowledgment was a communication sent to the applicant as a result of a phone call to the local agent. Arrangement have been made for an oral hearing and there should be no great delay after that.  It is not correct for the Deputy to say that the person concerned is entitled to this benefit: that has not yet been established.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully again criticised the attitude of social welfare officers when investigating means for various forms of social assistance.  I made it clear on previous occasions that I have really no reason to believe these charges and no Deputy has brought any specific case to my notice.  Social welfare officers have a difficult but essential task and, as I said, it is a vital task in ensuring the equitable administration of social assistance.  I am certain that the vast majority, at any rate, approach their task in the proper manner and in the realisation that they are an important part in the machinery maintained by the State for the elimination, in so far as possible, of hardship arising from any of the contingencies covered by the social welfare schemes.  Certainly I have done everything possible to satisfy myself that every social welfare officer appreciates that it is his job to ensure that if the State has provided benefit for a particular contingency, the person properly claiming this benefit gets it as a right established by legislation and without any compliment to the social welfare officer, the old age pension committee, or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear that the attitude of social welfare officers should at all times be helpful to applicants and I believe this is generally the position. In the case of assistance services, it is necessary to ascertain the means of applicants and, as I said before, not to do so would be rank injustice to the people who are in need.  However, the ascertaining of the means is a delicate job in which tact and courtesy must be combined with thoroughness.  There is a requirement, and again this is an essential one in the interests of equity and the distribution of the limited <Col N="1771" /> amount of money available, that increases in means be reported and so reassessments of means are occasionally necessary.  I must say, however, that when I see a file in which the social welfare officer solemnly asserts that a widow, or worse still, an old age pensioner, actually succeeded in increasing the income from an uneconomic and understocked farm, I react in much the same way as Deputy Tully.  How a social welfare officer, who is probably urban born and bred, can convince himself that he can assess all the imponderables associated with a year's agricultural operations so accurately and definitely as to decide that a recipient of social assistance should be moved from one means category to another, passes my comprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  An assessment of means must be made in the first instance.  I think that is a fundamental, but any normal man, in my opinion, should assume that the farming efficiency of the widow or the old age pensioner is likely to decrease rather than increase with the passage of time.  I should also say it is beyond the capacity of any ordinary person, taking account of good years with bad years, to say that a man's assessment of £25 should be raised to £35.  Certainly I would not like to take the responsibility of making a decision like that and I do not think anybody can really make such a decision with confidence that he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, necessary to find out if there has been an increase of income from any other source, such as the payment of a legacy or a pension, but, in my opinion, once the income from a farm to an old age pensioner or a widow has been decided on in the first instance, it should be left alone in the future.  As I said, I am satisfied that most social welfare officers appreciate their function in ensuring that social welfare is provided in accordance with the law.  I must admit I have come across one case which appeared to be a case of a new broom sweeping clean. <Col N="1772" /> It was the case of a new social welfare officer in an area embarking on a systematic revision of cases decided on the basis of his predecessor's reports. I have made it clear in such cases that it should be borne in mind by social welfare officers, deciding officers and appeals officers that the previous man probably had long experience of the area and was, in all probability, just as conscientious as his successor.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, as I said, that in the vast majority of cases the social welfare officers appreciate that it is just as much their function to ensure that a person gets what the law intends him to get as it is to ensure that people do not get more than they are entitled to.  I am also satisfied that they appreciate in the main&mdash;I have no instance of any case where this is not appreciated&mdash;the necessity for tact and courtesy in carrying out their very difficult task.</P>

      <P>As I said last year, the Social Welfare officer should assume that by reaching the age of 70, or by becoming a widow, as the case may be, a person has already fulfilled one of the conditions for the receipt of the pension for which he or she is applying and that it is the job of the welfare officer to find out in an objective way, and with courtesy and tact, whether the other conditions laid down by the law are fulfilled by the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned a disability assistance scheme and I have already dealt with that.  He also mentioned <Col N="1773" /> the case of employers who do not stamp their cards for employees with the result that employees are ineligible for benefit when they apply for it. The position is that the employer then owes as a debt to the employees whatever amount of benefit they have lost. My Department will always give every possible assistance to a person who wants to claim for the recovery of such money.  Deputy Tully suggested that as a matter of course the Department should undertake this for those people.  I would be very sympathetic to that idea.  The Department are not, of course, an interested party in this matter and I do not know whether it would be possible to do it without possibly being appointed as agent for the individual concerned.  Nevertheless, I agree that it is probably true that some people do not, themselves, take the steps necessary to recover this lost benefit.  I am, in fact, considering whether or not it would be possible for the Department to do this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised the question of people who make late claims for disability benefit.  There is a provision that if there is good cause for the delay, payment will be made from the fourth day of illness, but it is obviously necessary to have this regulation that the claim should be made at the first available opportunity in order to prevent abuses.</P>

      <P>With regard to the provisions in this year's Social Welfare Act, under which unemployment benefit for the first time is made available to a woman in domestic employment, I think Deputy Tully is a bit unreasonable in his attitude. As he said himself, the original assumption was that there was no real unemployment in this type of employment. I decided, after some experience in the Department, that I had sufficient evidence to show me that this assumption was not correct and I decided to make this change.  We could have decided that unemployment benefit would be paid in the normal way and contributed to at the normal full rate but it appeared to me and my Department that unemployment in this particular type of employment, in the main, arose only in the case of a person who had been in the same employment for a considerable number of years and found it difficult to adjust herself to the ways of a new employer or just was not adaptable to new employment.  It was not from any motives of meanness, which have been imputed to me by Deputy Tully, that this provision was put in.  It was put in purely because it did not seem to be necessary to impose the full rate of contribution in order to give a benefit which would probably be needed only in the cases that are in fact provided for.  The matter can always be reviewed and I would welcome Deputy Tully's assistance in keeping this under review in an objective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara and Deputy Lyons mainly dealt with reductions in non-contributory pensions due to increases in British pensions.  I have already dealt with this matter.  Deputy Dowling referred to the fact that children's allowances are paid without a means test. Some other Deputies also referred to this.  This does not apply to Deputy Dowling in particular but some other Deputies who objected to children's <Col N="1775" /> allowances being paid without a means test at the same time were critical of the fact that a means test did apply to the other social assistance schemes. If we look at children's allowances purely as social assistance, a means test would be proper but children's allowances perform another function, apart from the social assistance function. They perform the function of helping to lessen the disparity in the standard of living of people in similar occupations who have different family commitments.  That may not be so obviously a social welfare purpose but it is a function they perform and I think it is a desirable one.  This could be done of course in another way, by increasing income tax allowances for dependants, but it appears to me to be just as well to do it this way and avoid the administrative expenses in applying a means test to children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the fact that we pay these children's allowances to millionaires but I do not know whether there are any millionaires at present receiving children's allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not become millionaires as a result of all the children's allowances they get anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are, they are few in number, and I prefer to leave it as it is and press the Minister for Finance to deal with millionaires in another way and get back more than they get in children's allowances but Deputy Tully thinks this would not be a great imposition on the millionaires. Deputy Dowling was another of the Deputies who advocated the payment of old age pensions at 65.  Some Deputy said this would be done at some time.  I agree, but I cannot say when.  Deputy Dowling is wrong when he says it could be done at no cost to the Exchequer.  It would be a considerable cost to the Exchequer, and to employers and employees by way of social insurance stamps, and this is one of the many things that are in competition with the continuing need to improve the rates of payment in the schemes as they stand for the limited amount of money it is possible to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> I think I have already given some facts which should disprove Deputy O'Leary's contention that social welfare is only discovered by what he calls the conservative Parties at election time.  I have given some facts which should disprove that.  The progress of the rates of payment of the different social welfare schemes in regard to increases in the cost of living, as I demonstrated, has been continuing over the period since 1957 with a stepping up of the rate of progress last year and there have been only two elections in that period.  It would be difficult to relate all the increases that have been granted to these two elections.  I think I will resist the temptation to contrast our record in this regard with the record of the two Labour Ministers for Social Welfare which we have had.  It is difficult to resist that.  Indeed, when Deputy Tully makes reference to children's allowances which have never been touched by any other Government but Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the contributory old age pension not being payable outside the country or outside Great Britain was raised here and I intend to look at that to see if it is possible to remedy the situation.  The fact is the case that was raised by Deputy Belton I think is the only case that has come to my notice and I hope to be able to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be retrospective for this person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely to be retrospective.  Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>) referred to the fact that reservation of the right of residence and maintenance by a landowner over his farm will deprive the person concerned of the extra 5/- which is being granted from the 1st November this year.  That is a fact, but I have heard pleas here on a number of occasions that there should be more consideration for the most destitute people.  In <Col N="1777" /> the difficult budgetary situation that existed this year, I think I was quite justified in view of the pleas that have been made over the years here, in utilising the comparatively small amount of money to provide something extra for those people who have no means.  Surely it will be agreed that a person who has a right of residence, and maintenance while not well off because of that, is substantially better off than a person who is completely destitute and who has to provide himself or herself with whatever accommodation it is possible to provide.</P>
      <P>I think it was a move in the right direction to provide something extra for people in that position and, in fact, if Deputies would look at the means scale given in the handbook on the social welfare services they will see there are still some gaps that should be filled before we can be reasonably certain that we are distributing this money equitably between all the applicants for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy went further than Deputy Dowling in requesting that not only contributory pensioners but non-contributory pensioners should be made eligible at 65 and called on me to ask my colleagues to make the money available to do this.  Unfortunately there is more to it than that.  This particular proposal would involve a really large sum of money, particularly if you associate it with the request that was also made to abolish the means test.  If we take it that the percentage of people between 65 and 70 who would qualify by means for the old age pension would be similar to those over 70 who qualify for it, it would be easy to make an estimate of what this would cost.  The problem would be not just to convince my colleagues to give me this money but, first of all, so to expand the economy sufficiently that it could provide me with the money.  We are all agreed that the rates for those who qualify already, those who are over 70, are too low so we have the need to increase those rates.  Then we have the demand to reduce the age to 65.  Here, again, even if this large amount of money did become available the choice would have to be made between improving <Col N="1778" /> the rates of pension at present payable to an adequate amount or using the money to make pensions available at 65.  Personally, I think we should try to bring the present old age pension, the pension as at present payable, up to a satisfactory rate before we reduce the age.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of Deputies not being entitled to approach deciding officers and appeals officers raised by Deputy M.P. Murphy, I do not know anything of an alleged change in the position here.  I understand that the position is that at an oral appeal a Deputy will be allowed to attend on behalf of an applicant.  If an oral hearing is claimed, then the Deputy can appear.  It was also suggested by Deputy M.P. Murphy that the percentage of cases varied in the applican't favour on appeal was very low. I do not think this is so.  I have only got figures for social assistance claims, excluding old age pensions, and the percentage of such cases which are varied in the applicant's favour on appeal is 34.5 per cent which, I think, is quite a substantial amount.  I have not got the figures for non-contributory old age pensions due to the fact that these are decided in the first place by old age pension committees.  The appeal is generally by the social welfare officer rather than by the person claiming the old age pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would, at this stage, say in regard to the point he mentioned of the Deputies attending an oral hearing whether the applicant must request the oral hearing so as to enable the Deputy to be present to represent him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, oral hearings are usually arranged to suit the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also raised the question <Col N="1779" /> of people with other occupations who are debarred from receipt of unemployment benefit because of the fact that they have this other occupation.  I have gone a long way towards remedying this or meeting the case that has been put forward here before by Deputy Murphy and other Deputies. In the first place, I raised the amount of income from the second occupation which would disqualify a person from unemployment benefit and the disqualifying income is now higher here than in Britain.  In addition to that, I changed the regulations so that this rule does not apply at all to a person whose insurance record shows that he has been consistently working for wages.  If a person has 78 paid contributions over a period of three years, then this income rule on the secondary occupation does not arise.  I also removed the overriding disqualification which applied to licensees of public houses.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Murphy that it is unrealistic to assess the means of a widow claiming a non-contributory old age pension on the income derived from a smallholding while her husband was alive.  Obviously, a widow, particularly with a young family, could not hope to extract the same income from a farm as her husband could when in full health.  Adequate allowance for the reduced efficiency of the widow, as compared with her husband, or for paid labour, should be made in those cases and I believe that it is made.  Deputies should remember, in this regard, the recent change which we made in the Social Welfare Acts last year whereby £39 is deducted from the assessment of means in respect of each dependent child and also, in the case of intestacy, the amount of a child's share which is taken into account in the assessment of means is limited to £26.  Both those amendments have been of considerable advantage to a number of widows in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones raised the question of the areas scheduled for the application of the amendment to the unemployment assistance scheme in regard to <Col N="1780" /> the assessment of means of smallholders. He said it was hard to understand how these areas were decided on.  I dare say in many areas this is so, but I adopted the widest existing definition of the congested areas, that which is used by the Department of Agriculture.  I do not think it would be reasonable to expect me to embark on the task of drawing up a definition of my own for congested areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter raised the question of the making of employment period orders and gave the reasons which had been given in the past to justify these. I have said here before that I cannot bring myself to put forward those reasons as justification.  The only reason that I can give for having to make employment period orders is that I have never had sufficient money available to me to abolish them.  This is one of the many improvements which could be made in our social welfare code but I cannot say when it will be possible to make it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be necessary for me to refer to a ridiculous allegation such as Deputy Treacy made, that social assistance recipients did not benefit at all from the extra expenditure provided for in this Estimate. That is probably too ridiculous to mention but the facts are that the payments of social assistance provided for in this Estimate are £3 million more than last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it is a lesser percentage than it had been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I shall come to that.  I see that I have a note of some of the adjectives used by Deputy Treacy with regard to the means test&mdash;&ldquo;odious&rdquo;, &ldquo;despicable&rdquo; and so on&mdash; but I think I have dealt with that already.  I entirely disagree with his views and I must say, if they are the views of the Labour Party, it certainly astonishes me that such a Party can claim to have the interests of the less well-off in the community at heart.  If we were to dispense with a means test, it would mean the disposal of a limited sum of money without regard to the <Col N="1781" /> need of the person for it and, in such circumstances, the people who have little or no means would come off worst.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy also alleged that, in the assessment of means, charitable donations are taken into account.  That only shows his ignorance of the subject. There are many disregards, and charitable donations are one of them. Up to last year charitable donations in excess of £1 per week were taken into account but now they are not taken into account at all.  I am sure Deputy James Tully knew that but he was not here at the time, or possibly he might have corrected his colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the cheap fuel scheme and Deputy Treacy, in particular, said he could see no reason why this should exist in certain towns only.  There is no reason I know of now, but this scheme, as Deputy Treacy said, was instituted first during the emergency days, when fuel of all kinds was in short supply. This scheme was introduced as a special form of assistance in a number of towns which were scheduled as non-turf areas and where the procuring of turf&mdash;which was the only fuel available at the time&mdash;was difficult for anybody, but especially difficult for recipients of social assistance.  That scheme was introduced then and, with the return to different circumstance, it was never changed.  There is now no reason I can see why there should be this differential between these and other towns.  I think it is a wasteful way of spending money; it would be much better to take the cost of the scheme and give it to the recipients.  The only sensible thing I can see to do now is to replace this cheap fuel scheme by a cash payment and provide this payment in all areas. But, here again&mdash;as in all social welfare matters&mdash;it is a question of the <Col N="1782" /> availability of money and of a choice as to how whatever money is available will be expended.</P>
      <P>I think I dealt before with the question of the disqualification of people for unemployment benefit, due to an industrial dispute at their place of employment.  I am glad to say that discussions on the matter are now proceeding with the Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>As far as I can gather the point Deputy Molloy was making was that, in reply to a question here some time ago, I stated the position was that these discussions had been taking place and that my Department were awaiting submission of a memorandum from the Congress of Trade Unions.  At the time&mdash;I think this was in reply to a question by Deputy James Tully; he certainly asked supplementaries on it&mdash;this was not challenged and it was not until six months afterwards it was made apparent that the Congress had not the same understanding as my Department as to the belief that they had agreed to submit a memorandum on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison whatever.  The Fianna Fáil Government, in difficult circumstances, made this money available for social welfare. I saw this advertisement for the first time today; I did not even see it yesterday because I was here and did not see it in the evening papers.  It seems to me to be purely factual: there is no mention of the Fianna Fáil Government in it; it is purely an advertisement, placing at the disposal of the public, information in regard to changes in different social welfare benefits.  In my opinion, it is information very necessary to circulate but the peculiar thing about Deputy Dockrell is that he went on to complain of what he described as the lack of information in regard to social welfare matters and returned then again to charge me, as Minister for Social Welfare, with utilising the taxpayers' money on public advertisements in the newspapers, in this connection, and utilising the radio and television services for the same purpose.  I do not know what other way I could publicise these things, except through the newspapers and by the circulation of press releases, which <Col N="1784" /> were utilised by the newspapers, radio and television.</P>
      <P>Deputy Luke Belton later referred to the statement made on television and said that nobody at the meeting of the Dublin Old Age Pensions Committee knew that the increases in non-contributory old age and widows' pensions were available only to those who had no assessed means.  I am sure that Deputy Belton, as an attentive member of Dáil Éireann, meant that no one except he knew it, because as an attentive member of Dáil Éireann, he of course knows what is provided in the legislation which we passed immediately before the Recess.</P>

The advertisement and the press release which were circulated by my Department were very specific in saying that this increase of 5/- a week was for pensioners who had no assessed means, and if the people responsible on radio or television did not appreciate what &ldquo;no assessed means&rdquo; meant, and that it was an integral part of the press release, I cannot be held responsible for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal now with Deputy Ryan's continued insistence on regarding the figures published by international organisations as being reliable comparisons between the state of social welfare in the different countries. <Col N="1787" /> I think Deputy Cluskey also referred to these figures as indicating that social welfare here was on a lower scale than it is in other countries.</P>
      <P>A number of these international organisations such as the OECD and the ILO have published figures giving for various countries the expenditure on social security by relationship to the gross national product.  Not only during this debate but on other occasions we have had these figures bandied about as if they formed a realistic and absolute basis for comparison between the different countries concerned, and as if they provided a clear indication of the state of social welfare in the different countries concerned.</P>
      <P>In fact, these comparisons must be judged in the light of the warnings given in the various reports as to the comparability of the data.  It is quite clear that in comparing the percentage figures of the gross national product given in these reports we are not comparing like with like.  Deputy Ryan appeared to accept this at first.  He certainly did not dispute it, but he proceeded to ignore it and spoke of these figures as if they were an authentic measure of the level of social welfare in the different countries.  These organisations made it clear that they have not succeeded in overcoming the difficulties involved in arriving at a position in which the figures would give a true comparison as between one country and another.</P>
      <P>For instance, in the introduction to the Statistics of National Accounts 1950-61 published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development in 1964, there is a paragraph devoted to explaining the difficulties of making true comparisons between the accounts for various member countries.  In addition to that, there are general observations on the comparative tables which include this statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage structures shown in tables 5 to 9 generally refer to the two years 1950 and 1960. These percentages are more appropriate for comparing changes in structure as between the two years <Col N="1788" /> in any one country rather than for making structural comparisons as between countries.  In making comparisons as between countries the limitations to the comparability of the data which were outlined in the introduction have to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The International Labour Office publication &ldquo;The Cost of Social Security&rdquo; has similar warnings.  On page 2 it says:</P>
    <P>As the definitions of the terms and methods used as Social Security Statistics vary greatly from scheme to scheme and from country to country, and as there is generally a high degree of duplication (persons covered by or drawing benefit from two or more schemes) it is difficult to achieve a basis of international comparison in this field.</P>
    <P>Again on page 7 it warns in regard to the calculation of the gross national product, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it should be stressed that even if the figures in principle are calculated according to the United Nations' Systems of National Account there are great variations between the countries regarding the quality of the basic data, methods of estimating the various elements entering into the calculations, etc.</P>
    <P>Then, with particular reference to the figures in Table 3 of this publication, which were the figures Deputy Ryan used here before, it says that the figures in this table should therefore be interpreted with caution.  Caution is the one thing that has not been used in interpreting these figures here. Instead, we had the greatest enthusiasm in using them for a purpose for which the reader was specifically warned they were not suitable.</P>
    <P>To give one example, in a number of countries, compensation for war victims forms a considerable proportion of expenditure on social security. This item is not included in the figures supplied for Ireland.  If the percentage figures of the gross national product <Col N="1789" /> in the ILO publication &ldquo;The Cost of Security&rdquo; were adjusted to exclude compensation for war victims the figures for a number of countries would show a smaller disparity as compared with ours.  The figure of 9.4 per cent given for Ireland remains unchanged while Austria's 14 per cent becomes 13.2.  Belguim's 14.2 per cent is changed to 13.74; Denmark's 11.1 is only slightly reduced to 11.07; France's 13.9 becomes 12.85; and the Federal Republic of Germany's 16.1 becomes 14.77; Italy's 12.7 is changed to 11.65; Norway's 10.3 becomes 10.18; and the figure for the United Kingdom of 11 per cent becomes 10.32.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, many other items are included which are not normally classified as social security payments such as pensions for public employees. It is also known that some countries have included fringe benefits which are available to workers such as payments for periods of sickness by employers and private pension schemes administered by employers.  We know that some of these things exist to a certain extent here but no attempt has been made to evaluate them and include them in the expenditure on social security.</P>
    <P>Also, in a number of countries part of what is taken as expenditure on social security is by way of family allowances which are paid by employers as an integral part of the wage structure.</P>
    <P>Here instead of having, as these particular countries have, a basic wage plus family allowances paid by employers, the wage structure is a flat rate system irrespective of family commitments.  These family allowances, although they are part of the wage structure and not even administered by the State, are counted as social security expenditure.  Presumably, organised workers here, if they so desired, could move to change over to this system of payment whereby there would be a smaller basic wage with family allowances but they have not done so and I will certainly not suggest that they have been unwise in that.  Particularly when you have not full employment the other system contains an obvious <Col N="1790" /> incentive to employers to employ unmarried people in preference to married men.  If the flat wage system were altered here to a structure somewhat like they have in other countries these allowances would be counted as social security payments and this would change the comparative picture.</P>
    <P>It is fairly certain then that the percentage of the gross national product in Ireland which is devoted to social security is not as much out of line with other European countries as might appear at first glance from these figures.  Even if the figures which I have adjusted to exclude compensation for war victims represented the full picture&mdash;which they do not&mdash;the apparent deficiency between our percentage and that of other countries is not all attributable to the services administered by the Department of Social Welfare, as Deputies are inclined to make it appear.  The cost of the health services in these countries is also included in these figures and when the apparent disparity is distributed over these two fields of health and social welfare the actual disparity in either is less.  It does not mean that the Irish social assistance and social insurance schemes which come under my Department need to be increased by the difference in the percentages of the gross national product which appears in these tables in order to achieve parity.  In other words, it is not necessary to increase our expenditure on these services by .92 per cent of the gross national product in order to achieve parity with the United Kingdom but an increase of .92 per cent of the gross national product in expenditure on social welfare and health combined would bring us into line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 9.4 per cent, or at least it was, on the date to which the ILO figures refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, we have been improving since.  At the same time there is no point in ignoring&mdash;and I certainly do not ignore&mdash;that at our <Col N="1791" /> stage of development it is in the interests of everyone, and particularly those dependent on my Department, that as great a proportion as possible of our national income should be invested in increasing production.  I say that although at the same time it is our policy, and we have been implementing it, to devote an increasing proportion of our resources to social welfare.</P>
    <P>There are many other factors which should also be taken into account in making comparisons in the broadest sense.  For instance a relevant factor is the size of the State contribution to the social security scheme.  This is something we must bear in mind in making efforts to make progress towards adequate social security.  In Table 10 in the &ldquo;Cost of Social Security 1958-60&rdquo; published by the ILO, percentages are given for State participation in the distribution of receipts of social insurance and family allowances schemes according to sources.  The percentage figures in regard to the West European countries are: Ireland, 73; Austria, 13.2; Belgium, 26.2; Denmark, 52.5; France, 6.6; Federal Republic of Germany, 16.5; Italy, 17.3; Norway, 15.2 and the United Kingdom 27.7.</P>
    <P>When you take that table of the percentage contributions by the State to the cost of social insurance in conjunction with figures showing the percentages of workers' wages which are taken in contributions towards the cost of social security, it would seem to indicate that future improvements must involve relatively greater increases in contributions both by workers and employers.  The figures for the proportions of wages taken by way of workers' contributions were given in a document published by the Economic Research Institute, as being, in 1963, for Ireland, 2.3 per cent; Belgium 9; France 6.1; Germany 12.5; Italy 5.8; Netherlands 11.1; and the United Kingdom 5.3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are. They represent the percentage of the <Col N="1792" /> average worker's wages represented by his contribution to the social insurance scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If one takes the total percentage, the percentage represented by the total contributions of both employers and workers, Ireland's figure was 4.6 per cent; Belgium's 18 per cent; France's 21.6 per cent; Germany's 25 per cent; Italy's 29.8 per cent; the Netherlands' 17.6 per cent; and the UK's 9.9 per cent.  Therefore, it appears reasonable to suggest that in further improvements there should be a relatively greater increase in contributions particularly because the scope for increased taxation here is so limited.</P>
      <P>The fact that a greater percentage of workers' wages is left at their own disposal here undoubtedly means that some of those savings are used to provide extra security through private insurance and this is not included in our figure for social security.  Another factor affecting these figures is the percentage of the people of working age in the total population.  The figure for 1960, in respect of Ireland shows that 59 per cent were in the working age of between 15 and 64 years inclusive. In Austria, a country with which we have been compared here, the percentage was 66.  I know many people have continued to work after the age of 65 but I do not think there is much doubt that the majority retire on pension or disability benefit between the age of 65 and 70.  The figures show that we have about 40 per cent depending on the earnings of the workers. The figure for workers in Austria is 66 per cent, leaving only 34 per cent in the dependent age group.  In other words, each group of three people here in the working age group have to support two in the dependent group, while in Austria the comparable figure is two for every one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that the burden to be carried by those of working age here to give the same degree of support to those dependent because of age is greater and this makes the task of <Col N="1793" /> providing adequate benefits more difficult. In view of our circumstances, the provision we make for social security, though I fully admit it requires to be improved and it is one of our fundamental tasks to do so, is not nearly as bad as Opposition speakers would like us to believe.  The important thing is that we are increasing the proportion of the gross national product spent on social security as the economy improves and we intend to continue that policy.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the primary essential thing to do in everybody's interest is to ensure a continuous increase in production. This, in turn, requires investment and, therefore, limits the amount which can safely be taken for social purposes. I fully agree that as the national income increases it is necessary that the Government should keep a close watch to ensure that an increasing proportion of the rising resources of the community is appropriated by the State to raise the standard of social welfare benefits.  In other words, I accept it is the Government's job to ensure that there is a relatively greater improvement in the standard of living of those who must depend on social welfare than in other sections of the community because there is a considerable leeway to be made up.  It is, in my opinion, quite justifiable to expect a government to show that they have done this.  We have always been able to show that we have done this in the past and I have no doubt we shall be able to show the same thing in the future.</P>

    <P>The Department of Labour was established on the 13th July, 1966, and certain sections of the Department of Industry and Commerce were transferred to the new Department as from that date.  The Employment Service and a number of headquarters staff of the Department of Social Welfare were transferred to the Department as from 3rd October, 1966.  It is not necessary to make any changes in the existing financial arrangements in the current year in respect of the transferred services for which provision is made in the Votes for Industry and Commerce (Vote 40) and Social Welfare (Vote 47).  Accordingly, expenditure on those services to the end of 1966-67 will, as indicated in the note to the Estimate, continue to be borne on Votes 40 and 47 and accounted for by the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare respectively.</P>
    <P>The expenditure for which the authority of the Dáil is now being sought relates, therefore, only to certain services not provided for in the other two Votes.  This expenditure is necessary so that the Department can get going.  The new posts covered by the Estimate are the minimum immediately required.  A good deal of work, including the promotion of some important legislation, requires to be done before firm decisions can be <Col N="1795" /> taken on the structure of the Department. The funds now sought from the Dáil will, I hope, enable the bulk of that work to be completed in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>When he was speaking in this House last June on the Bill providing for the establishment of the Department, the Taoiseach explained fully why the Government considered it necessary to set up a seperate Department of Labour at that time.  He also outlined in general terms the functions which the Department would discharge. There was general agreement about the need for a special Department to do the work outlined by the Taoiseach.  I propose now to refer to progress made since the Department began to function, to set out the main tasks which lie before us, and to give an indication of the way in which I propose that these tasks should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Before I do this I should like to sketch briefly the historical background against which we are operating. Some of the legislation which the Minister for Labour has inherited was enacted by the British Parliament as far back as the middle of the last century.  This fact alone suggests the desirability of a wide ranging review of the various Acts, which Deputies will find listed in the relevant Transfer of Functions Order presented to the Dáil in July last.</P>
    <P>A Ministry of Labour operated under the first Dáil Éireann and the second Dáil Éireann, and did a good deal particularly in the field of conciliation and mediation in industrial disputes.  For the record, I should say that there were only two holders of the office of Minister of Labour, namely, Madame Markievicz and Joseph McGrath.</P>
    <P>On the establishment of the separate Irish State, the functions of the Dáil Ministry of Labour, together with various services, including the Employment Service, operated by the British Government Departments, were allocated to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In 1947 the Employment Service became the responsibility <Col N="1796" /> of the newly-formed Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate here to refer to the impressive volume of work done in this field by the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare.  This work is reflected in legislation on conditions of employment, industrial relations, holidays, apprenticeships, and on conditions in factories, shops, offices and mines and quarries.  There are also the progressive improvements in the social welfare code.  In addition, one must acknowledge the many changes for the better which have been induced and facilitated by the influence and activities of those Departments down through the years.</P>
    <P>As the Government see it, the primary duty of the Department of Labour is to protect and foster the interests of workers in matters which are properly the concern of the Government.  The aim will be to bring about conditions in which workers, through wage increases, improvements in working conditions and other benefits, are rewarded fairly for their labours.  It will be my concern to see that, as far as can be achieved by legislation, official action or guidance, the worker is safeguarded in his workplace and that he is sheltered so far as possible, against the adverse effects of economic and technical change.  However, real improvements in the lot of workers, as of any other category of persons, can only be achieved if national production is expanded. It is very clear by now that monetary increases which are not supported by an expansion of production or improvements in productivity are quickly overtaken by rises in prices and other developments which nullify the increases in pay.</P>
    <P>In pointing out the limitation imposed by economic laws on those seeking improvements in pay and conditions, I do not suggest that workers and others should suspend efforts to secure improvements to which they consider themselves entitled and which they believe can be attained.  It is desirable, however, that negotiations and other processes involved should be <Col N="1797" /> conducted with the minimum degree of dislocation and discord.  This requires an element of restraint, of willingness by parties concerned to use the procedures available and of readiness to make concessions when the need to make them is established.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the work of a Department of Labour is that emotion, tradition and subjective elements play a big part.  It is necessary, therefore, for the Minister and his officials to understand the motivation for actions and behaviour which to other people may sometimes appear irrational.  I would hope, too, that the members of the Dáil would have regard to these considerations, so that feelings which sometimes arise in this area will not be excessively inflamed.</P>
    <P>This is not to discourage comment or criticism of my handling of the Department.  I shall indeed welcome helpful suggestions and constructive criticism from members of the Dáil and from any other source.  But we in this House must also show restraint and avoid statements and postures which could be damaging to the success of what must be our common effort in this field.  It would be little short of calamitous if these matters were to be befogged by and, perhaps buried, under the dust of acrimonious political bickering.  I shall, of course, be answerable to the Dáil for the administration of the Department and, of course, the Government's record will be submitted to the people in due course.</P>
    <P>There is in existence a body of law relating to the protection of workers at their places of work and I have at my disposal a team of inspectors who visit factories and other work-places to see that the statutory requirements are carried out.  The inspectors are also available to give advice when required. Economic harm can be done as a result of losses of production arising out of industrial accidents and industrial illnesses.  But this is an area in which human considerations completely outweigh economic factors.  I need not dwell on the consequences which may ensue for a worker and his dependants as a result of a serious accident or illness&mdash;and it is disturbing to contemplate <Col N="1798" /> that many accidents which have occurred need never have happened.</P>
    <P>I propose to do all in my power to secure whatever reduction is attainable in the number of such accidents and illnesses.  To this end I have directed that the adequacy of the staffing of the factory inspectorate should be reviewed to see whether some addition to the strength would help.  But a strengthening of the inspectorate, if effected, will not, in itself, be enough. We need to get more co-operation from both managements and workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more managements seeking the advice of the factory inspectors on measures to improve safety and health-protection measures. There should be a safety committee, established by workers under the Factories Act, in every plant in the country. The number of such committees is, so far, pitifully small and I am considering whether any special measures can be taken to promote the formation of more of them.  I am considering also how I can assist more effectively the excellent work being done by the National Industrial Safety Organisation, which is representative of management, trade unions, and the factory inspectorate, and the main function of which is to stimulate a greater awareness of the pressing need for improved safety measures.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other Acts relating to the welfare of workers which have now been on the statute book for a considerable number of years.  I am drawing up a programme for a systematic review of all these measures, in consultation with those affected by them, with a view to determining their relevance to present circumstances and to the conditions which we are likely to meet in the future.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations have possibly been the most publicised area of my responsibility.  As Deputies know, wages and salaries are ordinarily settled and adjusted through a system of free collective bargaining.  This process is enshrined in a number of international conventions and it has been accepted, in principle at least, by <Col N="1799" /> organised labour, by employer organisations and by the public generally in this country.  The process may be generally described as negotiations about pay, conditions or terms of employment between, on the one hand, an employer, a group of employers or one or more employer organisations and, on the other hand, one or more representative workers' organisations, with a view to reaching agreement.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, negotiators are concerned to make the best bargain they can.  However, the interplay of various economic forces was supposed to operate to keep agreements from getting too much out of line and to keep the totality of wage or salary increases from outrunning the growth in national production, which, of course, was what supported all incomes.</P>
    <P>Experience over recent years, here and in other countries has however, compelled people to take a hard look at the system.  The fact is that increases in certain incomes and in wages and salaries as a whole, even when improvements in productivity are taken into account, have been greater than the growth in national production would justify, thus forcing up costs and prices, and making it difficult for us to sell our goods abroad.</P>
    <P>If collective bargaining continues to produce this trend, then it is clear that it is a national necessity to examine the system.  Some people allege that the system itself is defective, that it is unsuited to contemporary needs and that it should be replaced.  Before contemplating that possibility, however, I propose to explore an alternative explanation, which is that the system, as it has been operated here, has been working imperfectly, or possibly that it has, on occasion, been abused.</P>
    <P>Whatever the requirements may be for the satisfactory working of free collective bargaining in our circumstances, one requirement certainly is that the parties to negotiations should be alive to the consequences of their actions for others and indeed, for the community as a whole.  Negotiators are now in a position to obtain, from official sources and otherwise, all the <Col N="1800" /> information they reasonably require to enable them to form a judgment on the effect of possible types of settlements that may emerge; this is particularly important where &ldquo;key&rdquo; agreements, which may influence the pattern in other industries or occupations, are under negotiation.  If the implications are ignored, then industrial peace in a particular occupations or industry may be purchased at too high a price to the community, not excluding those who may have gained an initial and short-term advantage.</P>
    <P>I shall regard it as my duty to see that negotiators have access to the most up-to-date information on national economic affairs.  I shall continue to exhort them to have proper regard to that information when making settlements, in the hope that adjustments in wages, salaries and conditions will be kept within the bounds set by increases in national production. If, having done all that, I find that settlements in excess of the growth in national production are being negotiated, then some fundamental policy changes in regard to our procedures must be considered.  For the moment, however, I am concentrating on the promotion of amending legislation on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation will be to try to remedy the imperfections, and to lessen or eliminate the obstacles to the proper working of negotiation and free collective bargaining.  The comments and suggestions of interested parties on my proposals have been received and considered.  I have now set up two working parties, one with the trade unions and the other with the employers, to see if acceptable proposals can be worked out which will take account of the public interest. In this operation I expect both sides in industry to keep the welfare of the community as a whole in the forefront of their minds.  If they do, it will make the promotion of the necessary legislation easier in due course.</P>
    <P>The law governing the affairs of trade unions is still largely based on statutes taken over from the British administration.  It dates back as far as 1871.  Much of it was framed when <Col N="1801" /> trade unions were weak, harried and in need of protection.  I have already said publicly that I am certain that we must soon, in consultation with those intimately concerned, undertake a comprehensive review of trade union law, with a view to reshaping it to the needs and circumstances of our times. I regard this as a long-term operation, but I believe that there are some improvements which are urgently needed and which should not be delayed until a full review of the law is completed.</P>
    <P>I propose that these should be effected by means of amending legislation which will be put before the Dáil at the same time as the Industrial Relations Bill.  Lest there be any misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the purpose of the Government's immediate proposals, which have also been in the hands of workers' and employers'representatives for some time, I want to stress that their purpose is not to weaken the trade unions but to assist them in buttressing up the democratic foundations on which they are based.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement itself has been having a look at the need to reshape and reconstruct the trade unions so that they may be better placed to serve the interests of their members and to take a more effective part in the development of the nation. The legislation which I have mentioned may provide the framework for rationalisation and reorganisation, but the Government believe that the task is essentially one for the movement itself.  I welcome the progress already achieved in this direction and I hope that it will be accelerated.  There may be limits to the extent to which the Government can effectively help the trade unions in this work at this time but I am certainly willing to sit down with the responsible representatives of the movement to work out how the Government could provide useful assistance to trade unions in overcoming the formidable problems, financial and otherwise, standing in the way of rationalisation and reorganisation.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that there is <Col N="1802" /> no disposition on the part of the Government to interfere in the internal affairs of the trade union movement. The fact is that certain features of trade union organisation tend to be a cause of damage to the community&mdash;and the community is in large part composed of trade union members.  For that reason, the Government, in safeguarding the public interest, have an obligation to concern themselves in the matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is only proper for me to record here my view that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, within its powers and resources, has been guiding the movement as a whole in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>While I have been speaking of trade unions of workers, I am not overlooking the fact that trade unions of employers and employers' organisations must also be responsive to the requirements of the national interest.</P>
    <P>The subject of manpower policy has been debated fairly fully in the Oireachtas during the past year and I think it would be sufficient for me to summarise the progress which has been made and the developments in prospect. I aim to push ahead with a number of measures designed to make it easier for the worker to change jobs and to help him financially in the process of making a change from one job to another.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Training Bill which provides for the establishment of an authority with wide powers to deal with industrial training and retraining, was given a Second Reading in Dáil Éireann before the Summer Recess. The views of the main interested organisations have now been received and a Committee has been set up to examine the Bill in detail before the Committee Stage is taken.  This Committee, representing employers' and workers' organisations, will have as chairman an officer of my Department and will complete its work as quickly as possible.  I hope that it may be possible to take the Committee Stage in the present session.</P>
    <P>Consultations with the interested parties about the schemes for redundancy payments and resettlement allowances have been completed and <Col N="1803" /> the necessary legislation is being drafted at present.  The Bill will be a formidable one but, unless some unforeseen complications arise, it should be ready for introduction and circulation in time to enable the Dáil to debate the principles involved before the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>The Employment Service was transferred to my Department early this month.  I propose to approach the development of the placement and guidance facilities of the service in two stages.  A number of short-term measures to secure improvement in certain selected centres are already in train and I hope to have them in operation early next year.  At the same time I am undertaking a review of the organisation and structure of the service with a view to planning and implementing measures for its long-term development.</P>
    <P>Up to recently little progress had been made in regard to the establishment of a manpower forecasting service. The difficulty here lies in the recruitment of suitable experts; these are not available here and are in very scarce supply in other countries.  A solution of this difficulty is now in sight and I am hopeful that it may be possible to initiate this service early next year.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of information on labour and manpower matters available at home and from other countries and from international organisations. It is clear to me, however, that it is not being sufficiently processed and disseminated.  It is also apparent that our labour statistics, though adequate for most purposes, are not as comprehensive as those available in other countries.  I am about to set up an Information and Research Section which will process available information from all sources and which will, in consultation with the Central Statistics Office, see whether the range of our labour statistics ought to be extended. It is my intention that this section will also undertake fundamental studies on problems in the labour and manpower fields.  In addition, I shall consider whether it would be profitable of commission the undertaking of research work by outside agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> It is my intention that our relations with the International Labour Organisation, the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development and the Council of Europe should be developed and strengthened.  I am arranging that a study should be undertaken of the extent to which these bodies might be able to advise and assist the Department in its work.  It is also necessary for us to develop close links with the European Economic Community on questions of social policy so that we may begin to adjust our policies in a way which will facilitate our eventual entry into the Community.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's plan to keep in contact with the EEC I propose to visit Brussels early next year for discussions with representatives of the Community in regard to certain aspects of social policy, with which the Department of Labour is concerned.  Continuing contacts will be maintained by officers of the Department with officials of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for the appointment of an Information Officer in the Department.  The dissemination of information, the promotion of an understanding and an awareness of an economic trends, as well as the publication of material regarding the services administered by the Department and explanations of reasons for policy decisions, make it essential to have arrangements for the issue of information on matters concerning the Department.  The operating details will be worked out in agreement with the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    <P>In the field of industrial relations, and particularly when strikes are threatened or are in progress, the accuracy and reliability of press and other coverage is a matter of great importance, not only to the parties involved, but also the public generally. I have had indications that the appointment of an Information Officer &mdash;who is being recruited through the Civil Service Commission &mdash; will be welcomed by trade unions and employers and by the press and radio and television who have apparently been experiencing difficulty in getting <Col N="1805" /> reliable information&mdash;judging from the tenor and timing of some reports that have been published.</P>
    <P>I do not propose that the Department of Labour should merely continue to administer the services which were taken over from the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare.  Nor do I propose that it should pursue these policies I have outlined here and then rest on its oars.  All institutions, to remain useful, must be dynamic.  They must be sensitive to changes in the sphere in which they are operating and they must respond to such changes.  I see the Department of Labour in the role of a development corporation in the fields with which it is concerned.  I want it to be constantly seeking and developing new ideas, new approaches and new initiatives.  I visualise the Department to be imbued with all the best traditions of our public service, but at the same time always ready to discard procedures and outlooks which impede initiative and stultify progress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reciprocate the sentiments expressed by the Minister in his opening remarks, in which he speaks of the heavy responsibilities resting on him and his Department to work with Deputies and everybody outside in achieving the result which it is hoped will flow from the establishment of this Ministry.  At present the Minister is not in a position to give a progress report on what his new Ministry has been able to do in the meantime.  That is entirely understandable. <Col N="1806" /> This new Ministry is in the process of taking over portion of the responsibilities of other Departments. Because of that, and the shortness of the time available, the Minister could not come before this House with an account of his stewardship in these matters.</P>
    <P>We hope the new Department will achieve something of the purpose of its establishment in securing the smoother working of industrial relations and harmonious peace among the various elements of the community. It is apparent the Minister expects that a lot of personnel will come from other Departments to take over the administration of functions which up to now have been in the hands of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to inform us whether the staff he has scheduled in this Estimate is in keeping with what he expects it will be for what I might call the basic services of his Department, outside the administration of services being taken over?  When a new Department is established, you get this escalation of personnel and I presume that will happen in regard to this Estimate also.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Minister and I am taking into account the limitations on him at the moment, but I would have liked if he could have told us what technical advice he has available to him in the field of labour relations.  I notice that he has a chief adviser.  I presume he has other skilled personnel.  It would be useful for the information of the House and for the public generally if the Minister at an early stage would elaborate on the type of specialist services and advisers available to him.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister and his Department set out with the hope&mdash;a hope which everybody wishes to see realised &mdash; that we are going to have better industrial relations from the operations the Minister may set in train.  One of the things that strikes me, as one who knows nothing about this matter except what he learned from the grass roots up, is that better <Col N="1807" /> industrial relations will not come by way of legislation.  We cannot legislate for better industrial relations.  If there is not goodwill and an effort on both sides to see each other's point of view, and see it in time, and a readiness to discuss, no amount of legislation the Minister may bring in will improve industrial relations and bring about the harmony everybody is anxious to see.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the proposed new draft Bill.  Tentative proposals in this regard have been in the hands of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.</P>

I feel, from my personal contacts with the Minister, that he appreciates the invitation by me to discuss this matter. I have heard him to say on many occasions in this House that he would not tolerate any bad handling of claims for insurance benefit by any of the officers of his Department.  In tabling this questions, I am not suggesting that the way it has been handled is typical of the way the Department handles all claims but I am saying that it typifies in many ways the manner in which numerous claims for social welfare benefit are handled by his Department. I am not criticising the Minister.  I am simply looking for his co-operation which I am quite sure will readily be available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting down this question, I am sure the callous and unchristian manner in which the officers of his <Col N="1808" /> Department dealt with an unfortunate insured person&mdash;that is, a person who paid insurance to cover herself against the hazards of sickness or unemployment&mdash;will not be condoned by the Minister.  I hope he will accept my criticism of his Department in the spirit in which it is given.  This is an unfortunate case and it is not the only one.  Many of us have been generalising over a long period of time and, knowing that we did generalise, the Minister asked us to come along with specific cases.  I feel that this is one which typifies the manner in which very many cases are, I am sorry to say, handled by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The lady in question&mdash;her insurance number is 542096&mdash;is an insured person in full benefit and entitled to disability benefit from the Department of Social Welfare in the event of illness. She fell ill on 1st June of this year and made her claim in the ordinary way.  In reply to my question today, the Minister told me that, arising out of that claim, she had been paid the appropriate benefit on 4th June, that is, three days after falling ill, to 12th July.  She then received notice that she was to attend before the medical referee of the Department.  According to the reply I received today, she was examined by the medical referee on 12th July.  Again in accordance with the information I received from the Minister, it took the medical referee ten days to report to the Department on his medical examination.  His report was received in the Department on 22nd July.  This woman fell ill on 1st June.  We are now up to 22nd July.</P>
    <P>The lady duly received notification that, arising out of the medical adjudication, her claim was disallowed as from 13th July, that is, the day after she was examined by the medical referee.  Then, according to practice, she was also notified on that day, in the same communication from the Department, that if she wished to express any dissatisfaction she should notify the Department when they would send out to her the official appeals form which she should fill up and which would enable her to have an <Col N="1809" /> oral examination as to the basis for her claim.  I want to convey particularly to the Minister that that lady expressed her dissatisfaction.  She wrote to the Department on 15th July and sought a form whereby she could make an appeal in accordance with the code of social welfare legislation.  That form did not issue from the Department until 17th August.</P>
    <P>In other words, having done what she was invited to do&mdash;to express her dissatisfaction&mdash;it took a month and two days for the Minister's Department to carry out the very ordinary and easy exercise of putting the stereotyped form into an envelope and addressing it to this lady.  Of course, in the meantime, she was receiving no benefit whatsoever. Her appeal was hanging fire. Apparently, at that stage, there was no question of the dispute regarding the medical evidence: it was purely an administrative job.  Any junior clerk in the Department of Social Welfare, any office boy in the Department of Social Welfare, on receipt of the notice of dissatisfaction from the lady in question, could get this printed form&mdash; there must be millions of them&mdash;put it into an envelope and send it off to her.  It took them a month and two days to do it.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the regulation form, the lady made her appeal.  She filled up the form with all the relevant details and sent it back to this Department on the same day&mdash;a month and two days after she had made her original request.  When she got it, she filled it up and sent it back: that was on 18th August.  Let us not forget, now, that the original date of her illness was 1st June.  She sent back the form on 18th August and all was silence after 18th August.  Not a word was said, not a communication did she receive.  No social welfare officer called on her but, lo and behold, a month and a day after that&mdash;after a month and two days, first of all&mdash;she received a document.  I have here the original document dated 19th September:</P>
    <P>Ábhar Disability Benefit Appeal.</P>
    <P>Fuarthas do litir dar dáta 16/9/66...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> That was fine, was it not?  The original illness was on 1st day of June and, at long last, on 19th September this is received from</P>
    <P>Mise, le meas,</P>
    <P>L. Ó h-Uanacháin,</P>
    <P>Rúnaí.</P>
    <P>And he tells her:</P>
    <P>táthar ag féachaint chuici.</P>
    <P>She hears no more from that day, 19th September, until 27th September when, lo and behold, what does she get but another note&mdash;a printed stereotyped note&mdash;exactly similar to the one she got before, addressed to her from Áras Mhic Dhiarmada and dated 27th September.  What do they say to the lady at that stage?  Again:</P>
    <P>Fuarthas do litir dar dáta 16/9/66 agus táthar ag féachaint chuici.</P>
    <P>The same gentleman's name is appended to this.  He is again &ldquo;Mise, le meas, L. Ó h-Uanacháin, Rúnaí&rdquo;. She has, of course, been getting no money.  Nobody has adjudicated on her claim.  She is told in another document&mdash;I am sure the Minister took a note of this today when I raised it by way of supplementary question&mdash; that</P>
    <P>your case has been submitted to an appeals officer who will have an oral hearing of the matter at an early date before determining the question in dispute.</P>
    <P>That issued from the Minister's Department on 14th September.  It is now 20th October and this unfortunate insured person has received no indication as to when the oral hearing will be held.  The Minister in his reply to me today on clause (k) of my question in regard to the date on which it is anticipated the oral hearing will be held, said it would be held in the week commencing 7th November next.</P>
    <P>This matter has been going on now since 1st June and, remembering the Minister had notice of my question, I would have expected him to get on his high horse and unearth the officer in his Department who made such a bungle of the whole thing; but the Minister comes along and brazenly says that the hearing of the oral <Col N="1811" /> evidence, which was promised on 14th September, will now be heard in the week commencing 7th November.  In reply to the last part of my question in which I asked him if he would mind indicating the date on which it is anticipated the final determination of the appeal will be issued, he said in the week following the oral hearing unless further investigation or medical examination is required.  I ask you.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset&mdash;I hope the Minister will accept this in view of his previous statements with regard to delay in payments&mdash;that I think this is a scandalous example of civil servants choking themselves with red tape and choking the unfortunate people who should be in receipt of social welfare. I do not know what the Minister will tell me, but he certainly will not convince me, and I am certain he will not convince the House, that there is any justification at all, no matter what the ramifications of the administrative machine in his Department are, for leaving this unfortunate woman without benefit.  Today, she is told, through me, her parliamentary representative, that they may hear the oral evidence on 7th November and the case may be finally determined a week after that, unless further investigations are necessary.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  It is a disgrace to the Minister's Department. It is callous, uncharitable and unChristian. Where in hell does the Minister think this woman is getting money in the meantime to keep body and soul together?  Surely he does not think that, while his higher minions in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada are pontificating on this, throwing it from one basket to another, that she is receiving manna from Heaven.  It is not as if she is looking for charity.  She is an injured person entitled to payment but, because of the inefficiency and stupid bungling of the Minister's Department, that benefit has been denied her.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, if there are delays in matters of this kind, I usually write to the Minister himself and ask for his assistance in investigating the matter.  I must say that assistance is invariably forthcoming. <Col N="1812" /> But these would be minor cases.  On many occasions the Minister has expressed the view that he will not tolerate such conduct as that outlined by me and, because of that, I took this opportunity of putting down a question to pinpoint this case; it typifies the manner in which the officers of his Department handle the claims of these unfortunate people, people who are not able to fight for themselves.  But I will fight for them.  I am not criticising the Minister.  I am simply making him a present of this and I hope that he will investigate the matter fully and, as a result, overhaul his Department to ensure that nothing like this will ever happen again.</P>

      <P>I should, I think, go through this matter fully to show that Deputy Casey's interpretation presents an exaggerated picture of the delay that has occurred in this case.  Before I do so, however, I should admit that this case should have been disposed of long before now.  It is not correct for the Deputy, though, to say that it has taken over a month to send an appeal form to this lady.  The first notification of dissatisfaction with the decision of the deciding officer was received in my Department on 22nd July and the appeal form was issued on 15th August.  There was unnecessary delay there, but that delay did not in any way impede the process of dealing with the appeal because, as Deputy Casey knows, the second medical examination took place on 16th August.  In a case such as this, a second medical examination was obviously necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case&mdash;not, as Deputy Casey has said, of an insured person entitled to benefit because that has not been established at all&mdash;in which the deciding officer has decided on the basis of the medical referee's report that the insured person is not entitled to benefit. Now, when, in those circumstances, an insured person appeals, it is obviously desirable that there should be a second medical opinion available as soon as possible.  In other words, it would not be helpful to the person concerned to have the appeal decided without first of all arranging for a second medical <Col N="1813" /> examination.  Because of the fact that it is not administratively possible to have medical referees immediately available, this second examination can, in the normal course, take up to five or six weeks to arrange.  In this case it did not take this long; it was carried out on the 16th August, so that the delay in issuing the appeals form did not hold up this essential part of dealing with the appeal.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other misinterpretations of dates and so on but it is a fact, at any rate, that the case was sent to the Appeals Branch of my Department early in September and that was not an excessively long time. The delay we have to deal with is the delay from early in September to early in November, when it has been arranged to hear the appeal.  Again, in the case of oral hearings of appeals it is administratively necessary to arrange itineraries for appeals officers.  While it is desirable that they should be held as soon as possible, obviously it would not be physically possible to have an appeals officer ready to go to any part of the country to hear an appeal immediately the case was referred to the Appeals Branch.  However, I do agree that two months is too long a period to take to arrange for the hearing of such oral appeals and I do not see fully why it should have taken that long.</P>
    <P>I keep a continuous eye on whether or not we have sufficient appeals officers available for this work and to <Col N="1814" /> the best of my knowledge there is not a shortage of appeals officers at present, but it would normally take some little time to arrange for an oral appeal to be heard.  As I say, I do not think there is a shortage of appeals officers. Obviously, it would not be desirable to put on such pressure that it might result in more of these cases being dealt with without oral appeals.  Where it appears possible that a decision favourable to the appellant might be arrived at at an oral hearing, whereas if it were to be decided on the basis of the documentary evidence before the officer it would be against the appellant, it is desirable that an oral appeal should be heard in all cases where there is any such possibility. Therefore, it would not be a good thing to bring too much pressure to bear to have these things dealt with immediately.  It is reasonable that there should be some delay in arranging for oral appeals but I fully agree that two months delay, as occurred in this case, is more than could be acceptable.  Considering the number of these cases which are dealt with there are very few indeed in which anything approaching this length of time is taken up in having them decided.  I am always ready to investigate any particular case in which excessive delay occurred and as I said, I think two months was more than should have elapsed.</P>
