      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the invitation of the Government of Canada, the Government decided, on 19th January, 1965, to participate in the Canadian Universal and International Exhibition to be held in Montreal from April to October, 1967.  On the basis of estimates then submitted, the Government <Col N="1006" /> decided to limit expenditure on the participation to £175,000.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1965, it became clear that costs in Montreal were rising rapidly and that the original budget would have to be revised upwards to £200,000.  At the same time, the Government were compelled to take action to reduce the deficit in our balance of payments, and they decided they must withdraw from participation in the Exhibition.  A press announcement to that effect was issued on 4th January this year and our sincere regret was conveyed to the Government of Canada.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Montreal Exhibition is not a trade fair.  It is being promoted in 1967 to celebrate the centenary of Canadian Confederation.  The Canadian Government has been informed that a special effort will be made to mark the centenary in an appropriate manner in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have approved the following generating plant programme of the ESB for commissioning in the years indicated: additional 60 megawatt oil-fired set at Ringsend, Dublin, 1966-67; additional 40 megawatt milled peat set at Lanesboro, County Longford, 1966-67; new station (two 60 megawatt oil-fired sets) at Great Island, County Wexford, 1967-68 and 1968-69; new station (two 60 megawatt oil-fired sets) at Tarbert, County Kerry, 1969-70; and new station (two 120 megawatt oil-fired sets) at Pigeon House, Dublin, 1970-71.</P>
      <P>The estimated erection costs of these projects is: Lanesboro, £2.7m.; Great Island, £7m.; Tarbert, £7.5m.; Pigeon House, £16m.</P>
      <P>The additional set being provided at Ringsend forms part of a project for three 60 megawatt sets, two of which are already commissioned.  The total cost of this project is £9.3m.  Separate costs are not available in respect of any one individual set.</P>
      <P>This programme may be subject to some adjustment if required by changes in the demand for electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibilities of nuclear power for electricity generation are under review by the Electricity Supply Board. The Board advise me that the cost of nuclear energy generating plants, depending on their size and type, can be two or three times greater than that of conventional plants using coal or oil. Because of the high capital cost, a nuclear generating plant requires to be run at full load for the major part of the year, day and night, in order to produce electricity economically.  In <Col N="1008" /> this country there is relatively little three-shift industry giving rise to a continuous 24 hour demand for electricity. Furthermore, in accordance with Government policy the Board's hydro and native fuel stations are given priority.  The balance of the base load to be supplied otherwise is not expected to be large enough to support a nuclear powered station for several years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy.  The difficulties in financing public capital requirements in 1965, which involved heavy demands by the Exchequer on the banking system during the year, were outlined in the paper &ldquo;Capital Budget, 1966&rdquo; published last week.  As indicated in that paper the Government recognise the importance of ensuring that public sector requirements should not absorb an undue proportion of available banking resources in 1966.  It is intended that recourse by the Exchequer to the banking system for this year will be significantly less than last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that the recent increases in social welfare contributions have resulted in workers being liable to higher income tax payments <Col N="1009" /> on the part of the contribution which is liable to income tax, and that the increase in contribution is thereby made greater for these workers, he will take steps either to increase the fraction of the contribution which is tax-free or to eliminate the payment of income tax on these contributions altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement on which the first part of the Deputy's question is based, namely, that the recent increases in social welfare contributions have resulted in workers being liable to higher income tax payments on the part of the contribution which is liable to income tax, is not correct. Accordingly the second part of the question does not arise.  Social insurance contributions are taken into account in computing income tax liability in so far as they are related to widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance and old age (contributory) pension.  Under section 10 of the Finance Act, 1961, so much of an employee's contribution as is referable to these benefits is allowable as a deduction in computing income for income tax purposes.  As a consequence of the recent increase in social insurance contributions, enhanced deductions have been allowed for income tax purposes with effect from 3rd January, 1966.  For example, in the case of an ordinary male employee, the annual amount of the contribution deductible has been increased from £8 to £10 and, in the case of an ordinary female employee, from £7 to £8.  Corresponding increases have been allowed to other categories of contributors.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Section 115 of the Housing Bill does not correspond to any provision of the Labourers Acts but section 92 and the First Schedule of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and section 23 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, in effect, made county councils the local authorities for the purposes of Parts II and I, respectively, of the Act of 1890, to which section 88 of that Act relates.  Section 115 of the Bill is based on section 88 which prohibits members from voting on any resolution or question arising under Parts I or II of the 1890 Act if it relates to a house or land in which they are beneficially interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The property qualifications for membership of local authorities existing when the 1890 Act was passed made superfluous the application of section <Col N="1017" /> 88 to Part III of the Act, dealing with the provision and management of working class dwellings.  These qualifications no longer exist, and section 115 of the Housing Bill, 1965, accordingly applies to any resolution or question arising in pursuance of the Bill, including matters corresponding to Parts I, II and III of the 1890 Act.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) of section 106 of the Housing Bill, 1965, prescribes the matters to which a housing authority shall have regard in determining whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition. Within these limits, I am prepared to advise housing authorities that they may also have regard to the items in the Second Schedule to the Bill which relate to structural condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate the fact that by doing this he is visiting the sins of the <Col N="1018" /> local authorities on the tenants of those houses?  Even at this stage will he not reconsider the position, in view of the fact that it will create serious hardship for local authority tenants who would not be in a position to carry out repairs on their own?  Does he not appreciate that structural repairs would simply mean that the walls and roof would be in good condition and that all the rest of the house might be in very poor condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The general idea is that small repairs that could be regarded as within the competence of the tenants themselves to do need not necessarily call for the attention of the local authority and a works gang going out at probably ten times the cost in getting there and back related to the actual cost of doing the job.  The real point about these houses is that their structural condition should be sound and this is what we intend to ensure, together with the suggestion I have made that I would refer them to the contents of the Schedule as well as the statutory obligation in the particular section of the Act and to have regard to the contents of the Schedule as well as to the statutory provision.</P>

      <Col N="1020" /> Ex-gratia payments have been made to tenants by Dublin Corporation in certain cases where portion of the cottage plot, held from the corporation, was repossessed by the authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is presumed that the Deputy has in mind disability pensions payable <Col N="1030" /> to ex-soldiers under the Army Pensions Acts.  These consist of a basic pension in respect of the man himself and, if he is married, further sums in respect of his wife and each son and unmarried daughter under the age of 18 years.  At one time, there was, in addition to the basic pension, a flat rate of married pension rather than separate sums for the wife and each eligible child, but the separate elements were introduced as being generally more beneficial.  Under this system, the greater the number of children, the higher the total pension becomes.  As the earning capacity of the pensioner has been reduced by his disability, the payment in respect of the children represents a contribution towards their maintenance until such time as they could, in the ordinary course of events, be expected to earn their own livelihood.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any similar types of pension payable to former members of other State services, that is, pensions containing separate additional elements in respect of wives and children. But where, for instance, children's allowances continue to be paid to former State servants because the children are still under a prescribed age, the allowances cases when they reach that age, and I presume that the Deputy would agree that there must be some age limit for payments in respect of children.</P>
    <P>The numbers of ex-soldiers whose disability pensions were reduced during the last five calendar years because of the death of the wife or eligible children or because of eligible children attaining the prescribed age are 1961&mdash;14; 1962&mdash;16; 1963&mdash;18; 1964&mdash;17 and 1965&mdash;8.</P>
    <P>As on 1st March, 1966, the annual cost of the children's element of the disability pensions being paid to ex-soldiers was £600.</P>

The position has been discussed with the President of the Circuit Court: in addition to a third judge temporarily assigned on a whole-time basis to the Dublin Circuit, the President of the Circuit Court has arranged that judges assigned to other circuits would render as much assistance as possible in the Dublin Circuit when not engaged in their own circuits.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have brought about a certain improvement, but the position is still not satisfactory.  I intend to keep the matter under active review with a view to taking such further steps as are open to me to bring the service to an acceptable level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a question on 1st December last, delays in the Land Registry are mainly due to the inability to recruit and retain the necessary technical and clerical staff.</P>
      <P>The over-all position continues to be difficult.  A recent competition for posts as legal assistant failed to attract a sufficient number of qualified candidates, and I am at present considering what can be done to secure adequate legal staff.</P>
      <P>I expect that a sufficient number of clerical officers will be assigned to the Land Registry within the next month or so.  Because of complications arising from a review of salary scales, it is unlikely that vacancies for draughtsmen will be filled for some months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> All possible steps, including the working of overtime by legal clerical and technical staffs, are being taken to reduce delays to a minimum.</P>
    <P>While the existing accommodation is not regarded as ideal for present requirements, it does not contribute in any significant degree to delays in the discharge of current business of the Land Registry.  Arrangements to erect a two-storey extension over the Public Record Office building to provide additional accommodation for the Land Registry have been brought to an advanced stage and I am informed that the Office of Public Works hope to place the contract within the next month or two.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the extremely bad condition of the school building of Carrickbyrne national school, County Wexford; if he will detail the repairs which would be necessary to bring this school building into a satisfactory condition; whether his Department have at present under consideration plans for the building of an new school for the Carrickbyrne and Newbawn area; if so, if the parents in the area have been consulted about these plans; and when it is expected that either the old school will be repaired or the new school built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the conditions at Carrickbyrne national school. At my Department's request, an officer of the Commissioners of Public Works discussed recently with the Reverend Manager the question of carrying out improvements to the school in order to alleviate conditions for the period during which the school will remain in operation, pending its amalgamation with the Newbawn national <Col N="1041" /> school, some two miles away.  A new building is to be provided for the amalgamated schools.  The Reverend Manager considered that expenditure on the Carrickbyrne school would be useless and unwarranted, and I am prepared to accept that view.  I have not particulars of the improvements that would be necessary to bring the school building into a satisfactory condition, but I understand that they would be extensive and costly.</P>
      <P>The proposal to combine the Carrickbyrne and Newbawn schools has been discussed with the Reverend Manager of both schools.  It is the Department's practice to deal directly with the school managers in such matters but any representations from parents are given careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Planning of the new school at Newbawn is at an advanced stage, and, provided satisfactory evidence of title to the site offered by the manager is forthcoming, the Commissioners of Public Works expect to be in a position to invite tenders in the course of the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I spoke at some length on this last Thursday and all I want to do now is to emphasise a few points.  I should like to mention again the geriatric services.  The care of old people brings out the best in the members of voluntary organisations and every encouragement should be given to such organisations.  Paragraph 84 of the White Paper points out that voluntary organisations can often provide the most effective home aid.  It also urges co-ordination between the work of voluntary bodies and the appropriate public officers.  When I speak of encouragement, I do not mean lip encouragement but actual financial encouragement.  In Westmeath we are giving financial encouragement to a voluntary organisation in Athlone who are building a home for old people and providing them with amusements such as cards and television two or three nights a week.</P>
      <P>Again I should like to congratulate the Minister on what he has done for the rates by freezing the cost to the rates of health services at the figure obtaining in 1965-66 and ensuring that any growth in the health services in future will be the responsibility of his Department and not of the rates.  It is a big step forward in the stabilisation of rates and the Minister deserves thanks for it.  I am sure when we come to strike the rates in Westmeath and other counties, due tribute will be paid to him for what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a slight correction. There was a certain amount of doubt regarding the origin of this White Paper.  Fine Gael claimed it was theirs and Labour said it was in their policy document.  To illustrate, I asked if this White Paper was by O'Higgins out of O'Malley or by Kyne out of O'Malley? <Col N="1114" /> One thing is certain, however, O'Malley is the mother.  He deserves every thanks for the introduction of the White Paper and the matter of freezing the rates as I mentioned.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot about health over the past few days. Many of us feel after this winter things are not so healthy.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the serious situation that obtains at the Regional Hospital in Galway.  That hospital is crowded to the door and there are young nurses and other staff run off their feet trying to cope with the situation while, within a few miles, at Merlin Park, there are empty beds, empty units, that could cater for this overflow.  This has been put to the Minister recently and I hope he will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>Another solution would be the extension of nursing services to the homes of old people who are sick.  That would relieve the situation in the hospitals. We are clearly blessed in Galway in having the St. Joseph's Nursing Society and I take this opportunity of paying tribute to them for the trojan work they are doing silently.  If this work could be extended throughout the county it would help enormously. We have the other nursing groups who visit the homes but not to the extent that I would like to see it done.  Take the case of a man who has to go out to earn his bread and leave a sick mother or father at home.  The situation may become so serious that he has to give up his job, but if it is his mother who is ill he would certainly not be able to nurse her.  The suggestion I have made in regard to home nursing would relieve the pressure on our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I brought to the attention of this House the case of four young nurses at the Regional Hospital in Galway.  The Minister did not cover himself with glory in regard to the line he took on this case.  I should like to repeat what I said then.  A number of young nurses who had worked all night were expected to get <Col N="1115" /> up after two or three hours' sleep and attend lectures several days a week. They were dismissed from the staff of the Regional Hospital because, being so fatigued, they could not attend these lectures.  These nurses were prevented by the authorities from sitting for their examination.  Due to the great work of the Nursing Association they were allowed to sit here in Dublin for the same examination as their colleagues had done.  I am proud to say that three of the girls who sat for it passed in flying colours.  These girls were not given a fair crack of the whip in the first instance, and the Minister should ensure that such a situation does not arise again.</P>
    <P>With regard to medical cards, what happens to a breadwinner who becomes ill?  Heretofore, he did not qualify for a medical card.  When he falls ill, he has to provide very expensive drugs.  There is no income.  Those drugs are required immediately and the longer the delay the longer the return to health will be delayed.  I would like to know if in the interim, anything can be done to deal with such a situation? The kind of situation I have in mind needs to be dealt with fairly quickly because the unfortunate man cannot pay for the drugs and he might decide to do without them.  This would endanger his life and the future of his family.  I would like to know if anything can be done to deal with such a situation.  There is no income or little or no income and something should be done to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of medical cards I cannot understand why we have not a set standard throughout the country.  It is rather strange that in the western part of the country fewer medical cards are issued, <i>pro rata</i> than in the eastern part of the country where the land is rich, unlike the poorer sections of the west.  Why are the standards against the people in the western regions while they are with the people, if I may say so, in the eastern regions?  Those unfortunate people have been deprived of medical cards. There is many an unfortunate case <Col N="1116" /> which we raise and the people get the medical cards because we bring forward the actual facts that may have been ignored.</P>
    <P>We have been told about the White Paper on health.  Between all the promises Fianna Fáil have given, white papers, blueprints and what not, there is more paper in my home than would wallpaper many a house five times over.  What do they amount to?  We have a promise of this being the cure for all ills.  We have been told, for instance, about the choice of doctor. What choice of doctor will the people in the isolated parts of the country have?  Take, for instance, the Islands of Aran.  What choice have they of a doctor there?  We know the doctor is based on the larger island.  I concede you could not have a doctor on every island.  That would be a financial impossibility. In the very rough weather such as we experienced recently and as we experience every winter, the people are isolated completely and it is quite impossible for a doctor or a priest to get to Inishmaan.  The priest comes first and the doctor comes second to Inishmaan.  The island of Inishmaan and the island of Inishere are very particular cases and I would like to know if something can be done with regard to them?  They have a priest in Inishere and they have a priest on Inishmore but on Inishmaan they have neither priest nor doctor.  The people are at the mercy of the elements and during the greater part of the winter things there are in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>Last Friday I got a ring from the Aran Islands and I was asked what the possibility was of getting a helicopter for two days.  A man on the island was very ill.  The weather was such that while a lifeboat could go out it could not get to the island because of the rough weather.  The lifeboat people were willing to help. They rang me to inquire about the possibility of getting the helicopter.  I contacted the medical people and they said it depended on the doctor on the main island.  The doctor on the main island did not know what the condition of the man was.  He could not diagnose and he could not get there to help. <Col N="1117" /> In such a situation has the doctor to consider the financial implications and play for time while an unfortunate man is left with his life perhaps ebbing away?  This can happen around those islands.</P>
    <P>There will have to be some under-standing so that a doctor will have a free hand to call a helicopter.  As I said, I got to know of this on Friday evening and I told the people on the island it would be impossible to have a helicopter there at that hour because daylight would be against them.  I told them to ring me in the morning and let me know what the seas were like. I hoped the lifeboat would be able to go out.  They rang me in the morning at 11 o'clock and said the seas were still very rough and no boat could land.  I contacted the medical people in Galway.  I pointed out the situation and said that this man required both priest and doctor and something would have to be done.  In the meantime, I rang Baldonnel.  I told them I had no authority to call a helicopter but I said the reason I rang was if a doctor rang them it was important that they would be ready.  I pointed out that the man was extremely ill and needed a priest and a doctor.</P>
    <P>Half an hour later I had a ring from Baldonnel saying they were on their way and they were treating this as a mercy mission.  I would like to pay tribute to them for the part they played and I would like to pay a special tribute to the officer in charge. He did not waste time but dealt with the situation as it should be dealt with. They asked to have a priest and a doctor ready at the Regional Hospital in Galway.  They went to the island and they brought back the patient. The whole thing was carried out in a few hours.  There should be some understanding, when a situation like that arises in the islands of Inishman and Inishere, so that a helicopter can be made available.  Are we going to measure life by a few pounds?  That was treated as a mercy mission by the Army and I do not think there can be any charge for such a mission.  In fact it was the medical authorities who called.  I only pointed out the situation. <Col N="1118" /> They acted, and rightly so, and dealt with the case.  I would like the Minister to do something to ease the situation of the people on those islands.  I am surprised to note that more medical cards are issued in the wealthier counties than in Galway.  The standard should be checked by the Minister to ensure that people who are entitled to medical cards in my area are not deprived of them.</P>
    <P>Once again I appeal on behalf of the parents of the mentally handicapped children, and especially those of the low grade type.  Unfortunate people are trying to deal with them and they find they cannot leave their homes &mdash;somebody has to be around all the time and such cases are crying out for the Minister to do something to help them.  I can, as can every Member of this House, point out such cases and I would appeal to the Minister to do something to expedite the hospitalisation of such unfortunates.</P>
    <P>The Minister should check up on and do something about an improvement of the hospitalisation at the regional hospital to prevent overcrowding. I fear to think what would have happened had we had an outbreak of influenza such as they had in the North of Ireland.  Thanks be to God we were spared that but the Minister might examine that position and implement the request of the deputation met by him last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on the degree of energy he has displayed in bringing forth this White Paper and, furthermore, to congratulate him on the way in which he has introduced it in this House&mdash;not as an instrument for political hatcheting, but rather to get a clear overall picture from each and every representative in the spirit of co-operation and constructive criticism because, without constructive criticism any health scheme we formulate, or is formulated in this country, cannot be effective.  Therefore, we must view this not as anything partisan but as something which will redound&mdash;if properly legislated and implemented&mdash;to the success of the entire community.  It is on that note that this debate has progressed so far <Col N="1119" /> and, indeed, I would hope it will eventually terminate on that note.</P>
      <P>We must at all times be conscious of the health of our nation and, in particular, we must lay emphasis on that of the poorer sections of our community, many of whom cannot, through their financial resources, avail of specialist treatment or the aid of specialists at present.  It is our duty as a Government, as a Christian community, to ensure that lack of financial resources will not preclude anyone from gaining the very best medical advice and treatment available within the State.</P>
      <P>In an ever changing world we must constantly review all regulations but particularly health regulations.  The dispensary system which has operated here for a long number of years was, and is, indeed, today, satisfactory.  It was in its time even more so because it brought to the rural community, in particular, and to isolated areas, the service of a doctor for not only the very low income group but for the middle income group also and even those in the higher income brackets.  It was, in fact subsidisation of a doctor in some areas which might not normally have been able to support a private doctor.  Therefore, we have a lot to be thankful for as a result of the dispensary system, but we cannot allow things to remain static.  Where improvement can be effected, it is our duty to do so and to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained from the service provided by this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many instances, it will not be practicable or possible to give a choice of doctor to each section of the community but, where it is possible, it is highly desirable, not only from the medical point of view, because there may not be a terrible difference between one doctor and another, but also from the psychological aspect. When a person knows there is a choice, it eliminates a lot of frustration and a lot of the feeling that he is only taking Hobson's choice.  Therefore, the Minister made a very wise suggestion when he intimated to the House, through the White Paper, that a choice of <Col N="1120" /> doctor will be available, where practicable.</P>
    <P>We can also gain much from viewing our health services and their future improvement against a background of past experience and in the light of economic growth and future development. Our social system has revolutionised itself completely since the dispensary system was first introduced. Therefore, it is high time that we should review and appraise critically the present health system with a view to bringing about worthwhile and effective changes.  We can also concede that, with the passage of time, health has become a very expensive commodity when it breaks down.  Sickness has become prohibitive not alone for the lower income group but for the middle income group and, indeed, for some of the higher income group who have long and protracted illnesses or a repetition of recurring illnesses.  Those people, irrespective of what their income may be or what their valuation may be, must be catered for in any future health proposal.  People with £2,000 a year, if committed to a constant heavy and expensive demand on their resources, will soon feel their income and their standard of living being depleted by this heavy drain on their income.  So, it is imperative that we should embody in the future development of the health services some clauses which would cater for such eventualities.  They are not isolated; they occur daily, monthly and yearly.</P>
    <P>The Minister made one great concession to the health services and, indeed, to the local authorities who in many instances operate the health services in their area in so far as he has frozen, at this stage, the heavy demand on the rates.  The benefit of any increases effected this year may not be felt this year due to the fact that many councils and local authorities have now got to make good the debit which they did not fully levy last year but in the future development of any health service there will not be retardation of progress because of people's natural reluctance to increase rates.  This I feel will redound to the benefit, not merely of the rates, <Col N="1121" /> but will also redound to the benefit of the entire population because a more comprehensive form of health service will be envisaged and implemented in the future.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation of our health services is also a very practical and worthwhile development when all too often, we have had duplication and wasteful costs in administration.  Services which could have been regionalised for specialist facilities, which might not have been provided in each local authority area, can now be availed of in the centre of the region and the very best and the ultimate in scientific equipment and in practical experience from specialists can be made available to the people resident within that region.  In this the Minister has made a very worthwhile contribution in so far as the proper co-ordination of our hospital and health services will again redound to the benefit not merely of the profession and the people who have to operate and manage the hospitals but also to the benefit of the public at large as well.  They cannot but again from such a fund of skill and equipment being made available within easy reach of each local authority within the region.  I have one misgiving. I am afraid that the local people might be inclined to lose contact with it if a proper liaison between the authorities, the local councils and the regional boards is not maintained.  We must ensure that such a severing of contact between the boards and the populace does not occur.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed, frankly, that greater emphasis was not laid on mental health.  The mental health service is the Cinderella of the health services.  I speak not merely of the mentally handicapped but of the mentally ill.  These people are for the most part housed in antediluvian and early Victorian hospitals which were established when the whole concept of mental treatment was far different from what it is now.  I would ask the Minister, when the commission's report on mental health comes before him, to pursue a vigorous policy to rectify the tragedy whereby many of our people were locked away, forgotten and <Col N="1122" /> isolated from the realities of life behind high walls where they could neither see nor be seen.  With a more enlightened attitude on mental health we should develop this aspect of the health services, and give it top priority in any future development of capital expenditure on hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The provision of drugs and medicines is a very worthwhile exercise.  When the cost of drugs even for the ordinary person who is ill once or twice a year has become exorbitantly high, we must ensure that people in the middle income groups are catered for in a special way, and that they will not have to pay the tremendous costs&mdash;the extortionist costs I may say&mdash;which are at present charged.</P>
    <P>The White Paper has brought to the forefront the role of the nursing profession and shown it in a true light. Without the great devotion and the high degree of expertise these people have attained through their career and training, no health service can function nor can it be implemented fully.  The White Paper has given a new status to these people to whom I feel a proper recognition of their profession is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The dental services leave much to be desired and I am glad the Minister is revising the dental services as such. They are now to get an impetus which will do credit to each and every section of the service, and to the Government for implementing it.</P>
    <P>This scheme or any other scheme cannot be fully implemented without the full and proper co-operation of the people entrusted with it.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance that those who are engaged in the health services should give of their very best, and there should be no frustration or impeding of the desire of the Minister and the House to give better services to every section.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the health card will be of benefit.  Laying down standards for the nation will abolish completely the most degrading part of the present health services, that is, the investigation before the granting of a health card. At times that investigation was rather peculiar, and oftentimes the people <Col N="1123" /> concerned were not consulted, but their neighbours and other sources were consulted, and it was on that information that their entitlement was gleaned. This built up a resentment, and a justified resentment, at the method which was used.  I trust that setting down a national wage level and a poor law valuation will eliminate that obnoxious element from the health services.</P>

      <P>We all appear to have become very health conscious in recent years.  It would be no harm if we threw our minds back and gave credit to those who really did something for the health services of this country.  When this State was established we took over hospitals, some Victorian, many archaic, and many in a deplorable condition through lack of building or reconstruction as a result of lack of capital during World War I. The old Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;and I do not think they ever got the credit they deserved&mdash;set up the Hospitals Sweepstakes Trust and as a result many millions of pounds were poured into the building of new hospitals and the renovation of old hospitals.  We remember how at that time the Bill legalising the Hospitals Sweepstakes was bitterly opposed on many grounds, but without the millions of pounds which we received from the proceeds of the Hospitals Sweepstakes I wonder what condition would our hospitals be in today, and I wonder how many hospitals we have got would never have been seen.  We took for granted the flow of funds from the Hospitals Sweepstakes and we never gave credit to the people who first initiated them, and made them a success, and had the foresight to introduce legislation here to legalise this method of procuring funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a change of Government in 1932 and things were let drift.  Nothing was done for the health services for at least ten years, or possibly 12 to 14 years, after Fianna Fáil came into office.  We find that in 1945 the median age of death of those suffering from tuberculosis was 30.6 years.  The first <Col N="1124" /> inter-Party Government took office in 1948, and the first thing they did was to acquire buildings in an endeavour to eradicate the dreadful disease of tuberculosis.  The House will recollect that at that time the Minister for Health was instructed by the Taoiseach and the Government of the day to acquire buildings for the purpose of housing and giving hospital treatment to sufferers from TB.</P>
    <P>In my own county, an industrial school was taken over and made available to patients who suffered from TB. Regional sanitoria were set up throughout the country.  As a result, we find that, instead of 30.6 years being the median age at death in 1945, it had risen to 58.8 years in 1964&mdash;practically double.  The first inter-Party Government deserve credit for that and for endeavouring to wipe out human tuberculosis in this country.  They succeeded in doing so with the result that some of these sanitoria are now being closed down.  Even in my own county, the sanitorium taken over in 1948 is now about to be closed through lack of patients, thanks be to God.</P>
    <P>The policy of Fianna Fáil is &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do better than you&rdquo;.  While we were in the actual process of drafting the Health Act, the first inter-Party Government went out of office and, in 1953, the Health Act, 1953, was introduced.  We were assured by the then Minister for Health, Deputy James Ryan, who is now a member of Seanad Éireann, that that Health Act would cost 2/- in the £1 on the rates: He said it in this House. I myself heard him say that it would cost 2/- in the £1.  Let us look at the graph of costs of health services since then.  In 1947-48, the health services cost £5.7 million: today, they cost £30 million and it is now proposed to add another £4¼ million to that figure.  All during the time, we have had a falling population in this State.</P>
    <P>When the turnover tax was introduced here, I distinctly remember saying, that the ramifications of its introduction, particularly on local rates, would not be felt for some time.  Looking at the graph published on page 57 of the White Paper, we find that while <Col N="1125" /> the average increase in health services from 1947 to 1962 was approximately £1 million per year, there was a jump between 1963-64 and 1964-65 of £5 million.  Can anybody tell us or can anybody seriously suggest that we have got value for that extra £5 million spent in that particular year?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>While we accept this White Paper, we say it does not go far enough and it has come too late.  While we accept it, we do not accept the method of raising taxation for the purpose of implementing what is contained in that White Paper.  We think that the health services of this country should not cost the taxpayer and the ratepayer £34¼ million in the year.  I am aware that the Minister has told us, in writing, and has also stated in the White Paper that he is satisfied that the local rates are not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money on this scale.  He says, also, that the cost of further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.  He gave an undertaking that the Government would ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 would not exceed the cost of the year 1965-66.  The Minister has given us that undertaking.  I certainly would accept that he will keep his word.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, in Donegal, we had the unfortunate privilege of striking a rate representing an increase of 6/1½ in the £1.  We in Fine Gael who are on that council proposed that we should defer striking the rate until after the Budget until we would find out if the Budget would have any impact on the rates. We were then assured that any additional cost which may be incurred in the health services as a result of further taxation which may be imposed in the Budget would be borne by the Minister and, on that undertaking, we struck this rate.  I presume the Minister will carry out his undertaking and that, if expenses are incurred as a result of the imposition of any further taxes, the local rates will not be asked to bear them.  I am glad to have the Minister's consent to that statement of mine and that he agrees with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> One of the principles&mdash;and it is a principle with which I agree&mdash;in this White Paper is that there should be a choice of doctor.  But are we not makeing too much of this?  Where are we to have a choice of doctor?  The only places I know of where we can have a choice of doctor are in the cities or the towns of Ireland but certainly you will not have a choice of doctor in rural Ireland.  Indeed, the position at the moment is that we are very glad to be able to say we have doctors in some of the dispensary districts of rural Ireland because some cannot find doctors. This White Paper will not be implemented for some years to come. Unfortunately, there is an unrest growing amongst the medical profession in the country through lack of directive from the Department of Health.  We are told we will not replace dispensary doctors pending the implementation of the White Paper.  We are also told we cannot say exactly when this White Paper will be implemented.</P>
    <P>We have some dispensary districts at the moment where we cannot find even a <i>locumtenens</i> for the area and, if I might mention one, it is Aranmore Island, an island off the north-west coast of Donegal.  We have neither doctor nor nurse on the island and we are unable to procure one.  Some dispensary doctors have been unable to take a holiday because they cannot find a locum, unless the doctor in the adjoining dispensary district is prepared to oblige him.  There is a growing unrest throughout the medical profession in this State through lack of some positive directive from the Custom House on this particular matter.  We have only to look at the staffs of our hospitals throughout the country to observe the number of nonnationals employed there while our young graduates are finding employment in America and elsewhere.  It is not because of lack of reasonable remuneration but it is through lack of some security of tenure that these young men are being driven abroad. I should like if something could be done to ensure that there will be a steady flow of our young graduates from the medical schools into the health services of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Despite what we are spending on health services&mdash;£30 million&mdash;we find that the dental services throughout the State are completely unmanned.  Most local authorities are unable to procure whole-time dental surgeons to man the posts vacant in their areas.  We find even in the case of the school inspection of children that there is sometimes a lapse of three or four years between inspections in relation to the health of children in isolated schools. Recently, I discovered a case where the schoolteacher had not seen the school doctor for almost three years. On inquiry I found that owing to periods in which we had no assistant county MOH, we were unable to carry out the usual inspections that should be carried out in these schools.</P>
    <P>Again, people entitled to dentures under the Health Act have been unable to procure them and many Deputies, particularly county councillors, are continually making representations to local authorities to ensure that dentures will be given to those entitled to them, but nothing can be done.  I know people, holders of medical cards, who had teeth extracted three or four years ago but are unable to get the dentures to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Davern referred to the nursing service.  Jubilee and district nursing services are one of the greatest social amenities but there is an unfortunate tendency now to ignore these services and in many cases in rural Ireland where such services were provided, no attempt is being made to continue them.  That is a tragedy, particularly when there is so much emigration. The young people have gone and there is nobody left to look after the aged when they need attention.  District or Jubilee nurses are absolutely essential in those circumstances.  If the Minister gave that minor branch of the profession his attention, something good might come of it.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the reason for the high cost of drugs.  I fear that drug importers and those who have a monopoly in that regard are responsible. One has only to cross the Border to <Col N="1128" /> see the difference in the cost there. Has the Minister gone carefully into the question of the importation of drugs from the US?  Has he tried to find out if there is not a monopoly of the agencies and also a monopoly in the importation of the drugs?  That could possibly be the cause of the high drug prices here and should be looked into.  I think the Minister did this once before and some good resulted in the case of a certain drug, the price of which was drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that no district hospital built in the past 14, 15 or even 20 years, since the war, will be closed.  In my own town of Dungloe, the inter-Party Government built a magnificent district hospital which we had sought for years.  The Minister's immediate predecessor said it should never have been built and it was with the greatest difficulty that I persuaded him to advertise the appointment of a permanent medical officer.  I do not think such a permanent appointment has been made or that it was advertised for a considerable time.  I sincerely hope that hospital which serves a very poor part of the western Gaeltacht and provides much needed service, will never be closed.</P>
    <P>I am glad something is being done for the mentally handicapped but if we are to get the medical services that we all wish to see&mdash;and that includes the Minister, I am sure&mdash;we should bear in mind that taxpayers and ratepayers cannot afford it and some other method of procuring money for these services must be found.  There is no better method than that suggested by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, namely, insurance.  We know how well it has worked in the Voluntary Health Scheme for the middle or higher income group.  Nothing is offered in this White Paper to the middle-income group other than that where there is excessive expenditure on drugs, there may be a State contribution.  I am certain anybody in permanent employment would have no objection to paying a weekly contribution for a medical service and no employer would object to contributing, provided he was <Col N="1129" /> satisfied that in time of need the employee, his wife and family would be adequately looked after and dispensary, specialist or hospital treatment provided.  That would be a much better way of paying for health services than asking the taxpayers to pay when this White Paper is implemented, if ever, over £34 million.</P>
    <P>If the cost of keeping up the hospitals continues to rise at the rate shown in the graph published in the White Paper, the taxpayers cannot bear the burden.  I remember President de Valera, then Leader of the Opposition, on one occasion when the Budget was being introduced by Deputy Sweetman interjected: &ldquo;We have reached the limit of taxation&rdquo;.  I wonder what he would say were he sitting in the same seat listening to the present Minister for Finance introducing his Budget tomorrow.  Not only have we reached the limit of taxation at a local level but we have also reached it at the national level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House although I could talk for hours, giving examples and quoting problems from my constituency. I think the House has heard enough of those cases but I want to add my voice to the voices of those who have acclaimed the contents of this White Paper, having studied it objectively.</P>
      <P>Quite obviously, what is proposed will improve the existing services substantially and, as has been admitted by the Opposition, the present services are quite satisfactory in many respects. The most satisfactory part of the new proposals is the choice of doctor and chemist which must be loudly acclaimed as a positive step to give those in the lower-income group a general practitioner service similar in every way to that enjoyed at present by those who can afford to pay.  No longer will the poorer sections be a class apart, nor will they suffer some of the frustrations associated with the present dispensary system in regard to the supply of medicines and drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the intention to make better arrangements to assist persons <Col N="1130" /> in the middle-income group to obtain drugs where undue expense arises. As a member of a health authority, two proposals interest me particularly. First, it is the Minister's intention to define by regulation the limits of eligibility for general practitioner services. This will remove anomalies as between one health authority and another and will also save the public representative from making many representations he has to make at present. Applicants will know where they stand. This is one of the best features of the proposals.  The Minister has said it is his intention to issue a booklet telling each individual to what he is entitled. Secondly, I welcome the relief of the rates which the Minister's initiative has already brought to pass through his undertaking regarding future financing as far as local contributions are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to psychiatric treatment and said that the Minister should study the results of the inquiry made in this regard and act on it as quickly as possible.  For the information of the Deputy, I should like to say that the Minister has already made a move in this direction.  We in the Waterford Health Authority have been pioneers in regard to psychiatric treatment in the General Hospital at Ardkeen where a special unit has been established for patients requiring psychiatric treatment.  This has brought about a wonderful break-through in this field of minor mental disorders.  It has also removed the stigma which used attach locally to people suffering in this way.  Nowadays if a patient is sent to this unit, people merely say that he has gone to the psychiatric department of the hospital, just as they would say that a person has gone to, say, the orthopaedic department.  From my dealings with the doctors and staff in this unit, I can assure Deputies who are members of local authorities that if they require any assistance in this regard, it will be readily forthcoming from this staff.  In conclusion, I wish the Minister every success in his approach to this whole question of medical services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The very sad thing about <Col N="1131" /> this particular debate is that it is related to a document called &ldquo;The Health Services and Their Further Development&rdquo;. It might be better entitled &ldquo;How We Propose to Make a Silk Purse Out of a Sow's Ear&rdquo;.  It would be much better if in this day and age the National Parliament were to take a look at the human and moral need that there is to make medical services available to all and see how best that could be done, rather than that, in the second half of the twentieth century, there should be published, under the auspices of the Minister for Health and the Government, a document which is no more than an apologia for continuing into the twentieth century a medical system which was introduced, not to provide medical or moral comfort, but rather to prevent the spread of plague and fever at a time when the country was riddled with famine, fever and plagues which, thank God, no longer afflict the people.  We should consider man's status as a social being and from that status consider what obligations or what rights flow.</P>
      <P>We find that there is the obligation to render help to one's fellow-members of society and the right to expect help from one's fellow-members of that society.  At this point of time, surely we should consider whether or not it is within the capacity of our society so to arrange things that those in a position to help their neighbours and themselves could do so under a scheme which would apply to all, and by so doing, make the benefits of medical services available without all the restrictions which are inevitable as long as we try to graft on to nineteenth century legislation the future development of our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not speak of these things lightly and I do not say them for the purpose of taking partisan advantage.  I express these thoughts because I am appalled by the experience of this debate and by the acceptance that it is impossible for us so to arrange things that every person who is earning an income should contribute a little, a minute portion of that income, so as to provide insurance for himself and for <Col N="1132" /> other people against the day of illhealth which is inevitable as long as we are on this earth.  I am also disappointed that we have once again not learned by our mistakes.  The underlying approach of the Government to national problems is spelt out in black and white in their 1958 White Paper on what they called the economic development of the nation and in which they rejected as incompatible with economic expansion the provision of better social services.  It is time that we accepted without argument the fact that health is wealth and that if we accepted that, we would be contributing substantially to the economic development of the country, and that we would be preserving the wealth of the country if we ensured that the health of the country was also in good order.</P>
    <P>At present, through absenteeism, we lose 14 million working days per annum, an equivalent of seven per cent of the labour force available.  That is a figure which is five times greater than what we lose through the now much attacked industrial disputes.  One would not be so rash as to suggest that we could reduce that figure to nil.  We could not.  However, if we were able to reduce it by half, we would be contributing substantially to the health and economic expansion of the country.  There is no doubt that if we limit our future health policy to the targets which the Minister puts before us we will not reduce substantially the amount of absenteeism we have and we will certainly compel tens of thousands of people to continue, as they have in the past, to delay obtaining medical aid and to put off the purchase of drugs because they find it beyond their means to buy them.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I express not a little disappointment with the underlying philosophy in the Government's approach to the health problem.  It is entirely inadequate.  It is entirely unsatisfactory and the consequences are going to be a continuation of personal misery and substantial economic loss to the nation.  We in Fine Gael have twice invited the public to vote upon our health policy and on each occasion, as the Minister in the course of interjections <Col N="1133" /> has pointed out, we have been unsuccessful in getting the support of the people.  Of course, the reasons for that are not related to the acceptance or otherwise of our health policy. Rather it is a multitude of influences which come to bear on general elections, many of them to some of us irrelevant, many to many people unworthy, but none the less those influences do operate at general election times.  We have no doubt that if there was a referendum on the question of the Fine Gael health policy there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of it and there is no doubt whatsoever about the sincerity of our invitation to the Government to have such a national referendum on the Fine Gael health policy.  They could have it on 1st June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of making these stupid interjections the Minister should read the debates and listen to what is being said.  If he did that he would find that every Fine Gael Deputy who has spoken has accepted the Fine Gael policy on health <i>in toto</i> but at the same time has expressed the difficulties which even the Minister realises arise in relation to the application of a health policy in every parish, in every mountainside and in every valley in the country.  Expressing these difficulties is not to say that there is any division on the Fine Gael policy, on the underlying principle of our health policy which is one of taking a little every week from those who can afford to pay and charging nobody when they are sick and in need.  If the Minister does not understand that underlying principle he is becoming as bad as his predecessor, closing his mind, his eyes and his ears and making it impossible for the truth to penetrate into the Department of Health in the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think that the health of our people, indeed the very lives of some of them, so important that it cannot be determined by competition from other demands on the existing tax fund. As Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said during the debate and as he has been saying for years and years, to accept that a 19th century basis for health services is adequate for the future is to accept a continuation of the inevitability of <Col N="1135" /> the age-old struggle between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health.  We do not accept that.  The fact that this battle between the Departments is inevitable is acknowledged in the White Paper and in the Minister's opening statement.  It has been acknowledged by every speaker on all sides of the House in the course of the debate.  We in Fine Gael say that because it is inevitable in the present system we should reject that basis and should not try to continue to make a silk purse out of the abominable sow's ear which has been put before us by the Minister as being capable of improvement.</P>
    <P>The White Paper declares that a higher proportion of the middle income group are to be excluded by ministerial order from the health services.  The Minister, in a categorical fashion in his White Paper, says that the limits which he will fix for availability of medical services will not include a high proportion of the population. There are some matters in the White Paper which the Minister leaves open to doubt but one thing which is beyond doubt, beyond comment, is that a high proportion of our people will not be included in the medical services. Having regard to the fact that in some counties a high proportion are already excluded, it is apparent that the Minister proposes in some context to cut down on the number of people who at present enjoy whatever benefits there may be in the inadequate health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also in no uncertain fashion, in both his opening address in the debate and in the White Paper, guaranteed that he will not remove the abominable charges which are now extracted from people when they are sick and lying in hospital and not earning.  May I point out, as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins pointed out and as others did, that this iniquitous charge of 10/- a day, scaled down in some circumstances, was not even envisaged in the health policies brought before the House in 1953?  It was introduced four years later in 1957.  It means we are walking backwards now and <Col N="1136" /> apparently we hope to get increased revenue from this source in the years ahead.  I should like to point out that this miserable charge of 10/- a day&mdash; miserable because it is imposed at a time of human misery&mdash;produces onesixtieth part of the total health bill and we are to keep that and by so doing reduce the chances of recovery by increasing the worries of this section of our people.  The justification, we are led to believe, is that it will encourage people to get out of hospital more quickly.  I always understood that people stayed in hospital when the doctors said they could and should stay but apparently that is not so. Apparently the Minister accepts the theory that people like to be in hospital and would stay there unless they were charged 10/- a day.  They are to continue to be charged this iniquitous £3 10s. a week so long as they stay in hospital.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael find that unacceptable. We think it is unnecessary and unworthy, particularly having regard to the fact that it represents only one-sixtieth of the total cost of the health services, even allowing for the fact that everybody in the middle income group is not charged this 10/- a day, even allowing for the fact that only a small proportion of those people are called to pay it.  The fact is that this charge is imposed at a time when the family income is substantially reduced and the worry of this bill is something which medical men will tell you has a delaying effect on a patient's prospects of recovery.  On that account we reject the statement by the Minister that he proposes to continue this.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the White Paper to which I want to alert people to be careful when reading it. When the Minister wants to be specific, he has no difficulty in being specific.  But when he wants to confuse and leave things in the arena of doubt and uncertainty, he does so.  He leaves in the arena of doubt and uncertainty the amount by which the rates in Dublin city and county are to be increased. He has said in one part of the White Paper there will be no increase in rates in respect of any improvement <Col N="1137" /> in the health services.  He reiterated that in the introduction to this debate. He went on television and radio and said the same thing.  But he did not repeat, as he ought to have, the other section of the White Paper which specifically gives a guarantee that rates in Dublin, and presumably on the eastern seaboard, are to be increased in order to allow him to redistribute the burden of the costs of the health services.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that in Dublin city only 16 per cent of the population enjoy the services made available to holders of a general medical services card.  In Dublin county the percentage is only 13.  But in many other parts of the country the percentage is as high as 35, 40 and 45 and in Carlow, it is 47 per cent.  If the Minister is going to reduce the burden in those counties where at present over 30 or 40 per cent of the people have medical cards, he can do so only by increasing the cost of the health services in Dublin.  If he does it by allowing Dublin the same percentage enjoyment of the health services, it will be bad enough, but from what we can gather the intention is to reduce the number of those enjoying the health services.  The consequence will almost invariably be that Dublin will pay a higher rate for a lesser service.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister was frank with the people of Dublin and of the other parts of the country where he proposes to increase the rates.  How soon will he be honest with them and tell them by what amount he will increase the rates, or is this something that will be left over until after the in-famous, long-delayed local elections? Is this one of the factors taken into consideration in determining the timing of the local elections?  I can assure the Minister he need not think he will be left alone on this.  We will press him month in and month out, and not even the smirk on the Minister's face will be accepted as an answer by the people.  We want to know exactly by how many shillings, if not pounds, in the £ the people of Dublin are to be called on to contribute towards his particular silk purse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> The apologia for the health services published by the Minister is more concerned with defending the existing system than with doing something with the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is particularly apparent where it deals with the dispensary service.  We are told the dispensary service has many merits.  It then recites what it considers to be the merits.  It outlines the merits and ends by saying that the only disadvantage is that it does not provide a choice of doctor.  I thought we could in the course of this debate simply bury Caesar, but we have come not to bury Caesar but to praise him.</P>
      <P>The dispensary service has many defects, not the least of which is the fact that it does not give people a choice of doctor.  In Dublin, for instance, in corporation housing estates where the tenants of houses must have families before they are allocated a house and where the new tenants of houses, being young, increase their families in the decade or so after taking up their tenancies, there are dispensary doctors with as many as 8,000 people to look after.  It is quite clear that where a dispensary doctor is called on to attend, say, 120 or 140 people in an hour-and-a-half session, he cannot possibly give them a medical service such as the Minister boasts of, which the Department says they have been getting in the iniquitous dispensary service and which they say has only one disadvantage, the fact that it does not give a choice of doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of choice of doctor will not make it possible for any man to give proper medical attention to 140 people in an hour-and-a-half session in any morning, and that is what has been happening in our large urban centres where doctors are plentiful, where people pass doctors' surgeries on the way to their local dispensaries. There is no justification for the continuation in any form of a system which compels one State official to see 140 people in an hour-and-a-half session <Col N="1139" /> in an area where there are plenty of doctors available or where plenty of doctors would be available if we were to abolish this Victorian concept of providing only a State official to attend the poor in their medical wants.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the country where by reason of the low density in population, dispensary doctors have only a couple of hundred people to look after and if we did not maintain State-paid doctors in such areas, hardship would arise for people there.  That has been said by many members of the House, including many members of the Fine Gael Party, and that is not a contradiction of our long-stated intention to do away with the dispensary service where there is a high density of population and where there are ample doctors available to attend to the wants of those high-density communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in his supercilious way here and, for propaganda purposes, elsewhere suggest there is a conflict in the Fine Gael Party in relation to the dispensary service.  We cannot stop him doing it.  We have been trying for years to stop the irresponsibility of the Fianna Fáil Party, but irresponsibility is an endemic disease in Fianna Fáil and we can do little except to continue our best propaganda efforts to counteract the irresponsibility of that Party.  However, we shall continue to discharge our duties and hope that, whoever may get the credit for it, some day in our time we shall have a proper medical service, allowing people a choice of doctor, where a choice of doctor is available, and ensuring that doctors are available by paying them out of State funds if the alternative is to be that no doctor will be available in particular areas.</P>
    <P>There are certain problems ahead of us in providing the new service, and not the least of those is the provision of surgeries in corporation estates. There are dispensary doctors in some of the corporation estates in Dublin who have been unable to get houses within their dispensary area for the simple reason that every available <Col N="1140" /> patch of land has been taken up by the corporation in building houses for their own tenants.  As doctors do not qualify as tenants of corporation houses, they have not been able to get tenancies of these houses.  At present in most of these estates there are clinics and it is most important that these buildings be made available for doctors in private practice who will be providing the service which we in Fine Gael have been envisaging for years and which the Minister is, to some extent, trying to imitate in the programme he hopes to bring in.</P>
    <P>There is another disadvantage of the dispensary service which the Minister and the Government do not recognise, because in the White Paper they recognise only one fault, the lack of choice of doctor.  The system under which the eligibility for dispensary service is ascertained debases the dignity of both doctors and patients.  I do not know how many Members of this House have ever bothered to study the forms issued by some of our health authorities to determine eligibility of people for the dispensary service.  The form issued to the investigating officers requires them to obtain information on such matters as: Is the home well-kept or badly kept?  Is the home well-furnished or badly furnished?  Are the children well-clothed or badly-clothed?&mdash;and other extremely personal questions that should not have any effect upon whether or not a person is to get a general service medical card.  By those standards these services are only to be made available if you are a pauper or if you are destitute.  That is the kind of system which we are asked to enshrine once again in legislation for another decade or so ahead.  We are being asked to give a benediction to the Minister to go forth from this House and prepare a Bill enshrining this philosophy.  We in Fine Gael say: &ldquo;No; we are not prepared to do it&rdquo;. We are prepared to vote for a health service which we have categorically stated will cost £8½ million.  What the Minister proposes is going to cost only £4¼ million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister says his scheme will cost £4¼ million but does not say where it is to be obtained, whether it is by increasing income tax, by reducing the personal allowances or by increasing the turnover tax.  We recall that a few short years ago great money was spent, even out of election time, in boasting of the fact that the iniquitous turnover tax was going to be used to improve our health services.  The iniquitous tax was imposed but our health services got worse instead of better.  I have no doubt that tomorrow, too, we shall have the whited sepulchres giving out a new hope that out of this pollution of a health service and this pollution of a tax system we are going to produce a beautiful new flower.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should <Col N="1143" /> move cautiously.  He knows he was being most provocative in the course of Question Time in which he was claiming credit for things which Fine Gael said ten years ago.  Deputy O'Higgins pointed out that these things were said a long time ago by him and he put it this way, that he had written the White Paper.  In an hour-long address Deputy O'Higgins made clear what he had written in the White Paper, and the Minister, like all Fianna Fáil people, is a past-master at taking things out of their context.  I will make my own speech in my own time.  I had hoped to give way shortly to my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, but if the Minister asks me to give figures, I shall have to give them, or if he is prepared to undertake that even now he will justify the salary he is receiving by reading that debate, I shall be prepared to forgo the pleasure of teaching him.  I realise how difficult it must be for some teachers.  It must be extremely difficult to teach a dense pupil or perhaps just an obstinate one, but by repetition of these things, there is the hope that in the long run the truth will get through.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the shortcomings of the dispensary service which are not recited in the White Paper, and we shall now come to the third defect of this service which we are told has many merits and but one fault.  The third defect is that it produces a very high hospitalisation rate, and that is not surprising.  Any conscientious dispensary doctor who is called upon to treat 140 people in a morning, which is a regular thing here in Dublin, finds that the only way in which he can discharge his medical obligation and his moral obligation to patients is by putting them in hospital.  The consequence of this is that the hospitals get a large proportion of people who could be treated at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By limiting the dispensary service to only a minority of the population, such as now operates, you also compel people to forgo necessary medical attention with the inevitable consequences that the disease or ailment gets worse and will not be treated <Col N="1144" /> until hospitalisation becomes absolutely necessary.  As a result, we have here the highest hospitalisation rate in Europe and a rate, which instead of decreasing, as one might expect it to do, with the improvement in modern drugs, is increasing and is now little short of double what it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>This is a companion of the dispensary service and it is a third defect.  It is a fourth defect if you include the one which has been acknowledged in the White Paper.  It clearly indicates the Minister does not accept those things as defects in the dispensary service or if he does, that he is unwilling to admit it.  It would be much better for him, and for the future of the health services, if he were to acknowledge those problems.  I believe we should look at our problems if we have them and we should try to improve them according to our own lights but there are many people who believe we should determine our social, economic and financial policy by a Micawberlike hope that we may be a member of the European Economic Community by 1970.  If we become a member of the European Economic Community in 1970, or at any other time, we will be under very clear and rigid obligations to maintain health and social standards on a level which now operates in the countries who are members of that Community.</P>
    <P>We are already a party in respect of some of the clauses of the European Convention on social and medical assistance but apparently we do not accept, in practice, the obligations which already lie on us and which will become unavoidable if and when we become a member of any European community.  It is clear that the obligations in the European community are to become common to all countries and we shall have to bring our health services up to the same standards as operate elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, Denmark and Britain there are free medical services available to 100 per cent of the population. In Germany, France and Austria 90 per cent of the people enjoy medical services without charge.  In the Netherlands, <Col N="1145" /> Norway, Switzerland and Spain 80 per cent of the people enjoy health services without charge and in Belgium it is 75 per cent.  The Minister's proposals involve making the health services available to a small proportion of the population.  The present proportion represents on an average 30 per cent.  In Dublin city and county it works out at something between 14 per cent and 15 per cent.  It is 16 per cent in the city and 13 per cent in the county.  We are promised in the Minister's clear, specific undertaking, in black heavy print, in case there is any doubt about it, in the White Paper, that he will not have a large proportion of the people enjoying the health services although all our future companions, the people to whom we are to be bonded tomorrow, have health services available to not less than 75 per cent of the people.  This clearly indicates that our health services are not good enough.  The minute improvements, which the Minister is now offering, will not permit us to become members of the European community, upon which all our economic and financial hopes are now set.</P>
    <P>On page 9 of the White Paper there is a reference to the need for improvements and then there is reference to the fact that expenditure on development in the services could not, in any event, be undertaken in the existing financial circumstances.  Unfortunately, we know that to be true.  It is not the only necessary thing which is being postponed in the existing financial circumstances but we are entitled to say that those minute improvements are coming late.  They could have come into operation, even under existing administration, at any time in the last nine years.  The Government deserve to be criticised because of the fact that in days when they said finance was plentiful they failed to bring in even the miserable improvements which are now proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated in the White Paper that he will not leave in future an atmosphere of uncertainty regarding eligibility for health services. While there are merits in putting an end to all uncertainty there are also <Col N="1146" /> dangers.  We know the many hardships which can arise in our social welfare legislation.  The difference of as much as a penny can mean getting a service and not getting it at all.  The danger of bringing in a means test by ministerial regulations rather than by administrative decision is that we will close the door to many people who now, by process of argument or production of evidence of the burden of costs, can get in.  We, therefore, express the hope that there will be some kind of way left for grading those benefits so that people will not find themselves excluded by small amounts from all benefits, compared with their neighbours who, by having a minutely smaller income can get all the benefits. If one is to be specific as to the levels of eligibility, it becomes impossible to deal with the variations as between families.  There will have to be considerable grounds for manoeuvre if we are to have any kind of a just system.</P>
    <P>We are told also in the White Paper that at present no service is designed so that the person must show dire want before he can avail himself of it.  That is a quotation from page 16 of the White Paper.  Further on in that paragraph we are told:</P>
    <P>Eligibility for hospital and specialist services, which are likely to be much more costly, has been extended to a far wider group of the population and, in general, those outside the group statutorily entitled to the services can use them if they can show hardship.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister even know what his present health service is doing?  In one part of this paragraph he says there is no need to show dire want and further in the same paragraph he says that you must show hardship.  It becomes extremely difficult to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the White Paper which contradicts itself in the one paragraph.</P>

      <P>There is no difference between dire want and hardship.  What are the consequences of these tests which we now apply and which we also will be applying in the future? People make an application for a general services medical card; they are perhaps not as skilled as others might be in expressing their case and because they are unable to prove dire want or hardship, or the two of them, they then trot along to some politician and the politician makes representations on their behalf, and sometimes the representations might not be as clear as the original application.  In other cases, more information is extracted from the applicant and an appeal is lodged.  I am happy to say that in the majority of cases the appeals are successful but what really angers me is that in due course you get a letter from the health authority, the envelop of which is marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; and the letter itself bears at the top the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; telling you the highly confidential information that So-and-So has been given a blue card.  But we oblige people to go to politicians to disclose their family income, to disclose their circumstances, to disclose a <Col N="1148" /> disease from which they or their family suffer.  We oblige them to throw confidence out the door and then the irony at the end of it when we get a confidential letter saying because the people have broken confidence and because we have exposed them to the indignity of disclosing their family circumstances, they will now get a confidential blue card.  Apparently the Minister proposes to have something similar in future and, unless people disclose all these things, they will not be eligible for the blue card; unless they disclose all that they will not come within the limitations set by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On page 23 of the White Paper the Minister says:</P>
      <P>The maximum use of out-patient services will be essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael could not agree more with him.  We believe this will be for the benefit of the patients, and we are primarily concerned for the benefit of the patients, but we are also satisfied that the maximum use of out-patient services will bring benefit to the medical service in general, will make it possible for the doctors to give better service than they are giving at the moment.  If we accept this as essential, we must also accept the clear obligation of improving the out-patient services available in our hospitals.  It is deplorable that in this day and age, in this city of Dublin&mdash;and I suspect in most other urban centres&mdash;we have not got a system of appointments for outpatients. The result is that people without influence are obliged to go to the out-patients' departments of our hospitals at 8.30 a.m. and consider themselves lucky if they get medical attention by noon, one or two o'clock. Some years ago I had ocassion to go to a hospital in the city to get an X-ray taken of a fractured wrist.  I joined a queue of such unfortunate people and sat for three and a half hours, time which I could not afford as I was then a Member of this House and had other obligations as well, but I was interested to see what would happen.  At the end of that three and a half hours the X-ray was taken and then I was asked for my name and address.  When I had <Col N="1149" /> given this, I was severely criticised for not having disclosed my name and status beforehand because I would have got immediate attention.  But I expressed the view that I did not wish to have attention given to me which was not available to everybody.  I made an exhaustive study of other hospitals and inquired from many other injured people and found that this practice applies in practically all the hospitals in Dublin.  It may not be the case in them all but in any I have heard of this practice of obliging people to wait for hours in out-patient departments operates.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to do something about it.  I asked his predecessor to do something about it.  The Minister replied in the House and said it was not his responsibility, it was up to the people to make their own arrangements or for the health authorities to see they are looked after.</P>

I was delighted; I said a prayer in thanksgiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is getting home.  I would not make any personal claim on having got through to the Minister's conscience.  I would imagine that it would be impossible but, nevertheless, he did express concern then about the inadequacy of our out-patient services.  We need a radical improvement in this particular service <Col N="1150" /> and I think we should bring it about here and now.  The way to do it is to have an appointments system breaking up the appointments by half-hourly or hourly periods.  There was a time in our district courts in Dublin when there was no hour fixed for the hearing of cases, other than the commencement of the court in the morning at 10.30.  I am glad to say that over the years this system has been changed, a certain number are fixed for the 10.30 list, others for the 11.30 and so on.  The result is that a great deal of frustration has been avoided.  People do not as a rule have to resort to the law courts as frequently as they do to out-patient departments for medical attention.  On that account it is imperative that we introduce an appointments system.  It is clear that it would be easy to do it and there is no justification for delaying it.  I say that out of knowledge of my own experiences but there are some people who would not regard it as possible unless it is in existence elsewhere. I would remind everybody that it is in existence across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 29 of the White Paper the Minister mentions that at the moment dispensary doctors&mdash;flatteringly called district medical officers in the White Paper&mdash;act as registrars of births, deaths and marriages in their districts. I have advocated in the House that this system should be done away with; that this is something which does not require legislation.  The Minister has indicated that all it requires is an amendment of regulations by him and I would beg of him to do so without delay.  Again, speaking from personal experience, if one's child is not born in one of the general maternity hospitals, one of the parents must attend at the local dispensary to register the birth and there join a queue of, again, maybe 140 people who are looking for medical attention.  You join a queue of people, some with bottles, some without; some with pills, some without; some highly contagious, some not; some with broken limbs, some without; and at the end of a long wait&mdash;unless you have exerted influence&mdash;you arrive at the medical officer, if he is present, and you hand him a form which you filled in in the <Col N="1151" /> office outside and he accepts it from you.  You are totally unknown to him. Thus a great event has occurred in registering the birth of another Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>Why is such a parent not permitted to complete the form and return it by post to the Custom House?  Possibly the officer in the Custom House may know as much about the applicant as the local dispensary doctor.  I beg the Minister not to delay any longer in making this very necessary amendment. On another occasion when I raised this matter with the Minister he said&mdash;I may be wrong; I am open to correction&mdash;that only 25 per cent of the people had to register births at the local dispensary, and that would be in respect of births in people's own homes or in nursing homes, but even this 25 per cent should not be called upon to perform this ancient and ridiculous rite of attending before an official at the local dispensary who had no idea as to the veracity of the information given to him.</P>
    <P>The law requires that this form should be handed personally to the district medical officer, but I have had the experience&mdash;and I know other people who had the experience&mdash;of attending such a place for the purpose of handing in the form within the stated hours, and the medical officer did not arrive in time, and perhaps not for half an hour or an hour after the appointed time, and a sympathetic official who had no right to accept the form said: &ldquo;If you give it to me, I will pass it on to the doctor&rdquo;.  That practice is rampant and again it is evidence I adduce of the necessity to amend these regulations and allow births to be registered by direct information to the Custom House.</P>
    <P>The White Paper throws out for comment the question of the system by which doctors are to be paid for services to be rendered under the new medical system.  I have spoken already of the fact that an inevitable and unavoidable companion of the existing system is a high hospitalisation rate, because doctors must in conscience reduce the burden upon themselves by <Col N="1152" /> getting people into hospital where they can get better attention.  If we have a capitation rate, it is almost certain that some doctors will have a very high case rate because of their popularity, because of their skill, because of their good reputation, and such doctors, particularly during an outbreak like a flu epidemic, will not be able to handle all the patients they are expected to handle under a capitation scheme, and as a result they will refer their patients to hospital, and by referring them to hospital apparently they will not lose anything because the capitation fee will still apply.</P>
    <P>Clearly we would have a better system if we related the fees to be earned by the doctors to the services provided by them.  So far as I know, in all the countries which I recited earlier where there is a national health service, in only two is payment by means of a capitation fee.  Those are Britain and the Netherlands.  The other countries found it possible to have a system of paying for services given.  We think the interests of the patients dictate that we should have a system of payment for services rendered rather than a capitation system.  We note that the White Paper says that a capitation system seems the most practicable.  From what point of view?  I strongly suspect it is from the point of view of administrative convenience and not the excellence of the service that should be given to the people who avail of it.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 49 of the White Paper, we are told that doctors are to be limited in the drugs which they prescribe. We are very worried about this. We appreciate that it is undesirable to encourage the prescribing of luxury drugs and medicines if there are perfectly adequate alternatives, but we fear the consequences of a bureaucratic arrangement under which in some cases non-qualified people will determine whether or not a doctor's prescription is one which ought to be met.  Dispensary doctors will tell us, and patients who are compelled to attend at dispensaries will tell us, that at present it is not infrequent for a <Col N="1153" /> doctor's prescription to be altered by the dispenser.</P>
    <P>Several serious cases have arisen in which alternative medicines and drugs which were not prescribed by the doctor have been given out by the chemist and the consequences in some cases have been extremely serious.  I have been informed by a doctor in general practice&mdash;he is not a dispensary doctor&mdash;that he has had the experience of being called to treat a coronary case which had arisen by reason of the fact that the dispenser at the local dispensary had given a drug as an alternative to the drug prescribed by the dispensary doctor. This is an extremely serious situation. We know that doctors can bury their mistakes, and apparently the bureaucrats can also bury them, if it is a case of life or death.  We are alarmed that the drugs and medicines services are to be limited by the bureaucrats who have not got the professional responsibility which morally lies upon the doctor.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned that the further development of our health services as proposed in the White Paper will give us a continuation of a class service.  This is spelled out in several parts of the White Paper.  We are told at page 10 that our present health service is the system operated by the poor law guardians.  On page 12 we are referred to the classes which were entitled to benefit under the Health Act, 1953.  On page 13 we are told that so far as the medical services are concerned, we have three different classifications, the lower-income, the middle-income and the higher income.  These are called groups, but calling them groups does not get away from the fact that they are classes, with all the unsavoury relationships which that word has.  On page 34 we are referred to classes.  We are to have a classification not only in our medical services but also for the drugs and medicines to be provided and we think this is a most unsuitable basis on which to plan for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a suitable legislative framework for co-operative societies known as credit unions.  The provisions of the Bill follow generally the recommendations of the Committee on Co-operative Societies, the Chairman of which was the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  A credit union is defined in section 2 of the Bill as a co-operative society consisting of individuals having a common bond and formed for the purpose of promoting thrift among the members, creating a source of credit for them at a fair and reasonable rate of interest and using and controlling their savings for their mutual benefit.  This kind of financial institution is well known in other parts of the world as a special form of co-operative effort and there is a widespread demand for its legalisation in this country.</P>
      <P>The development of the credit union movement is set out in the report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies and it is hardly necessary for me to go into detail on that particular aspect of the matter; a brief outline of this story may, however, be of interest to the House.  The first co-operative credit society was founded in Germany in 1849 for the purpose of combating usury.  Societies of this kind spread rapidly on the Continent but it was not until 1900 that the first North American equivalent was set up in Quebec.  Enabling legislation was enacted in that province in 1906 and the credit union idea quickly spread in Canada.  Many Deputies will be familiar with the story of Monsignor Coady whose efforts to solve the economic difficulties of the people of Nova Scotia in the late twenties and early thirties have found a special place in the history of co-operative endeavour.  This resourceful and practical man made good use of credit unions in his fight against poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first United States Credit Union Law was passed in 1909 by the State of Massachusetts.  By 1934 credit <Col N="1155" /> union laws had been passed in 39 of the United States and a Federal Credit Union Act became law in that year.  The United States credit unions also promoted in that year the Credit Union National Association and a mutual insurance society with the object of providing suitable services for credit unions.  The Credit Union National Association now promotes the credit union movement all over the world and one of its representatives visited Ireland in 1959 to give evidence before the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  In the credit union movement it is the practice for each country to have its own national league and, accordingly, the Credit Union League of Ireland was set up around this time and it was admitted to membership of the Credit Union National Association in November, 1961.</P>
    <P>To-day there are credit unions in all of the United States, in all provinces of Canada, in Central and South America, in certain Pacific countries and also in several European, African and Asian countries.  The movement has a total membership of about 30,000,000 persons and assets in the region of £5,000 million.  The total number of individual credit unions is about 50,000 and it will be seen from these figures that the average asset for each unit is about £100,000.</P>
    <P>I think it desirable also to give Deputies some idea of the history of somewhat similar bodies in this country.  Under the Friendly Societies Acts, special provision was made in the final quarter of the last century for the registration of societies formed for the purpose of creating funds by monthly or other subscriptions to be lent out to or invested for the members of the society.  From the point of view of administration and finance, societies formed for this purpose were on the whole extremely unsatisfactory, particularly in the case of non-agricultural loan societies.  In 1917 the authority for the registration of loan societies was withdrawn and substituted by a new one which was limited to societies formed to grant loans for agricultural purposes.  Since that time, therefore, it <Col N="1156" /> has not been permissible to register non-agricultural loan societies, but those which were established prior to August, 1917, were allowed to continue in business and there are now about 23 of them on the register with total membership of about 20,000 persons.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural credit societies, the first of these was formed in 1894 and was quickly followed by a large number of others.  In 1914 a Commission on co-operative credit drew attention to a number of inadequacies in the operations of these societies.  They put forward certain recommendations to rectify the position, but war broke out before any action could be taken on their report. A later Commission on Agriculture endorsed these recommendations in an interim report on credit which was issued in 1923.  In 1927, however, the Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up under the Agricultural Credit Act of that year and this, in effect, put an end to the establishment of further societies of this kind in the private sphere.  No new agricultural credit societies have been registered under the Friendly Societies Acts since 1928 and there are now only seven such societies actually operating.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 125 of their report, the recent Committee on Co-operative Societies stated that having considered the whole question they were of opinion that savings and loan societies conducted on the credit union plan, with proper safeguards, would be a useful form of co-operative effort.  They pointed out, however, that with the withdrawal of the statutory authority in 1917 for the formation of loan societies other than those in the agricultural sphere, various legal difficulties stand in the way of the formation of credit unions in this country.  They recommended, accordingly, that the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts should be suitably amended in order to make provision for the registration of credit unions.  In paragraph 128 of their report, they set out in some detail the kind of provisions which they feel should apply to credit unions.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs 129 and 130 of their <Col N="1157" /> report the Committee dealt with the question of supervision of credit unions.  They recommended that in any legislation to deal with these societies provision should be made for supervision by some authority other than the individual societies.  This should involve, they felt, an annual inspection and intermittent surprise inspections and also instruction and organisational assistance.  The aim should be to have supervision provided by a representative organisation as soon as possible but in the early stages the cost might, they thought, have to be borne by the State.</P>
    <P>Since the report was published, the credit union movement has expanded rapidly in this country, mainly through the work of the Credit Union League of Ireland.  There are, at present, some 136 credit unions here with assets well in excess of £1 million.  Individual unions which wish to become affiliated to the League must comply with the League's requirements.  It is the intention of the League to employ suitably qualified personnel whose jobs it will be to make the kind of inspections, annual and surprise, which were envisaged in the report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  The need for interim supervisory arrangements on the part of the State has, therefore, been obviated as the ideal form of control by a representative organisation on the lines which the committee had in mind is now developing.</P>
    <P>On this question of supervision, I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the three reservations which were appended to the report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  Two of these reservations are fiatly opposed to the idea of State intervention; the third, which was put down by a credit union representative, expresses doubt about the value of State subventions to credit unions.  I agree with the general tenor of these reservations and have drawn up this Bill on the basis that the credit union movement should be allowed to regulate its own affairs as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Credit Union League of Ireland with the assistance of the international credit <Col N="1158" /> union organisations will keep a watchful eye on all credit union activities in this country and that it can be relied upon to take all necessary steps to protect the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless the unhappy history of credit societies in this country in the past suggests that any legislation dealing with organisations of this kind which handle money should be tightly drawn and should be provide ample powers to deal with any undesirable situation that may arise.  It will be noted that the Bill does, in fact, contain many such provisions.  Apart from detailed safeguards and restrictions of one kind or another which are interspersed throughout the Bill, Deputies will note the specific provision in section 12 for the establishment by each credit union of a supervisory committee.  The function of this committee is to oversee the activities of the directors and other officers, and the manner in which this function is to be discharged is set out in section 17.</P>
    <P>There are ample clauses designed to ensure that the supervisory committee will be independent of the other officers of the credit union and will be in a position to carry out its duties adequately. I should also like to draw attention to section 27 of the Bill which provides for the establishment by me of the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  This will be a body of persons having a knowledge of accountancy and other matters of significance in relation to credit unions who will keep an eye on developments in this field and advise me as to any action I should take to safeguard the interests of the public in this sphere.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from section 35 that the powers to which I could resort in making any such regulations are very comprehensive.  Normally, I would not think it desirable to seek such wide powers from the Oireachtas but in this particular case I think it is important that I should have authority to deal speedily with any situation that may arise by means of regulations.  One of the most important items in section 35 is paragraph (c) of subsection (1); this <Col N="1159" /> paragraph enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Credit Union Advisory Committee, to take a more direct part in the auditing of credit unions if this should be demonstrated by experience to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also notice the power given by section 33 of the Bill to the Registrar of Friendly Societies to petition the High Court for an order to wind up a credit union if it is unable to pay its debts or wilfully violates the provisions of the law.  I think it no harm to mention here too that the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, into which this Bill is being written, already contains a number of provisions which will assist in ensuring proper supervision of the activities of credit unions.  Section 20 of that Act will require each credit union to submit an annual return in a prescribed form.  Under section 18 of that Act, there is provision for the inspection of the books of a society by an accountant or actuary appointed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, while section 50 provides for a full investigation of the affairs of a society.  Finally, the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1913 requires every society to have its accounts audited by public auditors appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to refer to the other provisions of the Bill as these will be the subject of closer examination on Committee Stage.  To a substantial extent, the Bill is modelled on the legislation prevailing in other countries where the credit union movement has been a success and where failures have been rare.  A considerable amount of technical drafting difficulty was encountered in fitting legislation on these lines into the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts.  This has given rise to some delay in producing the Bill, but I am satisfied that we now have before us a set of provisions which will provide a suitable basis for regulating the affairs of credit unions in accordance with the principles accepted internationally in relation to those bodies.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, I think, to say that <Col N="1160" /> though we expect the spread of credit unions to give rise to increased savings which will help in the fulfilment of our plans for economic development, the credit union movement must be regarded as being of social as well as economic significance.  The object of the movement is to bring people together in co-operative endeavour so that they may help each other by pooling their financial resources.  Participation in enterprises of this kind has prevented many people from falling into the clutches of moneylenders or getting into difficulty through over-involvement in hire purchase commitments.</P>
    <P>Apart from this particular aspect of providing alternative sources of credit at fair and reasonable rates of interest, it has been found that by taking part in the management of a body such as a credit union, the members gain an insight into the meaning and purpose of money, and their understanding of the workings of the economic system is greatly improved.  Most important of all, perhaps, people who come together like this to help each other through their own efforts develop that independence of outlook which is such a refreshing feature of the co-operative movement, particularly nowadays with the prevailing tendency to seek State assistance for so many activities.</P>
    <P>I presume that it is for these reasons that the credit union movement has always held the interest of churchmen. From the very begining, the Credit Union Movement has had a socio-religious background, but at the same time it seems to have been free from any element of sectarianism.  I understand, in fact, that in many parts of the world the organisations promoting this form of co-operative self-help have included representatives of diverse religious denominations who have worked together in the greatest harmony to achieve the aims of the union movement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that the late President Kennedy of the United States, where credit unions have had a long and happy history, was an admirer of the credit union movement. His messages of support and encouragement <Col N="1161" /> are cherished by credit union people all over the world.  Our own President, too, has given his support to the movement and a message which he transmitted to the International Credit Union Year in 1962 pointed out that &ldquo;the encouragement of thrift and the provision of credit for desirable objects is of the greatest individual, local and national benefit&rdquo;.  I might mention here, too, the message conveyed in 1958 by the Secretary of State to Pope Pius XII in which it is stated that &ldquo;the Holy Father could not fail to derive comfort from the knowledge of the meritorious achievements, both economic and social, of the credit union movement in pursuance of the laudable purposes for which it was founded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the House, I think it is my duty to state that I fully realise the element of risk involved in permitting relatively un-skilled persons to handle substantial amounts of money.  I am satisfied, however, that if we maintain a sufficiently careful watch, it will be possible to take corrective action in time if anything should appear to be going wrong, and this Bill contains all the necessary powers to this end.  In any event, all the authorities associated with the credit union movement are satisfied that if this risk were measurable in terms of evil, it would be very insignificant indeed in comparison with the very substantial amount of good which the enactment of this Bill will make possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The credit union movement in Ireland has not yet become countrywide but it has made an impact in various parts and in my view, it is spreading all over the Twenty-Six Counties to the stage at which there will be a credit union in almost every parish.  In my own parish, I am a director of our credit union and I know the good being done by it.  We must accept, of course, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, that if we are to have an organisation dealing in other people's money, and in very large sums of money as expansion takes place, we must have governing legislation, just as we must have a <Col N="1162" /> Companies Act or all the extremely complex legislation which we have in relation to the various movements that exist within our society.  Therefore a Credit Union Bill is necessary and it is necessary that this House should regard it as a most important measure because of the expansionist nature of the movement.</P>
      <P>The fact that before the end of this decade we may have credit unions in every parish means that there will be a variation in the degrees of efficiency within the different credit unions.  This is another feature which must be taken into account and must be the subject of this legislation so that those who invest their money, those who give it into credit unions so that their neighbours may borrow, or they themselves may borrow when their time of need arises, can be assured that that money is as safe as if it were in a bank or any other financial institution governed by the most comprehensive legislation which has been passed in this House over the years.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement within the community is really the pooling of resources on the basis that money in the sock does nobody any good.  The need for money for the family or for the individual varies from time to time as purchases of capital goods, of furniture or, indeed, even of consumer goods, varies according to need at any time.  The ability of a group in a parish to lend money to somebody who needs a new milking machine means that he can pay for it with a fixed sum from his monthly pay cheque.  It means that when he is going to buy it, he has a bargaining power that he would certainly not have if he were dealing with an ordinary hire-purchase company, or the company selling or installing the machine and providing the capital over an extended period.  This bargaining power can be considerable when one considers that there is perhaps 25 per cent or 33? per cent profit on this machine and the man with money in his hand can save as much as 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the cost when the credit union provides the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to say that the credit union will not charge him interest.  As <Col N="1163" /> credit unions expand, the position in the past has been that they have found that their honorary secretaries could no longer deal with all the work and they had to employ people to deal with the expanding turnover.  It is through the payment of interest that the opportunity is provided for the borrower to borrow again when his need arises for a second time.  As I said, there is a great necessity for safeguarding those who place their money in credit unions and this legislation will provide that safeguard.  It is extremely detailed legislation, and if I were to say something which might be regarded as a criticism, it is that, in my view, the Bill should have been accompanied by an explanatory memorandum.  It is not a very difficult Bill to understand but many of the provisions relate to provisions and sections in other Acts which have already passed through here and it would have helped Deputies considerably, and the Opposition Parties, if such an explanatory memorandum had been provided.</P>
    <P>Another facet of this legislation is that directors and members of credit unions all over the country are intensely interested in this Bill.  Many of these people have not had experience of legislation such as most Deputies have had.  For instance, three Catholic curates who are directors of credit unions in their parishes, asked me to get them copies of the Bill.  I am sure that these good men would have gained a greater knowledge from their first reading of the Bill, and would have been in a better position to contact their Deputies and make representations, if an explanatory memorandum had been issued as well.</P>
    <P>Another great advantage of credit unions is that when a borrower gets money, while he may pay a slightly higher rate of interest than he would pay to a bank manager, there is no signature required, no surety sought and there is also something which is of great value, that is, that if he dies, his debt is wiped out.  This is something which, in a small rural parish such as the one I live in, is of great comfort to a man who will be in the bargaining <Col N="1164" /> position of being able to buy a television set and who knows, that even if he is incurring a debt of £60 or £70, if he dies, his wife will then own the television set and that any indebtedness he has will be wiped out.  This seems to me to be one of the best features of the movement.  I do not want to expand on the other insurance features which are there as well but there are many and the fact that a debt is wiped out is one of the best among them.</P>
    <P>Mention is made of the fact that credit unions are non-religious and that persons of diverse religious denominations are among their members and are actively participating directors and members.  That has been the experience in my part of the country.  We have in our parish members of the different denominations coming into the credit unions seeking to do good for the people, whatever church they go to on Sunday.  This is an excellent thing and something which I hope will be preserved. I am not a very religious man but I think that the coming together of all these denominations within this movement is something that is of immense value.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a Bill that should pass through the Dáil tonight or one that should not have a long and detailed examination on Committee Stage.  It is a Bill we have to look at. It is not long since it was introduced and it came to us at a time when many of us were reading volumes of material in regard to the Budget that will be introduced tomorrow.  I feel that the Committee Stage should be delayed for a week or two and that after that there should be an opportunity for giving it a detailed examination.  There is also the point that those involved in the credit union movement should have the opportunity of examining the Bill and making representations not only to the Minister but also to individual Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Donegan, I think it was a mistake that an explanatory memorandum was not issued with this Bill because it is pretty long and of some detail.  Having said that, I think Deputy Donegan will <Col N="1165" /> agree with me that this is one of the simplest pieces of legislation on a matter of this kind introduced in this House.  For that reason, those who drafted this Bill are to be congratulated. Engrossed as we are in the health documents and Budget literature, we do not have as much time as we should like and therefore the draftsmen are to be congratulated on producing a measure which is not ambiguous.</P>
      <P>I regard this measure as the first official recognition of this great and worthwhile credit union movement.  It has been growing in recent years. Though not a member, I had occasion to visit the offices of a credit union recently.  Prior to my visit, I read up some of its history, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred today, and became more and more enamoured of it as I read more and more about it.  Even though the legislation is absolutely necessary, it is apparent that those who have formed credit unions have appointed as directors, secretaries and so forth, very reputable people.  We do not know if in the history of the credit union movement during the past seven or eight years anything went wrong but those who are members of the movement would be the first to agree this legislation is necessary.  In fact, there has been a clamour in some quarters to have the legislation we now see before us. During Committee Stage, I shall have more to say on it but it does not seem to be an undue interference with the detailed, ordinary affairs of the credit unions.  All the necessary precautions are there for the ordinary individual and that, I assume, is the main purpose of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, like the Parliamentary Secretary and the previous speaker, I should like to add my words of praise to the credit unions in this country for their efforts in the promotion of thrift. This movement seems to have succeeded in inducing people to save where many Government institutions have failed.  This is saving with a difference.  It is not just the ordinary business of putting in money and getting a rate of interest.  This, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, has other functions, other purposes which <Col N="1166" /> are desirable.  One of our shortcomings, in recent years particularly, has been the reluctance of our people to save.  As an aside, may I say there has not been any inducement in this country to people to save because the usual method is through the Post Office, and if one has regard to the fact that the 2½ per cent interest rate offered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has not changed for donkey's years, one readily understands the reluctance of small holders to save.</P>
    <P>This is a movement in which they can both save and borrow.  It is a movement&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary touched on it briefly&mdash;of an educational character as well because it sets out to teach people about money.  One of the principal defects in the makeup of the Irishman or Irishwoman has been the lack of knowledge of money. We are said by economists.  We may have our suspicions of whether they are giving us the right advice, but both Ministers of the Government and laymen alike must take their advice.  Here is an organisation pledged to teach members about finance generally, particularly about investment, and for that reason the movement deserves the support of the House and the country.  I assume also that members will be taught about investment.</P>
    <P>This country, particularly in the past year or two, has been crying out for investment of money.  It is not any great secret that there is a lot of money in this country which is not doing any work.  People have saved money at home, people still keep it under the mattress or in the thatch and they might as well have so many pebbles for all the use it is.  If they want to do a service to the country and to themselves, they should invest that money.  They should be urged to get the money into National Loan, the Post Office or into State or semi-State organisations who will make the money work not alone for the individuals concerned but for the country. I believe there is a lot of undisclosed money in the country which could be put to many useful purposes.</P>
    <P>This credit union movement helps people to help themselves.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1167" /> Secretary referred to the difficulties people often get into because of hire purchase commitments and moneylenders.  Everything in the credit union movement as far as borrowing is concerned is above board.  It lends at reasonable rates of interest.  It concerns itself with people of integrity and character, as Deputy Donegan has told us.  For instance, if a single young man in a reasonable job wants to buy a motor cycle or an autocycle&mdash;some semi-luxury article&mdash;he will be facilitated by a credit union.  He does not have to have security.  In this country it seems that when one approaches a bank or any similar institution for a loan one must show oneself to be a man of means before a loan is advanced. This is one of the defects in our social fabric and it affects the agricultural industry particularly.</P>
    <P>A farmer knows what happens when he approaches an organisation like the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It appears that no farmer will approach the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan if he has not financial resources of his own.  When he goes, he is asked immediately for two names as securities.  He is asked to show what property he owns.  Therefore, the example set by the credit union could be well followed by many of the lending institutions in this country. They take a man for what he is, not for what he has.  It is one of the outstanding features of the credit union movement.  If a man shows integrity and character, he should be advanced money for a useful purpose.  The idea of giving a loan to a man for what he is, for his character and integrity, could well be copied by many State and semi-State lending organisations.  In this measure, there is adequate protection for shareholders' money.  There would seem to be very many safeguards, all of them adequate, for that sort of protection.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us a little more about an application for membership and, say, a subsequent refusal.  Section 5 gives anyone refused membership the right of appeal to the District Court. <Col N="1168" /> Is this an innovation or does it apply in respect of the ordinary co-operative society?  On what basis will the person be judged by the District Court?  Will it again be his known integrity or otherwise?  Who is going to give evidence for or against him?  In an ordinary creamery co-operative society, have the directors and members the right to refuse membership and, if so, has the person so refused the right of appeal to the District Court?</P>
    <P>Section 6 lays down the rules of a credit union and gives certain guidelines. I would like to know if these rules are to be of general application or may separate rules be made for each branch?  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say why it was decided in section 22 that dividends are not to exceed ten per cent.  I am sure it is not a figure he pulled out of a hat and I would like to know is there any particular significance in the ten per cent. In section 23 there is a requirement that ten per cent of surplus funds be put to reserves.  I do not question the principle of that but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say why that particular amount was fixed.</P>
    <P>Section 27 allows the Minister to establish a credit union advisory committee. Is this also part of legislation in other countries?  I can see the desirability of it but I would like to know if it is an innovation here or is it in other countries as well.  The Minister has power to appoint seven members, not less than two of which will be accountants.  He is also given power to appoint the chairman.  I do not know what the functions of the chairman will be.  It would be right to assume, however, that the seven persons whom the Minister appoints would be quite capable of choosing their own chairman.  I do not say there is anything sinister in the Minister taking this power.  Maybe he has some person with special qualifications in view.</P>
    <P>I would like also to have an idea of what the remuneration of the members will be.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to justify the payment of the members of this committee. I say that not to suggest they <Col N="1169" /> should not be paid but merely as a method of having the Parliamentary Secretary say what their functions will be and how much of their time will be taken up by this.  We have a variety of advisory committees here.  In the majority of cases, the members' fees are £400 or £500 per year.  But this is another little burden which I assume will have to be paid by the taxpayer. If the members are paid £600 or £500 per year and the chairman £1,000 or £2,000, that will be another little addition to the tax burden.  I am not opposed to the idea of paying them&mdash; I would be if these were purely nominal positions&mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary should tell us what the remuneration will be and what amount of their time will be taken up by this.</P>
    <P>Section 35 caused me some concern. This is the dangerous section in any Act of Parliament.  However, let me say for those who drafted this Bill that it does not appear to be as dangerous as other pieces of legislation introduced. Usually the section on regulations is general and vague, giving the Minister power to do almost anything at any time.  In this Bill the Minister may make regulations in respect of 12 activities in which a credit union may be involved.  I do not think one could take exception to any of them. However, they need some explanation, particularly subsection (g), which gives the Minister power to prescribe the investments, including investments other than those permitted by section 38 of the Principal Act, in which a credit union may invest its funds.  I do not know the usual places they invest now.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Donegan do.  I feel this needs a little more explanation. Are they to be confined to Government loans, investment in Government projects and such things?  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us the information, if not when replying then on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not see in this Bill&mdash;maybe I have missed it&mdash;a requirement that the rules and constitution of the union be given to everyone who becomes a <Col N="1170" /> shareholder.  This is elementary in the trade union movement.  Every member of my union must get the book of rules when he becomes a member.  I think it desirable to have a provision in the Bill to the effect that shareholders must be furnished with not alone a shareholding certificate but with the book of rules.  In that way they can see what their entitlements are, what the functions of the directors and so on are, what rights they have of appeal to the District Court or to the Minister and what rights they have to consult or lodge complaint with the advisory committee.  The remaining matters of detail may be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice in welcoming this Bill.  This legislation will now give the confidence necessary for any group of people who set themselves up to foster saving.  One of the greatest things needed in this country is education in money matters for our people, and in this movement we have the answer.  In view of the increasing wealth of the country, it is necessary that all sources of wealth be tapped.  The ordinary person should realise there are more ways in which he can assist the economy than by simply lodging money in the Post Office.  Previous speakers made the old suggestion that the rate of interest in the Post Office Savings Bank should be increased.  I do not believe that such an increase would bring in greater saving.  The rate of interest is not the enticement for people to put money in the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With such a movement the ordinary people can be educated in financial matters.  There is evidence enough of the great need for this education from the large number of people who have got into difficulties through hire purchase. We have heard of many people getting into grave financial difficulties and of people even being forced to emigrate because of hire purchase commitments.  This credit union movement is a sign of the spirit of modern Ireland.  We have heard it said recently that Sinn Féin should be the call of 1966 as it was in 1916.  This movement is a Sinn Féin effort.  It is to help ourselves <Col N="1171" /> and an attempt to get away from the mentality of always looking to the Government for help, that the Government must provide money for this or for that.  I see great hopes of doing away with this attitude through the credit unions and of creating the spirit which is necessary if we are to achieve the aims set out in our economic programme.</P>
    <P>I am not myself a member of a credit union but it is a very strong movement in the city of Galway, and I have seen the tremendous benefit it has been to the people who have joined it.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use every opportunity available to him to advocate support for this credit union movement.  Therein lie great hopes for the future of this country, and I should like to see more of this spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome, particularly to the members of credit unions throughout the country. They feel it will put credit unions on a proper basis.  We are very lucky in Kilkenny that a credit union has been established in the parish and the people there who established it are to be commended for the work they are doing for the general good of the people.  They have studied this Bill and advise me they have no great fault to find with it, although there may be a few matters to be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>They did suggest one or two things to which I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. Section 11 (6) says that a director or any member of a committee of a credit union cannot get a loan in excess of the sum of the nominal value of the shares and deposits in the credit unions.  They feel that would be an embarrassment to any man who is appointed a director of a credit union. Other members, I understand, could get a loan up to ten per cent of the total assets, but apparently a director is not in that position.  An amendment should be introduced on Committee Stage in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point is that a director <Col N="1172" /> can hold office only for three years. The chairman should be allowed to hold office for at least four years in order to preserve continuity in the board of directors.  These men are doing very good work in Kilkenny and there has not been one defaulter since the credit union started some years ago.  I attended their annual meeting as a guest recently and I was very much impressed by the way the business was conducted.  Section 35 (b) requires:</P>
    <P>... a credit union to take out insurance of a specified type in relation to the loans, deposits or shares of the members.</P>
    <P>I understand the money has to be sent out to America for the purpose of insurance.  There is no insurance company in Ireland or in England prepared to take up that business.  I would suggest the Government should enable some insurance company in the country to handle this type of business, and I should be glad if that point were looked into.  I know that in the hands of the men who are in Kilkenny &mdash;and I am sure it is much the same in every other area&mdash;the credit union will expand in future years.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this measure.  The credit union movement has grown in this country to a large extent over the past number of years.  In the initial stages, it was slow to start but now it is growing very strongly.  This Bill is to be welcomed at this particular time because it endorses the Government's recognition of the movement. It also safeguards those who put their money into credit unions and those who borrow money from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Crotty has said, the credit union movement in Kilkenny has grown considerably in the last number of years, all by a completely voluntary effort on the part of dedicated men and women who are prepared to spend their free time, free Saturdays and free Sundays in some cases, for the good of the community. The credit union has helped young people getting married to buy furniture and other equipment.  It has helped family men to educate their <Col N="1173" /> children and to buy school books and other incidentals.  It has also helped old people in their time of need.</P>
    <P>There are a few points that would be more proper to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  That is why I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept Deputy Donegan's suggestion to have the Committee Stage put back for at least a week, if not two weeks.  The Bill has come fairly quickly upon us and upon the credit unions in their localities. I am aware that the people who are at the head of the credit unions knew of the general principles that were going to be outlined in the legislation, but the ordinary member of a credit union will not know about this possibly until he reads about it in the papers tomorrow.  I feel, on this account, that the Committee Stage should not be taken for at least another week or even two weeks.</P>
    <P>There is one section I would like to refer to at this stage, that is, the section dealing with the appointment of an advisory committee.  I refer to section 27.  I should like to know what type of people will be on this committee? There is some indication in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement. There is also a subsection in this section which gives power to appoint two accountants.  I am greatly suspicious of those committees because it has been the practice, by successive Governments, to appoint people to committees for reasons other than the fact they were experts in a particular field.  It would be a pity if there were even one person on this committee who was not a man dedicated to the ideal of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>We have State companies run by people with private enterprise minds and we have co-operative societies and some of them are run by people with private enterprise minds.  We do not want to have the credit union advisory committee run by people with outlooks which would not concur with the outlook which the founders of the movement and those taking a part in it have. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to state, in more detail, what his <Col N="1174" /> intentions are in regard to section 27 because the working of the legislation will depend, to a large extent, on the personnel of this advisory committee. The whole success of the implementation of this legislation will depend on the advisory committee, naturally, so that the success of the whole movement will, in the final analysis depend on the personnel of this advisory committee. I want to stress that they should be dedicated men who believe in the credit union movement and who have experience of it, preferably those who have experience of it both as contributors to it and as people who benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department, when this Bill has been passed, would publish it in plain language in a small booklet that could be kept, say, in the inside pocket of a man's coat or even in a man's wallet.  A copy of the Bill in condensed form, should be made available, if necessary, so that it could be fitted into a man's wallet or carried in a lady's handbag and referred to at any time.  I will reserve, with those few remarks, more detailed remarks for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, by and large, is a Bill which has been pressed for by the credit union movement for several years past.  It may well be that it contains sections and provisions which are not entirely in keeping with the wishes of the credit union movement. Since the Bill was circulated, we have not had an opportunity of receiving from the credit union movement, and individual credit unions, their views on it.  It is very important that considerable time would be given to the credit union movement to study the Bill, to take advice on it and, if need be, to lobby their TD's and later their Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, it would be most undesirable if harm were done to the credit union movement by imposing on them legislation which they did not want, which unfairly or unnecessarily restricted them or which interfered with their operations in a way which those best in a position to know would consider as injurious to the interests of <Col N="1175" /> the credit union movement.  I share Deputy Crotty's concern that the credit union movement have difficulty in getting insurance companies to accept the insurance schemes which are part and parcel of the credit union movement. As a result, I think, something like ninepence per member, per year, has to go out of this country in respect of various forms of insurance specified in the Bill.  It may well be that insurance companies here have been reluctant to undertake the risk because, of course, all insurance constitutes a risk, until such time as credit unions are statutory bodies in relation to all financial operations.  I join with Deputy Crotty in exhorting the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the money is kept in the State.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that 136 credit unions now exist here.  If he knows, would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to tell us how many of those are, in fact, affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions?  I think there are a few independent bodies.  I do not know why they are in the country.  It would seem there is a great deal to be said for a form of national association because, I suppose, the problems of one are, to a great extent, the problems of all. Indeed, the very basis of credit unionism is that people would share each other's problems, responsibilities and risks.</P>
    <P>What is particularly attractive about the credit union movement is that it has created bonds where the common interests were somewhat uncertain. There is no place as lonely as a suburb of a large city, such as Dublin, particularly when people, who formerly had no common interest, coming from different parts of the city and different parts of the country, find themselves thrown together on a virgin piece of land in little concrete boxes that are suddenly put up.  The credit union movement stimulates in a neighbourhood which had not appreciated it before, a common interest.  That is a great thing for that neighbourhood. This far transcends any immediate advantages to individual members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> Like other Deputies, I have seen the advantages of credit union groups operating in my own constituency.  This constituency is made up, in the main, of the little concrete boxes to which I have referred.  It consists of places such as Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Drimnagh and Crumlin where the credit union movement, I am glad to say, has been in operation for several years. Deputy Donegan pointed out, in addition to the advantages I have already stated, that no surety is required in respect of a loan, debt liability is wiped out on the death of the person having the loan and discounts can be obtained by purchasing articles for cash rather than buying on hire purchase.  The credit union movement also had the advantage of bigger buying for their members, particularly in relation to coal and other commodities which we so frequently need in our climate.  I think it will perhaps accelerate the development of the credit union movement here to have this Bill but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to rush it.  There is plenty of time; it has been in the course of production for several years and a few months of processing this Bill in the House and in the Senate would be advantageous.</P>
    <P>May I say I am somewhat alarmed at section 35 which gives the Minister power to make regulations?  We can appreciate that we cannot perhaps in this day and age fix everything as perfectly as we might in the light of experience but we have in several sections of this Bill particularly set out limits of time, limits of finance, limits of interest and so on.  But in section 35 we as much as say: &ldquo;It doesn't matter what is in this Bill; the Minister can do anything he likes&rdquo;, while at paragraph (i) of that section we find that the Minister may alter in any way he wishes from time to time the financial or time limits prescribed by every section of the Bill.  We write into the Bill several limitations and then we say: &ldquo;But the Minister can change them willy-nilly as often as he wants from time to time.&rdquo;  I think that is undesirable.  Either the legislative powers or limits are necessary or they are not and we should not go to the extent of specifying limits here which <Col N="1177" /> people will assume are the operative ones, when, for all we know, they may be inoperative by reason of the frequency of changes made in regulations.</P>
    <P>I was wondering why section 32 was in the Bill at all but I suppose this is probably a rule of the credit union movement; that is the one which provides that a credit union may not advertise directly or indirectly in a newspaper or other periodical publication, or on radio or television.  I do not know whether that applies to a particular credit union or to the credit union movement.  I suppose it applies to a particular credit union and it occurred to me that the justification for it was probably that the very basis of the credit union movement is that there may be a common bond and that it probably would not be necessary to advertise, except, perhaps, in a periodical publication published by a particular employer, a body of employers or a body of employees. Subsection (2) of section 32 could preclude advertising in a publication by a residents' association or a tenants' association.</P>
    <P>For instance, there are large areas in Dublin in which people regard themselves as having a common bond, areas like Ballyfermot, which are as big as the city of Waterford.  The city of Waterford may have its own newspaper or may circulate in adjoining areas or counties but it is essentially a local one.  If a residents' association had its own journal published from time to time, I think it would be desirable to advertise.  But having seen that limit and with that thought having occurred to me, it would seem to be prudent to put down an amendment to cover that kind of thing but then we see that the Minister may modify the Bill in any way he likes.  Either we consider it necessary to have that restriction or we do not.  But giving the Minister power to modify it goes to the point of excluding the provision altogether, contradicts the provision.  It is undesirable to pass legislation here saying that a certain thing should be done or should not be done and then saying that no matter what the Bill, <Col N="1178" /> the Minister may modify any of the provisions.</P>
    <P>Again, I support Deputy Crotty in the view of section 14, that it might be undesirable, particularly at the outset, to provide a limit for all officers.  If the consequences of that for a number of unions are that they will have a total change of directorship every three years, it would seem undesirable.  I do not know whether that is one of the sections which can be modified by the regulations I have been talking about, but, indeed looking at it quickly, I see it is.  This apparently is one of the things in respect of which the Minister can make modifying regulations.  But, at the outset, in order to ensure that there is some continuity, we should remove the obligation on all directors to retire after the first three years.  You could perhaps specify that the chairman should retire after three years, that the secretary should retire after four years and then after a certain period when you know that the directors have been elected at different times, you could then bring in a three-year rule which would ensure some degree of continuity, and prevent power slipping into the hands of some people without the prospect of change because nothing keeps anybody in authority on their toes so much as the prospect of change.</P>
    <P>Generally I think the Bill is a prudent one.  It is in accordance generally with the wishes of the credit union movement, with the wishes of Nora Herlihy and others who have done such marvellous voluntary work and who are deserving of every praise and approval which this House can give.  I know this is given by all Parties and I join, particularly with my Fine Gael colleagues, in welcoming this Bill and reiterating that we should like some little time to think about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows we are not a little distracted by whatever may be in tomorrow's Budget and our discussion of it in the coming weeks.  On that account it is undesirable that we should be trying to consider the framework of the credit union movement, when it is likely to be put in second place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just <Col N="1179" /> one or two comments I should like to make on this Bill.  Let me say at the outset that, as one who is a firm believer in the idea of co-operation and who has, on numerous occasions in this House, advocated the extension of co-operation, I welcome the Bill.  In fact, one of the remarkable weaknesses of the co-operative movement in this country has been the lack of development such as has taken place in other countries and particularly in the cases mentioned on page 1 of the Minister's statement, of Nova Scotia, and not merely in Nova Scotia, but in every country in the world where the credit union movement exists.  For some reason or other, very few of us have followed in line with the co-operative movement in this country.  I feel, however, that in view of the interest and the number of credit unions which have been formed here in recent years, this Bill will have the effect of further encouraging the establishment of these unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the city of Limerick, we have a credit union which was established by the Redemptorist Fathers and is organised by the confraternity attached to the Redemptorist Church.  This credit union, which has been in existence for the past four years, has been a tremendous success.  The idea of co-operative saving, co-operative credit, is an excellent one and has been approved all over the world.  It is a system which should suit very well the circumstances of this country, but I have often wondered why it was that the establishment of credit unions does not follow automatically the establishment of co-operatives in this country.  Muintir na Tíre tried to promote credit also. The progress one would like to see is not being made so I sincerely hope this Bill will have the effect of extending the credit union movement.  The question of control is important.  From what I have seen and read of credit unions, I believe State interference should be kept to a minimum because the whole idea of co-operation is a coming together of people to work together for some purpose.  Certain safeguards are necessary and I think <Col N="1180" /> those set out in the Bill are entirely adequate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I sincerely hope it will arouse a new interest in the idea of co-operative credit and lead to an expansion of this form of saving throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and to express the appreciation of the Minister and his advisers of the complimentary remarks made in regard to the drafting of the Bill.  It was not an easy task to fit this Bill within the framework of the parent Act and I think an excellent job has been done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, Deputy Ryan and, I think, Deputy Pattison also suggested that we should give some time before Committee Stage to enable the details of the Bill to be considered.  I suggest we leave it over for a period of three weeks.  I believe that should be adequate because for one thing the Credit Union League has been pressing very strongly since the report of the Committee on Co-Operative Societies was published, for the implementation of the recommendations in regard to credit unions.  In the second place, I think it is true to say that the report itself could fairly be described as a White Paper.  Thirdly, I want to assure the House that the Credit Union League at all stages of the preparation of this Bill have been fully aware of what was going on and indeed discussions in depth have been held at all stages, and more especially when certain proposals for different sections of the Bill from those normally obtaining internationally were put forward.  For those reasons I suggest that a period of three weeks would be sufficient and I hope Members of the House will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan who welcomed the Bill mentioned that the credit union movement has spread rapidly throughout the 26 counties.  In fact, it has spread rapidly throughout the 32 counties and that is a source of satisfaction to us.  Several Deputies, including Deputy Donegan, mentioned this matter of insurance and Deputy Crotty, I think, regretted the fact that the insurance <Col N="1181" /> is placed outside the country. In point of fact, the reason for this may be stated simply to be that an international association is able to offer insurance through the National Credit Union League here to the component parts at a rate which bears no relationship whatever to the rate at which it would otherwise be available locally. In other words, this is another facet of the international aspect of the work here, that the insurance should be placed at a figure with which local insurance could not compete.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned something which is very dear to my heart.  When he spoke of the lending of money, I think he had especially in mind lending money for agricultural purposes without security.  This applies particularly to small amounts.  It seems to me that the credit union movement has a very significant role to play from the agricultural point of view in regard to these small loans because they know the persons involved.  All members having a common bond in the same community, they know the person involved and have the security of their knowledge of him which is far better than any security a stranger could offer.</P>
    <P>I believe that the experience in regard to getting money back from unsecured loans of this nature will be very good.  I have always believed that if you know a person's back-ground, his general temperament and his record in regard to credit, then I think you know whether you should lend him money in the first instance and also know when and when not to require security.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that the credit union movement ought to release a lot of money which is now stuffed in mattresses throughout the country, and I sincerely hope it does.  So far as the one hundred odd unions existing to date are concerned, the evidence is that it does prise loose a good deal of money which otherwise would not come to light.  Indeed, I suggest it is not an idle boast to say this is one of the things of which the movement is particularly proud, that it unloosens a lot of money which would not otherwise become available and makes that <Col N="1182" /> money available to people without security.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the Post Office.  I suppose it would not be politic of me to say anything much about the rate of interest which the Post Office is paying to investors at present.  As the House knows, a Committee is sitting to consider this and related questions but I feel I would not be going too far if I suggested that one of the recommendations of the Committee will be that the rate of interest for Post Office Saving Bank investors should be increased.  Indeed this is relevant to this debate only in an indirect way and I do not think I am called upon to say any more in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked the number of unions in existence in the country which are not affiliated to the National League.  It is very hard to give an estimate of this.  The vast majority of those already in existence are affiliated to the League because it is obviously to their own advantage that they should be so affiliated because of the technical and other assistance which the League is already giving to the movement throughout the country and on its expansion, the greater assistance of one kind or another that it will be able to afford.  It is not possible to say exactly but the figure is possibly 12, 15 or 20 but not more than that, of existing credit unions where they are identified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also mentioned section 35 of the Bill.  This is the section in which the Minister is given power by regulation to amend certain provisions of the Act.  I share his misgivings with regard to the blanket subsection at the end.  I agree with him that it is neither good nor desirable that one should read through an Act and see what one regards as definitive, only to find some subsection tucked away towards the end that undoes that impression.  I undertake to have a very careful look at that particular part of section 35, although I am sure the House will agree that the necessity for having as much flexibility as possible is there.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that it is desirable that the Minister should <Col N="1183" /> have the power, by regulation, to make changes rapidly where they appear to be necessary.  I believe that the exercise of the Minister's powers on this occasion will, in practice, turn out to be quite small because the movement appears to be heading for a good rather than a dispiriting future.  However, I do think that the necessity for flexibility should be recognised and that the Minister should be given the broadest possible powers by regulation, to make such changes as his advisory committee may recommend.  One can go too far in this direction and, being a lawyer myself, I appreciate the purpose of Deputy Ryan's remarks and will keep them in mind when considering the section between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked another specific question about the second part of section 32.  In that respect, section 35 (k) gives power to the Minister to modify the requirements of section 32. That appears to cover that, although, again, we can have a look at it later on.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of section 14 and the advantages and disadvantages of a rigid prohibition against directors serving for more than three continuous years.  I think there is validity in this criticism and, between now and Committee Stage, I think we will introduce a suitable amendment to have regard to the desirability (a) of some form of continuity of service and (b) of not having a situation like that of chairmen of boards of the GAA who are there for, perhaps, 40 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned quite a number of detailed points with which, as he said himself, we might deal more aptly on Committee Stage.  He mentioned the ten per cent limit on the dividends and asked why the figure of ten per cent was arbitrarily fixed.  At a time when the Government are borrowing at seven per cent, it is necessary to cover that fact.  In any event, the figure is a maximum.  Its presence in the Bill does not preclude a credit union from lending at whatever <Col N="1184" /> rate might seem advisable from time to time.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corish, also, who asked whether advisory committees as we envisage them in section 27, are operating in other countries. The answer to that question is in the affirmative.  In the United States and in other parts of the world, a similar advisory committee is in operation. Obviously, we shall have to pay the members of this committee.  I think it is more than desirable that we should do so because otherwise I do not think we would get people to work in what will turn out to be, in effect, a permanent working party.  Obviously, the members of that working party will be drawn partly from the chief body in Ireland, the Credit Union League, and partly from other interests.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Pattison will not have to make any comments on the lines of those he made this evening, which he put with considerable finesse and which I understood perfectly.  I want to assure him that I shall try to ensure that those who are nominated to this committee will have an obvious reason for their appointment.</P>
    <P>One of the things that the Credit Union League are there to do is to bring out, in handbook form, a book of rules and also a brief statement, for the benefit of the members, of the main rights, privileges and obligations enshrined in the Bill, when it is enacted.  I do not know if it would be feasible or even desirable to put the whole Act into a handbook.  I think one can rely on the League who will have the experience of other countries to help them to produce a handbook which will not leave out anything of significance with regard to the rights, duties and obligations of the members.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about refusal of membership and whether the provision in the section, which gives a person the right to go to the district court, is or is not a new one.  In fact, it is new. In the 1893 Act, the person who is refused by the registrar had to go to the High Court.  For various reasons we consider that this would place too great a burden on the person involved. We consider that, at this stage, anyate <Col N="1185" /> way &mdash; having regard to the cost of High Court proceedings about a matter even as technically easy as this &mdash; the district court is the right and proper tribunal while, at the same time, the right is preserved to appeal to the High Court in the event of a point of law arising.</P>
    <P>In my limited experience of the credit union movement and practice, one of the greatest advantages of it is that it encourages people, more especially in country towns, to spend their money in their own region.  The word &ldquo;regional&rdquo; is mentioned in the Bill as an example of a common bond.  Nothing is more important &mdash; for the country areas, anyway &mdash; than this emphasis on the regional aspect of this co-operative movement.  It has always been a source of annoyance and astonishment to me that people living in small rural towns spend such a vast proportion of their money in Dublin or Cork or some other place rather than at home.  One of the features of the credit union movement is that it has finally brought home to people the desirability of remembering that charity begins at home.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank all the speakers in this debate for welcoming the Bill.  I hope that, when the Committee Stage is reached in three weeks time, we shall not, in the meantime, have been too obsessed with irrelevant matters such as the Budget.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate that has just concluded on the Credit Union Bill dovetails perfectly into the debate on the health services.  The principle is exactly the same: it is one of mutual help.  That is the principle underlying Fine Gael health policy as distinct from the Government's policy which is one of creating classes or divisions and projecting them into the future, divisions which were regarded as respectable in Victorian ages but which we do not regard as having any proper application to our needs today.  We find utterly unacceptable the evidence, which the Minister says he has, which to him indicates that hardship is seldom caused in the middle income group through family doctor's bills.  If it be that hardship is seldom caused it is because in many cases people do not undertake the liability of family doctor bills.  They avoid that hardship feeling they are not in a position to bear the cost.  Not infrequently a breadwinner or a mother postpones medical attention. It is not an irregular thing for an adult with family responsibility to put off consulting a doctor hoping the ailment will pass or else they endeavour to cure it by being their own home doctor.  In a significant proportion of cases this leads to ultimate hospitalisation. It is in order not to impose on families the necessity to postpone medical attention that we in Fine Gael have been advocating that to be a worthy one a medical service should include people who were formerly excluded and whom the Minister seeks to exclude in the system he regards as an advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says in the same paragraph as he evidences that no hardships exist, that it is his intention not to include these people within the ranks of those <Col N="1187" /> who will enjoy medical services in future free of charge in respect of a particular service.  The Minister says it is intended that better and more formal arrangements should be made to assist persons in the middle income group in obtaining drugs where undue expense arises.  I am considerably worried about the interpretations that can be put on this.  &ldquo;More formal arrangements&rdquo; may mean that help in the provision of drugs and medicines will be given if and when expenditure on drugs and medicine exceeds a specific figure.  I think the Minister in his introductory remarks or on some other occasion said it was his intention to provide that where expenses on medicines and drugs went above a certain ceiling help would be forth-coming.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the level of this ceiling should vary according to the number of dependants and according to the length of time a person's income may be reduced through illness or injury. Perhaps the Minister proposes to provide for all these things in his regulations but we have the fear, enlightened by experience, that no matter how well-intended the regulations are some people will be outside their scope and some harm will be done because ceilings will be fixed too low.  We appreciate that the present system has been unsatisfactory in more ways than one and for a service to be successful it must be easy to use and clearly understood by those intended to benefit under it.  I am certain that our present health service is not easily understood nor easy to make use of.  It is not even understood by public representatives who are members of health authorities. I suppose we must try to avoid that situation in future but the danger is that once we begin fixing regulations the Department of Health like the Department of Social Welfare will become a purely accounting agency, forgetting that its primary purpose is to relieve human misery, and that it will be obsessed by the obligation that lies on every public authority to render a true and exact account according to the letter of the law, and that such concern will get priority over what <Col N="1188" /> should be an equal concern, the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>We are glad that at long last it is proposed to make improvements in the district nursing service so as to provide free of charge to a larger number of people home nursing services for the aged and chronic sick. Again, this is to be one of the three classes which now exist in relation to health services.  We think the home nursing service if limited to aged and chronic sick will be insufficient.  Many family problems arise particularly in large urban centres where the spirit of good-neighbourliness does not operate, not because people are not charitably inclined, but because they do not know their neighbours' problems.  The result is that frequently in these centres mothers of young families neglect to look after themselves medically and hesitate about lying up in bed, as they might be medically advised to do, because there is nobody to look after the children or themselves while the mother is confined to bed and the father at work.</P>
    <P>It is highly desirable to have a nursing service available so that in cases where mothers of families find themselves, through illness or injury confined to bed, a nurse or home service is available to look after the children. At present what not infrequently happens is that if such a crisis comes upon a family in an urban centre and there is no relative available to come and stay in the home the children are put in institutions or in reformatories, which is unfair to the children and to the mother.  It does not help the mother because she is worrying about the children and the children are worried about the absence of their parents.  I should like to see an extension of the home nursing service to provide for people in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in paragraph 61, on page 38 of the White Paper, that &ldquo;Treatment of defects found at school health examinations is similarly free, whatever the parents' means.&rdquo;  I should like to think that was always so but I have brought a case to the Minister's attention which he is going to look into and I would be very interested <Col N="1189" /> as to the outcome.  Certainly in relation to some of the defects found at school health examinations in the Dublin area, the parents have been charged with the cost of maintaining children in institutions for the treatment of their defects and such charges have been imposed after an examination as to means.  I have known of cases of this kind and it is undesirable that this should be so.  Perhaps the health authority has made a mistake and if so, I hope it will soon be corrected.  I would urge, if a mistake has been made, that refunds be made in all cases in which charges have been made.</P>
    <P>The cases to which I am particularly referring are those relating to mental retardation in children who require to be educated in special institutions. These institutional services have not been made available to all parents in the Dublin area and this is not as was intended, as far as we know.  We are glad that the abominable and irritating charges of 7/6 for an X-ray and 2/6 for other visits to the out-patient department are being abolished.  They should never have been imposed.  We are told that the amount collected last year under this heading was £48,000.  I do not know what the cost of administration was but I imagine that when the cost of administration and the inconvenience caused to the sick and to the hospital authorities are added, the gain would be negligible and certainly not commensurate with the revenue secured.</P>
    <P>It is clearly indicated that this White Paper &ldquo;The Health Services and Their Further Development&rdquo; is a political document.  That is indicated by the fact that in all of this book, which consists of 67 pages and 133 paragraphs, only one paragraph is given to the only advance in our health approach for several decades past.  I refer of course to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  That Board was vigorously attacked by the Fianna Fáil Party when it was set up, just as the Fine Gael health policy was also vigorously attacked.  When legislative proposals were brought in, the Fianna Fáil Party still said they could not understand it and that the scheme <Col N="1190" /> would collapse.  It is interesting to note that the same kind of remarks were made about the same health policy ever since 1957.  We were told that it would be utterly impossible to abolish the dispensary system, that it had to be retained, and that no modification was possible.  Now, nine years later, we find that some modification is permissible.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme has been a great success and what we in the Fine Gael programme, in the great O'Higgins social reform, seek to achieve is to extend to all the community, irrespective of means, the benefits now available under that scheme.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister is pleased with the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and also pleased to note that the board continues to improve its benefits and is now considering an extension of its field of activity so as to offer protection against abnormal medical expenses outside hospital. One wonders if the Minister pondered on why the board is considering this.  As I understand it, there are two reasons.  One is to improve the service which is available, but in addition, to reduce the rate of hospitalisation which exists under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and the system under which the benefits are available only in the event of hospitalisation. This has led to doctors inquiring whether people are insured under the scheme and, on finding that they are, encouraging them to go into hospital in order to get in hospital free, or at a considerably reduced rate, medical attention which could be given at home, but if given at home would require perhaps the daily attendance of a doctor or nurse and payments in full for all drugs and other attention.  This is the justification for the Fine Gael approach to health.  We want to get rid of any system which encourages a high hospitalisation rate.  The Minister is not doing that in his proposals and that is why we find a great deal of them utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 115 of the White Paper, certain figures are given for the estimated cost of the improvements. When we saw a table of estimated cost, <Col N="1191" /> we thought that although apparently the Minister had been avoiding providing us with details, that at last he was going to get down to it, but we were sorely disappointed.  While the Minister gives global figures for improvements in the general medical service, he does not say what the levels are to be for medical attention, drugs, medicines and other services.  He gives a global figure of £1,500,000.  This is the man who with all the resources of the State behind him, with a five year Committee behind him, with all the facilities of the Statistics Office behind him, challenges the Fine Gael Party to spell out penny for penny and benefit for benefit the details of their policy. This is the Minister who produces at public expense and with great ballyhoo a White Paper which does not tell us what the ceilings are to be for his health services, although he gives us global figures.  To my mind, it is the height of audacity, to put it mildly, for the Minister to make such a challenge.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs 116 and 117, we are told that the further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by the rates and a great deal of boasting and ballyhoo has been engaged in that connection, but the truth of the matter is that as a result of this great social advance, moryah, seven-eighths of the health services will still be paid for out of the rates and out of the fund which is now financing it. There is no great significance attached to it.  We will have an improvement of only one-eighth.  Seven-eighths will still have to be borne by the existing financial arrangements.  We are told in big, black heavy print that all this will involve some increases in health rates in areas other than the West.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not been honest enough to emphasise that?  He has been boasting, because the local elections have not yet taken place, that there will not be any further additions to the rates because of the health services but here we are told there will be increases in health rates in certain areas.  Will the Minister tell <Col N="1192" /> us precisely which areas will be milked to meet the arrangements he has in mind.</P>
    <P>On page 61, in a paragraph entitled Planning Capital Expenditure, we are reminded about a White Paper on public capital expenditure published last August in which it was recommended that priorities would have to be established.  Just when are this Government to establish priorities.  We have heard this cliché about priorities being established for years but the Government decline at all times to accept as a priority the health and social welfare of our people.  The result is that we find ourselves at the lowest point of social security payments among nine European countries recently referred to in the OEEC General Statistics Report for January, 1965.  Let us take these statistics for a moment.  We find Ireland is the lowest, with six per cent of gross national product devoted to social security payments, including health.  Austria, akin to us in wealth per head of the population and in potential, expends half as much again as we do.  Its figure is 9.2. West Germany is at the top with 10.4. Denmark, so often compared with us, is at 6.8.  They are all higher, Ireland being at the bottom.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael feel the Government have got their priorities wrong or confused because they have not put things right before now.  I should like to express the hope that physiotherapy will soon be included as one of the services paid for by the public health fund.  It is extraordinary that physiotherapy has not been paid for in that way heretofore.  If this were done, many people could be got back again to productive work.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in the White Paper that the optimum unit the new regional health authority will be expected to cater for will be 250,000 people, though he mentions that the Dublin Health Authority cater for a bigger number.  He should consider seriously whether the Dublin Health Authority are an economic unit or whether they could be made more economic with greater benefit to the sick and to the administrators.  In Britain, the optimum is 250,000 and, rather than have one <Col N="1193" /> health authority stretching over Dublin and part of Wicklow, it would be much better if we had two.  In health matters, particularly, it is very important to have a personal service, a more direct relationship between the administrators, the professional workers and the sick people.  Then you would have a human system and we in Dublin would get out from under the monstrous cloak in which the Dublin Health Authority are wrapped at the present time.  I ask the Minister to take a very careful and objective look at the Dublin Health Authority.  They have been in existence sufficiently long to say whether the right decision was taken to establish a unit of such size. I am not quite sure what the figure is but I suspect the authority cater for between half a million and three-quarters of a million.  The Minister might get a more efficient system if he were to modify it considerably.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are seriously concerned because the services are so hedged with restrictions as to cause grievous doubts as to whether they can achieve their objectives.  Putting it mildly, we said the same about the 1953 Health Act &mdash; that it would not achieve its much boasted about objectives. We were proved right in almost all points.  It has taken Fianna Fáil a long time to admit Fine Gael were right in 1953.  It would reflect a lot of credit on the Minister now if after 13 years he accepted our submission that he cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  His predecessor tried it with no success and the Minister will not do any better.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Minister gets rid of all the hedging restrictions, the sooner will we have a health service worthy of the country.  The only thing we can say in favour of the Minister's proposals is that one-third of a service is better than none.  It is certainly better than promises.  We know that most of what is being boasted about will not be implemented for a few years yet, if even then.  We can only hope that by then the wisdom of a better approach will have yielded fruit in the mind of the Minister, that he will forget about the miserable <Col N="1194" /> White Paper, that he will simply regard it as a necessary and compelling link he had to establish between his predecessor and the future which must be a more progressive one. We know the Minister is capable of better things but we believe that out of loyalty to his Party and to his predecessor, he did not want to throw his predecessor out with the dirty water.  When he brings in worthwhile, progressive legislation we will not criticise him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his White Paper.  It shows he has considered all criticisms of the previous health services and has brought in a worthwhile remedy of any defects there were.  In the White Paper, he sets out to eliminate three things and as well, proposes to give a choice of doctor.  In cases where there would be free choice of doctor, 80 per cent of the people would not go to the dispensary doctor.  A person might not see eye to eye with a new dispensary doctor and might not want to go to somebody else.  Under the old system he would have to pay, but now it is proposed to give a choice of doctor. Under the new system, the person with the blue card will be considered in the same way as the private patient.</P>
      <P>All over my constituency I hear complaints from time to time that you do not get the bedside manner if you are a blue card patient but the doctor is &ldquo;all over you&rdquo; if you are a private patient.  The fact that the blue card patient had to go to the dispensary while the private patient was taken into the house meant the introduction of class distinction right away &mdash; a type of class distinction that should not exist when dealing with health matters.  The free choice of doctor and the ending of the dispensary system means it will not be known whether a person is a private patient or not.  Everybody will have the same facilities and the same treatment.  That is a big step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad also that the income level has been raised.  At present people do not know what income entitles them to a blue card.  Under the proposed new regulations they will know at once and this will be a comfort to them.  I have <Col N="1195" /> often been asked by my constituents to say what income would entitle them to a card.  I can give only a rough estimate. I represent a constituency embracing parts of three counties, and in every one of those counties there is a different qualifying income limit.  The amount varies by up to 30/- per week for the individual.  It is not fair that there should be that difference in regard to obtaining health service.  You can see people in one county with a certain income receiving service while a person with the same income in an adjoining county is denied it.</P>
    <P>The decision not to consider the combined income of a household when assessing income is also to be welcomed. In the case, for example, of girls who are trainees in a small factory, such as a knitwear industry, their individual incomes may not be very great &mdash; indeed hardly sufficient for themselves.  But when three or four of them are added up and taken together with the remainder of the household income you may have a figure of £20 per week.  Under the new proposals the individual income of each person will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that old aged pensioners and those in receipt of social welfare benefit will now automatically qualify for a medical card. The Minister sent out a few reminders that they should be given cards, but in most cases the counties did not grant them if the income of the household was reasonably high.  The proposed new scheme will eliminate all that.  The people are very satisfied with the new proposals.  They believe they will work and eliminate many of the troubles of the old scheme.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the aged have been given priority and that the emphasis will be on their staying at home instead of going into the county homes, as we used to call them, but now they are called hospitals.  Whatever they are called, they still bear the stigma of the workhouse.  It costs a large sum to keep <Col N="1196" /> people in these homes, but still they are not happy there.  They are looked after exceptionally well and everything is done for them.  Yet you can see in the faces of these people that they are only putting in time.  They have nothing to live for.  At least, that is my impression of them.  The same type of people, even living on their own at home, have some future.  Maybe they have not the comfort of the people in the hospitals, but they are more happy.</P>
    <P>If possible, the Minister should increase the assistance given to old people.  If more could be given to them to help buy fuel and clothes, or even to provide direct financial assistance, it would be very welcome.  In addition, it would be good economics because it would be much cheaper for the State to provide this extra money than to provide the large sum necessary to keep these people in hospitals.  If possible, a service should be provided through the district nurse or some other organisation, whereby these people would be visited each day to see that everything was all right with them.  The day can be very long for these people when there is no one to talk to.  In the country people have the time to talk to them and they look forward to seeing somebody but the city can be a very lonely place.  There may be a radio, but a service such as the one I suggest will help people to enjoy their time.  Possibly people who have worked all their lives look forward to enjoying their retirement. They have contributed in some cases to a pension fund as well as to a pension from the State.  It would not cost so much to provide a service which would be beneficial to these people. Going around the constituency I find that people living at home on their own or with relations are far happier than when they go into a home.  With life expectancy going up all the time we shall have more and more aged people, and we must deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>In some counties houses are being provided for old people.  In my own county, flatlets which struck me as being very suitable, have been provided for aged couples.  The people <Col N="1197" /> who are living in them are very glad to have them.  Both in the towns and out in the country in County Kildare, some of the old houses have not been too good.  Some of them have become dangerous and the Minister for Local Government has given permission for the erection of prefabricated houses. In one area only three were put up and I have been inundated with calls from that area to try to get more of them.  They prefer these prefabs to cottages and say they are much warmer.  Whether it is houses, prefabs or flatlets that are built, it is a welcome step.  Unfortunately, we are only at the start of it and we have a long way to go.  In my own constituency quite a number of houses need to be dealt with.  Those remarks are slightly away from the matter of health, but still housing is the basis of all health. Unless there is a roof over people's heads they will catch some of the diseases that have been going.</P>
    <P>The proposal that free drugs will be available for the middle income group is a welcome one.  The cost of drugs is a worry to many of those people.  I know of one little boy whose father was with me recently and who told me that the cost of drugs each week for the boy was just over £1.  Since the original health scheme was brought in in 1953 the cost of drugs has been fantastic, with newer drugs coming along.  People do not object to paying the doctor's fee.  At least he is giving a good service, but when it comes to prescriptions and drugs this imposes a great burden.  It has resulted in people neglecting themselves and not buying the drugs that the doctor has prescribed for them.  The Minister's proposal will eliminate this trouble.</P>
    <P>The fact that the proposed increase in health charges will not fall on the ratepayers will also be welcomed by those who have borne the ever-increasing burden of the rates, particularly in relation to health charges.  The extra charge will come from general taxation. What I am surprised at is that the Minister has been able to get it down to a figure of £4,250,000.  That is a realistic figure.  It is one which will be easy to achieve and it should not <Col N="1198" /> require too much taxation to achieve it.</P>

      <P>We had better wait until tomorrow.  Dealing with the service as it is, there are a few criticisms I have to make.  One is in regard to the dental service in the schools.  I asked the three local authorities I deal with what has been the percentage of teeth extractions and the percentage of fillings. I found that practically 80 per cent of children who get dental treatment have extractions.  With the service the schools are getting it should be possible to fill those teeth.  When I was going to school I used to visit the dentist quite often and it was possible, even when teeth were going, to preserve them by fillings, but nowadays if the tooth is going at all the dentist will say: &ldquo;Out with it.&rdquo;  That is a serious aspect of what the service has been doing.  I hope the Minister will take it upon himself to examine it in detail to see if anything can be done to reduce this very high extraction rate.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why we should have this fantastic figure of extractions.  It is the same in all the counties.  It is ten per cent between the three.  I feel there is something wrong in it.  I do not know whether it is that the dentist is not going often enough to the schools or the children are not being brought to the clinic but there is something definitely wrong when the extraction rate is so high.  I do not think the children are eating anything different from what children ate years ago. Most children would have gone into their teens before their first extraction took place.  I should be glad if the Minister would undertake to examine this matter and see what can be done to stop this high extraction rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which has come to my notice and which I feel should be mentioned.  In a group of counties &mdash; Meath and Westmeath are among them &mdash; if a person goes into hospital and decides to pay, he is charged 35/- a day, but if he decides to let it go through the county, after having his case investigated, it is <Col N="1199" /> decided that he has to pay the full amount.  If he does not come under the health scheme, he has to pay 54/6. That is a fantastic item.</P>

      <P>It was a public ward in the general hospital in Mullingar. This case is with the Department at the present time.  In Kildare, it would be either 35/- or 37/6.  They have had Kildare people in Mullingar Hospital. They have got this extra charge.  They have not paid it as yet.  They are fighting it but there is an agreement among a group of counties &mdash; there are about five or six in this group &mdash; to charge people outside the Health Act and outside the county, when they go into hospital, the rate charged in Dublin.  I feel it is not right that a group of counties can come together and decide to do the like of this.  I hope that, by the time the investigation is fully completed, we will have some other arrangement.</P>
      <P>The proposed new regional hospitals are a very welcome arrangement because it is not right or proper if there is a serious case in any county, that it has always to go to Dublin.  Possibly, it does not affect my own constituency so much because we are within easy reach of Dublin.  It is easy for the person's friends and relations to go and see them but when you take a county in the west of Ireland and a person is moved up to Dublin, it is certainly not convenient for the sick person or the relations.  I feel that we may well come to the time when we will have regional hospitals with specialists so that the people in those hospitals will have the benefit of a specialist service. When that times comes, we will have a specialist service in all the counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems unrealistic that, if you want a specialist, you have to come to Dublin or Cork.  When the new regional hospital system is in operation, it <Col N="1201" /> should provide a bigger opening for the specialists in the country.  The newer men starting up will consider going down into the country areas where there will be an opening for them.  Most of those problems will take quite a time to get over.  The step the Minister is taking is a big one and a very welcome one.  I know in a group of hospitals in Meath and Westmeath, where they have an orthopaedic unit in Navan, this system has been working quite successfully.  A specialist comes down to them.  I feel the regional scheme will be a very important one when you have a specialist specialising in different types of cases as is the case in Dublin.  If a person, maybe after an accident, goes into a particular hospital, they find out immediately what is wrong with that person.  It will be the same down the country when the new scheme is in operation.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Minister and the Department will have quite a few headaches before this new scheme comes into operation.  It is a big step forward but a very welcome one.  I feel they will get quite a good deal of knowledge from Dublin and other health services throughout the country. They will be able to have services second to none in the country.  This new White Paper on the Health Services is to be welcomed and looked forward to.  It will not come in over-night. When you undertake any big step, you have always to take it easy and take each step as it comes.  After a few years, when these provisions are fully in operation, we will have a health service which the people of Ireland will be very happy to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This White Paper forecasts a number of much needed changes in our health services. It is anyone's guess when those changes will come in but there are a few points I should like to get cleared up.  The first point is the free choice of doctor. I can see quite well, relating that to my own constituency, how it would be possible to have a free choice of doctor in the town but in the rural areas, to my mind, it cannot be operated.  I know the Minister said, in his opening remarks, <Col N="1202" /> that in certain areas, particularly in the West, the dispensary system would be retained.  The position we are in in Galway is that we are working on a steeply declining population and, even though the dispensary system has many defects, it is the only system we have and it is the only way of keeping a doctor in the rural parts of County Galway.  As it is, we are losing dispensaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor will remember that in what we call South Galway, the Ardrahan, Kinvara and Gort area, about two years ago it was decided to amalgamate the three dispensaries.  This met with fearful opposition from the local people but yet the amalgamation went ahead.  In this area they say: &ldquo;How can we have a choice of doctor when we have to get up on a bike and cycle ten, 12, and sometimes 14 miles to the nearest doctor?&rdquo;  In that case there is no choice; it is a question of getting to the nearest doctor and that is that. I should like the Minister, if he could, to let me know in his reply in what areas it is envisaged to retain the dispensary system.  Will it take in the particular areas I have mentioned and the Portumna area and the Woodford area which is, to a great extent, mountainous?  In the whole Portumna area, there are only two doctors, two very overworked doctors.  I cannot see what can be done there.  Certainly you cannot give a choice of doctor to people resident in that area.  It is a question of paying a doctor to stay in an area such as that.  North Galway is a more thickly populated area and it would be easier to keep doctors there than it would in the more sparsely populated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said against the dispensary system but it worked in this country, to a certain extent.  In fact, in our constituency it worked well.  We have had good dispensary doctors, devoted doctors who gave adequate and excellent service over the years, but, as I have said, this is the only system we have.  The dispensary system has led to greater hospitalisation and in our county we are overloaded with hospitals &mdash; the Regional Hospital in Galway, Merlyn <Col N="1203" /> Park Sanatorium, a private hospital in Galway, nursing homes, the Regional Mental Hospital in Ballinasloe and St. Brendan's Hospital in Loughrea. The position is that the Regional Hospital in Galway is absolutely bursting at the soams.  The County Home in Loughrea is an absolute disgrace. While the patients are getting excellent medical attention, I know that in the women's wards the beds are four deep. I am sure the same goes for the men's wards, although I cannot vouch for them.  The patients in St. Brendan's Home in Loughrea are extremely happy and feel they are very well treated.  The overflow from St. Brendan's has been taken in Merlyn Park for many years.  I do know that the staff cannot possibly go on much longer working in those conditions.</P>
    <P>In Merlyn Park, I understand the position is that it has closed units, units which are apparently new because Merlyn Park is not very long built but surely these units should be open to take either the chronic cases from the Regional or more of the overflow from the County Home or St. Brendan's? It has become critical in both the Regional and St. Brendan's and the sooner something is done the better.</P>
    <P>I consider St. Brigid's Mental Hospital in Ballinasloe an excellent one.  It is, I suppose, still a little bit antediluvian: parts of the building are old-fashioned. I think on the whole in the country areas if people could be more educated in mental health, there would be far fewer patients in the County Hospital. I know in my own part people come and say some relative has gone into Ballinasloe and they are hoping to God they will not be asked to take him home.  There is this ignorant idea that mental illness is something to be hidden away, something to be ashamed of, and the sooner we get rid of this the better.  I know a lot has been done to enlighten people but more could be done in that line.</P>
    <P>The White Paper does a little for the mentally handicapped but not enough is done in this country for mentally handicapped children.  I do not know <Col N="1204" /> whether it is peculiar to our constituency but every week-end I meet people &mdash; and letters during the week say the same &mdash; who ask: &ldquo;Can nothing be done to get this child into a mentally handicapped home?&rdquo;  The position is that nowadays nobody can get help in the home and a mother with a small retarded child is absolutely tied to the house 24 hours a day.  It is unfair to the mother, unfair to the child and to the other children in the house.  We are really very far behind the rest of Europe in our care of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that some effort is being made to care for the aged people in their own homes.  I do not know what is really needed in this country. The district nurses and the Jubilee nurses do excellent work but it does not really need a qualified nurse to look after those people who are not ill, but who are just aged and infirm.  If girls could do a shorter training and be sent around on a sort of flying squad basis to look after these old and infirm people &mdash; and there are an awful lot of them in my constituency &mdash; it would help enormously.  I think much of it arises from the fact that the younger people have married and moved into town.  We have, particularly in the mountainous areas, very elderly people living in appalling conditions.  I have been told by nurses serving in the ambulances in Galway that they bring into hospitals patients whose conditions are unbelievable, not through illness but as a result of neglect, if you like. It is not those unfortunate people's fault.  They are just not able to look after themselves.  If this service were improved upon in some way, such as the flying squad works in the maternity services &mdash; people who could call once or twice a week to ensure that these aged people are cared for, washed and see that they have provisions in their homes &mdash; it would be a marvellous thing.  I know it is envisaged in the White Paper that certain provision will be made for this sort of service, but it is something we should have done years and years ago.</P>
    <P>I was in Woodford area the other day &mdash; it is sparsely populated &mdash; and <Col N="1205" /> while there I was asked to call on a certain lady who lived in a mountainous area.  She told me she was 87 years of age.  She was living alone&mdash;she was not destitute; she had money&mdash; and she was living in appalling conditions, unable to get into town and had no neighbours.  There was a time when neighbours would help but in these sort of areas the neighbours are moving out and it is in these cases that the flying squad would be advantageous. We were trying to get this old woman to go into a county home. Something had to be done; she might die of neglect up there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion spoke of the dental services in the schools.  The dental services in the schools are not adequate but, to a great extent, more dental care should be undertaken by the parents.  I do not think parents of young children encourage them strongly enough to look after their teeth.  I do not think it should be left to the local authorities.  What is left to the local authorities is adequately catered for in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The people who are not catered for are the people with medical cards who have their teeth extracted.  They have to go to a great many rounds to get their teeth extracted.  They go to one councillor, then another councillor, and then to a Deputy, and finally their teeth are extracted.  After two years, they come back to the same county councillors and Deputies and say they have not yet got their dentures.  After more writing and calling, the dentures arrive, but by the time they arrive the shape of the person's mouth has changed and the dentures do not fit and they are put behind the clock on the dresser.  That is not good enough. Dental health is very important.  Bad teeth can ruin one's health.  When people in the lower-income group need to have their teeth cared for, they should be extracted and the dentures should be supplied within a reasonable time.  I do not expect them to get the dentures overnight, but they should get them within a reasonable time. As I have said, if they get them after two years, the dentures do not fit and they are left behind the clock <Col N="1206" /> on the dresser.  That is a considerable waste of money.</P>
    <P>I notice that the medical health card system is the same to a great extent.  There are few changes in the regulations.  I have been in the Dáil for nine years and I still do not know how the issue of cards is decided.  One family with the same valuation, the same number of children, and, to all intents and purposes, the same amount of money as another have a medical card, and their neighbour has not.  I have had that pointed out to me thousands of times, and I have asked: &ldquo;Are you prepared to say that?&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;No, his medical card might be taken from him.&rdquo;  I think it is something to do with the way the forms are filled in.  Perhaps some people are more honest than others and by being more honest, they get no medical card. That should not be the case.  Medical cards should be given more liberally.</P>
    <P>The dispensary at Ardrahan was closed down because the number of medical card holders in the area decreased. To my mind, the people in Galway are worse off now than they were two years ago.  When the Minister is considering that area, will he consider Ardrahan for a dispensary or will he consider placing a doctor in it? I want to have the position in south Galway clarified.  Will it be an area where there will be a free choice of doctor, or where the dispensary system will be retained?  If we are to retain the dispensary system, as I think we must in these isolated places, some effort should be made to put in more dispensary doctors because already they are grossly overworked.  You cannot expect an unfortunate man to work 24 hours a day for the sort of money that is paid in dispensary areas. Of the two dispensary doctors in that area, one is not very well.  He feels he is overworked and he is a little uneasy about the present set-up.</P>
    <P>I think clinics should be held in towns to give advice to mothers about their babies.  These young girls leave hospital after four or five days, and it is too far for them to go back to the regional hospital, and the babies do not get the absolute care that should be available.  They are so far from the <Col N="1207" /> dispensary that there should be some clinic at which they could get advice.  I spend half my time advising mothers on what to feed their babies.  I would not have to do that if they could get advice in a clinic.  I am not qualified to tell them what they should feed their babies, apart from the fact that I have four of my own.</P>
    <P>On the question of drugs, either Deputy Crinion was wrong or I read the White Paper wrongly.  I do not think the Minister intends giving free drugs to all the middle-income group. Drugs are a fearful burden.  In Northern Ireland they are not anything as expensive as they are here.  There must be something wrong in regard to the importers or the suppliers.  The price of drugs for the average person in the middle-income group is a nightmare. Galway County Council are very reasonable in this matter.  When a patient has paid so much for drugs, they are reasonable in allowing free drugs.  I appeal to the Minister to look into the whole question of the price of drugs.  It has gone sky high in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme. I heard Deputies absolutely slating the scheme but I know there are hundreds of thousands of people who thank God that they joined it.  It is very hard for the father of a family who has to go into hospital to get better if he is lying there worrying about the bill. It is the same with the mother.  It is very hard for her to get better if she is worrying about the bill. Very few of us are so well off that we can spend 22 guineas or 25 guineas a week lying in hospital.  To my mind, this is the most marvellous system. I encourage my constituents who can rise to the subscription to join the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and I get letters saying that I was right and they were sorry they had not done so years ago.  The health services could have been run on the same lines but the Minister thought better.  I shall not delay the House any further but I should like the Minister to tell us as soon as possible <Col N="1208" /> which areas will be dispensary areas and which will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that my friend and relative by marriage, Deputy Crinion, was never so far off the ball as when he congratulated the Minister, because the Minister is not at the stage when he wants to be congratulated on the start of something new.  There is nothing new in the world.  In fact, this is not something new.  It is pale facsimile of a very small part of the health policy enunciated by Deputy O'Higgins as far back as 1957.  Before we deal with 1957, we had better go back to 1953.  When the inter-Party took over in 1954, they had to make a decision on whether or not they would implement the Health Act, 1953. Facts are good for us, and those of us who have been here for a while can marshal our facts if we have been interested in the legislation that has passed through the House.</P>
      <P>In 1954, the decision of the Cabinet was that, while they did not accept the Health Act, 1953, as the best sort of legislation, they would implement it, pending the provision of a different system of health service.  In 1957, Fine Gael produced their health policy. Since then, Fine Gael never said they would give free health services to the people of this country.  What they did say was that it was possible to give 85 per cent of the people a health service based on insurance.  Not only could the insured worker become a compulsorily insured recipient of health benefits of a certain standard but people could be voluntarily contributors.  They could become members of this health system whereby they would get a choice of doctor and not free drugs but drugs at 50 per cent of the cost, if they were in a position to pay for them and free, if they were not.  They would get hospital accommodation without a charge <i>per diem</i>; I use the phrase deliberately &ldquo;without a charge <i>per diem&rdquo;</i> as an alternative to the word &ldquo;free&rdquo;.  We never said these things would be free.  We said they could be paid for by a system of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We never said there would be a <Col N="1209" /> panel system for doctors.  We felt that, while the 1953 Health Act was something that could be implemented, at the same time, health policy for the future should be enunciated.  Then you could go to the doctors and to the local authorities and see how to set up a system of insurance whereby you could give this choice of doctor, where it was possible, either on the panel system or on the fee for consultation system, as was agreed with the doctors, and, at the same time, you could arrange that hospitalisation would be included in the insurance charge and that there would not be included, even for the middle income group, a charge <i>per diem.</i></P>
    <P>To enunciate our policy cost us quite a lot of support in various places.  We gained a certain amount of support from people who said we were doing the right thing but we lost support amongst certain vested interests and in certain places.</P>
    <P>At Question Time here, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins made the retort to the Minister, and the Minister enjoyed it&mdash;&ldquo;I wrote it&rdquo;.  It is true to say that a man who wrote an encyclopaedia could also write a pamphlet on the same subject. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins did it but what is now before us is a pale and sickly image of something that would have done a good job for the country and it is something which we never said was &ldquo;for free&rdquo;.  We never had the audacity to say that, nor had we the desire to say it.  What I put on my election posters in Louth in 1957, 1961 and 1965 was &ldquo;Health by Wealth&rdquo;.  I also put, under it: &ldquo;We want you to pay for your health on an insurance system&rdquo;.  That is the Fine Gael policy for health and it is as far removed from what we have here as daylight is from darkness.</P>
    <P>I have a great personal regard for the Minister.  He started off with a very difficult heritage.  When Fianna Fáil were returned as a Government in 1961, it was obvious that, while we had not won the election, there was one side of the argument which we had won hands down and that was the argument in favour of insurable health. When we came back here, the first <Col N="1210" /> thing we did was to put down a motion which sought that such a health system should be instituted.  That monolithic Machiavelli, Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Health, put down a very carefully worded amendment that the matter be referred to a Select Committee on Health.  I think the Minister was a member of that Committee right from the start: I was not. I came on when a member of our Party, a wiser man than I, decided that, because he had got himself a new wife, he was too busy to act on that Committee.  Therefore, I was there for about threequarters of its meetings. While enraged that health legislation was being held up, that the people were not getting the service they should get and that a hidebound conservative approach was emanating not only from the then Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, but also from the Chairman of the Select Committee on Health, Deputy Carty, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that this was all a delaying action designed to keep us sitting on the seats of our pants for four years, one had at that stage, if one had been here for a while and become a slightly sophisticated politician, to admire the hard-neck-manship of the then Minister for Health and of the entire Fianna Fáil Party in their representation on that Committee who were prepared to delay the whole forward movement of health legislation for years rather than to accept the policy of a Party which, even though that Party were defeated at the election, was universally accepted.  Nobody has ever denied that that was so.</P>
    <P>The steering of the work of that Committee up <i>culs de sac</i> by Deputy MacEntee which first started with the clever wording of his amendment to restrict the examination that could take place was such that we sat for four years and an election passed and with that election came the retirement from the Cabinet of Deputy MacEntee.  Now, Deputy MacEntee is a man for whom I have the highest regard.  If there is one thing to be said about him, it is that as long as he has been in this House, as hard as he has hit, he does not mind how hard you hit him back.  That is a <Col N="1211" /> good trait in any man.  Socially, he is as nice a fellow as you can get, so long as you do not meet him on a political platform.  That is all I have to say about him.</P>
    <P>With the disappearance of Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health, the pattern changed.  Noises of battle rumbled for years between the Irish Medical Association and the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee.  Then there was a reception in Iveagh House and all the members of the Select Committee on Health attended.  Deputy Tully, I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another wise man. The present Minister for Health, Deputy O'Malley, and I, amongst others, turned up for the reception and there was a marriage between the Minister for Health and the Irish Medical Association who had been at logger-heads for years.  That marriage was because a Party, Fine Gael, the major Opposition Party, held that there should be a choice of doctor.  Fine Gael had put that up to the people and had had a very large measure of support for it but they had not said how this was to be done&mdash;whether by a panel system, a fee for consultation system or any other system.  The conservative Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, who, for years, had rejected this and said we would continue the dispensary system, we would continue with the 1953 Health Act and that there would be no change, was very much aware of the situation.</P>
      <P>At the last election, some of my best friends who are dispensary doctors did not vote for me because they believed we were the Party of change.  They believed our Party would make them cyphers as the doctors of Great Britain believe they are cyphers.  To my knowledge, some of my best friends who are dispensary doctors did not vote for me at the last election because they believed we were the Party who would disturb their whole existence, their lives, the lives of their families and of everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the consumation of the marriage that took place in Iveagh <Col N="1212" /> House?  The present Minister for Health is the bride and they discovered that he has a wooden leg and false teeth.  The Minister for Health is no longer the conservative Deputy MacEntee who will keep the 1953 Health Act, the dispensary system, all these things, but he is the man who is bringing along this pale facsimile of the Fine Gael policy for health.  He does not say it will be paid for by insurance but he says there will be a choice of doctor.  Just like us, he has had to fly his kite and not tell the doctors how that will be arranged&mdash; whether it will be on the panel system, on the fee for consultation system or any other system.  Just as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins had to fly his good, large, strong, luminous kite in 1957, 1961 and 1965, the present Minister for Health in this Fianna Fáil Government, now flies his tiny kite which is waving in the breeze.  Nevertheless, the doctors are now back in the same position as they were in, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Fine Gael Party and Deputy O'Higgins. They do not know what will be the compensation for dispensary doctors; they must negotiate.  That is why we were not so popular in the past.  We are now all in the one situation.  Our boat is much larger, much stronger and can bring the people of Ireland a good deal further.  The Fianna Fáil boat is going in the same direction. They want to get rid of the dispensary system just as we do.</P>

Such a specification would fix different income limits for single persons, for married couples without dependants and for married couples with dependants, provision being made for a quite substantial increment in the limit for each child, having regard to the fact that hardship in meeting doctors' and chemists' bills is most likely to be met in large families.</P>

Instances have been given by Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins and by Deputy Crinion of where choice of doctor is not practicable.  He is entitled <i>ipso facto</i> to drugs at 50 per cent of cost and if his classification brings him into the lower-income group&mdash;and it is not a means test such as is preserved by the Minister in paragraph 51&mdash;he will get his drugs entirely free.</P>

The Minister, to his credit, is fully aware of the present position where, for instance, an old age pensioner has three sons working and living with him in the house.  They drink all they earn and give the old age pensioner nothing and that old age pensioner at present will not hold either a green or a blue card. <Col N="1215" /> Until now, as a result of circulars of the Minister, for which I thank him and I most vehemently support him and have stood behind him in my own local authority on this point, county managers have refused to give old age pensioners in this position a lower-income group card.  The Minister is fully aware of that and yet he is introducing a test which will still be a means test.</P>

So is the voluntary contributor in the middle-income group and those who are farmers under a certain valuation, are in the lower-income group and those with over £14 valuation are in the other income group and nobody will come along to say: &ldquo;Maggie is working in the factory, getting £4 a week and because of that her mother and father, even though the holding has a valuation of only £12, cannot be in a certain group.&rdquo;  If the Minister listens he will get a clear picture but I shall not proceed on the basis of question and answer because the Ceann Comhairle would rule the Minister out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given you the policy and I will give you more of it before I finish.  In regard to payment for this, I want to say that one of the great sins of the previous Minister for Health was that no matter what figures we produced, we were wrong.  We went to considerable trouble to put down Parliamentary Questions and to get Deputies to check on rates and spending in local authorities and we amassed figures to show how we could do it and to show what, at that particular <Col N="1216" /> time, would be the contribution from the employer, from the employee and the voluntary contributor.  The former Minister for Health deliberately misconstrued us and included in our costs the costs of running all the local authority hospitals.  That inflated the figures to such an extent that it was possible to prove to some people who knew no better that we had gone wrong.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I have said, that we never said we would remove from the rates the cost of running the local authority hospitals.  What we did say was that we were removing the cost of all health provisions outside the hospitals.  Local authority hospitals would still have remained on the rates. While the Minister now suggests that he is going to hold the rates as they are, the position on very detailed examination four years ago was that our provisions for transferring the cost of the health services outside the hospitals to an insurance contribution would mean that the average rate would have been reduced by 4/- in the £1.  Let us never say you can get anything free because one must always pay for it.  The position at present is that the Minister is creating a situation for which there is no guarantee whatever, when he suggests, in paragraph 117, that the rates contribution in the next financial year will not be increased.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the work which the Minister has to do.  He is only starting his work and it is most detailed work which requires a lot of courage, a lot of energy and ability.  However, the position is that if he proceeds along the lines on which he is going, I cannot see him holding the votes position at the end of two years as he says he will hold it next year.  The difference between us and Fianna Fáil is that whereas he is providing an advance from central fund, we were prepared to say to the people who could afford to pay, employee and employer: &ldquo;Put it on your stamps&rdquo;.  The Minister at present is a beggar at the Cabinet table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You did say the people who could afford to pay insurance. That is 85 per cent of the population, you say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a means test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  You might as well say that if you go and buy a packet of cigarettes, it is a means test, or that if you decided to insure your life, so that your wife and family would be looked after if you died, it is a means test.  For the voluntary contributor, the position would be that he would either have to go into this and get full coverage or stay with the voluntary insurance scheme and say: &ldquo;I am rich enough to stay out&rdquo;.  There is not the slightest doubt that our policy is far more detailed, far more comprehensive and far more honest, and that the Minister at the present finds himself a beggar at the Cabinet table.  We were prepared to put health standing on its own two feet.</P>
      <P>The Minister also has an important job to do in regard to the rationalisation of hospital services.  In County Louth, I felt that this should be done for many years.  I proposed a hospital bed committee which sat for 18 months and which produced certain recommendations in relation to the proper use of the hospital beds available to us.  The Minister is working on those recommendations with me at the moment and while the recommendations of that committee have not yet been fully implemented in Louth, we have saved the Louth County Council and the ratepayers £200,000 or £300,000 by the proper utilisation of beds at our disposal.  I believe that we will effect a saving of an additional £100,000 before we finally complete this rationalisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about merging health authorities and having bigger units.  This is absolutely essential and <Col N="1218" /> must be done if we are to move with the times.  It is one of the things the Minister must do.  He must plan for it and work for it with the members of his Party and with the members over here; he must work with the officials of the local authorities, with the county managers and with the officials of his Department.  It is one of the ways in which he can get health off the ground.  It is one way in which he can really benefit the people and even benefit the Exchequer.  The difference between us is that he is relying far too much on the Excequer in relation to what he can do for the ordinary person who requires health services.  I do not want to go into detail about our operations in Louth but I will say that the people, no matter what way they vote, or what Party they support, are grateful for the work that is being done.  The Minister has given his blessing to some of the work and I will work with him towards the culmination of this work without seeking Party political advantage, but merely to get the job done.  I will not congratulate the Minister as Deputy Crinion did but I will wish him well because he has a big job to do.  He is a young man of energy and I hope he will make a good job of it because that is extremely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I feel that this White Paper has been very well covered.  I was glad to hear Deputy Donegan praise the Minister because he deserves praise for his progressiveness, apart from any other consideration.  Deputy P.J. Lenihan made a very good point in relation to achievement, one side or the other claiming the kudos for a White Paper on a health policy.  This achieves nothing.  The implementation of this White Paper should be an all-Party effort and should have the encouragement of the whole House.  Indulging in politics or in one-upmanship achieves nothing.  Health should be above politics and I would appeal to all to consider it in that perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal, in the first instance, with our aged.  The figures in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for 1961 showed that 32,000 of our older citizens, that is, <Col N="1219" /> people over 65, lived on their own.  In addition, 24,000 were living in institutions. This is a very sad reflection on us here as legislators.  We have fallen down badly in our obligations to our older citizens.  This was brought home very forcibly to me recently in the television programme entitled &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; which is a very worthwhile programme.  It dealt with three cases of old people living on their own and fortunately, or unfortunately, as the case may be, the programme dealt with an east coast holiday resort and but for the fact that the name &ldquo;Dún Laoghaire&rdquo; was used two or three times, nobody would have guessed that it was dealing with the constituency which I represent.</P>
    <P>It brought home to me the difficult circumstances in which these unfortunate people live.  They receive from the State the maximum social welfare benefits, 47/6.  One asks is this sufficient? One asks can they live on this? Clearly in the three cases dealt with in the television programme, the 47/6 was insufficient and it was a rather harrowing experience, to say the least, to learn how they survived.  But survival it was.  In relation to the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; programme, there is some controversy at the moment as to its merit.  I should not like to think it will be interfered with in any way because it performs a very good social service in relation to various facets of Irish life.</P>
    <P>In relation to the care of the aged, I should like to see a worthwhile analysis carried out, particularly in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rath-down. There would seem to be a great number of old people living on their own in this area.  I suggest that the Minister conduct a survey there as is being conducted by the Irish Sisters of Charity in Kilkenny, a domiciliary service survey.  Such a survey would be directed towards finding the trained staff necessary, such as auxiliary to doctors and nurses, mainly under the supervision of district nurses.  It is also very important to promote liaison with the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems today is that there is a lot of duplication of <Col N="1220" /> work among the voluntary organisations. We find that two, three or four organisations perform the same function. The Minister might get a list of these bodies and arrange that the efforts be amalgamated.  At the moment they do their best and succeed in many cases in achieving the same objective.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the survey I have suggested would be to estimate as clearly as possible the number of patients at present in hospitals and institutions who could be treated at home with the help of a domiciliary service; (b), the number of patients on the lists of district nurses who could benefit by domiciliary services; (c), the number of patients on the general medical services register; (d), in addition to compiling statistics of patients, a list should be made of the voluntary organisations already providing domiciliary services in the area; (e), a list should also be made of sub-areas as centres for mobile kitchens; (f) a list should be made of chiropodists who might be approached to visit very needy patients.</P>
    <P>In regard to the district nursing service, I think the present one may be ample, if reinforced by other services. Then we come to the question of male orderlies where heavy lifting is called for.  These male orderlies would be required for heavy sanitary disposal work.  These people would be needed for three types of work: one, emergency work of cleaning and sanitary disposal in the less hygienic houses: two, emergency house work, which would call for some experience of children; three, work such as shopping for chronic cases.  Helpers should have some domestic training in hospitals and also with nurses.  I suggest payment of five guineas per week to these people with an average holiday of three weeks per year.  When I urge a wage of this kind, I emphasise, of course, that the work would be on a part-time basis. Nobody is expected in this day and age to work for five guineas a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely part-time workers should be paid more?  It is the usual trade union basis.  Deputy <Col N="1221" /> Andrews must be speaking of a day rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is on a temporary basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be very temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be on top of another job.  Deputy Kyne mentioned a voluntary service conducted by children.  It was a first-class idea. He said that children gave their services after school visiting the aged in their homes and contributing what money they could towards the purchase of coal and other such necessaries.  It is the type of work for which I am suggesting these people should be paid.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to mentally retarded children.  A Commission have reported rather fully on this question and I do not have much to add. However, I have experience of three cases.  A mother with a family of seven or eight children has one unfortunate child who has reached her mental limit at the age of six or seven years.  The problem of this unfortunate mother is that she cannot find and institution in which to place her child. The State has a responsibility which to date has not been discharged.  Again I urge on the Minister to look into this matter.  It is not fair to have a mother with five or six children doing her best for them but having one child on her hands holding back the progress of the others.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like to mention is in regard to the Portrane institution in County Dublin.  Here, adult male and young male patients are thrown together.  This is a bad thing.  Whatever hope there is for improvement in young patients cannot be realised if they are among old patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter the Minister should look into urgently.  I have mentioned it because it came to <Col N="1222" /> my notice through a case in which I became interested.  I cannot speak for the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's considered advice.  The White Paper proposes free choice of doctor which is a good thing.  At the other end of the scale, the doctor must be considered.  He has not got a nine to five job.  He is at work 24 hours a day and is lucky if he can take two or three weeks' holidays in the year.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is continuing his discussions with the IMA and the Medical Union.  He is doing a good job.  The findings have not been issued.  Apart from the citizens in general, the doctors are at the other side and their lives and livelihood must be taken into consideration when implementing the White Paper.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion that the dispensary system will be abandoned.  Of course this is erroneous.  It will be abandoned mainly in city and urban areas but will be retained in country districts where it is working adequately. One function the White Paper performs for us is that it indicates clearly where we are going. There is a lot to be done.  It leaves us in no doubt as to what the issues involved are.  This is a very important function of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his achievement in getting the White Paper into booklet form and I would now appeal to him to get it operating.  He is a progressive Minister.  He is a Minister with a deep social conscience.  I am glad to see the atmosphere of this House has been one of encouragement. This is a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad an attempt is being made to reorganise the health services.  We need a much improved service for many of our people who are sadly neglected.  It is an old saying that health is wealth, and it is very true.  People not in good health are a heavy burden both on themselves and on everybody else.  I know a fair amount about this health <Col N="1223" /> problem because I live about eight miles from two of our county hospitals &mdash;the Leitrim County Hospital and the Sligo County Hospital.  I live midway between both and I have occasion to visit them frequently.</P>
      <P>We have a fine hospital in Manorhamilton since 1954.  I should like to remind the Minister that it will be essential to appoint a surgeon there in the very near future.  We have a surgeon who gave good and loyal service to the people for about 40 years. He is due to retire on 31st March and it is essential that a surgeon be appointed to take his place.  Apart from the fact that extensions to provide better nurses' quarters are necessary, this is a hospital that should serve the people of Leitrim for many years to come.</P>
      <P>For some time past the staff in the Manorhamilton hospital has not been kept up to strength.  At times there are 80 patients, but when the number of patients increases the number of nurses is not increased.  Consequently, the nurses often find themselves heavily taxed because there are more patients in the hospital than there is accommodation for them.  Old people and so on are sent there and the matron is placed in a difficult position.  The county home in Carrick-on-Shannon is filled to capacity with old and feeble people who cannot be sent back to their own homes because there is nobody there.  The matron should have the power to call in whatever extra nurses are needed in order to relieve the pressure on the hardworking staff. The Minister is doing a fine job at Sligo.  Very large extensions are being carried out there to provide nurses' quarters and to house the most modern type of hospital equipment.  It is good to know the nurses' quarters will be beside the hospital instead of being located, as they were, in another part of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  In some counties pay slips are sent out with the cheques for the nurses.  In Leitrim the nurses are rather annoyed that pay slips are not sent out with <Col N="1224" /> their cheques.  The cheques are issued, so to speak, in bulk, instead of having a slip attached to each cheque showing the amount each nurse receives along with deductions.  It causes a certain amount of discontent amongst the nursing staff to have their cheques thrown around.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see that the nurses in Leitrim have their cheques sent out accompanied by a pay slip the same as in some other counties. I do not know how many other counties do this but it is certainly done in some of the neighbouring counties to Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposed new system will result in patients being attended to more speedily and will end delays in having X-rays.  I have known of a patient who went to one of the hospitals and was told it would be three weeks before he could have an X-ray. He could be dead and gone before the three weeks were up.  Under the new system a doctor, who visits a patient far removed from a hospital and who considers this patient should be sent to Dublin, should have the right to send that patient direct to Dublin instead of having to send him from, say, Ballinamore to Manorhamilton and after a few days from Manorhamilton to Dublin.  This is precious time lost with a patient in need of immediate attention.  This is something the Minister should look into with a view to cutting out the red tape of having to go to the surgical hospital in the county and then to Dublin.  It is almost as far from south Leitrim to Manorhamilton as to go direct to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of old people.  Deputies have spoken about old people, and the same applies to the constituency I represent.  We have in Leitrim a fine hospital which is used as a county home but unfortunately it is only half big enough to deal with the demand made on it.  What we in the county council would like to see is the erection of a small hospital at the northern end so that people would not have to travel 50 miles to visit one of their aged relatives.  It is rather sad to go into this hospital and speak <Col N="1225" /> to somebody you thought was dead and gone.  People have been there for years and the relatives have forgotten about them.  They are ending their dreary, quiet lives in that county home without anybody to think of them.  If these people were in a small hospital more convenient to their homes and to their relatives, I think more frequent visits would be made by relatives.</P>
    <P>In Sligo I hope it will not be long until the old county home is replaced by a new one.  An old building there was converted some years ago into a county home&mdash;it was always a workhouse as well as I remember&mdash;and it is packed to capacity.  Only about three years ago when we had a very severe winter, I discovered that it was impossible to get old people who were almost dying into the county home.  It is bad enough for many of those people to find themselves on the way to the county home but it is still worse when they discover there is no home at all for them.  I hope there will be no undue delay in replacing the old home.</P>
    <P>Only recently I was approached by two men who were longing to be sent back to the county home in their own county.  I inquired if this could be done and was told it could not be done and that they would have to remain where they were.  I hope the Minister will do something to ensure that people in their old age, if they have a longing to be in the county home of their own county, will be allowed to go there instead of having to live in some county home where they are not at all happy.</P>
    <P>A district nursing service for people living on their own is desirable.  It would be a great help to many old people who are living in isolated rural areas to have some nurse to call in and have a chat with them over a cup of tea.  That would change the outlook of that old lady or gentleman who might have nobody to talk to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We only do that around election times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at election times we all go to them.  There are voluntary bodies who must be complimented <Col N="1226" /> on doing this work where the county home is concerned.  However, the members of these voluntary bodies have their jobs to look after in towns during the day and are not, perhaps, in a position to go out into the rural areas in the evening or at nighttime. It is easy enough to drop into the county home and talk to these people, but to take to the rural areas and bad roads is another day's work. A nursing service would be a great help.  I come from a rural area and it is only such a person who can realise how lonely and how isolated those people are becoming day after day. Members of the family emigrate or a brother or a sister dies and the place is sold.  Eventually that person may have no neighbour nearer than a mile or two miles away.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins gave us an instance of it, and it is a very common thing today.  These people find they have nobody even to bring a parcel from a shop for them.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether medical cards are being given to all old age pensioners but in a constituency like Sligo-Leitrim where practically all the farmers are small and many of the townspeople are living without any means, it would be a good thing if a medical card were given to all old age pensioners.  Many of them might not avail of it very much but many others might be very glad to have it.  Anybody who has to live solely on £27s. 6d. a week cannot afford to go to a doctor.  Many of those would have to get a car and might have to make a great effort to get into the local village. Certainly they could not ask a doctor to come to the house to them.</P>
      <P>The time has come when there should be a more regular call by the dentist to examine the teeth of school-children, even at the cost of increasing the number of dentists.  Sometimes a rather long period elapses before the dentist comes back to see the school-children. Full use should be made of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability allowances have recently been increased all round.  There are many people who are disabled and who are unable to get around, and £1 <Col N="1227" /> or 25/- is still a very small amount. They may be living on a small farm with a married brother who has a few young children.  Naturally enough, they are depending solely on that £1 5s. 0d. which, spread over a period of seven days is very small.  Recently I spent, I am sure, four months making representations on behalf of an applicant who was very broken down in health. It was cheaper to go to an outside doctor than to her own dispensary doctor because the other doctor was near at hand.  Finally, after long correspondence and careful consideration, she succeeded in getting 10/-.  When I was told she was getting 10/-, I said I was rather surprised that she did not get more than 10/- in 1965.  The valuation of her brother's farm was £5 and he was getting £2 2s. 6d.  The only answer was that the case would soon be reviewed again.  God knows, I cannot understand what was the meaning of having the case reviewed again when they found it needed to be reviewed at all.  I hope that case will be fully considered before long.  It takes a long time.  In fact, it takes sometimes six or eight months before this thing gets going.  I know it takes a bit of time to get it through ordinary channels but I do not think it should take eight months to deal with applications of this type.  That is about eight months allowance lost to that person if she succeeds in getting it.  Most of those people have to make representations to county councils, TDs or somebody else to see what can be done in their particular cases.  I hope to God it will come to the time when there will be fixed allowances for those people and that they will not have to go to their public representatives to do something for them.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I should like to say and I think I am fairly right in saying it.  Anything other than a dispensary system will hardly ever be a success in a constituency like mine. The counties stretch over a very wide area.  The constituency consists of rural areas which could be 40 or 50 miles from the principal town.  If the dispensary <Col N="1228" /> were closed and if there was no dispensary doctor, hundreds of those people would find themselves at a loss to know where they would get a doctor.  If a doctor has to attend to a certain area the chances are that he will be located in the biggest town in the county.  At the county council meeting I said I could never see some of those isolated rural areas left without a dispensary and without a doctor.</P>
    <P>Dispensary doctors deserve to be complimented on the work they did in the past.  They lived in villages far removed from all the social life and all the facilities to be found in other towns, such as schools and other amenities that could be enjoyed by those men who work so hard.  It very often happened when one dispensary doctor was ill that another dispensary doctor took over his work.  That meant that man had to do double the work.  Some of those men became seriously ill as a result of overwork.  We certainly owe a lot to the men who have done so much for the people in remote areas, such as we have in Sligo and Leitrim.  Many of the homes in those counties are in out of the way and backward places.  I hope the new system will soon be put into operation although I doubt very much if it can be soon due to the fact that the Minister can hardly have money for all those things mentioned in the White Paper.  However, I wish him luck and I hope he will succeed.</P>
    <P>There is a very big dispensary area in my constituency called Drumkeerin and it has been without a doctor for years.  There is no doctor's residence there.  No doctor wants the dispensary. That area has to be covered by two doctors from the local dispensary of Drumshambo and Dromahaire.  There is another area, Kiltyclogher, also without a dispensary doctor.  This means heavy work for the men doing the job.  The Minister should take notice of the service that a doctor gives in an area and not leave him too long in a temportry capacity.</P>
    <P>There is a doctor in my area of whom the people are very proud.  He has given great service.  He is a good doctor and when I asked the county manager what could be done about this <Col N="1229" /> man, why he could not be made permanent so that he would not go away from the people, the manager told me that was a job for the appointments commission.  That is a very serious situation.  Here is a hard-working man who has given good service to the people for the last three years, and he is still only in a temporary capacity in that area.  When people are anxious to have such a man appointed he should be appointed.  He would not then leave the people because he would be content. No doctor can be found in areas like that.  There is nothing to attract a doctor.  The only way to attract one is to pay him enough money.</P>
    <P>People can often die as a result of the doctor living at a distance from them.  I remember going into an area on a Sunday morning at 11 o'clock. There was an aged woman dying there. Her son went the night before looking for the doctor but he was away.  He had to return and at 11 or 12 o'clock the next day the doctor came.  Fortunately, the woman was saved.  That is a danger when the doctor lives at a distance from such centres as Drumkeerin and Kiltyclogher.</P>
    <P>With regard to mentally retarded children, I shall only echo what other Deputies said tonight.  We are informed of such cases; representations are made with a view to getting something done. Of course, once we read the letter we know that what we can do is almost nil.  The other day I was told about a woman who had a son of seven years of age.  He was mentally retarded and the mother could not even go out if she wanted to attend the doctor.  She could not leave the home.  This little boy was getting bigger and she wanted to know what could be done about him.  That is only one of many cases. There are other people who have succeeded after a very long time in getting children into homes.  They thought it would be quite an easy matter to contribute something towards the cost but as time went on they discovered the payment was very heavy and was becoming a great hardship.</P>
    <P>These people, as well as the people who are waiting to get their children <Col N="1230" /> into some of those homes, are in sore straits.  There are children from my own area who are on a waiting list for some of the homes in Dublin.  There are 300 on the waiting list before them. Only God knows when those children will get into one of those homes.  The sooner something can be done to get homes built for them the better. Parents are really desperate to know when such boys or girls will be taken away.  As well as that, it can spoil the whole outlook of the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>With regard to mental hospital patients, I think I would not be asking the Minister to do too much if I asked him to cease seeking any moneys from them.  I am a member of a mental hospital board and I know that there are not a great number of them paying in some of these hospitals.  If the whole service were given free, it still would not make that much difference to the Minister.  I have met people who were very annoyed about bills and who came rushing to see what could be done for them, while, in fairness to the hospital authorities, I should say that in any such case, the charge was wiped out. I always had that experience of the Sligo Mental Hospital and the same will happen now.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say, other than to refer briefly to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  People should be advised very strongly to join the scheme and plenty of publicity should be given to its benefits so that they will be induced to join.  I have known many people who would be expected to know about its value but who do not know.  I had hoped that people would have learned about its advantages because it is a great safeguard when hospital treatment is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go over all the facts of this White Paper at this late stage in the debate, as all the paragraphs have been fairly well aired over the past few days.  However, there are a few points which are worth emphasising and I shall avail of the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the care of the aged, I want to compliment the Minister on <Col N="1231" /> the proposals outlined here and also on the steps he has taken, since he took over the Ministry, to deal with the problem.  Paragraph 81 on page 45 of the White Paper sets out:</P>
    <P>... The Government's general aim is to encourage old people to stay at home and to endeavour to ensure that assistance will be available where needed to enable them to do so without causing hardship to the aged or imposing too heavy a burden on their relatives.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is the basis of the Minister's programme for looking after the aged but there are a few points in this regard which I think should be brought out.  There is, first of all, the case of the young girl, a member of a family, who stays at home to look after the aged parents.  We have thousands of such people in this country today.  When they leave school at 17 or 18 years&mdash;maybe after getting a good education&mdash;one girl has to stay at home to look after the house and, then the parents become infirm and have to be cared for.  If the parents live to an old age that daughter may be around 40 or, possibly, 50 when the parents die.  That girl then, having given her life to looking after her parents, thereby keeping them out of institutions and hospitals and saving the ratepayers and the State a certain amount of expense, finds herself heavily penalised because there is no State aid for her.  She has no stamps; she cannot draw unemployment benefit or social welfare because she was not insurable all her life.  She is too old to take up employment of any kind, to be taken into employment or to be trained.  Such a person finds herself at the age of 40 or 50 without any means of support or without any State scheme to assist her.</P>
    <P>There should be initiated, possibly with the co-operation of the Minister for Social Welfare, a scheme of insurance for sons or daughters who stay at home to look after aged parents, because they eventually find themselves in this situation.  The only body to which they can turn for assistance is <Col N="1232" /> the county council which provides home assistance or maybe they take up menial domestic work of some sort or other to eke out a miserable existence for the rest of their days.  It is a poor reward for people who have stayed at home to look after their parents.</P>
    <P>Of course we also have the other type of person who stays at home to look after parents, people who had insurable employment down through the years and who, when the parents became infirm, had to give up their employment to look after them.  They had the alternative of continuing to work and sending the parents into the county home or to some hospital to be a burden on the local authority or on the State, as the case may be.  But, generally speaking, the great majority choose to give up their employment to look after their aged parents.  Here again, we find they are penalised for doing this because they cannot draw unemployment or social welfare benefit, because when they inform the appeals officer of the Department of Social Welfare that they are unemployed because they have to look after their aged parents, it immediately cuts them off from unemployment benefit.  That problem also should be looked into in relation to the care of the aged.  First of all, there should be the initiation of a State scheme to assist such people and, also the inclusion of some clause whereby they could draw, if they have an insurance record, unemployment or other social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>The problem of the aged, of course, has been recognised in this country for a good many years but, unfortunately, it has taken some time to get the Government to act.  Voluntary organisations of one kind or another have sprung up in recent years because of the lack of any proper Government steps and co-ordination amongst the Government Department and the local authorities in doing anything about it. We have social service schemes operated by voluntary organisations set up in various towns, schemes which were initiated by the local Bishop of the diocese which are well worth all the support, financial and otherwise, which the Department of Health can <Col N="1233" /> give.  The White Paper sets out plans for co-ordinating all these schemes, and I hope that as a result a still better effort will be made on behalf of the aged.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in the services which I should like to see wiped out.  I have come across cases of old people living on their own near a county border who are being looked after by relations in another county perhaps only 100 yards or half a mile away.  If they are living within the county boundary, it is usual for the local authorities to grant home assistance to people who need it, but where a county boundary comes between the old people and the people who are looking after them, it is not possible to grant them home assistance because one local authority cannot grant home assistance to someone in another county.  That is an anomaly that should be straightened out.  If it were, we would be better able to look after the aged, and we would have far fewer old people in our institutions and hospitals, and we could make the health and hospital services available for people who really need them, and who would benefit from them.</P>
    <P>There are other points, too, in this White Paper which deserve to be well aired.  Many views have been given and possibly every aspect has been discussed, but there is no harm in emphasising the deficiencies in our dental service and in particular, in our services for mentally retarded children. We would not be overdoing it if every Deputy who spoke on the White Paper mentioned mentally retarded children. I feel that if any Deputy talked about this White Paper without mentioning this problem, he would be failing in his duty, and I hope positive steps will now be taken to solve it.</P>
    <P>The dental service is very bad in some counties, and particularly in my own county, and in my neighbouring county, Carlow.  There are people on the waiting list for dentures for three, four and five years.  If a local representative made representations on behalf of a person who was two years on the waiting list for dentures, he would be told that that person was very <Col N="1234" /> lucky to be waiting only two years. Such is the position in our dental service.</P>
    <P>I am referring only to the details which stick out very obviously.  There are many others.  The provision of drugs and medicines has always been a bone of contention.  Some months ago a constituent of mine told me that he picked up some kind of germ and got very sick.  He was the holder of a medical card.  He went to his doctor and the doctor gave him a prescription. He followed the prescription for some days, but he did not get any better. He decided to contact a private doctor who prescribed a very expensive drug, and the man was cured within 24 hours.  I am not casting any reflection on the doctors concerned, but I am casting a reflection on the provision of medicines.  It has been the policy in certain local authorities to provide only the cheapest medicines and to keep the stocks low, and not to get any expensive drugs or medicines.  This should be remedied.  The best drugs and medicines should be available for all the people who are entitled to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about my experience since I came into public <Col N="1235" /> life.  No matter what part of the county you go to, there are complaints that the local dispensary is not stocked with this, that, or the other, that it is understocked, and there is also the incident I gave of the man who went to the local authority doctor a few months ago and got a bottle of something or other.  He took it for a few days but he did not improve and he went to a private doctor who prescribed some kind of expensive drug&mdash;I forget what he told me he had to pay&mdash;and it cured him within 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not worry about that unduly.  The Deputy's statement about the local authorities getting cheap medicines and drugs is a very serious allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>These are complaints that every public representative has to listen to especially in the rural areas where the dispensaries always seem to be understocked.  I have taken this matter up with the local authority, and have found that their case usually is that they do not want to have large stocks of medicines in these rural dispensaries because they deteriorate after <Col N="1236" /> a certain time, and possibly it is dangerous to use them if they are left for a few months.  That may be a valid excuse in some respects, but where the health of the people is involved, it should not continue.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that steps are being taken to improve this system, and I hope the administration of the new health services will prove to be as good, in a sense, as the present system, because a lot could be said for the county system of administration. People are better known to the local officials.  They are in contact with them on matters besides health.  If the regional committees consist of people from each district we will have a better service, because the county boundaries cause injustices in some cases.  We had incidents of one family living on one side of a boundary with certain means, and another family on the other side of the boundary with similar means, one having a medical card and the other not having a medical card.</P>

      <P>The latest financial year for which all the information sought by the Deputy is available is 1964-65.</P>
      <P>Up to 31st March, 1965, expenditure from public moneys on airports construction and on share capital in Aer Rianta subscribed by the Minister for Finance amounted to £23.9 million. Receipts of a capital nature were negligible.  The expenditure on airport construction amounted to £11 million. The following is a summary of the financial outcome of the operation of the Airports up to 31st March, 1965:</P>
      <P>Receipts, £13.7 million.  Expenditure (air navigation services and airports management including pension liability), £15.1 million.  Operating deficit, £1.4 million.  Interest and depreciation, £9.4 million.  Gross deficit, £10.8 million.</P>
      <P>The total amount subscribed by the Minister for Finance to the share capital of Aer Rianta up to 31st March, 1965, was £12.95 million.  Aer Rianta in turn subscribed £5.7 million to Aer Lingus and £6.9 million to Aerlínte retaining £350,000 for its own capital purposes including £300,000 for investment in Irish and Intercontinental Hotels Limited.  No capital was invested in any other company in respect of air navigation and transport.  No dividends on capital investment in the air companies have been paid.  If a dividend at the rate of five per cent had been paid from the time that the capital was provided, receipts by the Minister for Finance would have amounted to £3.5 million.</P>

      <P>The position of the Industrial Engineering Company, Dundalk, has been under continuing examination both before and since the date of the Deputy's question of 9th April, 1964. As a result of this examination, the Government recently decided that further Exchequer support for the Dundalk group is not justified and the Industrial Credit Company, as debenture holders, were asked by the Government to appoint a receiver to administer the affairs of the Industrial Engineering Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the agreements under which the debenture loans were made.</P>
      <P>The information requested in the final part of the Deputy's question is: (a) accumulated losses of the Dundalk group of companies to 31st March, 1965 (the latest date for which audited accounts are available), £1,842,354 and (b) total number at present employed in the group, 675.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> Under the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; introduced in 1963-64 following on recommendations in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, a single assessment is made on the taxpayer in respect of his total income.  The amount of tax due is stated in one sum without regard to the particular Schedules under which the relevant income arises.  The tax referable to particular Schedules does not emerge under the new system and accordingly figures are not available, for 1963-64 or subsequent years, of the net produce of tax under each Schedule.</P>
    <P>As regards Schedule E tax, however, since it consists almost wholly of tax collected under PAYE and under Rule 11 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt.</P>
    <P>The amount of income tax collected under Schedule E in 1964-65 was £22.5 million approximately of which £18.9 million was referable to Pay As You Earn.  It is estimated that the Schedule E tax to be collected in 1965-66 will amount to approximately £26.4 million of which £21.3 million will be collected under Pay As You Earn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> If the Deputy puts down a further question after the Easter recess, I shall be glad to give him particulars of the actual out-turn of the Schedule E collection for 1965-66.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following is the text of the circular letter which was issued on 24th February, 1966:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">Labourers Act, 1965.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Sale of Labourers Cottages.</P>
      <P>1.  I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to enclose a copy of the Labourers Act, 1965, which became law on the 3rd November.  This circular letter does not purport to contain a comprehensive review of the provisions of the Act, which should be studied in detail by the appropriate officers of the housing authority.</P>
      <P>2.  Section 17 of the Labourers Act, 1936, provides that a vested cottage (which, in this context, includes a plot) shall not, during the period for the payment of the annuity, be alienated otherwise than by devise or by operation of law or by sale with the consent of the housing authority.  The section also provides that a cottage shall not be subdivided or used otherwise than for the accommodation of an agricultural labourer and his family.</P>
      <P>3.  Section 21 of the 1936 Act provides that a vested cottage may not, during the period for the payment of the annuity, be mortgaged or charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  These provisions were designed to ensure that cottages provided from public funds would continue to be used for the accommodation of agricultural <Col N="1093" /> labourers and their families notwithstanding the sale by housing authorities of the cottages to their occupants. With the passage of time the provisions have been found to be unduly restrictive. Section 2 (1) of the Labourers Act, 1965, provides for some relaxation by enabling a housing authority to consent to the mortgaging, charging, alienation or subdivision of a cottage.  The relaxation is not intended in any sense as a general departure from the policy that cottages should be used as far as possible for the accommodation of persons in need of housing.</P>
    <P>5.  In accordance with this general objective, a housing authority should normally consent, under section 2 (1) of the Act of 1965, to the mortgaging or charging of a cottage or plot only where the mortgage or charge is intended to secure a loan for the reconstruction or improvement of the cottage or for some other housing purpose.</P>
    <P>6.  Similarly, section 2 (2) will strengthen the powers of the housing authority to refuse consent to the sale of a cottage by a vested owner if they consider that the sale would not be in the best interests of housing policy. Before the enactment of the provision there was doubt as to whether an authority could refuse consent to a sale solely on the grounds that the proposed purchaser was not an agricultural labourer.  It was also doubtful if they could refuse consent even if the proposed sale would leave the vendor or his family without accommodation&mdash;thus, perhaps, again throwing the responsibility for housing them on the authority.  Section 2 (2) gets over these difficulties by providing specifically that a housing authority may refuse consent to the alienation of the cottage if they are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the person to whom it is intended to alienate the cottage is not a person in need of housing, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the alienation would leave the vendor or his dependants without suitable housing.</P>
    <P>7.  These two criteria should, therefore, be applied by a housing authority when a request for their consent to the sale of a cottage is received.  If the <Col N="1094" /> proposed purchaser is a person in need of housing but not an agricultural labourer as statutorily defined, the Minister would be prepared to consent to the suspension by the authority of the conditions of section 17 of the Labourers Act, 1936, which require that the cottage shall not be used except for the accommodation of an agricultural labourer and his family. Similarly, if the purchaser is a farmer buying the cottage for the accommodation of a workman, the Minister would not object to consent being given by the authority where no other eligible purchaser is forthcoming who would be willing to use the cottage for his own accommodation.  In all cases where the consent of the authority is sought to the sale of a cottage to a person who is not in need of housing, the authority should consider if purchase by them to meet an ascertained housing need would be justified.</P>
    <P>8.  Where the sale or transfer of a cottage is proposed and the housing authority are agreeable, section 2 (3) of the Act of 1965 enables them, before consenting, to require the annuity to be redeemed.  Alternatively, they may, under section 2 (5), consent without requiring redemption of the annuity. If the plot or part of the plot held with a cottage is being charged, mortgaged or subdivided, the authority are required, under section 2 (4), to apportion the annuity and, where a sale or transfer is involved, to require to be redeemed the part of it which relates to the land being divided from the cottage.</P>
    <P>9.  When an annuity or apportioned part of an annuity is redeemed in full, all the restrictions on the sale of the property to which the annuity or part relates, the uses to which it may be put, and on mortgaging, subdivision, etc., will, under section 4, cease and the property could, for instance, be used without reference to the housing authority for business purposes or resold by the purchaser at a profit.  The Act also permits of the redemption of part of an annuity on a cottage.  Where this happens, the restrictions will cease to apply to such extent as the authority may, by order, determine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> 10.  An amount for the redemption of the annuity based on a purely mathematical calculation of the present value of the annuity, which is generally small, would yield a figure disproportionately low in relation to the benefits to the purchaser of having the property freed from the existing restrictions.  Accordingly, the amount which the Minister will be prepared to approve under section 3, for the redemption of an annuity, will be assessed on the basis of the current market value of the cottage (or, if appropriate, of the plot or part of the plot) at the date redemption is proposed, due allowance being made for the number of years for which the annuity has been paid on the cottage. For example, if a cottage has a market value free from annuity and other statutory conditions of £800 and the annuity has been paid for 15 years out of a total payment period of 40 years, the purchaser should get credit for 15/40ths of the market value, i.e., £300, so that the amount which he should normally be required to pay for redemption would be £500.  Where, following subdivision, a <i>bona fide</i> sale or transfer of a plot as a housing site for a member of the family or of the household of the vested owner is proposed, the authority may accept in redemption only the present value of the part of the annuity apportioned by them in respect of the plot.</P>
    <P>11.  Where a housing authority wish to ensure that the statutory restrictions will continue to apply to a cottage which the vested owner proposes to sell, and, at the same time consider that they should get some benefit from a transaction which their capital and work made possible, they should require payment to them of an amount under section 2 (5).  The amount which the Minister would be prepared to approve for the purposes of this subsection will normally be not less than one-third of the current market value of the interest being sold, subject to the proviso that, in general, the amount paid to the authority should not exceed the price that would have to be paid under subsection 2 (3) for the redemption <Col N="1096" /> of the annuity (and consequent freeing of the cottage from the statutory conditions).  Where, however, a <i>bona fide</i> transfer or assignment to a member of the family or of the household of the vested owner is proposed, the authority should not require any payment to them as a condition of their consent.</P>
    <P>12.  Section 3 provides that an annuity or any part of an annuity may, if the housing authority think fit, be redeemed by the person liable to pay it.  Thus, the purchaser of a cottage could, independently of any question of sale or transfer, redeem his annuity if the authority agreed.  The amount for redemption of which the Minister would normally be prepared to approve in these circumstances is as set out in paragraph 10.</P>
    <P>13.  Individual cases under paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 should, until further notice, be submitted for the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>14.  Moneys received by a council in respect of the redemption of an annuity or under subsection 2 (5) of the Act should be used for a housing capital purpose such as the provision of additional housing, the payment of supplementary grants, the redemption of loans, etc.  Subsidy will cease in respect of any cottage on which the annuity is redeemed.</P>
    <P>15.  The Land Registry should be notified of all cases in which annuities are redeemed or apportioned so that they may make any necessary amendments in their records.  The details should be given in the form of a simple certificate containing any information necessary for identification of the cottage concerned and for rectification of the register.</P>
    <P>16.  This circular replaces circular No. H.7/59 of 28th May, 1959, dealing with the sale of vested cottages.</P>

      <P>I am giving particulars of applications advertised and registered rather than accepted, as given in the reply to which the Deputy refers, because I think that the figures in this form give a more accurate picture of the position.</P>
      <P>The numbers of applications for the registration of trade marks which were received, advertised in the Official Journal and registered in the year ended 31st March 1964 were 1733, 1170 and 1004 respectively.  The number of applications which were regarded as abandoned, withdrawn or refused in the same period was 375. The percentage of marks advertised to applications received was 67.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figures for the year ended 31st March, 1965 were 1,873, 1,531, 1,431, 404 and 81.7 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>I think I should warn the Deputy that these percentage figures may be misleading, as many of the applications dealt with in a particular year would have been received in a prior year.</P>
