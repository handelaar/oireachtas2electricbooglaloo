      <P>The Government's plans for increasing employment are set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  As indicated in the Progress Report for 1965, the increase in employment has fallen short of the targets, and the necessary studies are in hand to identify the factors responsible for the shortfall and to consider what remedial action should be taken.  The results of these studies will be published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the National Industrial Economic Council recently came to the conclusion that, subject to certain assumptions, the industrial targets set for 1970 by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> remain capable of achievement.</P>

An estimate is made of the total number at work in respect of the month of April each year, but such estimates are not available until early the following year because of the fact that the returns on which these estimates are based take a considerable time to collect.  The latest estimate is in respect of April, 1965, when the total number of persons at work was 1,050,000 of whom 338,000 were engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing and 712,000 were engaged in other branches of economic activity.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that numbers of CIE wages grade pensioners receive a pension of £1 2s. 6d. a week after 37 years service, and of £2 11s. 3d. after 42 years service; and if he will now consider the whole question of CIE pensions for those who retired some time ago with a view to providing them with pensions more in accord with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The categories of wages grade pensioners referred to in the Deputy's question are among those who retired from the service of CIE prior to April, 1963.  The retirement benefit of these pensioners must take account of social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>In addition to their CIE pension these pensioners are entitled to social welfare benefits particularly the contributory old age pension which is payable at 70 years of age.  The contributory old age pension which in April, 1963 stood at £1 15s. 0d. for a single man and £4 for a married man has since been increased to £2 7s. 6d. for a single man and £5 7s. 6d. for a married man.  CIE pensioners who opted for £2 11s. 3d. rate of pension reducing to 22/6 at 70 years, now have a total pension plus social welfare income from 70 years of age of £4 2s. 6d a week in the case of a single man and £6 10s. a week for a married man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the existing members of the CIE Wages Grade Pension Scheme were prepared to agree to an amendment of the Scheme to provide for an increase in the rates of pension payable to these pre-April, 1963 pensioners, the full cost of any such increase <Col N="8" /> would fall to be borne by CIE on an ex-gratia basis.  The Deputy is already fully aware of the difficult financial position of the Board at the present time and of the causes of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to make a recommendation to the pensions board of CIE that the pensions be upped?  Does he still say that in assessing the pensions of CIE employees there should be a means test to the extent of taking into consideration the old age pension to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 24th May, the company propose to take two unit load vessels on time charter to cater for the growing trade in this category.  I understand that these vessels which are newly built were specially designed for unit load transport.  The company have informed me that the volume of their unit load service increased by 50 per cent in 1965 and that the rate of growth has since accelerated.  The company, therefore, have to charter suitable tonnage if they are not to lose the traffic available to them.  This course will also have the advantage that it enables the company to gain first hand experience for the planning of new ships for this particular trade.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Dublin Corporation that plans for the development <Col N="15" /> of Maryfield Estate were first lodged with them in 1953 and by order dated 17th June, 1953, general planning permission for the development was granted subject to conditions, one of which related to the provision and maintenance of an open space at the north-west corner of the estate.  General permission was granted on 1st December, 1954 in respect of a revised layout, again subject to conditions. One of these conditions provided that the playing fields and open spaces proposed to be provided should be level-led, soiled and grassed and bounded by a six feet high fence to the satisfaction of the Corporation and that the spaces be dedicated to the residents, who would be responsible for maintenance. In January, 1955, an appeal was made to the Minister for Local Government against this condition and other conditions and on 16th November, 1955, the Minister dismissed the appeal and affirmed the condition relating to the open spaces which had been imposed by the Corporation.</P>
    <P>Development work commenced on the Estate in 1954 and subsequently, house plans and layout designs for various sections of the Estate were lodged with the Corporation.  The last permission in respect of these was granted on 26th June, 1963.  Houses on the Estate were completed at various dates since 1954.</P>
    <P>On 8th September, 1965, application was made to the Corporation for permission to erect 30 houses on a site which was designated as playing fields and open space on the plans previously approved.  Permission was refused by the Corporation on 22nd October, 1965, and an appeal against this decision was lodged with me on the 24th November, 1965.  An oral hearing of the appeal has been requested. Objections against the proposed development have been received by me from several residents in the area and from the Maryfield Residents Association and it will be open to these parties to be present or to be represented at the oral hearing which will be arranged in the near future.</P>
    <P>I understand that no work on the <Col N="16" /> development of the open space, apart perhaps from some levelling of the site, has been undertaken by the developers. I am not aware of what assurances or guarantees about the open space were given by them to prospective house purchasers.  Any question of breach of contract is a matter between the parties concerned and is one in which I have no functions.  Sections 31 and 35 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1965, empower planning authorities to take enforcement action against landowners and developers where development is not carried out in conformity with the permission granted.</P>
    <P>In considering the appeal I shall take all relevant factors into account, including the objections received by me from local residents.  At this stage I could not say what the decision on the appeal will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the developer in question, who, I understand, is a very close supporter and associate of the Fianna Fáil organisation, subsequent to the approval of the Corporation of the plan of development subject to certain works being carried out, deliberately ploughed up the fields and interfered with the enjoyment by the householders there of even their native soil?  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that there is some responsibility on him to secure that there is not this blatant avoidance of the planning requirements?</P>

If the Deputy informs me of any particular difficulty which may have arisen in the interpretation of the Act or of the circular, I will be glad to assist him as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any general delay in the giving of consent by county councils to sales of vested cottages.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the Waterford County Council will, with the money sanctioned by his Department, be able to build only eight extra cottages in the coming year notwithstanding that there are over 60 approved applicants and a further 60 who are seeking approval for new cottages; and if in view of the dire need for accommodation he will consider sanctioning the proposals to complete the cottages for the 60 odd approved applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. I understand that the Waterford County Council expect to complete about 98 cottages in all in the current financial year, as compared with 42 last year.</P>
      <P>The allocation in respect of new works was related to the number of tender proposals before the Department at the time of the making of the allocation.  There are proposals to accept tenders for 21 cottages at present before the Department and the housing authority's decision is awaited as to which of these they wish to proceed with out of their present capital allocation.  I understand that with savings on the amount allocated to commitments the housing authority expect to be able to proceed with 16 cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as approval to further tenders is concerned, the housing <Col N="19" /> authority have been informed that the position will be the subject of review in the light of the capital situation later in the year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the amount of capital moneys allocated to (a) Dublin Corporation and (b) each of the remaining local authorities who are housing authorities in the country for each of the years 1964-65, 1965-66, and 1966-67 for each of the following purposes: (i) construction of local authority houses directly or on behalf of the local authorities concerned, (ii) advances of loans for purchase of houses, e.g. SDA loans, and (iii) supplementary housing grants.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 146 of 27th April in which I set out particulars of the housing capital allocated to each housing authority for the current financial year.  No corresponding allocations were made for the years 1964-65 and 1965-66.  Global figures of capital provided in these years are however available and I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report, a statement setting out the total allocations for 1966-67 for the housing purposes referred to by the Deputy, together with the total amounts of capital provided under the same headings within each of the two previous financial years.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>As regards local authority housing schemes and sanitary services works, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 19 of the 28th April last.  Since then seven housing schemes involving ten or more dwellings and 38 rural cottages estimated, in all, to cost £317,120, have been approved, while proposals involving one further housing scheme and 47 rural cottages, together with one sanitary services scheme have been received.  The aggregate value of all housing and sanitary services schemes now awaiting sanction is approximately £5¼ million, of which £2.16 million relates to local authority housing.</P>
      <P>As regards the other information requested by the Deputy, its compilation would involve detailed examination of a large number of applications for both loan and overdraft accommodation which would involve serious disruption of current work in my Department. Applications for loans to finance house purchasing and supplementary grants are being recommended and sanctioned without undue delay, within the limits of the appropriate capital allocation.</P>
      <P>On the general questions of expediting house building and financing operations, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on the Adjournment Debate on 18th May, 1966.</P>

      <P>Planning authorities have wide powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to provide or preserve rights of access.  Such an authority may include as an objective in their development plan under the Act the preservation of any existing public right of way giving access to seashore, mountain, lakeshore, riverbank or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility, whereupon the <Col N="27" /> authority must take all steps necessary to secure the objective.</P>
      <P>A planning authority may also enter into an agreement for the creation of a public right of way over land, or may create one by order subject to a right of appeal to the Minister, and payment of compensation where appropriate. Where a public right of way is created, or a provision relating to its preservation is included in a development plan, the way must be maintained by the planning authority and penalties are provided on conviction for obstruction.  The erection of fencing in association with the development of land may also be controlled. I have recently brought these powers and responsibilities to the notice of all planning authorities and have asked them to examine the extent to which they require to be used in their areas.</P>

      <P>Children's allowances are payable in respect of all children under 16 years resident in the State and there is no provision in existing legislation for payment beyond that age.  It would involve a fundamental change in the present children's allowances scheme to introduce the principle of differentiation as between one group of children and another, and while I may say that I have had under consideration the question of making some special provision under the Children's Allowances Scheme for handicapped children generally, I am not yet convinced that this would be <Col N="29" /> the best way of dealing with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle underlying the cessation of the children's allowance at 16 is the presumption that such a child can secure employment or have the capacity to earn.  If it is manifest that the child has not the capacity to earn at the age 16 to 21 when it would get a disability allowance if it were mentally handicapped, or unable to earn its living, is there not a case to be made from the Minister's point of view, as distinct from that of the Minister for asking his colleague to extend the benefit of the disability allowance to this restricted category?</P>

    <P>Section 73 (1) (g) of the Factories Act, 1955 enables an inspector, should he so wish, to have a safety delegate, if there is one, accompany him on his tour of inspection of a factory and the essential point in this is, that no one can legally object to the safety delegate accompanying the inspector if the <Col N="35" /> inspector wishes him to do so.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this is a better arrangement than to make it illegal for an inspector to carry out his duties unless he is accompanied by a safety delegate.</P>

      <P>The question of restrictive trade practices in relation to the supply of timber was investigated in detail by the Fair Trade Commission in the course of a public inquiry held in 1953 and 1954 into the supply and distribution of building materials and components.  Following the report of the Inquiry, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made an Order entitled the Restrictive Trade Practices (Building Materials) Order, 1955, which came into force on 26th April, 1956.  This Order prohibits restrictions on entry to the trade, resale price maintenance and collective price fixing in relation to building materials, including timber.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence that the terms of the Order are not being adhered to or that restrictive trade practices on the part of the Timber Trade Federation of the United Kingdom or other trade associations are leading to an undue increase in the price of timber.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>While the prices of young cattle in recent months have not reached the record levels of the early part of 1965, they have been at about the same levels as in the corresponding part of 1964. Prices this year have, of course, been affected by the adverse weather in recent months but with improved weather conditions and with grass becoming more plentiful it is reasonable to expect that the market for young cattle will now tend to improve, although the full benefits of the improvement may be delayed somewhat by the effects of the shipping strike.</P>
      <P>The prices of older cattle are, of course, supported by the subsidy on exports of carcase beef to Britain and by the arrangement whereby Irish store cattle fattened in Britain or Northern Ireland qualify for guarantee payments under the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme.  These valuable support arrangements have a significant influence on the prices of all cattle here, including those of young cattle.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of public dissatisfaction that sentences imposed on persons convicted of theft and personal assault do not effectively discourage such crimes; and if he will introduce legislation to increase the maximum sentences which may be imposed in such cases and to provide for minimum sentences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence of any public dissatisfaction with decisions of the criminal courts, generally.</P>
      <P>It may appear from the necessarily abbreviated accounts of cases published in the newspapers that some penalties are unduly lenient but it must be appreciated that the trial Judge's assessment of the punishment which is proper for the offence is, subject to law, the only possible course.</P>
      <P>The maximum sentences for the offences of theft and personal assault, referred to by the Deputy, are severe by any standards.  The maximum penalty for simple larceny is five years penal servitude and related offences, such as robbery with violence, are punishable by much heavier penalties. The maximum penalty for common assault is six months imprisonment and various serious assaults are punishable by much heavier penalties, some by penal servitude for life.</P>
      <P>Certain cases of theft and assault may be dealt with by a District Justice who cannot impose a heavier sentence than 12 months imprisonment, but the District Justice, before dealing with a criminal charge, must be of opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.</P>
      <P>Minimum penalties are bad in principle, are rare in existing law and would be totally unsuitable in the case of the offences in question which can vary widely in triviality and seriousness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, in the circumstances of the moment it is somewhat difficult.  The answer to my original question was very lengthy. When the Minister refers to the fact that the only avenues open to the public, in so far as reports of the administration of justice are concerned, are the reports appearing in the newspapers, does he not consider that, on that basis, there is room for public concern as to the general leniency &mdash; one can find no other word for it &mdash; in the operation of the law where serious crime is committed by individuals and groups which sometimes results in the terrorisation of neighbourhoods?  Does the Minister not realise that this is not good enough?  Will he take whatever steps are open to him to let the justices know that they are there to protect the community and that the community are concerned with the present position so far as reports are concerned?</P>

      <P>That in the case of the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966, the proceedings on the five stages there-of and on the Money Resolution in Committee on Finance and on Report in connection therewith, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7th June, 1966, by putting from the Chair forthwith the Questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion: Provided that after the said hour on the said day</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to register a strong protest against the terms of this motion.  This is not the first time the present Government attempted to introduce &mdash; regrettably but unsuccessfully &mdash; what is in fact a guillotine motion.  The purpose of this motion is to have passed through all its Stages the Bill called the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966.  It is now 4 o'clock and Dáil Éireann is expected to discuss the Second Stage, the Committee Stage, the Report Stage and the Final Stage of this Bill, a Bill which has very wide implications, in a matter of 6½ hours.  The Taoiseach particularly must understand that the contents of this Bill were only made known to me, and I believe to Deputy Cosgrave of Fine Gael, yesterday afternoon. As a matter of fact, it has not been in my possession 24 hours yet. I do not think this is quite good enough.  If I had not been in Dublin yesterday, it is debatable if I would have received this Bill before late last night or some time this morning.  But I happened to hear the news on Radio Éireann to the effect that the Government intended to introduce the legislation to which I refer.  Immediately I decided to come to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and I, being Leaders of Parties, are in the position that we were acquainted late yesterday afternoon with the contents of this Bill; but I do not think the Government can afford to ignore every single one of the 144 Deputies of Dáil Éireann.  Many of them travelled 200 miles or over this morning.  While the contents of the Bill were in my possession, I do not think it is seriously proposed that my Party&mdash;let the Fine Gael Party speak for themselves&mdash;particularly with our special interest in trade union legislation, could be expected to examine the Bill in all its details or to <Col N="48" /> try to foresee its implications within such a short period.</P>
    <P>This is an absolute guillotine and curtailment of debate.  As far as our Party are concerned, no matter what the decision on this motion is, we propose to discuss it as far as ever we can.  I do not think the Taoiseach is doing justice, not alone to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party but in particular to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of trade unions.  Maybe they welcome this sort of guillotine in that, as members of trade unions, they will be pleased not to have the opportunity of discussing a Bill which in effect is an incursion on the rights of the trade union movement and of individual workers.  As it is, only a few speakers can participate. This was our experience in September, 1961, when there was an attempt, which subsequently proved abortive, to introduce legislation somewhat similar to this.</P>
    <P>This is an important and unprecedented measure as far as freedom of action by the individual and by the trade union movement is concerned. It may be quite a popular thing for the Taoiseach to do in present circumstances. Apart from the circumstances, which again are debatable, I do not think he should avail of this occasion to use the big stick to frighten and disrupt the trade union movement. This motion does not provide any worthwhile time for amendments.  If I or members of my Party put down amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage, according to this motion if they are not reached by 10.30 p.m. they will not be taken.  On the other hand, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any members of the Government decide they will put down amendments, their amendments will be decided.  That applies only to members of the Government.  Therefore, no matter what amendments are promoted from this side of the House, from people who have been all their lives in the trade union movement, they cannot be decided on because the Fianna Fáil Government want to curtail this debate to 6½ hours.  We therefore propose to oppose this motion and to vote against it.  We are not <Col N="49" /> going to be stampeded by agreeing to this closure motion into a commitment which may have serious repercussions not alone on the trade union movement but on the whole economy of the country.  The Taoiseach and the Government ought to give further thought to this legislation so that that sort of damage may not be done.</P>
    <P>This Bill interferes with the right of trade unions and the rights of their individual members.  This motion interferes with the rights of Deputies.  I have heard Deputy Dillon on many occasions talking about the rights of every Deputy as an elected representative to be given time in this House to express his opinions as long and as fully as he wishes.  If this motion is passed by this House, there will be a curtailment to the extent that maybe only five, six or ten people can participate. For that reason, we oppose this motion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may feel there was urgency in this.  On the introduction of legislation to do certain other good things, we protested there was urgency. For example, we advocated in respect of Budget proposals for an increase in social welfare benefits that these be given quickly, but we were told it was not possible because the legislation had to be passed, as the machinery has to be exploited to the full.  The result is we do not get that sort of legislation until months after the Budget proposals. In this case there seems to be no difficulty in legislating against the trade union movement and against the individual.  There seems to be no difficulty whatsoever in having the parliamentary draftsman frame this sort of Bill within a matter of, if not hours, days.  Because, as I say, it will stifle debate, because we have not had sufficient opportunity to consider the Bill and to consult with our trade union colleagues, we propose to vote against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is good enough that Deputy Carty, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, should stand up here and say &ldquo;I move&rdquo; and immediately everybody should take it for granted that the democratic process is going to stand still and that we are going to <Col N="50" /> reverse the procedure which has been evolved here over the past 40 years. This is a complete denial of the rights and privileges of ordinary Deputies, and I am certain there must be somebody from among the ranks of the Government Party who feels respect for Parliament and respect for the Dáil, and who feels that, having been sent here, he has a responsibility to the voters in the constituency who elected him to look after their interests.</P>
      <P>If he is to be enabled to do that, the first requirement is that he should be made aware in the fullest possible sense of what he is going to talk about or what he is going to vote upon. However, it is very evident here that the Government decided, without consultation with anybody outside the Cabinet, that they were going to put down this motion and steamroll it through the House and have everything their own way.  It is not going to be so.  We intend to give the Government as much opposition on this as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>As to the content of this piece of legislation, we can suspect its general terms from having read the papers, but we know very little of the details because we have not been individually informed of what the Government intend to do.  Apart from that, I am concerned to discuss what Deputy Dillon so many times has valiantly guarded and fought for, that is, the rights and privileges of Deputies to be fully informed as to what is about to take place.  I have not seen this Bill and, apart from the Leaders of the main Opposition Parties, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish, I am just as wise as any other ordinary Deputy as to what it says in detail.  It may very well be there are people outside this House who know more about it than I do.  In fact, I am sure there are people outside this House who know far more about the contents of this Bill than the elected representatives of the people.  We, therefore, think that this incursion, as it has been described by Deputy Corish, upon the rights of Deputies must be brought to a halt at the first available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> In the normal course of events, the purpose of a motion of this kind would be to enable the eventual circulation of a Bill which we must consider at the same time and it would not meet with any opposition from us.  However, this is a guillotine or closure motion. As Deputy Corish has said, there might be time in the next six and a half hours for six to ten speakers out of a House of over 140 to give their views on what is being done here today or what the Government propose to do.  I would not think we would have time for anything like that number of speakers.  The progress here is nothing if not pedestrian, and I am quite certain speakers from the Government side will be introduced to drag out the agonised moments for their own purpose and that the amount of time given to Opposition speakers will be so manipulated that few voices will be heard.</P>
    <P>We contend the Government have an obligation to the elected Members of Dáil Éireann to provide them with the Bill which they have in mind so that they can study it, get time off to examine it and to look into its implications.  From what we hear and from the summaries I have read in the papers, its implications can be very serious so far as the trade union movement is concerned.  Rumour has it that it will take from workers a right they have always had, that there is a danger of making it impossible for workers to pursue their disputes in the manner in which they have done since 1913.  I know the reference to 1913 hurts some of them here but it is something which we hold dear.  The workers of this city, of this county, of this country, have not built up an organisation such as exists today, a model in many ways for the trade union movements of the world, to have it brought to nought by some mountebank politicians.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that we are very concerned&mdash;and we would be false to the people who founded this Party if we were other than concerned&mdash;at what the Government propose to do here today.  It is because of that concern and because also of the primary matter which we are discussing, the disregard and contempt shown by the Government for the ordinary Members of this House, that we are offering the hardest opposition we can to every step they propose to take.  It is to be thought that the Government might have taken something of a lesson from the events of the past week, the lesson being that they cannot go on forever flouting the wishes of the people to their own benefit, that they cannot go on forever living in a little world of their own, detached from the people, that they cannot ride rough-shod over the people, looking after their own friends and forgetting about everybody else.</P>
      <P>This should have been evident to the Government from the events of the past week but I know there are some upon whom the facts of political life never impinge.  There are some who see things only through the rose-tinted spectacles of their own Party and cannot see any other view.  The people have shown otherwise; they have shown that there are more sides to the picture than one and that there are more things in the political spectrum than just the one evergreen view.  This demonstration on the part of the people will, I think, extend and go further and when the time comes, they will make it even more effective in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But here is another example of how the Government can attempt to destroy completely the rights of the ordinary citizen as represented by the ordinary Deputy.  This is a piece of dictatorship, this closure motion which we have here today, which leads on to belief in the omnipotence of the Party in power, which leads on to their self-delusion that they, and only they, know what is good for the people, which leads on eventually to their downfall. <Col N="53" /> We are not standing for it.  We are standing first, at this moment of time, on this day, on the principle that every Member of this House should be fully informed as to what is proposed to be done by any Bill upon which he is being asked to vote.  He should have time enough to consider what is contained in the Bill and there should be no guillotine on that consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputies should be either naïve or legalistic about this.  Every Deputy in the House is, I think, aware that the country yesterday was faced with a situation of critical significance, a situation which involved the livelihood of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Irish workers, as well as widespread public inconvenience.  We may be faced with that situation again.  It is certainly a situation in which the public expect the Dáil to take action and to take action having regard to the rights of workers to livelihoods and even perhaps the right to life itself. If the Dáil does not agree to dispose of this Bill today so that the Seanad can deal with it tomorrow, then of course we are into a situation where if the worst happens the enactment of legislation necessary to deal with it will not become possible until next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil is entitled to express very strong criticism of the manner in which this matter has been handled by the Government.  The Taoiseach implied in his remarks a few moments ago that the House and the country were aware of the situation. Of course they are and the only people who appear to be unaware of the gravity of it are the Government.  This motion which amounts to a strict limitation on time for discussion is not the first motion of this sort to be introduced here.  We have a precedent within the memory of virtually every Deputy in the House and certainly within the memory of every Minister.  That precedent is less than five years old.  On <Col N="55" /> that occasion the motion was introduced after a special meeting of the Dáil had been summoned.  It was moved by the Taoiseach who, in the course of his remarks in response to some queries, said that the motion would not be introduced unless the situation was of the utmost gravity. The motion today is introduced almost inaudibly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who advances no reason or cause why it should be considered.  It is implied of course in the newspaper reports and in the general consternation that exists throughout the country that not merely are the lives of people in danger and threatened but also that the employment of 180,000 workers is in jeopardy.  That is common knowledge.  This has not been brought forward to the Dáil by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>It is suggested here that because of the gravity of the situation the timetable should be abridged.  If the situation is as serious as we believe it is, we have no objection on this side of the House to curtailing the normal time of debate but what we suggest is that the House might adjourn and allow Deputies&mdash;these other Deputies who have not been given a copy of this measure&mdash;time to read it.  Deputies are entitled to get time to read it.  It is quite wrong to suggest that in the case of a Bill of this sort, dealing with a matter which abridges and seriously restricts the rights of workers to organise and affects the principles under which trade unions operate, full opportunity should not be given to Deputies to read the measure.  Subject to that limitation, if it is contended&mdash;and the only suggestion here is by implication from a remark of the Taoiseach that the situation is serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What we are discussing at the moment is motion No. 6 which purports to limit the time of the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.  We are against that.  As an individual member of this House, I am entitled to know what legislation I am being expected to enact.  I do not know what that legislation is as yet.  I have not yet got a copy of the Bill.  I am entitled to get a copy, to study it and to make up my mind on it.  From the newspaper reports and from the rumours we have heard, it does appear to us that this is a vital piece of legislation.  It is not good enough in my case, as an individual Deputy, that in an hour's or two hours' time, I am to get a copy of the Bill and then be expected to come in here and discuss it in all its stages and then, in approximately four or five hours, be asked to pass this vital measure.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that he is doing a great disservice to this Parliament and to this House, the standards of which we are all anxious to maintain at a high level, if he expects that legislation of this nature can be rushed through it without allowing each and every one of the over 140 Deputies to speak on all stages of it.  If he intends to do that, he is doing a great disservice to the House.</P>

Next week we will have one for CIE, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Irish Shipping and Aer Lingus.  I do not want to make any political capital out of this and I hope the Taoiseach will take our arguments in the way we are putting them to him, but this is an important matter from our point of view and from the point of view of democracy, and I think he should have second thoughts about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made here to my concern for the working of Parliament.  I think the time has come for every one of us here to ask ourselves the question: &ldquo;Are we going to demonstrate to our people that Parliament in this country is capable of acting?&rdquo;  We can conduct all kinds of acrimonious disputes across this House and the net result of it will be that our own people will say that Parliament has ceased to function for the purpose of maintaining the society in which we live.</P>
      <P>I do not want in these circumstances to introduce a note of acrimony but I think it is a desperate error of judgment on the part of the Leader of the House&mdash;because, remember, the Taoiseach was not only elected by this House to be the Head of the Government; he was elected to be Leader of the House&mdash;not to have realised the significance of the motion he has set before us and not to have recognised his obligation of explaining deliberately to the House the reason why he asked Deputies to waive their inalienable right and responsibility to give individual consideration to a grave legislative matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Taoiseach should have risen here today and told the House of any serious peril such as they have been led to believe might arise, such as we were called upon to prepare ourselves for yesterday but are reassured this morning is now more remote.  I do not know.  It is a grotesque situation that a person of my experience in this House should find himself in a position at this hour <Col N="60" /> to get up and say: &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;. The Taoiseach ought to be in a position to say: &ldquo;If you were listening to what I have told the House now, you ought to know&rdquo;.  He has not told us anything.</P>
    <P>I am not getting to my feet to belittle the Taoiseach.  I am merely directing his attention to the fact that he has greatly increased the difficulty &mdash;and I am sure Deputy Cosgrave will agree with me, and probably Deputy Corish&mdash;of correctly evaluating the situation.  For all of us who love Parliament and individual liberty, he has made it ten times more difficult to handle this situation with prudence and with the resolution that the country expects Parliament to show in the presence of any situation which could be properly described-properly described&mdash;as a national emergency.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say that Parliament is paralysed in the presence of a national emergency.  There is no more effective instrument to deal with a real national emergency than a representative Parliament because, if we all speak here today with a united voice, we speak for all the people and it would be a thousand times better, whatever the situation is, if we could find a basis of agreement on all sides to deal with this specific emergency. I think that has been made extremely difficult by the approach of the Taoiseach in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in fairness, I should tell the Deputy that each of the Opposition Parties was informed yesterday of the intention to ask the Dáil to dispose of this business today and I was not informed of any objection to that course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy MacEntee was mistaken in saying that the procedural problem was insurmountable.  I think the text of the Bill could be made available to all Deputies through the machinery of a White Paper.  If you want to get over the technical business <Col N="61" /> that you cannot print a Bill until the House has authorised its printing, you can issue a White Paper.  I do not doubt the document is in print.  Let it be circulated to Deputies, not as a Bill but as a White Paper.  Then we can consider this motion in the light of the contents of the White Paper and if our Labour colleagues here feel, having read the White Paper, that they could not in conscience vote for the motion, then they will vote against it.  Do not let us lose our heads.  I want to be able to say down the country, whether I agree with the members of the Labour Party or not, that they acted coldly, deliberately and did not lose their heads.  I want to be able to say to the whole country: &ldquo;Whatever we did, we did it coldly and deliberately, in the belief that we were doing what was in the best interests of the country&rdquo;.</P>

I am asking that such adjournment as the Leader of the Fine Gael Party has suggested should then be made so that we may all study the White Paper and I am asking then that we should return to the consideration of this motion.  I do most earnestly implore, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that when we return to the consideration of this motion, the Taoiseach would accept responsibility as Leader of the House for telling the House why he asks Deputies to abrogate the most sacred right they have, that is, to speak their minds in a free Parliament, not as delegates of any special interests but as responsible men and women elected by our people (1) to see that the fundamental rights of the people are defended and (2) to demonstrate before the world that Parliament works in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights and wrongs of this measure do not enter my mind at the moment.  What I am anxious to ascertain is: does this House believe in democracy?  Following on what Deputy Dillon has said, it is only right and proper that every member of this <Col N="62" /> House must be made familiar with what is being put before the House. It is quite obvious that that has not happened up to the moment.  One must question the motives of the person or persons trying to perpetrate what is sought to be perpetrated at the moment on this House.  In that regard, I am entitled to ascertain why the introduction of this measure should be made by somebody who has not any particular responsibility for this situation we are presented with.  I do believe the Minister for Transport and Power should face up to his responsibilities and put the measure he intends to introduce before this House and put it properly and make argument for it.  As we operate in a democratic State, we should be afforded an opportunity of deciding upon whatever he says in that connection.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon when he advocates that we should be given an opportunity of discussing what exactly is being put before us because few, if any, of us, other than the Leaders of our respective Parties, know what this is all about.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party may know.  The Government may know.  The Leader of the Labour Party undoubtedly knows&mdash; he got short notice of it.  The fact remains that there are a number of persons elected to this House, and irrespective of any Party affiliation, it is right and proper for every member of this House to be afforded the opportunity of considering such a serious measure.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach or anybody else&mdash;or indeed the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to stand up and leisurely move something. Indeed, a case has not been made for what has been forced upon us and therefore, as I say, it is only proper that every Member should have an opportunity of considering what is placed before us.  That is what is expected of us by the people who elected us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very wrong of Deputy MacEntee who comes now and again to the forefront, and when it is convenient remains in the background, to start to tell us how we should conduct our affairs.  We are a democratic and, unfortunately, only a Twenty-Six <Col N="63" /> County state, and we purport to be democrats and that being so, it is obvious that we should afford the opportunity to every Member to consider whatever is being thrust upon us. If there is any value in the motion that is to be put before the House, then argument must be advanced for it.  It is only right to ask the man who is charged with responsibility for running the ESB about this, the man who is the cause of all the trouble, the Minister for Transport and Power, who has remained silent and will continue to remain silent for many reasons, and particularly because of his inactivity in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of politics, we are entitled to have the opportunity of considering any measure which comes into this House, otherwise we can be described outside as a State which filibusters matters through the particular House of Parliament.  I do not hold with that.  It could be said that this has to be taken as an emergency measure but surely this emergency has been in train for a number of weeks?  The Minister for Transport and Power should have been well aware of this but he was not.  Apparently the Taoiseach became aware of it and that being so, he had the opportunity, as indeed had the whole Cabinet, to set out their ideas in regard to legislation before this.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which does not affect only people employed in the ESB; it also affects countless numbers of workers in different types of employment who will be looking on, as indeed will countless numbers of employers. Bad example could be given by the manner in which this matter is being presented to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make just two or three short observations?  The Taoiseach said that he had been given advice that this was the right way to do this, but the advice was cockeyed and was based on what happened at a special session of the Dáil in 1961 when I happened to be the Opposition Whip.  The proper course, under Standing Orders &mdash; and we do this <Col N="64" /> regularly&mdash;is to move a motion before 8.30 on an ordinary sitting day.</P>
      <P>A mistake has been made and I do not want to score any political point but let us try to do the thing properly.  Let the Taoiseach move that further consideration be adjourned until 5.30.  Let the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduce his Bill immediately afterwards and then let the Dáil adjourn until 5.30 so that each Deputy can read the Bill and see what the Dáil is being asked to do and let everybody know where he is.</P>

      <P>We want to say that there can be no question of a gentleman's agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil because we consider the issues involved too important to be decided on in a haphazard or peremptory fashion.  We are aware that our stand on this matter is not a popular one.  If anybody could claim political capital, it is those who take an opposite view to ours.  It is not so much the 100 fitters and their rights which are in issue but the whole trade union movement which has been brought into the dock and in five hours this Parliament is to judge that movement and in five hours is to decide to alter the trade union law which has been formed over 50 years.  We say as the representatives, to some degree, of that movement that we do not intend to stand idly aside and see those rights whittled away.</P>
      <P>In recent months, in the middle of this industrial strife, there has grown up the idea that by bringing in the judicial concept and by compulsion, these issues can be solved.  Everybody in this Party, and I am sure in other Parties&mdash;many of the members are employers&mdash;knows that this is not so, that the issues that have been in dispute in recent months have their origin in economic problems and that introducing a conception of this sort into industrial relations will not bring any easy solution.  I do not see how this Parliament can presume to be resolute in a crisis if the impression is that this matter can be debated satisfactorily in four hours.  Not alone are the rights of Deputies infringed by this panic measure and, in dealing with a crisis in this fashion, the Government cannot be absolved from an accusation of panic, but the Government have, in my opinion, introduced this measure without adequate forethought and that is scarcely the way in which to deal with the very serious situation confronting us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this problem is one that has not arisen over a very short period of time.  I understand somewhat similar legislation was, brought before this House in 1961.  I understand that, following on that, a court of inquiry was set up and that court of inquiry in its report suggested <Col N="66" /> that the negotiating machinery of the ESB should be drastically altered and that the manual workers and clerical workers tribunals should be terminated and one tribunal set up.  I understand that has not been done.  I ask the Minister for Transport and Power why it has not been done and why, since panic is now the attitude of his Government, he, as the responsible Minister, did nothing in the months leading up to this crisis.  This claim was first introduced in November, 1964.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (c), page 4, line 28, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or who was so entitled, if he is still lawfully in possession of the lands, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This arises from a point I made on Second Reading.  Subsection (3) provides generally for the cases in which the fee simple can be acquired by purchasing out the ground rent.  I raised the question of a person who had the right, under the Reversionary Leases Act, 1958, to acquire a new lease and who, for one reason or another, possibly default on his own part, had forfeited that right.  The Minister thought at the time that such a case was in fact covered under subsection (2) (c).  I suggested that it seemed that the case was not fully covered because the concluding sentence of subsection (2) related only to the case of a person who is now entitled to a reversionary lease under the Act of 1958.  I was concerned for the person who had lost that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that, even though a person may have technically <Col N="72" /> lost his rights of renewal under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, the mere fact that he has lost his rights of renewal does not mean he has necessarily lost his rights to the land.  He may still be perfectly lawfully in possession of the lands.  It could be that neither himself nor the owner of the superior interest had in fact adverted at all to the effluxion of time and that, because of the passing of time, he was losing his rights to apply under the 1958 Act.  I suggest that, in those cases, once nothing irrevocable has been done and once the occupant of the land is still there, and still lawfully there, he should have the right to buy out the fee simple, to purchase out the ground rent, just as, in the other cases described in subparagraph (c) of section (3) (2), that is, a person who holds the land or held the land under a building lease which had expired, or a proprietary lease which has expired or who is entitled to be granted a reversionary lease under the Act of 1958.  If the Minister considers this, I think he will see that there is a case for putting the people whose case I am urging on a par with the others, with cases of those who hold under a building lease or a proprietary lease which has, in fact, expired.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept the principle of this amendment.  If he does not like the wording of my amendment, I am quite prepared to withdraw it and allow the matter to be considered by the Minister with the parliamentary draftsmen, between now and Report.  Indeed, that applies, to a greater or lesser extent, to the various amendments I have tabled. The Minister will appreciate that a Bill of this sort is very technical.  It is not very easy for Deputies, acting without the assistance of a parliamentary draftsman, to prepare amendments which will conform in all respects to what is required.  Therefore, if the Minister accepts the principle of any of these amendments, I should be quite happy to withdraw them and to allow the parliamentary draftsman to word them later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain <Col N="73" /> sympathy in that direction in connection with some later amendments by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins but with this particular one I am not so sympathetic. I feel that, under the existing law, particularly under the Reversionary Leases Act, 1958, there is ample protection already for the sort of case mentioned by the Deputy.  At the present time, the tenant has a statutory right to obtain a reversionary lease at any time up to 15 years before the expiry of that lease. There is the further protection that the landlord must give notice of expiration of the lease to the tenant.  The tenant then has three months after the expiry of the notice to seek his reversionary lease.  Having done that he can then proceed to act under this Bill when it becomes law and secure the purchase of his ground rent.  The sort of case where a tenant would neglect to act in the manner I have just mentioned would be one of gross neglect on the tenant's part.  I am not over-predisposed to spoonfeed the tenant too much.  Under the existing 1958 Act the tenant has this right within three months of receipt of a notice of termination of his lease to apply for a reversionary lease. He can then either get his reversionary lease&mdash;the terms of which are carefully controlled by the 1958 Act so as not to prejudice him&mdash;or he can apply to purchase his ground rent.  I feel he is safeguarded sufficiently well in that respect.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be correct in saying that there might be gross default on the part of the tenant and that he was, if you like, his own worst enemy in not getting his lease renewed.  That may be the case in a large number of cases.  But there is always, as the Minister well knows, the exceptional type of case where a tenant is absent, where possibly things go astray, where there might be illness or something of that sort in the house and the notice is overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entering into a completely <Col N="74" /> new departure here.  The general principle behind the Bill is to breach in a very dramatic way the whole concept of landlord and tenant law and get away entirely from the idea of leases. In those circumstances, it would seem to me that a person in the position I am talking of should at least get the benefit of the new broom regarding landlord and tenant law rather than that we should adopt the attitude that because he defaulted in the past, he will have to put up with the old position rather than have the benefit of the new.</P>

      <P>I have found in Midleton, where a row has been going on for the past two years in connection with the purchase of this estate by a certain bank and an auctioneer, that in the meantime a number of leases fell in.  I do not know under what law it was claimed but I have been given cases where the new landlord demanded on the new leases practically double or treble the previous rent.  The tenants naturally refused to pay.  In those circumstances, the Minister should consider the position of those tenants now.  The three months to which he referred have elapsed.  What is the position now of those tenants who had their leases finished in 1963 or 1964 and who now in 1966 are still in possession of the houses?  I would like to have that aspect dealt with by the Minister.  There is certainly much merit in what Deputy O'Higgins has said.</P>

      <P>I would like to have the Minister's advice on the problem of the expiry of leases recently in Buncrana, Donegal, where ground rents have been increased in some cases by up to 500 per cent.  In view of the fact that this legislation has been in contemplation for quite a while and the Report of the Commission issued some time back and in view of the fact that these people have had their ground rents multiplied by five or six in some cases, would it not be fair that they should be given the benefit of some of the favourable provisions of the <Col N="75" /> Bill?

      <P>Not later than that.  Section 11 deals with building leases and says the reversionary lease could be obtained:</P>
      <P>(a)  not earlier than fifteen years before the expiration of his building lease, and</P>
      <P>(b)  not later than the expiration of the building lease or the expiration of three months from the service on him by his immediate lessor or any superior lessor of notice of the expiration of the building lease, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>It then goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The notice referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall be a valid notice only if served not earlier than 15 years before the expiration of the building lease.</P>
      <P>It is possible for the notice to be served very many years before the building lease expires.  The person would think he had plenty of time and then might forget about it.</P>

The Commissioners of Irish Lights, who control lighthouses around the coast, feel aggrieved by the fact they are not included in the Bill in any way.  They make leases which might not necessarily be required for a lighthouse at that time.  They want a clause put in that should they need it for a lighthouse in the future, they ought to be safeguarded.  A simple amendment would meet their purpose. I would ask the Minister to consider including Irish Lights under section 3.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Cunningham's point, this applies in the case of all legislation.  It is a question of going back on arrangements which have been finalised, where agreement has been reached under the existing law. Although I am sympathetic to the particular case the Deputy mentioned and to other such cases, I do not see how we can make retrospective legislation to cover cases where agreements are already reached privately between two persons, in this case between landlord and tenant.  This Bill is designed to ensure that in the future the tenant will have his rights.  I am afraid I cannot make those rights retroactive to deal with the situation where agreements have already been entered into.</P>

      <P>In some of the cases I mentioned maybe agreements have been reached, under protest of course.  There is this point, however, that the provisions of the Bill were pretty well known and I am afraid that in some cases the landlord availed of that.  Had the provisions of the Bill not been known, the increases would not be of the same magnitude, because in order, under any new agreement, to get the maximum under the Bill, it is more beneficial to have a very high ground rent.  It may have been that because of the Bill the landlord &ldquo;upped&rdquo; the rent and would not otherwise have done so to such an extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where some tenants were unfortunate enough to have concluded an agreement with the landlord, would the Minister consider making the Bill retrospective in this way? Some rents and some leases will have been in force longer than others. Whether it is in force for 20, 50 or <Col N="78" /> 100 years, is obviously of material difference.  Where a lease or a ground rent has been in force for 100 years, presumably it is at a lower figure and to raise it five times might not be the great hardship it might seem when it is related to some agreement that was only in force for 25 or 50 years. Would the Minister be agreeable to the principle that the purchasing power of the money which bought a lease should be related to the purchasing power of money today and that where a landlord has sought and obtained a higher ground rent or lease than would be justified on this basis, the Bill would be made retrospective to include these people even though they concluded an agreement?  It could be said in these cases that the landlord got too much and has taken advantage of the tenant, that the landlord has taken too much of an increase, bearing in mind the purchasing power last year as against when the lease was originally granted.  The Minister could protect the tenant by saying that where an agreement has been concluded providing for too high a rent, he will make it retrospective.  While we are all anxious to be fair to landlords, the tenant needs protection under the Bill.</P>

We are travelling further in this Bill and making it one-eighth.  I cannot go the whole way and interfere with arrangements and agreements that have been already legally entered into between landlord and tenant, wherever my sympathy may lie, and in many cases my sympathy lies with the tenant.  I am going as far as I can to meet what the House is asking, that is, to give the right to purchase the fee simple in any case where the tenant is in possession of the lands, which is the basis of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, and where no legal or binding agreement has been reached, I shall see what I can do to meet the case of such a tenant, even if the lease has expired, and to bring him within <Col N="79" /> the ambit of the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) (d) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) a person who, or whose predecessors in title has or have been continuously in occupation of the land during the whole of the period of fifty years next preceding the date of the service by the person of a notice under section 4 of this Act in relation to the land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think I can accept the amendment.  First of all, it expands the type of yearly tenant who will get the right of purchase by giving this right to any tenant irrespective of the size of his rent or the nature of his letting.  In section 3 (2) (d) we provide that any yearly tenant who has been in possession up to 50 years and who is paying a rent which is less than threequarters of the amount of rateable valuation&mdash;and that sort of yearly tenant and that sort of small rent arrangement is equivalent to a ground rent arrangement&mdash;will have the right to buy out the ground rent. I would be open to persuasion to reduce the period of 50 years or possibly to &ldquo;up&rdquo; the rent to the amount of the full rateable valuation.  The subsection might be mitigated in that direction and that might go some of <Col N="80" /> the way to meet what Deputy Norton suggests.  However, he goes too far in that his amendment includes all sorts of tenancies.  There are a number of leaseholding arrangements which are outside the scope of this Bill which is designed purely to cover building leases and proprietary leases.</P>
      <P>This subsection is designed to cover cases where a certain equity arises in the case of long possession by yearly tenants.  Other types of leaseholding are at the moment being examined by a Landlord and Tenant Commission which I appointed last December to examine the whole matter from Deasy's Act of 1860 to the 1931 Act and on to the 1958 Act.  I have asked this Commission which consists of legal men and auctioneers and valuers to report to me as a matter of urgency on how leaseholding arrangements not covered by this particular Bill can be dealt with.  This Bill covers ground rents primarily but I have also included in it certain types of letting where a tenant has been there for over 50 years; although it is not exactly a ground rent, it can be presumed to be a ground rent.  I should also be disposed to reduce the period of 50 years and possibly raise the limit from threequarters of the valuation to the equivalent of the full valuation.  That might go some way to meet the Deputy.</P>

      <P>What the Minister proposes to do will not cover a great number of leases from our point of view in the city and in the country generally.  When I heard the Minister introduce the Bill, I was more optimistic. I thought it would strike at the heart of the problem because I think we can accept today the position is that the balance of public sympathy is on the side of the tenant.  This is desirable and I thought the Minister's proposals would cover practically all cases.  Since then I have made investigation and I find the Minister is really only scraping at the problem.</P>

As a result of their report I hope to bring in comprehensive landlord and tenant legislation which will be up to date and in accordance with present day views of what is right and wrong.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (2) a new paragraph as follows:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  a person who is in actual possession of land under any lease or sublease made for a term of not less than ninety-nine years at least twenty-five years of which term remains unexpired provided such lease or sublease is not now subject to a rack rent or that the rent has been redeemed whether or not such lease or sublease is a building lease or a proprietary lease.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another effort to expand section 3.  I think I should declare something of a personal interest here, although it does not really concern me very much.  My own house would be in the category referred to but I happen to know that a number of other houses are being developed in that neighbourhood and they would come into this category and it is from this point of view that I want to present the case to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest in this amendment that the person who is buying a premises under a lease or sublease which is being made for a term of at least 99 years and in circumstances where there is a minimum of 25 years of that term still unexpired and where the lease is not subject to a rack-rent, in other words, where it is subject to a nominal rent or ground rent or, in fact, no rent at all, in the case where the rent may have been redeemed, that the owner of the lessees' or sub-lessees' interest in such leases or subleases should be put in the same position as a person who is buying a ground rent so far as buying out the fee simple is concerned.  In the particular cases I have in mind, I do not know if it can be established with any certainty whether the leases are building leases or proprietary leases. It may be that they are covered by the Bill but it may not be possible to establish with certainty whether they are building leases or proprietary leases or deemed as such under the 1958 Act, but what is certain is that the premises are held in the particular <Col N="84" /> instance I have in mind under a sublease for some 300 years where there are about 80 years of the sublease still to run.  The rent has long since been redeemed.  It was redeemed actually in Land Commission proceedings some years ago so that the present position is that the owner of the sublessee's interest in the premises holds for a term of 80 odd years still to run free of rent.</P>
    <P>As I read the Bill at present a person who has redeemed his rent or whose predecessors in title have redeemed the rent without getting a conveyance of the fee simple is being put in a disadvantageous position as against a person who is at present paying a ground rent, although the market value so far as the head landlord is concerned obviously is nil because the superior lessee is not going to obtain any benefit out of the premises at all for 80 years or upwards.  Consequently, the market value of the superior lessee's interest is practically nil.  What I am trying to establish is that the sublessee in that position should be entitled to buy out his fee simple by agreement with the superior lessor.  Under the machinery of the Bill, it does not seem to me that this kind of case is covered at the moment.</P>
    <P>I think this is a proposed extension of section 3 of the Bill which would not breach the principles of the Bill as propounded by the Minister.  I appreciate that this is an extension which might be going in a slightly different direction from that in which the Minister started but the extension is not that great and I do not think the principle would be breached.  I would ask the Minister to examine the case. I have some later amendments to deal with other cases where it might not be possible to establish whether leases are buildings leases or proprietary leases and I am suggesting the phraseology of the 1958 Act in relation to them but I do not think that would suit in this case.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Subsection (3) of section 3 excludes certain building and proprietary leases from the right of purchase: leases which contain rent review provisions, leases by harbour authorities, et cetera.  It does not, however, exclude such leases when they come within the category referred to at subsection (2) (c), that is, when they are expired leases which still attract the right to a reversionary lease.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exclude from the right of purchased leases which contain provisions requiring the lessee to carry on a business restricted to dealing in commodities produced or supplied by the lessor. However, it is expressed to apply only in the case of such leases given before the commencement of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreements have in the past been entered into between business people by means of building and proprietary leases which make provision for exclusive <Col N="86" /> dealing.  It is considered undesirable that such business arrangements should be prejudiced by the provisions of the Act where they have been freely entered into in the past.  The fact that the exclusion will not apply to future leases will mean that whatever exclusive trading arrangements are agreed upon in future will probably not be by means of building or proprietary leases.</P>

      <P>I think I have a later amendment dealing with this matter.  If I have not, I did consider it.  The Minister is aware that in a number of new housing estates, there is an arrangement whereby the developer provides business premises with living accommodation above. There is a limited number of shops provided and frequently there is a provision that only a particular type of business will be carried on.  In some of the leases there may be a covenant by the lessee that he will restrict the shop to a particular trade.  This arises more appropriately on one of the later sections.</P>

I think it would be undesirable to disturb such arrangements entered into before the passing of the Act but subsequent to the operation of the Act, such an arrangement cannot be made without attracting the right of purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> The Bill deals with the question of the interruption of supplies of electricity arising out of trade disputes and I should like to explain to the House that its provisions would become effective only on the making of an Order by the Government and the power in the Bill to make an Order bringing the Bill into effect would be exercisable by the Government only in circumstances where the supply of electricity is interrupted or in imminent danger of being interrupted.  There would be discussion by the Dáil since such an order would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and could be annulled by either House.</P>
    <P>It is not the type of legislation which the Government thought it would ever be obliged to introduce but the community cannot carry on without electricity. There are two possible methods by which an interruption of the supplies of electricity could be provided against securely.  One method would be the negotiation of a voluntary arrangement by the employees of the Electricity Supply Board to give up their right to such action as would bring about interruption or serious danger of interruption in the supply of electricity.  We have not got this voluntary arrangement.  In its absence, the Government, on behalf of the community, must have resort to the only alternative method, that is to seek legislative powers to deal with such a contingency.  We do not regard this as the more desirable procedure.  I should like to stress that the Government do not regard it as desirable at all.  I regret to say that circumstances have arisen which place a clear obligation on the Government to take power to be able to act in the event of an electricity crisis.</P>
    <P>The facts of the situation are sufficiently well known and do not call for a lengthy statement from me.  It is no revelation to say that in our western civilisation conditions of life have by now become extraordinarily complex.  The paradox is that our technical advances have placed us on a razor edge and day by day we are becoming more and more dependent on the smooth flow of supplies and services which themselves are caught <Col N="93" /> up in a web of interdependence.  In this situation, electricity is no longer a matter of mere relative importance in our lives.  Today, the importance of electricity is absolute.  When speaking on the subject of industrial relations in Ennis in December last, I said that the extension of the principle that a man can withdraw his labour to include the right of a trade union to call a major strike in an essential industry is like putting a nuclear warhead on a conventional weapon.</P>
    <P>The realities of the situation in which we now find ourselves transcend any such issues as traditional rights of sectional interests.  When the lifeline of the nation is in danger, if the nation cannot look to the State for protection, then chaos is come.  The ESB is an agency of the State and is the nerve centre of our everyday lives. No one in that organisation could be unaware of the havoc that a serious strike could cause.  It would be naive to suggest that it is necessary to place pickets on ESB installations in order to let people know there is a trade dispute on.  The various media now available for the dissemination of news see to it that we know what is happening.  Therefore the effect of picketing is to disrupt the organisation so that it cannot supply the people with the electricity which is vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>If that is not the purpose of pickets on ESB installations, then they have little meaning at all.  The one simple, basic fact in this whole matter is that we cannot carry on now without electricity. The workers who supply us with electricity are in a unique position. They know the position, as indeed does every man and woman in Ireland know it now.</P>
    <P>If an Order is made bringing the Act into operation, it will give legal effect to the rates of remuneration and conditions of service to people employed in the ESB.  This will not prevent rates or conditions being varied as a result of determination by one or other of the statutory ESB tribunals, or a determination by an arbitrator, or a recommendation by the Labour Court.  The legislation would make it <Col N="94" /> unlawful for the Board of the ESB to remunerate any of its employees or apply conditions of service otherwise than in accordance with what I have just said.  Strikes and picketing aimed at forcing issues of remuneration and conditions other than those determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Bill would be illegal if they interrupt or threaten imminently to interrupt the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the normal traditional method for resolving differences is by free collective bargaining. The Government would prefer to see the parties in the ESB settling their differences in this way, through the agreed negotiating procedures.  If the parties fail to settle in this way, and if there is serious disruption of electricity supply or imminent danger of disruption, then the provisions of this legislation must be applied.  The Bill does not attempt to abolish the fundamental rights of workers to strike.  Its intention is to curtail that right on a narrow front where the exercise of the right would lead to a shut-down of electricity supply and so bring the country to a halt.  I am not speaking about anything outside the experience of Deputies.  Twice within the last couple of weeks this danger has appeared and has been brought home to us.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputies saw fit to make remarks about my colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, because he is not handling this. He, like all Ministers, participates in a collective responsibility for the measure but matters relating to trade union law, or relating to industrial relations law, are the sole responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and this explains why the Minister for Transport and Power is not handling this Bill.  I recommend the provisions of the Bill to the House. As I said, its purpose is to enable the Government to act in a contingency and even though, as some Deputy remarked, the crisis seems more remote now, what the Bill seeks is to give power to the Government to make an Order if a crisis is upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House, if assurance is needed, that this was done immediately after the members of my Party saw the text of the Bill.  Whether you want to describe that, as Deputy Dillon described it, as &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo; is your affair.  In any case, it will be appreciated, I think, that our attitude on the 1961 legislation has been consistently maintained here this afternoon and that consistency is <Col N="97" /> shown in the amendment we have tabled.  I do not know whether or not the attitude of Deputy Dillon's Party will be equally consistent.  The terms of my amendment, for the benefit of those who have not had it circulated to them, are, and I formally move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that it deliberately abolishes the fundamental rights of trade unions and trade unionists and that the proposals contained in the Bill will create an atmosphere which will hinder the amicable settlement of trade disputes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to refer to something the Taoiseach said, by way of interjection, with regard to the time limit on this motion.  He said, and rightly so, that he had informed Deputy Cosgrave and me that this guillotine motion would be moved.  I do not think that called for any comment from us.  It was a statement of intention and I do not believe any reply was needed from me.  The Taoiseach will recall that in September, 1961, we strongly opposed the idea of a guillotine.  We are just as strongly opposed to it now.  The Fianna Fáil Party have their majority.  I think, however, that if the Fine Gael Party were to do today what they did in September, 1961, there would be an overwhelming majority against any curtailment of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We decided that, rather than take a curtailment at half-past ten, we should go on and agree to the consideration of the Bill until four o'clock tomorrow afternoon.  Having regard to our special relationship with the trade union movement, I do not think we could agree to a short debate on this motion because, despite what the Minister says, this represents a fundamental change in trade union law.  I do not think we would be true or honest with the trade unions or the 400,000 trade unionists if we allowed <Col N="98" /> this piece of legislation to be rushed through here.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in this matter.  The Taoiseach was accused today of making a very skimpy speech.  The same accusation can be levelled against the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He introduced the Bill in about ten minutes.  He said it was necessary in what he nearly described as a state of emergency.  The usual practice in a Second Reading speech is to say exactly what each section means and what the implications may be.  The Minister passed it off by saying that, whilst this is a Bill, there is power for the Government to make an Order to do certain things.  This is not a temporary Bill.  This is a piece of permanent legislation which gives the Government an instrument to prohibit trade unions and trade unionists from withdrawing their labour and also provides for substantial fines.</P>
      <P>There is no point, I suppose, in protesting against the short notification we had, but I do not know how long this legislation has been in contemplation by the Fianna Fáil Government. I am sure it was not just last Sunday morning, or Sunday night, or yesterday morning; this must have been in their minds for quite a long time.  It may be true that in 1961 we had a similar situation and the Bill then framed was constructed within a very short time. Of course that was obvious from the reception it got from this House.  It was obvious it was a patchwork affair. One remembers the speed with which the Taoiseach, piloting the Bill through the House as Minister for Industry and Commerce, withdrew a section and thereby made the Bill much less effective than it was in its original form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude towards this sort of legislation is the same as it was in 1961. I can talk, I think, in this for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which were not, as a body, apprised of this legislation, though they may have been told something about it as individuals. The attitude we expressed in 1961 is the attitude we have today.  I do not know if the Minister will be able to <Col N="99" /> tell us that he had discussions with Congress on this legislation, but I know &mdash;most of us know&mdash;that he has had conversations with Congress in recent times about industrial unrest generally. I do not believe, however, that he intimated to them in any respect that he and his Government had in their minds this sort of repressive legislation.  In my opinion, this will do more to antagonise the workers than to curb the situation which the Minister described so very briefly today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Your blood be on your own heads, if you vote against this and your blood be on your own heads, if you do not give us this Bill within a certain time.&rdquo;  We appreciate, perhaps much more than many members of the Government Party, what the repercussions of an ESB strike may be now or in the future. But this situation need not necessarily be peculiar to the ESB.  We know how vital electricity is.  Over and above that, we have to have regard, and always will have regard, to the fundamental right of the worker, not so much to withdraw his labour as to sell it in the best market he can find.  All the criticism we have heard lately has all been directed to one side of industry. Too few people are trying to discover if there is any fault on the other side.</P>
    <P>This legislation seeks to deprive the individual of his right to withdraw his labour.  That right will be taken away under this Bill in certain circumstances. Mark you, people may be under the impression that this will affect only the type of person who is on strike at the present time and the unions of which they are members.  But this Bill seeks to give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the power to execute this Order in respect of any employee of the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not know how many there are.  This Order could be used against those employed in the offices of the ESB, should they decide to go on strike.  I am not saying it will be, but it can be.</P>

This Bill provides in respect of a person who goes on strike or who pickets a fine of £25 per day.  If he continues to remain on strike or picket, he can be fined a sum of £5 per day or, on conviction or indictment, he and his trade union can be fined £5,000 and £100 per day thereafter, the trade union in both cases to pay the fine.</P>
      <P>Some people would say this is a panic measure.  It may have been a panic measure in 1961 but, in my opinion, this is not a panic measure. This is a measure that has been fairly well thought out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Government. One of my colleagues described it today as the thin end of the wedge.  We all acknowledge that this industry is vital and we all agree that a strike in it can have serious consequences, but are we to accept the principle that, in any situation in which the economy is disrupted to a certain degree, similar legislation can be invoked and operated?  We believe that this is not the proper approach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said recently in a statement to the members of his Party that he believes that industrial relations&mdash;I do not pretend to quote him exactly&mdash;cannot be legislated for entirely. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said recently that industrial relations must be cultivated and I, and the members of my Party, applauded. This is the big stick.  I do not believe it will achieve anything other than to antagonise not alone the workers involved in this dispute but workers generally throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some questions we ought to ask in respect of this dispute in an effort to discover whether or not the action now contemplated is justified. We have not heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Maybe we can hear from the Minister for <Col N="101" /> Transport and Power whether there was justification for the power cuts of yesterday morning and the Monday morning of three or four weeks ago. There is no evidence available to me or to the members of my Party to show whether they were justified.  We wonder whether this was a device for the justification of a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>We agree that this is one of the most serious types of strike we could have, if not, in fact, the most serious, but we resent this Bill because we believe the Government are establishing it as a precedent.  This legislation will be fairly popular with certain sections. We have often been accused in this House by members of the Fianna Fáil Party and others of taking the popular stand as far as votes are concerned. Today, the Taoiseach said that, no matter what we did, our blood would be upon our heads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not use those words but that is what he meant.  I believe, also, that in recent times there has been pressure on the Government by the Federated Union of Employers to promote legislation of this kind.  I often wonder whether this situation has been allowed to develop so that this type of legislation may be attractive to certain sections of the community.  All these questions have not been answered although they have been asked in recent times not alone here but by the public and by the trade union movement.  We have not had a word from any member of the Government, particularly from the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Government can disclaim entire responsibility for what has happened.  There is no point in saying that the trade unions and the ESB failed to agree.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been at pains in the past few minutes to defend the Minister for Transport and Power and to relieve him of any responsibility for this situation.  Of course he is responsible for the situation and of course the Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for this situation. <Col N="102" /> Did they just sit back in their offices and let the situation develop? Why?  What efforts has the Minister made to resolve this dispute?  When the Taoiseach introduced a Bill in 1961, the Minister for Transport and Power took about four or five columns in the Official Report to tell us of the efforts Deputy J. Lynch, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, had made in order to avoid a dispute. We applauded that.  We saw he had an interest.</P>
    <P>Compare our situation with the situation in Great Britain where, when a major dispute occurs, as in the case of the present seamen's strike, the Minister for Labour there has tried by every possible means to secure a solution.  The Prime Minister there also tried.  There is no evidence that any member of our Government made any effort in the past few months to ensure that this sort of situation would not arise: if he has, they have not told us about it.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to the public that this has been a lightning strike. As in practically every dispute, particularly with those who are anti-trade union, those who just do not care appear always to believe that the fault is on the side of the workers or the trade union movement.  This was not a wild cat or a lightning strike.  The claim now in question was made in December, 1964.  The ESB Manual Workers' Tribunal rejected the claim without explanation.  This rejection was not accepted by the engineering group of unions and the ESB were so informed.</P>
    <P>In February, 1965, nearly 16 months ago, an official ban on overtime was imposed by the engineering unions but this did not alter the attitude of the ESB to the members' claim.  On no occasion did they seem to get any response from the ESB or from the tribunal.  On 14th April, 1966, these unions notified the Irish Congress of Trade Unions of one week's strike notice on the ESB.  They also notified the ESB of this action, thus giving two weeks' notice of strike.  We did not read of any concern on the part of any members of the Government, particularly <Col N="103" /> the Minister for Transport and Power.  Following this notice to the ESB and at the request of Mr. O'Donovan, Chairman of the ESB Manual Workers' Tribunal, it was agreed by the engineering unions not to place pickets on power stations during the first week of the strike in order to give him an opportunity to get the two parties together with a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement.  Conferences took place during this particular week between the union and ESB officials but no progress was made.  On 9th May, 1966, pickets were placed on all power stations but, at the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, these pickets were withdrawn.  On 12th May, the Tribunal made a certain recommendation.  On 13th May this was rejected by a ten to one majority of the trade unions involved and they were requested to hold off pickets until the Labour Court was asked to make a public inquiry and give a decision.  Up to recently, we were still awaiting that decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, his predecessors in this Government, and the Taoiseach, have talked about a revision of the Labour Court and the Industrial Relations Act. This is all we have heard.  It is not any great tribute to the Labour Court or to the machinery employed there to say that, after two weeks, the brilliant recommendation from the Labour Court was that the men should go back to work and re-enter into negotiations with the ESB.  They could have given that sort of recommendation in five minutes flat.  When the matter was referred to the Labour Court, it was hoped that there would be some sort of recommendation which would be acceptable to the men but this was a childish one.  I do not know why they came up with it and why it took them ten or 11 days to do so.</P>
    <P>Some State bodies, particularly the ESB, are notorious for their bad public relations.  We have seen this not alone with the ESB but with CIE and other State companies.  This is something for which the various Ministers are responsible: they may not be legally responsible for it.  The Minister for <Col N="104" /> Transport and Power comes in here and pleads abjectly that he has no function in the matter but, as a Minister, at least he does not have, every time a situation like this occurs, to look up the Statute Book to see whether or not he has power to do this, that or the other.  Other Ministers for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers for Transport and Power have tried to help and have intervened to bring the parties together.  There has been no suggestion of that in this dispute.  That is why I wonder whether it was allowed to develop in order to create a climate in which legislation like this would get the approval of certain sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The semi-State bodies seem to be inconsistent in their attitude to workers and the problems which now beset the ESB and the engineering unions. Practically the same type of claim as that made by the engineering unions on the ESB was admitted by Aer Lingus.  Therefore, we have the situation that the claim is refused by the ESB but accepted by another group under the aegis of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I do not know what happened to the 1961 Act.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time lauded this to the Dáil as something which would prevent the situation we had then and which we have to some extent now.  Embodied in that legislation and embodied in the speeches made on that occasion and the discussion that ensured during 1st September was a provision for the establishment of a commission to look into the grievances of certain employees, particularly manual employees, of the ESB.</P>
    <P>That tribunal made a recommendation. I do not know whether the Minister for Transport and Power is conversant with it or whether, because the dispute was settled in a matter of a few days, he believed the recommendation did not matter anyway.  One of the big questions in this dispute between the trade unions and the ESB at present is parity with clerical workers.  I happened to check with a person who was a member of the Commission in 1961 and one of the recommendations <Col N="105" /> was to the effect that there should be only one tribunal for both manual and clerical workers.  If this is so, it is an admission by a Commission established by the Fianna Fáil Government that conditions of employment, salaries, wages, scales, increments, bonuses and all these things should be considered as if they were the one group.  As far as I can see, that is one of the most important things in the present dispute.  The members of this Commission were reputable people: Martin Gleeson, Chairman; Thomas Corry; P. T. Murphy of the ESB; Edmund Grace; F. Robbins, Dublin Port and Docks Board and Charles McCarthy and Leo Crawford of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  What was done about this recommendation of the Commission?  It appears to me there is still that division between manual workers and clerical workers within the ESB.</P>
    <P>Great emphasis has been placed on the importance of having these fitters at work.  I think they are important but I think also the ESB should recognise they are important.  We are prepared to pay big salaries to judges because they are judges.  We gave big increases to professional people, particularly in the medical world, because they do important work.  If these 100 people are so unimportant, why should they have to work a 42 hour week for something over £14?  We are talking about these people on whom depend the running of industry and the economy generally.  We have a situation where, because they want to retain a certain status, certain of the personnel of the ESB do not want to give them this status commensurate with the type of work they are doing.</P>
    <P>We have got our values wrong, not alone in respect of the ESB but in respect of other sections of the economy.  Would the Minister not agree that those on whom the running of the economy depends should receive a little more&mdash;I do not want to go into the merits of the case&mdash;than the £14 or £15 being paid for a 42-hour week?  There is no use talking about overtime.  A man earns his overtime, whether it is half-rate or three-quarter rate.  The only standard on <Col N="106" /> which we can judge wages and salaries is the rate for the job for the accepted number of hours.  I merely want to mention that in other employments, say, in Dunlops in Cork or in Telefís Éireann, for similar work these fitters get much more.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Transport and Power explain to me the stupidity of the members of the ESB Board who would, for reasons best known to themselves, deprive what are regarded as very important operatives of a decent wage?  This is typical of the type of attitude we have from the employers in recent times, particularly since the last round of wage increases was initiated.  It is typical of the FUE attitude to negotiations for the modest increase of £1 suggested by Congress and agreed to by the majority of the workers at a special conference.  They refused to negotiate for this modest increase and hung on to some Government statement they believed. was made to the effect that only a three per cent increase in incomes should be permitted this year.</P>
    <P>When we think in terms of industrial relations and industrial unrest, we should more often&mdash;the Minister has done it at times but not often enough&mdash; balance the criticism of one side as against the other.  The trade union movement would be the first to admit its shortcomings.  It would be the first to admit that changes in trade union law and industrial relations law are necessary.  Let us not go away with the idea, however, that every strike that happens, particularly a strike that affects large sections of the community and the economy, is not justified.  I do not think this legislation is justified to the extent of blackmailing people to work for £14 or £15 a week for a 42 hour week.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the consequences of this legislation.  I do not think that legislation like this, which is repressive, is going to create goodwill between the trade unions and the employing section.  Rather is it going to cause great antagonism and, maybe, further unrest.  It does not appear to me that any member of the Government did anything appreciable to have this dispute resolved.  It is simple for them&mdash;<Col N="107" /> and, as I said, popular with some people in the country today&mdash;to try to legislate, to throw a few words on paper and say: &ldquo;If you go on strike or put on pickets, we will fine your union £5,000 and £100 per day for as long as the disputes last.&rdquo;  This will not solve the present crisis.  If, for example, the 100 ESB fitters on strike decided in the morning to resign, what solution have the Government for a continuation of electricity supplies to industry and the other sectors of the economy? If, like some of the bank officials, they decided to go across to Great Britain and possibly earn more, despite this legislation before us today the Government would still have the problem of trying to get fitters to man the power stations.  Believe me, having regard to the importance of their work to the ESB, they might have to pay much more than they are paying and give conditions of employment much more attractive than those at present.</P>
    <P>This sort of problem is not, I am sure, peculiar to Ireland.  I am sure this is not the first strike which hit electricity supplies in the western world or in the world as a whole.  We have been talking about the European Economic Community in recent years.  We were told there will be a code in respect of social welfare, industrial relations arrangements, industry and agriculture, which are more or less applied to all the members.  Could the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell me if there is any such legislation in any of the EEC countries?  Is there similar legislation in Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that industrial relations should be cultivated rather than legislated for.  We always think of industrial relations in this country when we have industrial disputes.  In January, 1964&mdash;whether it was right or wrong, there is no point in going into that now&mdash;the trade unions and the employers sat around and agreed to a wage formula that would be effective for two or two and a half years.  This was a time of relative peace.  This was a time which, apart from some disputes, could be regarded as a truce period in industrial relations.  Could the Taoiseach tell me what any of his Ministers for Industry and Commerce did during that period in regard to making necessary changes in industrial relations law in consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in order that we would not be confronted with a situation like this?  This was the time to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was going on for two and a half years.  I do not think this is the right atmosphere in which to introduce legislation which will be opposed by every trade unionist in the country.  What we are talking about here today is the fundamental right to sell your labour in the best market <Col N="110" /> and not to sell it if you do not get the best price.  This is the fundamental issue.  If fitters are supposed to be so important, if 100 fitters can save the economy as the doctors can save life, then they are entitled to much more than they have at the present time.</P>
      <P>It is relatively easy to write this Bill but its operation will be another thing. I suggest, therefore, that what should have been done and what still can be done by the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power is to investigate the crisis to see in what way it can best be resolved, because these bludgeoning measures will not get the approbation of the Labour Party or the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of a similar piece of legislation which came before us five years ago, we regret the circumstances in which legislation of this sort has to be introduced, but we recognise that the interests of the community in the grave situation which has developed here must be regarded as paramount.  In those circumstances, it falls to the Dáil to consider this emergency legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a last desperate effort to deal with the situation which has been allowed to build up over a number of years, a situation in which Government leadership was clearly needed and in which the Government made no effort whatever to give a lead or direction.  It has been common knowledge for many years that there has been serious discontent among workers at all levels in the ESB.  This is certainly not a time to go into the details of why that discontent existed or, even more so, of the rights or wrongs of this dispute, except to say that on this occasion there is no excuse for the Government not knowing that the situation existed.  Just five years ago the Dáil was summoned to deal with a similar crisis.  Though the actual issues involved in it were somewhat different, it was then clearly recognised by everyone who discussed the matter, by Members of the House, in particular, and by the ESB as well as the trade unions concerned, that there was general dissatisfaction with the manner in which the tribunal <Col N="111" /> dealing with the matters concerned had functioned.  In fact, the dispute at the time arose because the tribunal did not function at all, and the Minister for Transport and Power abdicated any responsibility.</P>
    <P>What is important in this situation is that the causes underlying the present dispute have been known to the Government for many years and nothing has been done about them. When the legislation was introduced five years ago to deal with a largely similar situation, steps were taken to have the matter considered by an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal: the Government have done nothing, or virtually nothing, since to ensure that the same situation would not recur.  We do not believe that the sort of problem that lies behind the present dispute in the ESB can be solved by waiting until half the country is shut down before doing anything and then rushing into the Dáil with repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>The history of industrial relations in connection with this matter or other matters proves that the workers cannot be coerced by the Government, by employers or anybody else.  Ultimately, the only way of solving the problems which have brought the country to the brink of economic collapse is by securing agreement on long-term principles between the parties involved.  By the time the disputes break out, it is already too late to do this.  The time for Government leadership is when the climate is good.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat now what I said in the debate in 1961 on 1st September at column 294 of Volume 191:</P>
    <P>It is not when the dispute reaches the point to which this dispute has developed that legislation of that sort can be considered in the atmosphere in which it should be considered.</P>
    <P>We had no consideration of industrial legislation since then.  We now find ourselves considering a problem of industrial relations in an atmosphere other than that which is appropriate for a calm and dispassionate discussion of the matters involved.  Only in a <Col N="112" /> calm atmosphere when the climate is good can constructive discussion take place, when the issues can be considered without the chaos and passion which develop when a situation is allowed to drift as far as the present situation has been allowed to drift.</P>
    <P>I have no illusions about the difficulties of the problems involved in the issues which affect the present dispute. It is common knowledge that a cleavage exists and the cleavage issue is the relationship between the manual workers and the clerical workers.  In recent years with the development of technology, the position and responsibility of the manual workers have been undergoing great changes in industry generally.  The old distinctions between clerical and manual workers are becoming increasingly blurred.  This has inevitably led to understandable demands from those classed as manual workers for a re-assessment of their status and remuneration in the light of their changing responsibilities and the increasing levels of skill demanded of them.</P>
    <P>Recently the Quinn Report adverted to this fact and pointed out what has been generally known from the information available, that in recent years the relative position of manual workers not merely in the ESB but in other State employment has deteriorated <i>vis-à-vis</i> the clerical workers.  In fact, in that Report advertence was made to the recruitment standard of education required for clerical workers compared with the standard of technical skill and education required of manual workers performing highly-skilled and very vital work in industry.</P>
    <P>It is in a matter of this sort that the Government had a clear duty to lead, to stimulate thinking on the kind of issues involved, to promote discussion leading to an acceptance by those immediately involved and the community in general of basic principles which can act as guidelines in tackling specific cases.  Even in the ESB, an organisation where the ESB is itself the employer, there was an obligation to give a lead and it is entirely wrong that the Taoiseach or Ministers should go about the country preaching and <Col N="113" /> suggesting at chambers of commerce and other gatherings that both sides in industry should come together and hammer out their differences, lecturing others about what they should do when the Government themselves set such a deplorable example in failing to take any steps to ensure that organisations under their control set examples in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister for Transport and Power or any other Minister to abdicate his responsibility in this regard.  It is no use telling other sections of the community, however high-sounding the language or however much Ministers may pontificate, of this responsibility of industry or the trade unions if the Government are manifestly unwilling or unable to give the lead or even make the effort to create the impression that they are trying to give the lead.  In fact, State and semi-State bodies are the bodies that should give the headlines in setting examples of proper industrial relations. Organisations controlled by the State should be pioneers in putting into practice correct principles and guidelines for conducting industrial relations instead of, as in some cases, merely setting the example and setting the tenor for other industries to try to follow in order to equate their status with them.</P>
    <P>What the Government failed to grasp is that the time to secure agreement between employers and workers is when times are good.  It is useless to wait until the situation has deteriorated before doing something about it.  Never since the foundation of the State has there been such a period of industrial unrest, such discontent and strife between workers and employers in which the Government have shown themselves powerless to give any lead. Instead, they have lurched from one makeshift to another and this particular piece of legislation is probably the last desperate effort.  In fact, it is worthy of comment that although this situation developed some weeks ago, no effort was made to deal with the problem and no effort made to introduce legislation until the election was out of the way.  Then this legislation was introduced.  I know it may be suggested that the Dáil had been <Col N="114" /> adjourned but it had been adjourned for only a week.  On a previous occasion when the Dáil was adjourned for the summer recess, it was called back at short notice.  There was no effort to deal with this serious situation or to grapple with these problems until the votes were cast and counted.</P>
    <P>This Bill is merely an effort to deal with symptoms; it can do nothing to solve the underlying causes and may indeed have the opposite effect.  Drastic panic legislation of this kind can only make matters worse in the long term; it can only make it more difficult to solve the real problems by the only way in which they can be solved, by getting the agreement of all parties concerned to some formula and some principles which strike a fair balance between conflicting interests.  This Bill will make it harder to do that.  No matter how powerful the interests concerned and how deeply they are involved in this matter, it is the responsibility of the Government and of the Government alone to give a lead.</P>
    <P>The time the ninth round wage agreement came into effect, when the climate was good and when there was general satisfaction, however secured and whatever the motives involved in securing it, was the time when discussions should have been initiated between employers and workers in industry. The Government had an opportunity then to show initiative and imagination in bringing the different sections of the community together to work out the long-term principles which should in future govern increases in income, their relationship to productivity, the relationship of different groups of workers to each other; the sectional grievances over such things as status and generally the way in which relations between managers and workers should be conducted in the kind of Ireland we wish to build.</P>
    <P>This was the situation and these were the problems which concerned us when Fine Gael advocated an incomes policy and when we urged on the Government the need for such a policy. Our proposals at that time were sneered at by the Government and heavily criticised by the Taoiseach in his Mullingar speech when it was suggested <Col N="115" /> that we wanted to control wages.  The only Party who ever controlled wages in this country are the present Government.  The Government did not put themselves to the trouble to find out even what an incomes policy was and we are now paying the price of that wilful ignorance or bland incompetence, the incompetence of a Government even to make an effort to discover what an incomes policy is.</P>
    <P>The Government have concentrated their attention solely on short term solutions by the manipulation of incomes to buy votes at elections.  This cynical manipulation for the meanest and narrowest of Party political purposes is a major factor in the really serious situation which faces the country today, not just in the ESB but in numerous other disputes and in the numerous dissensions and disruptions in other industrial concerns today.  If the Government put the facts plainly before the country, said what were the issues, ceased to create the illusion that prosperity can be secured simply by voting for it, then there would be a greater realisation of the problems involved.</P>
    <P>This particular measure can be justified only if it offers a breathing space to tackle the serious problems involved in the present dispute.  The fact is that there are thousands of people in imminent danger of death, people in hospitals, patients in iron lungs, sick people in oxygen tents, thousands of people in danger of death because in this modern technological era the lives of so many people depend on a continuous supply of electricity. It is only because of that that a measure of this kind can be justified at all.  It is also important to remember that at least 180,000 workers, and some people put the figure as high as a quarter of a million, and much consequential employment depend on the maintenance of electricity supplies.  It is in the light of this grave situation that it is right to consider that legislation of this kind can be enacted.  We believe that the industrial problems which affect the country at the moment are such that this measure can only be used as a breathing space <Col N="116" /> in which steps can be taken to initiate discussions between the parties involved in the dispute.</P>
    <P>It is not merely this dispute alone. It is easy to consider many cases where the livelihood of so many people can be so vitally affected as it is in the case of the electricity supply.  There are possibly other sections, possibly other State concerns, possibly other cases of relatively few workers, possibly other vital areas of employment in which the employment of large groups of other workers could be jeopardised. It is because of the present industrial situation in the whole of the country that we want to impress on the Government, and on the people, the Government's responsibility in this matter to give a lead and the inescapable obligation that is on them to initiate the discussions necessary in order to reach some basic principles on which agreement can be secured in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It has been said both by the Taoiseach and by different Ministers that if the trade unions and the employers could come together and reach agreement, the Government would implement such agreement.  That is the handing over of responsibility by the Government to some outside bodies and, no matter how powerful and influential these bodies may be, the responsibility is still on the Government. The responsibility for initiating legislation and enacting it devolves on the Government and on the Government alone.  It is the function of the Government to bring in the legislation and our function to discuss it here and to seek to ensure the greatest possible measure of agreement.</P>
    <P>The present Government secured the confidence of the country last year on the illusion that prosperity could be voted, on the illusion that by voting Fianna Fáil, prosperity and buoyancy would continue.  The events of the last year and of the last week have shown that that confidence was dishonestly secured; the people will not now listen to the Government or to any views put forward by the Government because they feel that the Government cannot be trusted.  The people feel they have <Col N="117" /> been tricked and that the Government are responsible for the present situation. A Government who have lost the people's confidence as the recent election showed this Government so clearly to have done has only one course open to them, to go, to make place for others, to make place for a Government with the will and the capacity to deal with the problems confronting the nation.  The only reason we are supporting this legislation at the present time is to save the country from the fumbling futility that is characteristic of Fianna Fáil in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish commented on the fact that this Bill which we are now discussing has not been framed as a temporary measure.  That is correct, although we hope that it will in the event prove to be a temporary measure.  I should, perhaps, explain the considerations which led the Government to the framing of the Bill in this way.  I think we all here recognise that public opinion in Ireland will not accept a situation in which there is a complete termination in the supply of electricity and if this should emerge, will expect the Government and the Dáil to do something about it.  This was the conclusion that we reached in 1961 when there was a similar threat of an interruption of electricity supplies. Under pressure of public opinion we acted then by the introduction of legislation which, as Deputies have mentioned, ultimately was not required. This is the situation which we are faced with now.  If there is a danger of interruption of electricity supplies involving the disemployment of all industrial workers and all the danger to life that Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, the public will expect the Dáil to act and the Dáil must act.</P>
      <P>Once, therefore, we have taken the decision in relation to this Bill, as we took in 1961, that a complete cessation of electricity supplies by reason of a strike must not happen, then we have to face the possibility of permanent legislation to that end or, at least, legislation that can be utilised in such emergency in order to prevent that catastrophe falling on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> There are two ways by which the danger of total interruption of electricity supplies by reason of a strike involving critical consequences for the country can be avoided.  One is by negotiation of a voluntary agreement between the trade unions catering for all ESB workers and the Board under which, in consideration of a voluntary renunciation of their right to strike for a period, these workers would get compensating advantages relating to their remuneration and to the security of their employment.  The other is by legislation.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government are concerned, we would wish to see negotiations for such agreement undertaken. We are prepared to facilitate them if that should be desired or would be helpful and the settlement of the present dispute, the elimination of the prospect of the immediate cessation of supplies, would be helpful in this regard. Indeed, I think that the enactment of this Bill would also be helpful because it will ensure the acceptance by everybody that the situation against which the Bill is directed, namely, that complete disruption of electricity supply is something the people are not prepared to accept and, if it cannot be prevented one way, it must be prevented in the other.  The way we prefer to see it prevented is by the negotiation of such voluntary agreement as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair to describe this Bill as Deputy Corish did, as directed against the workers, the class of people in our community who are so described, who get their living by working in return for a weekly wage or a monthly salary.  This Bill, so far as the Government are concerned, is designed primarily to protect the workers, to protect all those workers, coming close to 200,000 of them, who would be unable to earn their livelihood if a total interruption of electricity supply should come about.</P>
    <P>We know, and we must accept the fact, that workers employed in a vital service like the Electricity Supply Board possess enormous economic power.  They possess a power of life and death over the community and the very fact that they have that <Col N="119" /> power places on them a responsibility to use it sparingly and certainly never to use it in a way which would be damaging to all the other workers in the country, not to mention the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Let it be quite clear that, as far as the Government are concerned, we are expressing no judgment of any sort upon the merits of the claim put forward by the mechanical fitters now on strike from the ESB service.  We note the fact that the tribunal set up under the Electricity Act for dealing with claims in relation to remuneration of ESB workers have rejected their claim.  I do not know whether they were right in rejecting the claim but it is fair to say that, having regard to the composition of that tribunal, it could not be alleged that it was unsympathetic to the interests of workers generally or of these workers in particular.</P>
    <P>We know that subsequent to that rejection of their claim by the ESB Tribunal, there were negotiations initiated by the Congress of Trade Unions and others which, however, failed to produce an arrangement that was acceptable to these workers.</P>
    <P>The proposition that I think has to be put forward, whether it is implemented by way of legislation or by way of a voluntary agreement such as I envisage, is that in regard to matters of this kind, in preference to using the destructive power of the strike in order to bring about the arrangement desired, there should be acceptance of some objective judgment upon the merits of the claim and an acceptance irrespective of the extent to which that judgment concedes the full claim sought by the workers; certainly, that the acceptance of an objective judgment of that kind, even where it is not fully in conformity with the ideas of those putting forward the claim, is preferable to the utilisation of the alternative method of the strike if that involves complete closing down of all the industry in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has said that we have not here as a Government dealt properly with the problem of industrial <Col N="120" /> relations in our society.  If he means by that that we have not found a solution of the problems of industrial relations in our society, he is quite right.  We have not found a solution and there was not in his speech the slightest hint of a suggestion as to how such a solution might be sought.  We know that neither here nor, so far as I am aware, in any other free democracy has a really satisfactory method yet been evolved of dealing with labour matters and, specifically, matters bearing upon industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a great deal of thought to this.  Since the beginning of the year, I have spoken at length in public expressing my ideas on this subject, trying to evoke further discussion on the subject from those more intimately in touch with the various aspects of the problem and, while there have been some very valuable contributions to the general pool of knowledge by spokesmen both from the trade union side and some representative employers, there has not emerged from all these discussions as yet anything that could be described as a consensus, any clear indication of a road that we could follow that would lead us to what we would all desire, a situation in which industrial disputes involving stoppages of work would be minimised if not entirely eliminated.</P>
    <P>We have proceeded as a Government, certainly in recent years, subsequent to the passing of the Industrial Relations Act and the setting up of the Labour Court, on the basis that workers and their trade unions, employers and their organisations, could be relied upon to act in most cases in a responsible way and would try to avoid, by the process of compromise, if necessary, upon matters in dispute, the danger of stoppages of work, the disemployment of workers on the one hand, the loss of production on the other.  On the assumption that we could rely on the reasonableness and responsibility of the people involved on each side and their representatives.  We considered the function of the Government to be solely to maintain machinery which <Col N="121" /> would facilitate them in reaching agreements.  We set up the Labour Court for this purpose.  We set up the conciliation service which functions in conjunction with the Labour Court and in a number of cases we encouraged and facilitated the creation of Joint Industrial Councils, some at least of which have functioned fairly well, if not all of them.</P>
    <P>Behind all this was the idea that the Government should not openly and formally intervene in order to resolve industrial disputes.  I use these words, openly and formally, deliberately because I am sure Deputies have suspected that in most cases there is a great deal of informal discussion, comment and talk between the Minister concerned, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his officials and both sides in many disputes, trying to clear the air so that they could get together.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As it was unworthy, I withdraw it.  This policy of non-intervention, of setting up the machinery and providing the means by which the parties concerned would get together without any intervention by the Government, was reinforced in our view by the experience we had in earlier years that the availability of a Minister and a Department of Government, and the tendency of the Government to intervene to settle disputes when they threatened or happened, tended to multiply disputes and led to a situation in which strike notices were given fairly freely and strikes were begun, in the knowledge that the Government would immediately be rushing in to try to settle the disputes on the basis of some concession. That was the general criticism at that time.  As I said, we recognise that we have not yet found a method by which the problem of industrial relations can be resolved.  The method adopted in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, is no longer fully applicable. The situation today is different from what it was then.  Nowadays, the measures taken to resolve a dispute in any one instance are known very often to have widespread repercussions outside the immediate group of workers concerned and are likely to lead to similar demands affecting many other categories.  This was not the position before the war or before the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, this policy of non-intervention, this policy of setting up machinery for resolving disputes and trying to force the parties either to come together or, alternatively, have recourse to the conciliation service, or the Labour Court, has not worked very well either and we have to consider whether there is anything further we can do in order to improve the situation, if not to resolve it altogether. I would say that the outcome of my consideration of the matter is that the time is coming when we should set <Col N="123" /> up a new Department of State, a Department of Labour under a Minister for Labour which will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will be particularly concerned with all matters dealing with the development of policy in this regard.  This would include matters such as an incomes policy-I hate using that phrase because nobody seems to know what it means but I will use it because nothing better suggests itself to me at the moment &mdash;a manpower policy, training and redundancy problems, as well as industrial relations.  Certainly the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has been handling these matters has been commenting to me upon the difficulty he has experienced in handling all these problems as part of the work of his Department.  We have to recognise that this problem of industrial relations, this problem of developing a comprehensive policy in relation to labour matters, has become one of the major problems of our times, one of the major social questions which modern democratic Governments have to deal with.  This being so, it should not, in my view, be left to the part time attention of one Minister, no matter how hardworking he may be.  It requires not merely an independent Minister but an independent organisation acting under him to handle this aspect of our affairs.</P>
      <P>This view of mine regarding changing of the methods by which the Government have been trying to discharge their responsibility in this regard is based upon a further consideration of certain defects in our present system. We have a Labour Court but the Labour Court is rarely able to intervene in a dispute until the dispute has begun.  It is there to try to help to bring about a solution of disputes generally when a strike has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely so.  I realise that a large number of cases <Col N="124" /> come to the Labour Court which are of comparatively lesser importance but, by and large, in relation to major disputes, the Labour Court's intervention comes after the situation has led to the outbreak of a strike.  We see that the conciliation service is also in a sense a last resort.  By and large, employers and their workers try to resolve their difficulties by direct negotiation between themselves.  It is only when these negotiations have become deadlocked or fail to produce a settlement that recourse is had to the conciliation service. It seems to me that we need some organisation with power to intervene to prevent trouble before it happens. I do not know whether this will be possible but it also seems to me that it should be the function of the new Department of Government to have available to it skilled and experienced individuals who could be in touch with the industrial situation in every sphere all the time and, who noting where danger of conflict was emerging, could act in time to prevent that conflict coming to a head.</P>
      <P>The new Government Department which I envisage would also be concerned with labour affairs relating to our State companies.  This is an aspect of the matter on which as yet I have some hesitation in expressing a very definite view.  We set up these State companies with the general idea that important commercial activities could be carried on here by them, giving them, on the one hand, access to the capital and credit resources of the State, and, on the other hand, the same freedom of operation as private industry enjoys.  This, of course, implied in particular freedom in relation to the payment of remuneration to their staffs and employees and in the sphere of relations with those staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also is not, I think, working out as was intended.  By and large, most people believe that the State Boards set headlines for private employers. That was not our intention. It was quite the reverse and, indeed, I am not at all sure that the present dispute in the Electricity Supply Board is not partly due to the application of a course of action which I, in the past, strongly recommended, namely, that <Col N="125" /> the Electricity Supply Board should, in relation to each category of its staff, agree to pay whatever rates of remuneration were fixed in relation to similar workers in private employment and that they should not be involved in direct negotiation on these rates but should automatically apply the rates which emerged from private negotiations.</P>
    <P>The earlier Electricity Supply Board trouble affecting the electricians was largely attributable to the fact that the ESB departed from that policy by becoming a member of the Industrial Council for Electricians and sitting on that Council as an employer. Ultimately they terminated that association after their last experience.  This has introduced a certain rigidity, I think, into the Electricity Supply Board's attitude and into their power to deal with the claims and difficulties brought to their tribunals by their staffs.  It may be that some more flexible system will be required, recognising that flexibility carries a great deal of risk in itself, that a large part of our present industrial unrest is due to comparisons made between groups of workers employed by a State company or a private firm with the remuneration of similar workers in other employments.</P>
    <P>A much more fundamental question, and one which Deputy Cosgrave briefly mentioned, is the comparisons made between the remuneration of skilled manual workers and that of clerical workers.  It seems to me that the role of the State company in setting wage patterns is becoming so pronounced that, even though it is undesirable, we have to recognise that it is so and the sphere of responsibility of a new State Department of Labour would therefore have to extend in some degree into the area of these companies and, to that degree, involve some departure from the conception we had in mind when they were originally set up.</P>
    <P>It is quite true&mdash;it was said here this afternoon and it has been stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a number of occasions&mdash;that without a great deal of goodwill, no machinery, no matter how elaborate, will work.  Whether we confine ourselves <Col N="126" /> to improving the powers of the Labour Court or to extending the conciliation services associated with that Court, or whether we create a new Department of State which will have responsibility in these matters, unless we can build up a climate of goodwill, we will continue to have industrial disputes affecting our economic development.</P>
    <P>Our greatest need, therefore, is to change the climate of industrial relations, to change the negative attitude of many employers, which has made it difficult to secure general and comprehensive arrangements acceptable generally, and the tendency of some unions to resort too readily to seeking a solution of their problems by way of strikes rather than by an extension of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the Government have been proceeding too slowly in the preparation of proposals for legislative changes, both in relation to the Industrial Relations Act and the Trade Union Acts, or in other directions. I agree we have been proceeding slowly.  We have been trying to secure the greatest possible measure of agreement between the parties before submitting proposals to the Dáil.  It would be optimistic to think we can get complete agreement, but I think we should seek to promote the widest agreement attainable.  Deputy Cosgrave described this as abdicating our responsibilities. I presume what he has in mind is that we should abandon this effort to get agreement and produce our ideas as to what should be done in the form of legislation and impose this on the parties, irrespective of whether or not it was acceptable to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>In my view, the process of seeking agreement and prompting discussions aimed at getting agreement is in itself a very important part of the whole operation which will ultimately lead, I hope, to the generation of this better climate of opinion in which the solutions we are seeking will be more easily found.</P>

      <P>I am trying to speak seriously; I hope the Deputy will allow me to do so.  It seems to me that when Deputy Cosgrave spoke here this evening about the Government provoking discussion on these matters, he was in a sense contradicting himself when he talked about our abdicating responsibility in trying to do what we are aiming at by discussion and agreement. It is very easy to say, as Deputy Cosgrave said, that the ideal solution is that everybody agrees about everything. This would be perfect, but that type of perfect society has not yet appeared on earth.  It has certainly not appeared here.  Deputy Cosgrave said that, when times were good, we should have got employers and workers together to promote in that atmosphere the possibility of future agreement. When times are good, it is impossible to get employers and workers to meet at all.  It is only under the provocation of some difficulty that people become alerted to the need for seeking solutions. Anyway, so far as we are concerned, we have very deliberately sought to proceed slowly in this matter &mdash;as I said recently, more slowly than would otherwise be possible&mdash;in order to achieve agreement rather than try to act more quickly by means of legislation and find ourselves imposing something on people without their concurrence.</P>

At that time this device for dealing with the problems of remuneration and conditions of employment was generally welcomed. <Col N="128" /> The trade unions involved and the Board accepted the attractiveness of this arrangement whereby there would be these tribunals to which, in the last resort, questions in dispute could be brought and resolved, the decisions of the tribunals being accepted and applied.  I think it is true to say that the Electricity Supply Board has never failed to accept and apply a decision given by these tribunals; but what has happened in recent years is that these tribunal decisions have not been accepted in all cases by some sections of the workers.</P>

If there is to be no alternative but a strike, then some substitute or some workable formula must be provided.  By an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement&mdash;it had little legal justification&mdash;some disputes not resolved at tribunals were brought to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court acted in these matters extra-statutorily. It seems to me that part of the change we have to envisage in the future is that all these matters will be concentrated, in so far as they are dealt with in that way at all, in the Labour Court.  In this way, it helps not merely to ensure the building-up of an expert body of opinion to be brought to bear upon these problems but also some uniformity in the decisions taken, as between one case and another, which will prevent this sense of unfairness when divergent awards are made by different tribunals which is a large part of our present problems.</P>

One can see that, in the ESB, there should be a domestic tribunal which will deal with most of the matters that arise in the employment of large staffs such as they have but, where the issue to be resolved is one that can affect other State organisations or other private employers, the final body to deal with it should, in our view, be the Labour Court.

      <P>In the last resort, where there was not initial agreement, the chairman of the tribunal, who was an independent person, would ultimately produce the majority decision which became effective.  I agree that this system tended to break down.  I think it can be restored in part, if not <Col N="130" /> completely.  This is what I can see emerging from the work of a new Department of Labour such as I envisage. All these matters have now to be thought out again in a fundamental way so that we can develop a general policy not merely in respect of industrial relations but on all matters affecting the welfare of labour in the country which will, if not completely eliminate the prospects of disputes arising, greatly minimise them, we hope, and ensure that a more flexible approach can be developed to the resolution of disputes that occur.</P>
      <P>I believe, in relation to the ESB, that the enactment of this Bill will be helpful.  I believe, and I hope sincerely, the Government will never have occasion to make an order bringing this Bill into operation.  However, recognition of the fact that such is the ultimate resort which will have to be availed of, if the alternative is a complete shut-down of electricity supply and the disemployment of other workers, should help to bring about the type of voluntary arrangement which will give us the benefit of an assurance against disruption of electricity supply while maintaining the principle of collective bargaining to which the Government are committed. The enactment of this Bill could be helpful in the present dispute. I suspect that one of the problems of the ESB, in dealing with this present dispute, is that it could be the first of many and that, if they resolved this dispute by making concessions, they would have similar claims by other groups of workers, leading eventually to the threat of strike action by them also.  Therefore, the protection given by this Bill can help to bring about a better atmosphere and therefore a better solution of the dispute.</P>

      <P>Let me express my views.  We are all pleased to learn that the situation appears to have eased somewhat.  The negotiations today are being resumed tomorrow. While, earlier this morning, it looked as if the unions' direction to cease picketing the power stations was not <Col N="131" /> being generally obeyed, that instruction has since been obeyed and the pickets are being withdrawn from all but two of the stations.  This suggests that the atmosphere is better and that the solution which we desire which will avoid the utilisation of the powers contained in this Bill may be in sight.  I am certain it will help to bring this about if we can get everybody to recognise and accept that a complete stoppage of electricity power is something we cannot have.</P>

      <P>The thought going through my mind while the Taoiseach was speaking, and I am sure through the minds of many people here, was that as the Taoiseach knows so much about the wage-fixing machinery in the ESB, and the way it can be settled, and all these disputes can be settled, is it not a great wonder that the only way he can now find to settle those disputes is not what he has told the House but to arm himself with a big stick and parade it in the House in front of the Fianna Fáil Party so as to put through a Bill?  I am sure he was heartened by the fact that Deputy Cosgrave and Fine Gael lined up with their big stick on the other side of the House and assured him of their support.</P>

      <P>Whether you were sure or not, you gave the right answer from your side.  You let the cat out of the bag.  That is what the Government have in mind.  In future, if you cannot get a wage dispute settled to your satisfaction, then the proper thing <Col N="133" /> to do is use the legislation of this House and force them.  I would like at this stage to point out to the Taoiseach that although there is no reference in the Bill to imprisonment, there is reference to fines.  They are pretty hefty fines.  Does the Minister know what happens the fellow fined who does not pay?  Of course, he would not know anything about that.  We know what happened a few months ago when people would not pay fines.  We will not have a Presidential election for a considerable time so we cannot hope that anybody will intercede for these fellows and bring them out of jail.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach can be sure that if he succeeds in getting this Bill through the Dáil and if those people are brought to court, because they are not going to crawl back to work to oblige him, his Government or anybody else, he is going to have the greatest trouble he ever had in his life.  I am sorry to have to say it.  While he is talking about the shocking thing it is that 180,000 or 200,000 people are out of work over the stoppage, he seems to forget that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions speaks for most of those people and we speak for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Our instructions are that they are opposed tooth and nail to this Bill.  The Taoiseach can think over that one for a few minutes.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach knows as much about the ESB negotiations as he claims, he must know that the Board of the ESB and nobody else are responsible for what has happened. We hear an awful lot of talk about the shocking thing it is that 100 men can hold up the whole country.  I suggest that 100 men are not holding up the country but that seven men, plus one Minister, are holding up the country.  I have nothing personal against the Minister.  There is no getting away from the fact that if the Government were doing their duty, they would not be attacking the trade unions and the strikers but would be dealing with the Board of the ESB and with the Minister, who says here he has no responsibility for them inside the House but surely he must have responsibility for them outside the House.</P>

      <P>The Bill introduced here this afternoon was introduced as a deliberate blackmail attack on the workers of the ESB at present on strike in an attempt to force them back to work.  There is no use in anybody trying to deny it.  We may talk about fair play but we cannot get away from the fact that there are two parties to this dispute and the Government of the country, with the assistance of the main Opposition, attacked one of them and said they would settle the dispute while the ESB can sit back and say: &ldquo;Good men; you will look after our interests and let the other fellows go to jail if they do not pay.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If it is, then I am afraid the Taoiseach is the man who has not read the Bill.  At the end of section 9 are set out the penalties.  For disobeying an order not to strike, a person on summary conviction may be fined £25, plus £5 a day for continuing the offence and on indictment, a person may be fined £5,000, plus £100 a day. It is also provided that when a person is acting on behalf of a trade union, the trade union must pay the fine.  Section 10 provides that a body corporate may be prosecuted on indictment for an offence.  This means that the trade union will be threatened with a fine of £5,000, plus £100 a day.  Will the Taoiseach explain if that is the way to encourage people back to work?  Is this the way the industrial relations of the country are going to be dealt with in the future.  Is this what the new Minister for Labour will have as his charter?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is one of these people who is a great believer in democracy when it sui <Col N="135" /> himself.  It is his own type of democracy? He says all men are equal, only some are more equal than others.  I have heard the Taoiseach and his Ministers say: &ldquo;We believe the right of workers to go on strike except...&rdquo; and then they go on excepting.  As soon as somebody treads on their corns, they say that group are not entitled to go on strike.  It is the ESB workers today; it will be CIE tomorrow and Aer Lingus the next day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We listened to you for half an hour.  The Taoiseach and the Minister talked about going slowly. They talked about how slow the Government were in all this and how they desired not to rush into anything.  The ESB were also very slow.  This demand was served on 29th December, 1964. The tribunal heard it on 29th July, 1965.  The strike operated from 2nd May, 1966.  If that is not going slowly, I would like somebody to tell me what is.  I do not know whether or not the ESB felt all along that, having the experience of 1961 behind them, all they had to do was sit back and eventually the Government would &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at the strikers.  Make things bad enough and they were sure to have the Government on their side.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach may not be in a position to contradict this, or he may be, but I would like somebody to state it authoritatively.  A reply was given here to Deputy O'Connell the week before last.  It was reported by the people representing the strikers that there was no reason whatever for the shut-down of electricity which occurred a few weeks ago.  There was no reason whatever except one, and that one reason was that the Board of the ESB wanted to create such a situation that there would have to be action by the Government.</P>

The people who are on strike now say there was no reason, good, bad or indifferent, for that closedown, and particularly for a closedown which prevented hospitals from getting supplies.  The ESB must be damn bad organisers if they could not organise the current available in such a way as to give supply to essential services.  I know of one hospital where the Board refused to allow the local authority running it to bring in a supplementary supply until it suited themselves.  There were two fuses to be drawn.  They could only be drawn by the ESB, who refused to allow them to be drawn.</P>

The unions were doing everything possible to have the strike carried out in a reasonable way.  The Board of the ESB persuaded the Government to blackmail, or attempt to blackmail, these people to go back to work.  It does not matter a damn if the Taoiseach and his Minister get this Bill through the Dáil tonight or tomorrow afternoon, get it through the Seanad and have it signed by the President.  That will not settle the dispute and nobody will be forced back to work simply because the Government say they must work for a certain wage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish made a point which I think was completely missed by a number of people and for that reason it is worth repeating.  The judges got a very high increase in pay a few years ago because it was felt the judiciary were doing a special job that nobody else could do.  In recent weeks doctors have been receiving a very high increase to which they are entitled because they are doing a specialised job.  There are 100 men involved in this dispute and nobody can do that work except them.  Let the Minister for Transport and Power deny that if he likes.  If the Minister or his Government thought that Army engineers would be able to do that work they would be manning these stations before now, but they cannot do it because they have not been trained to it. These 100 men know their job and they are doing it well.  What are they being paid for a 42½ hour 5-day week? The basic is £13 10. and for a 45-hour week, it is £14 5. 11.  I wonder does the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers know there are people in small factories around the country working from 8 o'clock to 5 o'clock on five days a week who are getting that wage.</P>

In these circumstances it is not seen what purpose may be served by holding the discussions requested by you.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach does not know what he is talking about.  If we could get these people to the Labour Court, these things could be settled overnight, but there is no appeal against the conditions of employment laid down for State employees. That is the sort of treatment which would be given to the ESB workers if the ESB thought they could get away with it.  This matter is far too serious to be treated in the way in which it is being treated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach rushed around yesterday evening with his Bill.  People outside this House had copies of it.  Deputies even of his own Party had no copy and did not know what was in the Bill until the Taoiseach told them today, or they were issued with copies in the afternoon.  Matters should not have been allowed to rest there.  The Taoiseach quoted Standing Orders and while it is true that Standing Orders preclude the publication of the Bill until after the First Reading, by agreement there is no reason why, if the Taoiseach wanted to do the thing in the proper way, every Deputy should not have had a copy of it in the post this morning.  He did not get it and the reason we did not get it was that <Col N="140" /> the intention was to bulldoze it through the House and the less Deputies knew about it, the less chance there was of having opposition to it.  It just did not work out.  The usual explanatory memorandum was not included.  Maybe it was rushed out, but we were able to make out our own explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House.  The proposal to deal with this Bill in this way is no credit to the Government or to the Taoiseach.  During the discussion on the motion when some intelligent comments were being made by members of the Labour Party, there were interruptions from backbenchers of Fianna Fáil who did not see the Bill and who did not know what was in it.  They were only interrupting because they thought the Taoiseach might hear them and maybe consider them for a Parliamentary Secretaryship later on.</P>

In my opinion, this is a trial run for further repressive legislation which the Government propose to introduce later on, and that fact makes it imperative that it should not be allowed to pass through this House without comment. I sincerely hope the ESB will see a bit of sense and that the discussions which took place this afternoon, despite the efforts of the Government to sabotage them by bringing this Bill into the House, will be successful.  I assure the Minister that as far as we are concerned in the Labour Party, every time this sort of measure is introduced here, we shall oppose it tooth and nail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a Bill under which we are trying to make it unlawful to strike or to picket in the case of a very essential service. We are also discussing the very heavy penalties in this Bill.  The Labour Party have made the point that these do not include imprisonment but, of course, if you do not pay the fine, you will probably be imprisoned anyway.  The Taoiseach has told us that he proposes to produce the headlines tomorrow for the shape of a new Department for Labour which will cover industrial disputes in State-sponsored bodies, manpower and so on.  He already has a Parliamentary Secretary doing that and I do not think the promotion of the Parliamentary Secretary to a junior Ministry will matter very much.  It will possibly mean a slight increase in pay such as is being sought by the workers on strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce took the biscuit when he came along and said the Government never foresaw having to introduce such legislation. The truth, of course, is, as we all know, including the Minister if he remembers it, that such legislation was introduced in 1961.  It was far more repressive at that time although it was temporary.  We all know how the Dáil and Seanad were kept here until two o'clock in the morning to put that Bill through.  We also remember that it was Saturday morning and that the provisions in the Bill were that there <Col N="142" /> should be a tribunal in 1961.  In 1966, we are to have an arbitrator.  There was provision, if agreement could not be got on the tribunal, that a majority decision would hold.  In 1966, we are to have a commission and we are to have recourse to the Labour Court. In 1961, we were going to regulate the prices of commodities that might be affected by a cessation of electricity supplies.  We were taking power to produce price control as well as wage control in 1961.  We were going to impose fines of £100 and £20 per day for a continuing offence.  Now we are going to fine them on conviction on indictment&mdash;the £100 being merely on summary conviction&mdash;£5,000.  On summary conviction in 1961, we were prepared to send people to gaol for six months.</P>
    <P>What happened between Saturday at 2 a.m. and Monday morning?  The Taoiseach has settled the job for 35/-a week.  Our minds were made up at 12 o'clock on Friday night and at 2 a.m. on Saturday.  I remember this well because four or five members of our Party felt so deeply on the matter of personal freedom in regard to this piece of legislation in 1961 that they asked to be excused from voting. Deputies Dunne, Casey and O.J. Flanagan and other Deputies on the opposite side will also remember this. We voted with the Government on that occasion because we felt that the supply of an essential commodity should be preserved but the Taoiseach, between Friday night and Monday morning, did what he will always do &mdash;fiddled the job.  He merely came in on Friday night for the purpose of waving the big stick as mentioned by the Labour Party and mentioned by him as a magic wand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not see much magic or fairy wands operating on the Fianna Fáil side at present.  They are dull, heavy-footed and leaden like the Deputy but I believe the same performance will take place between now and tomorrow night in 1966.  Let us prophesy about this.  This Government are down in the trough, not quite at <Col N="143" /> the bottom but sliding down, and once they are sliding, they cannot stop.  They cannot afford to have a situation in which more people will be brought before the courts and fined £5.  The question mark is: will the unions pay? Of course in this legislation they have &mdash;this is where the Labour Party slipped up slightly&mdash;authority to give the matter over to the Attorney General under the Minister for Justice who now sits looking at us who will have the means to collect the fines.  If they are acting on behalf of the unions, the unions will be responsible and they will be made pay the very heavy fines of £5,000 which can be extracted.</P>
      <P>I believe it will not happen.  The Taoiseach is a political animal&mdash;I mean that in no personally offensive way.  He thinks in a political way and I am as certain as can be that the matter will be concluded.  Is it right that it should be concluded in the present frame of mind?  Is it right that a solution be found which may not be the right one? The Taoiseach mentioned that this solution will affect all other labour problems in the ESB.  If it does, it will have the same effect outside.  Should we have reached this stage?  That is the big question.  Did the Taoiseach and the Government do as much as they should have done in the past few years?  They are the people in power since 1957.  In 1961, they had four years; in 1966, they have had 8½ years. This proves they have completely failed to create a climate of conciliation in industrial relations.  We are told the Taoiseach is trying to do something about it by promoting his Parliamentary Secretary to a junior Ministry, calling him by a different name.  Is this a solution.  There is no solution except the proper regulation of Government and the proper regulation of the machination of the Cabinet.  In the years that have passed that has not occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is in order to discuss briefly the position in relation to incomes and the problems of the working people in the past few years.  The Government themselves adverted to it in 1962 when they issued the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap&mdash;Incomes and Output</i><Col N="144" /> laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in February, 1963.  The tenor of this White Paper was that we were all spending too much, that our production was not equating the increases in incomes we were giving ourselves, that we must tighten our belts, produce more and spend less on consumer goods.  On page 7, paragraph 10, it stated:</P>
    <P>When income increases greatly exceed the growth in national production there are adverse effects also on the country's trading position.  Home-produced goods are made less competitive in foreign markets by the rise in production costs.  At the same time some of the new purchasing power is being used to buy a greater volume of imports.  Less exports and more imports mean a bigger gap between what we earn abroad and what we spend abroad &mdash;an increased deficit in our balance of international payments.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 on the same page says:</P>
    <P>To correct a large deficit, measures having adverse repercussions on trade and employment may be unavoidable. The measures taken in such circumstances in 1956-57 included heavy duties on imports, restrictions on consumer spending and curtailment of capital expenditure. Trade and production were depressed, unemployment and emigration were increased, and an atmosphere unfavourable to economic expansion was created.  This experience should be sufficient warning to avoid the need for such measures again.  The final result, in effect, is that the initial increase in pay, so far as it exceeds the increase in output, is nullified by higher prices and fewer jobs.  Those who lose their jobs and those on pensions or other fixed incomes are the hardest hit, although few remain unaffected.</P>
    <P>Then there is the following sentence in paragraph 12:</P>
    <P>The reason for concern at present is that, as indicated in earlier paragraphs, most of the features described above were present in 1962&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> This is at the end of 1962&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;income increases outrunning productivity, a rise in prices, a slackening of the rate of growth in industrial output, a widening of the trade gap, and a large increase in the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>That is what the Government thought in 1962 and it was the Government's responsibility to create a climate or a situation whereby the difficulty they saw in 1962 would have been dissipated and all the clouds dispersed at least by 1966.</P>
    <P>What did they do since 1962?  Why are these 100 men so adamantly on strike?  Whatever are the rights or wrongs of the case, the unfortunate working man, whatever increase he got, is now hard hit to rear his family and is worse off than he was even before the ninth round, after that White Paper was published in 1962.  The Government found themselves in difficulties with two by-elections, when they had to have recourse to the electors, just as, last week, when they again had recourse to the electors, they would not bring in this Bill because there was a Presidential election coming up, even though they said that that election was of no political significance.</P>
    <P>The Government have progressively gone down the slide because they have not been prepared to live up to what they said they believed in when they published that White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i> They have gone down the slide because they wanted to buy votes.  They can buy votes as long as they have the wherewithal to buy them but they have now reached the end of the road and they can no longer buy them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that he himself and his Ministers do not openly and publicly intervene in negotiations on wages but that there are always informal talks.  After the publication of <i>Closing the Gap</i> and when there were two by-elections coming up, the Taoiseach boasted to the electors that he had secured for the workers a 12 per cent increase to cover a period of 2½ years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He did nothing of the kind.</P>

    <Col N="146" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, and I will not accept any declaration that he did not.  I will go to the Library and produce the papers on this matter and quote them the next time I get the opportunity.  The Taoiseach boasted of this in two by-elections.  He produced this increase and he rode the horse home, regardless of whether there was steam to continue the journey.  That is what he did and he holds a double responsibility for the present state of affairs because that wage agreement was made to cover a period of 2½ years.  The Minister knows that prices will follow wages in from nine to 12 months and if you make an agreement for 2½ years, you have created the perfect climate for the cutting in value of the workers' wages and for creating difficulties for the workers' wives in making ends meet.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that three weeks ago OECD described us as the worst country for industrial strikes in Europe in 1965.  We are the people who are supposed to be encouraging industry here in order to absorb the people who are leaving the land and we are also the people who, in 1965, believed in the cod and in the targets set down in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  We are the people who had 7,000 people fewer employed in 1965 than in 1964.  We also had the futility this year of statements by Ministers who said that the proper wage increase should be three per cent.  These statements were blown up by the Labour Court when a wage increase of £1 per week, approximately nine per cent, was produced by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do we blame 100 fitters who think they are entitled to more?  The Government did not introduce this legislation a week or a fortnight ago because they were afraid they would lose votes in the pending Presidential election, an election which they said was of no political significance.  We are here tonight because we find ourselves in this position, because of a weak Government who cannot stand up to any vested interest at any time, a Government so weak that their Ministers are prepared to hold on to their <Col N="147" /> offices by any means whatever, a Government who have left us in a position where we must legislate tonight or tomorrow because there are children in incubators in hospitals, because there is such a thing as blood plasma, because there are iron lungs, because there are such things as cows that have not been milked in any other way than by electrical milking machines, because there are hundreds of tons of butter in cold storage, because there is food that will be ruined and because there are chickens that must be kept warm by electricity. It would be a national catastrophe if we found ourselves without electricity and we could not face our people or raise our heads if we allowed this to happen.</P>
    <P>We are legislating here tonight in a national crisis which is definitely and solely the responsibility of the Government in office for 8½ years.  Remember how critical they were even in 1962, how severe they were, how the present Minister for Transport and Power, when the price of cattle was falling, came in here day after day and put down 20 to 30 questions regarding the price of cattle, not caring whether he brought the price down further but only because he wanted the job of Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>When dealing with these people, we are dealing with politicians first, last and all the time and, in passing, I may say that I am fed to the back teeth with political commentators who describe us as amateurs and the members of the Government as professionals. They are not professionals; they are political prostitutes who are prepared to sell everything they have to stay in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might amuse the Minister for Lands if he were here but I will try to keep in order from now on.  We have been talking here about <Col N="148" /> 200,000 people who could be put out of employment but I want to say that the climate for that situation has been brought about by the Government. The whole situation is the fault of the Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to deal with a strike that might arise in an essential service which is under Government finance and control but the two gentlemen responsible for these services are sitting opposite to me now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Transport and Power.  I have indicated that our present dilemma is a result of the ineptitude of the Government.  No more inept persons could be produced here than the two Ministers now sitting opposite. I do not want to go into particulars but the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows that on two certain matters he has been proved to be wrong.</P>
      <P>Let us realise, then, that a weak Government are an invitation to every vested interest and that leapfrogging is not confined to wages and salaries.  It is not confined to Government sponsored companies or private companies or public companies.  It exists right through society.  The position is that whatever increase is given today by a Government that is incorrect&mdash;and I suggest that certain things they have done have been incorrect and by that I do not mean either too large or anything like that: I mean incorrect; an example would be the fact that the 12½ per cent was for two and a half years and the two and a half was incorrect&mdash;once it is incorrect, it creates a wrong flow of wages and salary increases, a wrong flow of prices.  That is what has happened here.  It is the Government's fault because in the by-elections, in the 1965 general election and in the Presidential election, they portrayed themselves as a weak Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that we find ourselves in this situation.  I want to be quite clear. I attended a meeting of the Front Bench of this Party before we came down here at six o'clock and discussed it with members of the Party also.  Our position is that we have to be complete and absolute pragmatists, people <Col N="149" /> who just look at the facts of the case. The facts are as I have outlined, that you will have people dying in incubators, you will have colossal loss, you will have 200,000 workers out of jobs and we have got to legislate.  I forecast, and I would bet if such were permissible in this Chamber, that that legislation will never be used and that there will be a settlement.  That is the way it was done before and, if I know the mind of the Taoiseach, that is the way it will be done again.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is a poor situation to have reached after 8½ years of Government, in which the terms of trade were very favourable to us at times and never very unfavourable, in which there was every opportunity and, up to quite recently, a good flow of capital available.  Fianna Fáil stand charged with complete failure in this instance and that is another reason why they should get out and let other people get in.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over again what has already been said by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce but I should explain that in connection with the operation of the ESB, I have worked very closely with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in all matters with regard to the ESB organisation where he has the ultimate responsibility of framing for the Government such matters as relate to industrial relations and I think it is about time that something was said about the ESB organisation. I say without any kind of hesitation that the Electricity Supply Board is a splendid organisation, well organised and well and competently run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say also that in past debates in the Dáil the <Col N="150" /> Electricity Supply Board has been very highly commended by people from all sides of the House and because we happen to have got into a very serious position in relation to a contemplated strike, it does not mean that this atmosphere should be created in the House that the ESB itself is not a fine organisation.</P>
      <P>Although, as the Taoiseach said, the two statutory tribunals of the ESB have proved, because of various changes that have taken place in different sections of workers, not to be entirely satisfactory, it is also true to say that there have been a great many accepted settlements within the statutory tribunals, on small matters relating to the internal working of the ESB, to the gradings of workers, to all sorts of matters relating to their conditions of employment and also in relation to changes that have taken place in the wage structure.  It should be made clear that while these two tribunals, as the Taoiseach said, no longer fit the case in present circumstances, and their work in so far as it relates to wages and salaries which will have an impact outside, should really be taken over by the Labour Court, nevertheless, as I have said, many satisfactory settlements have been made and accepted by the workers and by the ESB management that have been put forward by these two statutory tribunals.  To get into a kind of hysterical state and suggest that the whole of the labour relations of the Board are disastrous is not being objective in a study of what is a very serious question that we now have to examine.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deal with the rights of this particular group of workers because that is not part of the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill, as Deputies know, there can be an appeal to the Labour Court and also to another arbitrator appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so it is not true that as and from this moment the final agreement in regard to the wages to be paid to these fitters <Col N="151" /> is necessarily what it is now but there must be acceptance of one or two forms of arbitration.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the main consideration we have to think of in this connection has already been mentioned, that is, we simply cannot have an interruption of electricity supply and I want to make it clear that the ESB and I had an absolute understanding that they should do their utmost to preserve power and it is scandalous to suggest that the ESB tried to limit the amount of power available throughout the system in order to have a Bill of this kind enacted through the House.  It is completely untrue.</P>
      <P>When the men decided to picket certain stations, the men working inside the stations said they would have to close the station down, that they could not go on working there, and all the ESB can do in the event of stations being picketed by one group of people and others refusing to pass the picket is to re-deploy the staff willing still to work in the best way they can in the maximum number of stations they can keep open and even that can last for only a short time.  If there happens to be any breakdown in a station even at this moment, a crisis could begin again and there are some 270 megawatts at this moment not available out of a total of 800 to 1,000 because they need maintenance at this moment which they cannot have because of the strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, not to go over ground gone over before, I do want to assure Deputies that I have constantly sought some way by which I could tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that some kind of voluntary arbitration scheme would be possible, either by negotiations through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Electricity Supply Board or through internal negotiation between the ESB management and the staff.  I have always thought that that was by far the best solution for a monopoly service of an absolutely essential character. I have studied the arrangements that were made in half a dozen countries in Northern Europe where <Col N="152" /> there are never any strikes whatever in electricity undertakings and in some cases railway services and docks are strike free.</P>
    <P>I have studied the system which has been fully accepted by the trade unions of these countries, which has been in operation for many years, which consists either of some voluntary arbitration agreement renewable every year which by itself operates to prevent strikes, or else by an arbitration arrangement which has been agreed to by the unions and by the employers and which has been fortified by legislation confirming the whole arrangement and providing for penalties and making quite sure that the agreement for any particular level of wages and salaries is an enforceable legal contract.  This is not in the least uncommon.  It can be found also in countries such as New Zealand and Australia.  You will find most of the public utilities' labour arrangements organised in such a way that there is this voluntary arbitration.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat, as the Minister in charge of the general operations of the ESB, that I have constantly sought opportunity for finding out whether I could say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he might help in some particular way in getting some arrangement accepted.  It has not been found possible&mdash;</P>

I hope there will be a settlement and I hope that because of the very grave crisis we face&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and because of the possibility of the complete elimination of electricity supplies, we can hope that there would perhaps be a better climate for discussing a more permanent system or arrangement which can be voluntarily entered into and agreed to by the workers and management of the ESB and which might possibly require another form of legislation in order to seal it and deliver it to the public so that they can understand its import.  I do not think that is an unreasonable comment of mine. I am sure everybody in the House would prefer to have the kind of arrangement that is possible in a great many European and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it would take much too long to cover the present situation and I simply wanted to make it clear that I have examined at all times the working of the statutory tribunals, the suggestion that they should be abolished and their activities replaced by the Labour Court in relation to labour claims, and I have been in constant touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to all matters concerning the working of the ESB. I have constantly studied the improvements made in the position of the staff. The general increase in remuneration in the ESB in the past five or six years has not been unsatisfactory to the point that one could say the whole wage system is unsatisfactory.  That is why I think it is all the sadder that there should be, as there is, the danger of a complete breakdown.  I hope this Bill will be accepted in the spirit in which it is meant, in the hope that it will <Col N="154" /> encourage in the future a longer lasting form of arbitration machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution which we have just heard from the Minister for Transport and Power is typical of the type of statement he made at chambers of commerce dinners where there was nobody to criticise him.  He comes along now with a palsy-walsy speech in which he invited all of us to be very good boys and to induce our trade union members and the members of the Labour Party to toe the line and then we will all be pals and everything will pass over.  I am afraid he cannot get away with that.  Candidly, during my 12 years in this House, I have never seen a more disgraceful attempt at introducing this type of legislation.  Earlier on the motion, I pointed out that I was expected to come along here, without any copy of the Bill, to discuss a motion limiting me to a certain time and in which to go through the whole gamut of what I and everybody in the Labour Party and indeed, every liberal-minded person would regard as a very important Bill and have the whole thing completed by 10.30 tonight.  However, we got over that.</P>
      <P>Speakers on the Government side and from the main Opposition Party have endeavoured to create the idea that we are assembled here specially to deal with what they regard as the alleged irresponsible actions of 100 men, which of course is not the case. There is much more involved in this, and everybody knows it, than the 100 fitters in the ESB.  If this Bill passes into legislation, it will mean that everybody working in the ESB, not only the 100 men who have been unjustly pilloried by this House, by public bodies and by the press generally, will find that the terms of this Bill will apply to him.  He may be an electrician, an office boy, a chief clerk, an accountant, or a lorry driver &mdash;it does not matter who he is as all are included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are seeking power under this Bill to take action as a result of a trade dispute or where there is a serious disruption of electricity or a danger of such a disruption. <Col N="155" /> In other words, the Government of the day can decide that perhaps in three or four weeks time, or three or four months time, there will be a reasonable danger of a disruption and they can immediately take action against the people concerned.  I want to say this non-politically, that if this House endeavours to embark on that type of legislation, it is not known where it is going to end.</P>
    <P>I know that very cogent and valid arguments can be put forward from that side of the House in relation to the present dispute, but I invite those who advance these arguments to tell me where all this will end: the ESB today; I suppose CIE tomorrow.  We have heard rumours regarding CIE over the past few years in this House in regard to their labour relations.  I suppose it might possibly spread to Bord na Móna, to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, perhaps to Aer Lingus.  I suppose the Minister would not be averse to extending it to Irish Shipping and our newly-acquired B &amp; I.  In other words, we are setting up for the first time here a situation in which the majority of those employed in industrial employment will, as it were, hold that employment at the whim and fancy of the Government and the particular Minister in charge of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to everyone to examine his conscience and ask himself: is this democracy?  Are we slipping a little from the great democratic principles about which many of us have been shouting over the past few months during the celebrations of the 50th Anniversary of the 1916 Rising? I wonder are we slipping?  I feel quite sincerely, not strictly as a Labour Party man, but as a democrat and a constitutionalist, that we may begin to slip in that direction and, in time, may hand over to the civil servants powers that should be reserved to Parliament and to the free democratic institutions in the State, employers' associations, trade unions, concillation machinery and voluntary&mdash;I stress voluntary&mdash; arbitration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> One part of our press has sought to give the impression that this Bill is introduced to deal with unofficial strikes.  That is not so.  Actually this Bill is dealing with an official strike called by a responsible and registered trade union.  One cannot set up a trade union without going through a certain process.  One must satisfy the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to one's bona fides.  One must lodge a deposit; one must be registered.  Only then can one set up a trade union.  This Bill seeks to imply that these legal, bona fide organisations having gone through that process, may no longer act in the way trade unions have traditionally acted in relation to just claims against employers.  It is sought to take away from trade unions rights they have always enjoyed.</P>
    <P>We should not make a bad situation worse.  Nobody can tell me that by passing this Bill we will solve the unhappy situation that exists.  It is provided that, if there is danger of disruption of industry, the Government may bring in an Order and then, under section 6 of this Bill, prohibit picketing in furtherance of a dispute where an Order has been made.  If the Government wanted to run into trouble, they could not have worded that section better.  They are, in effect, telling a responsible trade union&mdash;I shall say nothing about the strength of the various trade unions connected with the ESB&mdash;that they are prohibiting their picketing in an official strike, a course of action taken after due deliberation by the trade union concerned.</P>
    <P>In section 9 the penalties for misdemeanours under this piece of legislation are set out.  On summary conviction, a person may be fined £25, plus £5 per day, that is, per skull on the picket.  On indictment a person may be fined £5,000 plus £100 a day. It is also provided that where a person is acting on behalf of a trade union, the union must pay the fine.  I wonder who had the brainstorm that thought up that particular provision?  I should like to know the identity of the individual who thinks that, in this day and age, he can say to organised Irish <Col N="157" /> trade unionists, acting on the instructions of their trade union, a union that has deliberated and come to a certain conclusion, that, if they happen to be working for the ESB, they will be subject to very stringent penalties for acting in accordance with the instructions of their trade union.</P>
    <P>Does anybody, outside Grangegorman, think that policy can be implemented?  The trade unions can instruct their trade unionists to picket in their hundreds.  What will be the position then?  The first thing the country would have to do is to start building gaols fast.  As a Minister remarked in Limerick recently, one of his main concerns is the housing problem in Limerick.  The housing problem in Cork is just as acute.  I think we should go ahead building houses and not start building gaols but, if this legislation is implemented, if this House is stupid enough to pass this Bill, we will not be able to build gaols fast enough.</P>
    <P>Those of us who know something about the negotiating machinery of the Electricity Supply Board feel that, if there is to be any indictment in this House or elsewhere, it should be an indictment of the Board of the ESB. Deputy Tully mentioned a sorry list of negotiations: it was really a list of lack of negotiations.  He pointed out quite clearly that this alleged machinery was obviously neglected by the Board of the ESB.  Therefore, we make this case and we are not making it particularly on behalf of the 100 men who happen to be the kernel of the dispute.  We are making it in relation to labour relations generally and particularly labour relations within the ambit of the present Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>It is not without significance that, over the years, since the advent of the present holder of the portfolio of the Department of Transport and Power, all our major disputes have been with concerns that come under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power.  We had the case of the CIE busmen.  We had the row with Aer Lingus.  We had the row with the port authorities.  We had the threatened very serious row with Irish Shipping. <Col N="158" /> I suppose the only reason the present Minister for Transport and Power has not had a row with the B &amp; I is that he is not sufficiently long in charge of the Department.  Without any personal animosity towards the man himself, I think we must all feel, as reasonable men, that there is a mishandling of these matters by the Minister for Transport and Power.  It would be difficult to surpass such a sorry record of failures.  Therefore, we in the Labour Party feel that instead of bringing in a trade union or a section of a trade union and devoting the time of the Dáil here today to indicting them, the people who should be indicted and who should be answerable are (1) the Minister for Transport and Power and (2) the Board of the ESB.</P>
    <P>If we have the temerity to put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power in regard to any of the State-sponsored bodies which come under his Department, the reply we get is that he does not interfere in the day to day administration of these bodies.  He is down the country at present.  He knows everything about the ESB, CIE and every other company. He can quote statistics <i>ad nauseam</i> but, if he is asked a question the following week, he knows nothing. That is not good enough.  The discussion we have had here today and the necessity the Government felt to introduce this most restrictive and reactionary piece of legislation can be laid at the door of the Minister for Transport and Power who is either unwilling or unable to do his job.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that a handful of people should never be in a position to hold the country up to ransom. Any of us in the Labour Party or in the trade unions would not subscribe to the theory that a small group or, indeed, a group of people, should be able, undemocratically, to hold the country up to ransom.  We would not, and do not, subscribe to that view but certainly we would say, with greater emphasis, that a Minister of State, and a Minister in this capacity, should not, because of his incompetence or reluctance, be allowed to put the country into the position into which <Col N="159" /> he has been putting it in relation to the ESB, CIE and every other State-sponsored body with which his Department is connected.</P>
    <P>Special legislation was introduced here three weeks ago to give increases of £700 per annum to certain specialists attached to various local authorities. I am glad the Minister for Health is present.  In conjunction with the Association of City and County Managers, and perhaps other interests of which I am quite unaware, the Minister was able to write to each authority, certainly to the authority with which I am connected, giving approval to an increase of £700 per annum in respect of three persons in my area, at any rate.  This happened at a time when other employees of local authority hospitals&mdash;they happen to be domestics and other people&mdash;are awaiting the Minister's sanction for an increase of £1 per week but I suppose the Minister has not yet got around to that.</P>
    <P>When at the stroke of a pen the Minister for Health can grant an increase of £700 a year to specialists, we begin to wonder where are we going. We are entitled to warn the Government and the main Opposition Party, about going along with this very restrictive legislation and, having listened to Deputy Donegan, I am not quite clear what their reason is.  We must make this categorical statement. On principle and irrespective of what happens, we are against any legislation that deprives a man of the right to strike.  The people we represent have nothing to sell but their labour.</P>

      <P>We started this debate at 4 o'clock this afternoon in an atmosphere of extreme tension, an atmosphere where there was a certain amount of parliamentary chaos and a certain amount of talk in relation to Motion No. 6 on the Order Paper, which in fact should not have been discussed at that particular time at all. We in the Fine Gael Party are being accused of simply lining up with the Government Party in order to have a slap at the workers in the ESB or anywhere else.  It would be extremely easy for me or any member of my Party or indeed for anybody as a simple political manoeuvre to vote against this measure.  But we chose otherwise.  In so choosing we are merely making another contribution to a long list of similar and related contributions in the field of patriotic endeavour in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be told that it is an Opposition's business to oppose and that on that supposition one should always so oppose.  We do not accept the view <Col N="163" /> that one should oppose merely for the sake of opposition.  One must at times consider the nation, consider the common good.  We considered these three things and all the things associated with them and came to the conclusion to support this particular piece of legislation.  That does not mean we accept for one minute that this legislation is made necessary by reason solely of the fault of the workers in the ESB or solely of the fault of the Board of the ESB.  We believe, and I believe personally, that the fault in this matter lies, in the first instance, at the door of the Minister for Transport and Power, who has failed miserably to take any reasonable steps during his period of stewardship to date in order to ease labour difficulties which were accruing in that board since legislation of this kind was necessary on a similar occasion in September, 1961.  Even if it passed over then beyond the point of recollection, he had notice last year that this trouble was again brewing, and he had notice as far back as 2nd May of this year that pickets would be put on.</P>
    <P>I remember reading the daily paper on the 10th May of this year.  Was the Minister for Transport and Power responsible for the administration of the ESB and for the manner in which these workers were being paid and being treated, responsible for their conditions of employment?  Was he concerned at that time when a strike of this kind was threatened and was imminent?  The only piece of news I saw on the morning of the 10th May in the daily newspaper was that the Minister for Transport and Power had graciously consented to read poetry in Dundalk at a festival.  Tonight as I looked across there, while he silently and timorously waited to make his miserable contribution to this debate in which he justified nothing and explained less, he reminded me of the lines of Burns, if we have to swop the pleasantries of poetry with him:</P>
    <P>Wee, sleekit, cowering, timorous beastie,</P>
    <P>Oh!  what a panic's in thy breastie.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Having made that little contribution he scurried out of the House, because he knew he was able to pass the buck to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, he said, has responsibility for labour relations.  That, of course, is true but how can you pass any kind of responsibility over without having cared to study it at all?  The Minister for Transport and Power regaled us with information about labour relations machinery in various countries in Europe.  He was even as far south as New Zealand in order to tell us what happens there.  But in Ireland, here in the territory, he has no responsibility. He does not seem to have even a glimmer of what is the correct thing to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has said so often that he has no function that he believes it, and the ESB as well as the boards of all the other companies for which he is responsibility policy-wise have taken this oft-repeated remark seriously, and he, like the Government, is not in control in any phase of the activity which he is supposed to supervise and direct. &ldquo; I have no function in the matter. &rdquo; I am extremely glad the Minister appears to have the function of returning to the House.  It should have been obvious to the Minister for Transport and Power over the past few years that something was going very wrong in the labour relations of the Electricity Supply Board.  He has invited us again this evening to read the plaudits which many of us have used on previous occasions in regard to the ESB.  He says it is a splendid organisation.  I agree it is a splendid organisation.  It certainly was, but it is becoming daily less splendid under the supervision, direction and guidance of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>When I make commendations in regard to the ESB or in regard to any other board or State body, I am paying the compliment to everybody from the chairman right down to the most recent acquisition of office boy, because, remember, they are all cogs in a machine.  If each cog is not working perfectly then something will go wrong and the whole machinery will <Col N="165" /> collapse.  The office boy, the fitter, the typist, the junior executive officer, the senior one, the accountant, the engineer, the members of the board, all occupy the same position of importance in relation to the smooth running of that organisation.</P>
    <P>It must have been clear to the Minister over the past few years that the ESB, in its very natural anxiety to secure a degree of competence which would be very desirable as an achievement, employed an arrogance which it was beyond human capacity to tolerate.  Therein lies the trouble, and the Minister knows it.  In all labour relations there must be method and there must be result, and the best result is never achieved by arrogance, however competent the exploiter of that arrogance might be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening told us they thought they would never be obliged to introduce legislation of this kind and that the Government did not regard it as desirable but, he said, &ldquo; a situation has arisen &rdquo;.  Then he went on with a beautiful piece of padding about the technical advancement in the western world that made us dependent upon electricity.  One would imagine that these were all discoveries of this afternoon.  There has been technical advancement.  I do not know whether he was claiming the advancement in electricity for the Fianna Fail Party.  He probably was.  They would claim anything that is good and hasten to disown anything that turns out to be bad.</P>
    <P>It is true that a situation has arisen, but this situation has been here for a long time.  I regret I must repeat what other speakers have said, that the Government would not have dared to bring in this piece of legislation this day fortnight.  They preferred to wait until full advantage could be taken of political expediency and, having done so, they come today with this Bill which we do not think is desirable either, but which we think is necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>Let me say this in passing.  While everybody has been shying away from the merits of this, it is true that two <Col N="166" /> Labour Deputies have given the figures of the earnings per week.  I do not think those earnings are adequate having regard to the cost of living and the times in which we live, that they are in any way reasonably commensurate with earnings being made by similarly qualified persons in other occupations outside the ESB.  The sooner this arrogance is abandoned in the ESB and the sooner they come to talk with these people the better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was for two and a half years in this particular stewpot until the Labour Court made that statement and is he now relying on that statement to get him out of the mess which he allowed to grow up. Neither my Party, nor I, nor anyone associated with us denies the fundamental right of the worker to a just reward for his labour, nor his fundamental right to sell his labour for the most he can get for it, nor his fundamental right to withdraw his labour if he cannot get what he thinks is adequate.  But the more fundamental a right is the more fundamental again is the duty of the person who enjoys that right.  In this age of technical advancement we cannot, no sensible person could allow, a situation to develop where we are so dependent on electricity for the hospital, the home, the farm and the factory, that power can be withdrawn from these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we are voting for this legislation.  We are doing so because we conceive it to be our duty.  We regret the necessity for doing it and we regret and condemn the Government for not doing it at a much earlier <Col N="167" /> stage.  The Taoiseach's speech this afternoon was one of the finest examples of tangents to date.  He was flying away from every conceivable real issue and giving vent to the usual phrases about labour relations and managements, with an occasional little hit at the employer.  He was talking of negative attitudes.  The Minister for Transport and Power said that the workers were never willing to come to the Government about these matters. They were never asked to do so.  The Taoiseach told us that when times are good employers and labour never come together.  They have never been asked to come together.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to a Minister for Labour.  We have a Parliamentary Secretary to somebody or other who is dealing with manpower and could he not devote himself to this matter? Perhaps the Taoiseach wants an opportunity to promote some Parliamentary Secretary.  In my view he should dismiss at least five of his Ministers although one of them was extremely useful to us within recent times.  The Taoiseach talked about the process of getting agreement and of having formal talks.  I do not believe that should be the real approach of Parliament or Government.  If a Government has a proposition to make here is the place to make it, here is the place to give the details of it and to have it discussed fully and freely.  Parliament has been by-passed on far too many occasions here in recent times.  It is the practice now to deal with matters like this in high-falutin' speeches made at dinners and similar occasions and even at poetry recitals.</P>
    <P>If I am speaking now in a state of indignation it is because I am indignant about the present state of affairs.  Even though I vote for this measure my sympathy is with the workers and the fitters.  Their wages are inadequate.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to Deputy Lindsay trying to cloud the issue.  It is not the conduct of the ESB that we are discussing here.  It is not the services of the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is the real issue which has arisen outside, an issue which has threatened to bring the economy of this country to a standstill.  The issue has not arisen between the fitters, one section of the employees of the ESB, and their employers, but between two sections of employees.  One section is striking in order that it may secure the same rate of remuneration as another. This is a civil war inside the ESB.  This is a feud between the artisans and the clerical workers and that is the issue that has brought this country almost to the brink of economic stagnation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy on the front bench opposite has avoided that issue.  He has avoided saying whether we can allow a civil war between two sections of employees to do untold damage to the economy of this country.  It is because such a feud threatened to do that that it has been necessary to bring in this Bill.  That is the reason and no other. So far as relations between the Board and its employees are concerned the Deputy should not forget that this issue of the proper remuneration of the fitters was referred to the arbitration board set up to deal with such matters. This threatened strike has arisen by reason of the fact that one body of the employees who went before the arbitration board has refused to accept the award.  This dispute has no bearing on the conduct of the Minister for Transport and Power or on the failure of the Government to do one thing or another but it is a deliberate act of defiance of one section of the ESB employees that has brought the nation to this grave state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question before the House is whether we can allow any section of the community, large or small, to do damage to the community as a whole. These people who are threatening to bring a close-down of the ESB are all <Col N="169" /> members of the community, are protected by the community, and reap the advantages conferred on them by this community.  It is they who are trying or have threatened to try to make it impossible for other members of the community to live.  That is the issue that has brought this House together.  That is the issue the Government must face up to.  It does not matter how much those who speak from the Labour Benches say they are speaking for the workers of this country.  They are not.  What the workers want, the vast majority of them at least, is that when they present themselves at their places of employment they will be allowed to enter in without being stopped by pickets, official or unofficial, and allowed to earn bread for themselves and their families.  They wish to see that every other member of the community is in the same position; and they look to the Government to ensure that persons who are engaged in essential operations in the employment of this monopoly will not be allowed to bring the economic life of the nation to a standstill.  That is the issue and I hope that whatever the cost to any member of this House may be, or whatever the cost to the community may be, the Government will fight this issue out to the end.</P>

He is entitled to something more than membership of the House.  No doubt we would all applaud the spectacle of Deputy Corry as Minister for Labour, even at this stage.  Reverting to Deputy MacEntee's intervention, which I would consider from the point of view of the Government a somewhat unfortunate intervention, it might have an impact similar to the impact upon the recent electoral event which we had and the result it showed in Deputy MacEntee's constituency.  It might have an impact comparable with that of the intervention from the Mayo Clinic.</P>
      <P>To get down to the Bill; there has been a great deal of talk about the seriousness of the situation which the country is in.  There has been no lack of people ready to attack this handful of men in the ESB, the fitters.  The ESB fitters apart from this dispute have equal rights with every other citizen and these rights should be preserved. We have yet to see them parading outside the Dáil bringing Parliament into contempt.  I hope we do not see them outside the Dáil but it would appear from the actions of this vacillating Government that that is the answer to many of the problems. It appears that is the way to get results and indeed to impose further hardships on the workingclass people in cities and towns for the benefit of those who are far better off.</P>

The Government have seized the opportunity, in a situation where there are pickets on only three out of 27 power stations, to bring in this piece of coercive legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the whole involved industrial position which we see now in front of us and with which nobody can be satisfied is due to the policy of this Government.  It dates back to the initiation on their part of the increase in the cost of living by the turnover tax.  That was the most inflationary and disastrous move any Government ever undertook in this country.  It provoked wage demands <Col N="174" /> left, right and centre, and its logical follow-through has been inflationary and there has been a continuing inflation ever since that tax was brought in.</P>
      <P>The merits of the claim of the workers have been very ably dealt with by other speakers and I will not concern myself overlong with the details of the merits of the claim but it is obvious that these workers, on the figures given, are underpaid when you look at their situation from the point of view of the cost of living and when you think of the fact that these are in the main men who have served seven years apprenticeship.  They are skilled craftsmen.  Others of them more recently recruited may have had to do only five years but the more settled of them have had to do seven years apprenticeship and their return at the end of all that is a wage rate at a level which nobody can honestly argue gives them a fair standard of living.</P>
      <P>They put forward their claim two and a half years ago.  Nobody could possibly suggest that they have been hasty in their action, that they have been irresponsible, that they rushed to the picket line at the first opportunity. To my mind, they have displayed a great deal of patience and a great deal of forbearance, particularly when dealing with the ESB, because one of the features of these semi-State bodies with which we have been forced to live, since their inception almost, has been what has been referred to as the arrogance of these puffed up gentlemen who are on semi-State bodies, arrogance supported by the Minister's attitude&mdash;the Minister for Power without responsibility.  Some people, as I have observed, will remember how that was defined.</P>
      <P>The situation, as I say, as of this moment, has been exaggerated in order to force through these powers, to frighten the population and to frighten the majority of the members of this House into voting for these compulsory powers which, in effect, amount to the deprivation of citizens of their right to withdraw their labour and, indeed, their right to seek to improve the return which they get for their labour.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes no mention of gaol.  I mentioned Mountjoy.  I suppose there is no mention of gaol because the Government do not want to offend the susceptibilities of former students of these centres. Although it is not mentioned <i>per se,</i> as the lawyers say, it is there.  There are provisions for very heavy fines for any worker who, mistakenly it would appear, may think he is entitled under the much shouted about Constitution to say to the ESB: &ldquo;I want more for what I am doing.  After all, the farmers have got more for what they are doing and I am paying them and I want more for what I am doing.&rdquo;  That is a reasonable proposition but he will be taken by the heels and will be brought before a court and can be fined £25.  He can be fined £5 for every day he continues to picket if he is on picket or fined for every day that he continues to be on strike.</P>

      <P>If he proceeds far enough with his effort to improve the way of life of himself and his family, he can be levied to the extent of £5,000. There is no mention of gaol, of course, but any of us who knows anything about life knows what happens when you do not pay debts.  The law is there. The debtor can be put into prison and behind this Bill is the threat of <Col N="176" /> Mountjoy.  It is government, in other words, by coercion in its most blatant form and the deprivation of the right of workers to bargain for better conditions and to employ the only methods open to them at the end of 2½ years whereby they can improve their conditions.</P>
      <P>I am very well aware of the fact that the Labour Party's stand in this is not one that would win popularity polls and every one of us is also aware that every effort will be made by the supporters of this Bill to misrepresent the position of the Labour Party.  All my constituents and my supporters suffered to the same degree as the supporters of every other Deputy by the stoppage of electricity supplies.  In this matter, however, something arises for the Labour Party and for me personally which can only be described by one word, a word which has been debased and degraded by constant reiteration and misuse and that word is &ldquo;principle&rdquo;.  It is a matter of principle for us no matter what the consequences may be and the principle is that we, as members of the Party founded by Larkin and Connolly, believe that the workers have a right to bargain with their employers for an improvement in their wages and conditions and to pursue their claim within the existing law by means of peaceful picketing or otherwise, and they have a right to enlist the support of their fellow-workers in their plight if their fellow-workers are willing to accompany them along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the principle that was enshrined in the great struggle of 1913. The speeches made in favour of this Bill could have been and no doubt were made practically word for word by those who sat on the Committee of 400 masters who tried to starve out the people of this city in 1913.  It was said that these people were combining to destroy the business fabric of the city and that if these people were not put down, if this perfidious combination of Larkinism was not put down, the result would be disaster and ruin&mdash; in the very same way as these words have been used here to-day.  As I say, this is a matter of principle for us, <Col N="177" /> no matter what the outcome may be. The Minister sought to convey that there was no wage freezing inherent in this Bill but if he looks at section (3) he will see that it provides that when an Order of the Minister is made, the remuneration and conditions of employment of ESB employees are to be at a standstill at the level obtaining before the Order was made.  Is that not wage freezing?</P>

      <P>It is not a bit awkward.  It seems to me that this legislation at this time is foolish, imprudent, and dangerous.  I can understand and forgive certain members of the Fianna Fáil Government for not being particularly sensitive to or even aware of the normal reactions of Irish people to coercion, or to coercive measures or repressive legislation, but <Col N="178" /> I cannot understand the tolerance of the majority of the members of the Government Party, or indeed of the Fine Gael Party, who after all like myself are of this nation and who should be quite capable of reacting instinctively, as the people will, against coercive legislation, but who troop in to try to justify this action on the part of the Government.  I can understand the Minister for Transport and Power because from the first moment that he assumed office he seems to have been at pains to demonstrate that not alone had he no sympathy with the aspirations of the workers under his control but no knowledge of how their minds worked or what their desires were.  The whole sad story of his administration has been one of continual blunders.  I dislike making personal attacks or what might be deemed to be personal attacks and I hope this will not be miscontrued as one but I do think that the Minister for Transport and Power seldom made a speech in which he did not put his foot in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows how far the Minister is getting from the people.  This Bill does not just relate to the ESB fitters; it can be applied to all ESB workers whether they are skilled craftsmen, labourers, clerical workers, cleaners, messengers or what have you, all who are part of the complex organisation known as the ESB.  I hope every one of them realises that this is not just aimed at the fitters, that he realises that this means that <Col N="179" /> if this Bill becomes an Act, Parliament will have accepted as a principle that the Government have a right to interfere to this extent with the liberty of the individual.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party deplore the consequences of strikes of this nature because our own people are the first in the front line, as it were, to suffer.  But there is here the question of the liberty of the individual.  Now the individual may be thought to be of no account by those who possess undemocratic and authoritarian minds. They are not wanting in the Cabinet of the present Government.  But the liberty of the individual is dear to those of us who believe in the democratic process.  We in the Labour Party always uphold here the liberty of the individual on every occasion on which it is under attack.  It is under attack now.  An attempt is being made to sabotage it.  Listening to and watching the proceedings here today, it seemed to me this whole business is being conducted in a very light-hearted manner. There has been a kind of forced gaiety, the kind of gaiety one might have found in the Fuehrer's Bunker before the collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility appreciates that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. This action by the Government has in it certain irrationalities which will not stand up to close examination.  I believe there will be acceptance generally that this Bill, far from resolving the crisis or solving the problem, may very well make it worse.  It may very well be that this act on the part of the Government will precipitate a situation worse than any we have known heretofore.  I hope that will not happen, but the Government's cavalier disregard of that possibility is very dangerous. There was every evidence, there was every hope today that this dispute would reach solution.  Both sides have come together under the chairmanship of an official of the Labour Court.  The ordinary processes of discussion have been under way.  It could very well be that the issue might be resolved. Surely the Government remember <Col N="180" /> what happened on the last occasion on which they indulged in this kind of antic.  When they introduced a Bill similar to this one five years ago, they succeeded in doing one thing: they united the workers, particularly those in the ESB, against the management of the ESB in a manner that had never been achieved before.  Although the strike was unofficial, collections were made at the end of the week in which the legislation to which I have referred was being discussed, and the workers still in employment contributed thousands to maintain these men under threat from the Government. That is the reaction the Government will get now.</P>

      <P>I am sure my learned colleague is concerned as I am about all this.  He is far away from here tonight; it saddens my heart that he is.  Not that he would do much about it, but he might do a little.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly now to one of the issues involved as between the ESB and the fitters.  Deputy MacEntee referred to a civil war.  That is how he describes the action of the fitters in seeking parity paywise with the clerical workers.  Earlier this year we had the Report of the NIEC.  That Report referred to an incomes policy and the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions referred to the need for an incomes policy.  So, indeed, did the Taoiseach.  It gave a certain spurious soundness almost to all the trash and baloney and codology talked about the so-called Second Programme.  Up to the Presidential election we had people talking about this Second Programme as if it were something really serious instead of just a mere piece of imaginative writing by some civil servants, with all due respect to them.  That is all it is.  It has no basis in reality.  That has been clearly shown by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the question of an incomes policy was underlined in parts of that Report.  I should think that those who were responsible for injecting the idea into that Report of the NIEC were the trade union representatives on <Col N="181" /> that body.  Everyone agrees we need a realistic incomes policy, a policy of wages and salaries related as nearly as possible to productivity and to the value of the citizen in the community, to his work as a productive unit or as one giving service.  One could, perhaps, offer an opinion as to the relative value of a skilled craftsman, such as an ESB fitter, who has served seven years to learn his difficult and sometimes dangerous trade, and the value of a clerical worker who may not have had to serve any time to learn his particular task and who may, in fact, have enjoyed a high salary at a much earlier age than the craftsman does.  That is something with which an incomes policy would have to deal.  Yet, Deputy MacEntee describes this problem as something in the nature of a civil war.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that description.  I do not believe there is anything even slightly resembling a civil war between the white collar workers and the manual workers in the ESB.  There is, perhaps, in the minds of the manual workers the reasonable thought that they should be adequately recompensed for their services, but I am certain none begrudges the other ESB workers what they are getting.  They may put forward the argument that they feel entitled to as much as the clerical workers are getting.  What is wrong in that?  If they can argue that, and establish it, I do not see that there is very much wrong in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>In 1961 a commission was set up to consider this question of the relative positions of groups of workers.  This commission recommended there should be one tribunal to deal with wages and conditions of <Col N="182" /> both manual and clerical workers. That was four and a half years ago. This commission was set up by the Government.  Nothing has been done. Had the respective Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power been doing their respective jobs, something would have been done and it might very well be, had they done their jobs, that what we are discussing now would never have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day, I gave notice of my intention to raise the subject matter of Question No. 21, standing in my name.  It concerns a matter affecting some 400 or 500 families who live on the Maryfield Estate, Coolock, North Dublin.  This House, the Minister and his Department should long ago have taken steps to protect the interests of those families in the context in which I speak.</P>
      <P>A group of developers, known as the Gallagher group, should not be allowed to contravene planning legislation and to avoid their admitted responsibilities as developers.  Repeated applications for sanction for development, and appeals, should not be tolerated in respect of an area already earmarked by Dublin Corporation for playing fields and for public recreation purposes.  In their efforts to obtain sanction for development of the land in question, this group are acting purely out of consideration for their own profit.  Their action can only prejudice some ordered and reasoned development in housing estates and, if successful, would deprive the children of some 400 or 500 families of the amenities in the Maryfield Estate in North Dublin to which they are fully entitled.  To deprive these children of playing fields in that area could have serious consequences.  The nearest suitable large space for recreation is at Coolock-Harmonstown which is across the Malahide Road and near a dangerous roundabout at which a child was killed some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> This is a situation in which a group who are interested purely in their own profit are neglectful of their manifest duty to the people living on the Maryfield Estate.  I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will examine the situation in the light of the fact that the people on this estate have provided themselves with their own homes in which to rear their families.  Hardly a month goes by that some spokesman of the Government or of a local authority or even a Deputy does not praise the prudence of these families who, since 1954, have gradually been occupying houses on the estate in question, paying their rates and their taxes and bringing up their families but, all during that period, the commitment of the developers to clear the site and provide proper recreational facilities in this area has not merely not been carried out but repeated appeals have been made by them in an effort to avoid leaving the playing space there.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1955, an appeal was submitted to the then Minister against the decision of the local authority requiring the developer to leave the space, to fence it and dedicate it to the residents in the area.  That appeal was dismissed by the Minister of the day.  I understand that the developer has suggested that the open space has been used as a dump.  In fact, the developer ploughed up fields that could have been used, at least in a primitive way, for recreation purposes.  Not satisfied with casting that reflection on the citizens of the area, the developer has sought sanction for the erection of a further 30 dwellings on this land which would further enhance his financial position without regard to the obligation on him to leave a playing space in accordance with the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>In September, 1965, some 11 months after his previous appeal was dismissed by the Minister, the developer again attempted to get past legislation.  Possibly the developer thinks that, as there is now a different Minister in the Department, his application might receive some further consideration.  In practically every case where a family on this estate entered <Col N="184" /> into a contract for a dwelling, they were assured by the developer that there would be ample space for recreation purposes.  They were shown a sketch plan which indicated that the north-east corner of the area was reserved for playing fields.  Consequently the house purchasers, conscious of the danger to their children if they were permitted to cross the Malahide Road to get to the nearest convenient playing space, understood they were getting an assurance that this space would be reserved for playing fields.</P>
    <P>We were told in the reply today that on 8th September, 1965, application was made to the Corporation to build 30 houses on the portion of the site designated as a playing field in the plans already approved.  A previous appeal by the developers against the conditions laid down by the local authority requiring them to develop this space as a playing field was dismissed by the Department of Local Government.  This is a peculiar Planning Act.  The developers can wait a few years, do nothing, avoid the obligations of the Planning Act and then submit a new application to build houses on a place that has been designated as playing fields.  We are aware the Minister has some judicial authority in these matters, but in ordinary consequences, it should be made clear to the developer that this kind of activity will not be countenanced.  Or is this Minister going to change his mind?  Is there some reason?</P>
    <P>So far the only comfort given by the Department is that the Corporation have refused permission to the builder to build houses in an area designated as a playing field.  An appeal by the developer against that was dismissed. Yet the developer comes along and makes another appeal in respect of the same plot of ground.  Again there is a refusal by the local authority.  That shows that at least in this instance they have some regard for their responsibility to the families in this area.  The appeal comes again to the Minister. The only cold comfort he has for the residents' association is that it will be open to both parties to be represented <Col N="185" /> at an oral hearing in the near future. The Minister has a responsibility to give something more than that reply. All these families are taxpayers and ratepayers.  They are trying to educate their children to be decent citizens. Surely they are entitled to more from the Minister than a reply that they can be represented at an oral hearing?  The matter should have been disposed of ten years ago.</P>
    <P>We are told a number of objections have been lodged.  That is certainly true.  Out of 400 families here, at least 320 have written personally to the Minister appealing for his help and protection.  But the public at large should be aware of this attempt being made by the developer.  It is not the first time developers in the city have failed to live up to their obligations. Some of them act as if they are doing the community a service.  They are getting very well paid for it.  If they buy the land and lease it, they get the ground rent.  If they develop it and build houses, they get the profits from the building.  In addition, in most cases the houses are built with assistance from public funds.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that something more than the assurances and information given today should be forthcoming from his Department.  I shall conclude now because I promised Deputy Byrne a few minutes.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to Deputy Larkin.  In the few minutes remaining I had better be quite brutal and forthright in what I have to say. We know who the developer is.  His name has been mentioned here&mdash;the Gallagher group.  We want no dirty work at the crossroads in North-East Dublin in this matter.  We have had one or two questionable and &ldquo;dicey&rdquo; planning decisions by the Minister for Local Government in areas adjacent to Maryfield some years ago.  We do not want them repeated.  There is a solemn obligation in justice to these people, who were promised in glossy brochures when they bought these houses that they would be located in a garden estate with playing fields and playgrounds.  An exactly similar undertaking was given in a nearby area and <Col N="186" /> the Minister connived at the breach of that undertaking.  We do not want that repeated.  If it is repeated, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I would ask him to pass it on to his Minister&mdash;this is a marginal constituency and we will see to it, Deputy Larkin, Deputy Belton and myself, that two Fianna Fáil Ministers will pay for it at the next election.  That is as much as I have to say.  We want no dirty work at the crossroads from Minister Blaney.</P>

      <P>I suppose if Deputy Byrne thought he could succeed in making one or two Ministers pay for it, that is the way he would like it. We gave a very full reply today to the question put down by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Byrne, particularly in view of the fact that this estate or part of it is the subject of appeal before the Department at the moment.  Why is it on appeal?  It is on appeal because Dublin Corporation, of which Deputy Larkin is a member, failed to do their job for ten years.  Particularly since 1963, when the Planning and Development Act came in, Deputy Larkin, who was not alone a member of the Corporation but Chairman of the Housing Committee, did not insist that the conditions laid down in granting planning approval were carried out.  Therefore, there is no use in trying to blame the Minister for Local Government.  It is Dublin Corporation and Deputy Larkin who have failed in their job. If he had insisted on the conditions being carried out, there would be no question of any group being able to make an application to the Corporation for the building of houses.</P>

As far as the Department of Local Government is concerned, there were no complaints, and I understand as far as the Corporation are concerned, there were no complaints from the residents in this area until the matter came to the notice of the Department last week. That does not get away from the fact that the responsibility for this position rests entirely with the Corporation who failed to exercise the power they had under section 31 of the Act.</P>
