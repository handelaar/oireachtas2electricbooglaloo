      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make available to historians documents, now in State custody, relating to the 1916 Rising for the purpose of setting down a clear historical record of the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>A number of Government offices hold records relating to the Rising of 1916.  In the State Paper Office and in the collection made by the Military History Bureau, there is a relatively large body of such records.  It is likely, however, that, for the historian, there are more important collections in British Government offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that the British collections are not scheduled for release for a considerable time.  The question of the control of the records of Government Departments generally is at present under consideration and it may be that this consideration will result in proposals for legislation.  The collection made by the Military History Bureau is still covered by the rules of <Col N="480" /> confidentiality under which the material was contributed.</P>
    <P>The records in the State Paper Office include correspondence between individuals and Government offices as well as police reports and official minutes which passed between Government servants. Much of the material deals with persons still alive or with those whose immediate relatives are alive. The restrictions imposed on access to those papers were designed in the public interest and, in my opinion, they continue to serve the public interest.  I should emphasise that my view on this is not related particularly to the State Papers for 1916 but is applicable to all State Papers of less than 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>The State Papers are arranged and classified and I can assure historians that my Department will continue to offer to supply, where possible, information by way of answers to specific questions about the 1916 Rising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that certain of the State papers might be made available to historians, and other people interested, for inspection purposes without any danger of the kind to which the Taoiseach adverted in his reply?  I refer to the type of papers which deal with the general situation in a generalised way and in which there would be no specific reference to individuals.  Surely papers of that kind might be made available?  Further, does the Taoiseach not consider that the process he suggests of asking specific questions is liable to result in considerable delay in getting the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Limited access, subject to conditions, to <i>bona fide</i> historians to some of these papers could be considered, but nothing beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While substantially agreeing with the Taoiseach's view as to the general treatment of the State papers referred to, I should like to ask the Taoiseach has he considered the desirability of directing that these papers should be microfilmed and stored in the National Library, or in some other place of safety, lest <Col N="481" /> any catastrophe should destroy the originals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The papers I am talking about are kept in the State Record Office and the question relates to the possibility of releasing them from that office.  The papers are there; they are classified; they are now being indexed.  I am sure precaution is taken to ensure their safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider <i>ad interim</i> that these papers should be microfilmed so that they will be available for the future should any fire catastrophe destroy them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that office in the Castle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are a number of records in other Government Departments.  There are also records in the Bureau of Military History.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say how historians are defined for the regulations?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the deficit in the balance of payments, (b) the gross national product, and (c) the balance of payments deficit expressed as a percentage of the gross national product in each year from 1948 to 1965 inclusive.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy for each year 1948 to 1964. Corresponding data for 1965 are not yet available.  It is expected, however, that the external deficit on current account in 1965 was about £45 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs why the film <i>Ireland</i> produced by Vincent Corcoran was not secured by his Department for showing abroad; whether his Department had any contact with Mr. Corcoran on the production of a general film on Ireland; and, if so, if he will indicate whether any difficulties arose and the nature of those difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in 1961 my Department opened negotiations with Mr. Vincent Corcoran and Mr. Joseph Mendoza for the making of a film depicting economic progress in Ireland.  In 1963 their partnership dissolved and the project had to be abandoned.  Mr. Corcoran later secured another partner and submitted a treatment on the same theme which was not acceptable to the Interdepartmental Committee on Publicity Abroad.  I accepted the Committee's recommendation not to proceed with the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representatives of my Department have seen an unedited version of the film to which the Deputy refers and I am satisfied that, for a variety of reasons, it would not be possible for my Department to obtain such commercial distribution abroad for this <Col N="491" /> film, or even for a shorter version of it, as would justify the considerable cost involved in its purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that it was the nature of the script proposed for this film to which the Minister's Department had objection? Would it be true to say that where Mr. Corcoran wanted to have, say, the script depicting a national school, the Minister's Department would have preferred a secondary school, that because the script was such that it did not give a Cassius Clay picture of modern Ireland, the Minister's Department did not consider it suitable for projection abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department did not ask for this film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is considered on of the best films to come from Ireland in recent times and would probably gain a larger circulation abroad than any film sponsored by the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to stop the film being sponsored by a private individual who wants to undertake it. It is not our film.  We did not order it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a great pity that £18,000 has been spent on two films, the Yeats film and the Lee Valley film, neither of which will gain anything like general circulation?  Although this film is considered generally to be up to the standard of gaining general circulation, the Minister's Department has not got the sponsoring rights of it.</P>

I am glad, however, to be able to point out for the Deputy's information that the published trade statistics show that while the import excess for the six months period January-June 1965, was £26.5 million, trade in the subsequent four months period July-October, 1965, was practically in balance. Available evidence indicates that this favourable trend has been maintained in the period since October, 1965.  It will, of course, be assisted by the new trading opportunities which will be opened to us when the Free Trade <Col N="496" /> Area Agreement with Britain comes into operation on 1st July next.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's question on 5th May last, it was intended to invite tenders shortly after that with a view to starting works during the summer of 1965.  About that time experience in the construction of the breakwater for the Major Fishery Harbour at Dunmore East made it clear that procuring of rock to the required size at Kilmore would be difficult, if not impossible, and in any event would be much more costly than had been allowed for in the estimate.  The estimate was, therefore, reviewed in the light of this experience and of recent developments in breakwater design.  A substantial increase in the estimate resulted.  Unfortunately, as this coincided with the general financial stringency, consideration of the scheme has had to be deferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  Normally, a plot of one quarter of an acre will give sufficient room for siting a septic tank in accordance with the distance requirements.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 46, 47, and 48 together.</P>
      <P>One-half of disability benefit has always been assessed as means for special allowances purposes, and consequently an increase in disability benefit has always involved an adjustment of a special allowance where the recipient is also in receipt of disability benefit.  In all such cases, however, the overall income from public funds is increased, seeing that only one-half of the increase in disability benefit is assessed.  I do not propose to change the system.</P>
      <P>The number of special allowances being paid on 31st December, 1965, was 8,546.  On the basis of figures extracted when the position was last examined in August, 1965, it may be assumed that about ten per cent of the recipients were also in receipt of disability benefit and so qualified for the increase in that benefit which became effective as from 3rd January, 1966.</P>

      <P>Police certificates of character are given to meet specific requirements of the authorities of certain foreign Governments who have made it very clear that their enquiry covers any conviction for an indictable offence, no matter how long ago.  In these circumstances, the only choice the police have is to give a correct certificate which lists the convictions or to decline to give any certificate&mdash;in which case the foreign authorities concerned draw their own conclusions.  I should emphasise that the certificate is sent to the person himself and that it is up to him to decide whether or not to produce it.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the certificate was not issued to the authorities of a foreign country but to the man himself and was issued on the standard form.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a publication on the health services in Ireland regarding eligibility for general medical services; if he is aware that an insured person on disability benefit who makes application for a medical card before admission to hospital is admitted to the benefits <Col N="523" /> of the general medical service, while an applicant in similar circumstances who is hospitalised for a similar period and who makes application for benefit on admission to hospital on the ISA form is charged 10/- per day; and if he will advise the managers of health authorities to make application forms for the general medical service readily available to hospitals and institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a patient's circumstances as to means are such as to qualify him for free hospital treatment he should get that treatment free whether he already has a medical card or not.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is technically wrong in suggesting that insured workers who need hospital treatment should apply for a medical card.  A medical card indicates that the holder's name is included in the register of persons who are entitled to avail themselves of the general practitioner service.  Claimants for hospital services under the Act must complete an ISA form and this applies to medical card holders as well as to those in the middle income group. Where the patient holds a medical card no investigation as to means is necessary as this has already been done.  In the case of other applicants the position as to means is investigated and the rate of charge determined.  This may be nothing or a rate not exceeding 10/- per day for an insured person.</P>
      <P>A person may, of course, apply at any time for a medical card but to apply for such a card in addition to completing the ISA form on admission to hospital should not influence the decision as to whether the patient's hospital treatment should be free or at some rate of charge up to 10/- per day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide statutory authority for the payment of grants in respect of net receipts from licence fees to the Broadcasting Authority during the five years ending 31st March, 1970.  Section 22 of the Act of 1960 authorised the payment of such grants for the five years ending 31st March, 1965 and the Vote <Col N="532" /> for my Department for 1965-66 makes provision for a grant which was calculated on the assumption that the Oireachtas would wish that the Authority should continue to receive the full net proceeds of broadcasting licence revenue for a further period.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the 1960 Act also provided for the payment of subsidies not exceeding £500,000 in all during the first five years of the Authority's existence. This Bill makes no provision for the payment of a subsidy.</P>
    <P>The present opportunity is being availed of to propose some minor amendments which experience has shown to be desirable.</P>
    <P>Probably the most noteworthy change is that concerning the name of the Authority.  &ldquo;Radio Telefís Éireann&rdquo;, has been recommended by the Authority on the grounds that a good deal of public confusion exists between &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Telefís Éireann&rdquo;, and that the new title is more appropriate to a body which caters for both sound broadcasting (Radio Éireann) and television broadcasting (Telefís Éireann).</P>
    <P>Under section 12 of the Principal Act, officers of the Authority must as a general rule, be selected by means of public competition but exceptionally an officer may be promoted within <Col N="533" /> the organisation.  It is now proposed to make a further exception which will permit the Authority to promote a servant to be an officer.  As the Authority's servants are not selected by open competition, promotion of servants to officer positions will be by limited competition.  This is in line with the practice in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill proposes three minor changes in the functions of the Authority.  The first two remove a certain amount of overlapping between paragraphs (h) and (k) of subsection (2) of section 16 of the Principal Act and clarify the Authority's position in regard to its business dealings with other broadcasting organisations.  The third specifically authorises the Authority, subject to the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to act as agent for a Government Department, as it does at present for the Department of Education in regard to Telefís Scoile.</P>
    <P>Section 6 proposes that the Authority's annual accounts shall be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They have in practice always been audited by the C. &amp; A.G. although under section 25 of the Act of 1960 a commercial auditor could have been appointed.  In view of the heavy existing and potential investment of State funds in the Authority it is considered that the C. &amp; A.G. should continue to audit the accounts and that this arrangement should be specifically provided for by statute.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to comment on the other provisions of the Bill, which are of a routine or noncontroversial nature.</P>
    <P>The fact that so few changes are considered necessary in the Principal Act, after more than five years' experience, is a tribute to my predecessor and to all who took part in drafting that Act.  There has, of course, already been one amendment of it.  Deputies will remember that the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1964, raised the limit of £2 million in section 23 for Exchequer Advances for capital purposes to £3 million.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has discussed the Authority's affairs on several occasions <Col N="534" /> during the past few years, and copies of its five annual reports and statements of accounts have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas under sections 25 and 26 of the Principal Act.  In the circumstances and as the primary purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of grants, I shall confine my remaining remarks to financial matters.</P>
    <P>During the debates on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959 serious doubts were expressed about the possibility of providing a worth-while television service in this country without cost to the taxpayer.  My predecessor was confident, however, that revenue from licence receipts and advertising fees should enable the Authority to provide a service which would pay its way after an initial period which he estimated as about three years.  However, the television service has been a financial success practically from the beginning.  The first television transmissions from Kippure took place on 31st December 1961 and 1962-63 was therefore the first full year of operation.  The deficit on television for that year was a mere £17,000.  This was converted to a surplus of £259,000 in 1963-64, and in 1964-65 the surplus had grown to £539,000.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that the Act of 1960 authorised payment of subsidies not exceeding £500,000 in all during the five years ended 31st March, 1965. These were intended to meet expected deficits on sound broadcasting during the early years of the Authority's existence.  The full amount authorised was exhausted during 1963-64.  Since then the Authority has had to manage without a subsidy.  In 1964-65 the deficit on sound broadcasting was £166,000.  When this deficit is set against the surplus of £539,000 on television there was an overall surplus of £373,000 on both services combined in that year.  It will be seen from the Authority's report for 1964-65 that, because of increasing costs and stabilisation of receipts from licence fees and advertising revenue, it expects less favourable financial results in future.</P>
    <P>The recent substantial surpluses on the television service have assisted the <Col N="535" /> Authority to finance much of its capital expenditure during the past few years from its own resources.  In fact it has not sought any advance from the Exchequer since February, 1964. At present its total indebtedness to the State amounts to £2,065,000, made up of £249,000 in respect of property, et cetera, transferred to the Authority on the establishment day, under section 32 of the Principal Act, and £1,816,000 in respect of repayable Exchequer Advances.  No part of the extra sum authorised in the Act of 1964 for capital purposes has yet been utilised and £184,000 of the amount provided in the Principal Act is still available.  The Authority has incurred, or is already committed to capital expenditure of the order of £3½ million. It envisages that over the years immediately ahead further expenditure of about £2 million will be necessary, including provision for development of the Donnybrook site to cater for sound broadcasting which is still housed in the GPO.  Some increase in the present limit of £3 million for repayable Exchequer Advances may be necessary within the next few years but it is considered that the Authority will have reasonably adequate capital for the time being from its own resources and the £1,184,000 still available under the Acts of 1960 and 1964. The Authority is obliged by section 24 of the Principal Act so to conduct its affairs as to secure that at the earliest possible date its revenue becomes sufficient, not merely to meet current expenses, but also to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it will be clear that the Authority is not yet in a position to commence repaying its indebtedness to the State.  It is, of course, paying interest on its advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware that the Authority is engaged in providing a national VHF transmitter network.  I understand that the first of these transmitters will be going on the air about the end of April, that the others will follow as soon as they are ready and that it is hoped to have all the main transmitters working by next autumn. <Col N="536" /> The new transmitters will generally be welcomed because of the improvement they will effect in sound broadcasting coverage.  The VHF service will, however, result in a further increase in the deficit on sound broadcasting, a deficit which will have to be made good out of the Authority's general revenue.</P>
    <P>Last February the Authority submitted a comprehensive memorandum setting forth its recommendations for other improvements in the radio service.  It was particularly anxious to introduce day long broadcasting as soon as possible.  The proposals would have involved a substantial increase in the sound licence fee.  I could not support such an increase, particularly in view of the Government's price stabilisation policy.  It seemed to me that no new commitments should be taken on which would involve a worsening of the financial position of the radio service and I therefore informed the Authority in July last that I proposed to defer further consideration of the proposals until the present economic difficulties are resolved.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that under this Bill the Authority will continue to have the maximum freedom regarding programmes and matters of day to day administration and that the power of intervention by the Minister or Government will continue to be confined to a small number of matters in which it is important that the public interest should be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the programmes on various grounds and from different quarters but this is only to be expected, and is indeed the experience of broadcasting organisations all over the world.  It is impossible to please everybody all of the time but, on the whole, I think Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann have given general satisfaction.  I believe the Authority is to be congratulated on its achievements since it was established and I, therefore, confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last note in the Minister's opening statement, namely, that the television and radio authorities are to be congratulated on <Col N="537" /> their work in the past few years, we, on this side of the House, agree with that sentiment in connection with these two forms of public instruction, entertainment and education.</P>
      <P>There is not much in the Bill beyond the giving of legal authority to continue, financially, and so on, for the next five years.  Section 5 is exactly similar to the Principal Act.  The word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; would seem to have some legal significance but otherwise it seems that it is exactly the same as the 1960 Act.  In the same section, we read &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;: perhaps, in his reply, the Minister would clarify those two points.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity to talk of broadcasting and television in the past five years and of the way in which these two services have worked generally. Nowadays, Telefís Éireann is the more important service inasmuch as it is the service most people use.  It must not be forgotten that Radio Éireann nevertheless does a tremendous amount of work.  I do not suppose it has the listening public it had before television came but it is still listened to by many people and, considering the limited amount of money available, its programmes are very good&mdash;and I think that is also true of Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to talk today at any great length or to go into the merits or demerits of individual programmes. I shall leave that to other Deputies, but I would like to discuss the matter broadly from certain points of view.  It would be of great benefit to our people here if we could extend television to include television to schools.  I am not sure just to what extent we could do that at the present moment but it would be a very good thing if we would make a real feature of that in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more local and, what I would call, native humour and entertainment, as against imported comics.  I know people like to be entertained in a light fashion but I do think many of these comics are really hardly worth while looking at.  They are not offensive but I do not think they are at all worthwhile and I would ask the <Col N="538" /> television authorities if they could&mdash;for heaven's sake&mdash;to cut out the canned applause.  That is the most appalling part of these things.  When somebody makes some corny joke which, to our ears, is perhaps only a form of ham humour, we find that the invisible studio audience becomes convulsed with laughter at this very often ridiculous joke&mdash;which is quite out-of-keeping. Apparently in the studios when these comics are being prepared, a man, who is like a leader, stands up and conducts the applause&mdash;somewhat as the conductor conducts an orchestra.  It would be better if that terrible applause could, in the main, be rubbed out.  However, that is only one side of it.  If we could have more and more substitute programmes of local interest to our own people instead of those I have just mentioned, it would be very good.  It would also give more employment to our own people.</P>
    <P>I saw a very good programme recently&mdash;to single out one of the many good serious programmes&mdash;on the inter-relation of geography and Irish history.  It was very well produced, very well documented, and I am looking forward to others in the same series.</P>
    <P>We also have our political commentators and commentaries and it is only fair to say that, on the whole, the political broadcasts are fair.  I do not hold with people who sometimes think it is unduly weighted one way or the other.  Over a period, it is quite obvious that the Authority is trying to give a fair show to all political Parties.  Sometimes, of course, one thinks the opposite but one must judge it over a period.  The political commentators are very good and the men who meet and discuss what we have done and said in the House are fair-minded in giving the public a résumé of the work here.  In that connection&mdash; this is rather difficult for me to put&mdash; we have to be careful that when people speak about Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, it is fairly indicated that what they say is a private opinion because to many people, a man speaking into a microphone and giving what is a private opinion can appear to be almost the voice of the whole Authority&mdash;like the news.  The public sometimes tend to accept these private <Col N="539" /> opinions as being as factual as the news itself.  That is something we must always be careful about; but there is no danger in that respect now.</P>
    <P>Commercials, we know, are necessary to help pay for television and are not primarily a money-raising undertaking. By that, I mean that the commercials are not the most important part of what we look at&mdash;God forbid that they should be, but, mind you, they are not bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are often better than the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  They can be very clever but we sometimes get too much of them.  I have counted the number of commercials between, say, 7.30 and 10.30 p.m. I have not got the figures with me but they break in on the programme a good many times.  I have noticed that in other Parliaments, which shall be nameless, a very keen eye is kept on the time devoted to entertainment, instruction and so on and to commercials. We should be very careful that we do not overload our service with commercials.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning, I would like to see more local, serious discussions on day-to-day affairs.  When Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann tackle these matters, they handle them extremely well.  We can be very proud of the people who come before the cameras and microphones on both Telefís and Radio Éireann.  We certainly have no lack of first-class material, people who can give us good programmes and who can interest us greatly.  I should like to see more of these features and fewer imported items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention also the question of music.  This is something which is very dear to my heart, as I think it is to an enormous number of our people who are very fond of music.  I should like to see more of the Radio Éireann Orchestra on television. One hears it on Radio Éireann. I personally very seldom see it on Telefís Éireann.  Viewers would welcome very many more programmes by the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and the Light Orchestra.  There <Col N="540" /> should be more of these programmes accompanied by explanatory talks on the music being performed.  It should not be too difficult to implement that idea and it should not be very expensive, although I suppose the cost of special programmes by the orchestra is not insubstantial.  Such programmes would be good for our young people. Judging by the audiences who pay money to hear the Radio Éireann Orchestra, there is an enormous number of people who are very anxious to hear classical music, in which I include romantic music, and so on.  The Sunday night Prom Concerts in the Gaiety Theatre given by the Radio Éireann Orchestra are very well attended.  On most occasions the orchestra play to capacity houses, which shows the interest taken in first-class music.  I do not know how often the orchestra appears on Telefís Éireann.  Anybody in public life has to spend a great deal of time away from home and therefore does not have an opportunity to watch television.  There may be occasions when I missed the orchestra.  I do think we could do with more and more of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word on the quality of reception.  Reception is good, but, both from the point of view of sound broadcasting and television, the Authority should be more vigilant in preventing electrical interference. Having regard to the expense of radio and television licences, the public have a right to expect that the Authority will ensure that they are protected against persons who will not suppress electrical apparatus properly.  I know money is spent on this work but people should be encouraged to screen electrical apparatus properly.  I suggest that admonitions might be broadcast as to the need for vigilance in this respect.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann are to be congratulated on what they do.  We have not the money to mount the big programmes that other larger countries broadcast but in many cases we can put on very good programmes which are either very amusing or very instructive and entertaining. We have every reason to be proud of our announcers and our actors and actresses who take part in <Col N="541" /> sound and television programmes nightly.  Having regard to the tiny population on which we have to draw and the limited sums of money at the disposal of the Authority, these people do a very good job.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement does not have a black border.  I should have thought it would have. It is some weeks now since Mossie Walker was laid to rest and I should have thought it appropriate that he should have been commemorated in some way.</P>
      <P>I suppose the main thing we can say of this report is that it appears that financially the Authority is doing pretty well.  At least, it seems to be breaking even.  As far as my interest goes in the actual financial details of this report, I am happy to say that this is the case.  I recall some of the fears expressed at the start of the service that we might be taking on a luxury frill too soon, before many other priorities were met.  The Authority in its work over the last few years and in the financial statement before us has proved that this fear need not be harboured much longer.  It appears that financially the Authority is not doing too badly, although I would have thought that part of the satisfactory state of the finances is due to the death of Mossie Walker.</P>
      <P>It is generally desirable that there should be more home-produced programmes on Telefís Éireann but the answer can be given that having regard to the small staff and the size of the station, it is true to say that relatively more home-produced programmes are broadcast by Telefís Éireann than by other stations of similar size in other countries but we should still ask for more because the very best programmes on Telefís Éireann are those that are home produced.</P>

      <P>If we talk about having too many commercials, I suppose that is one of the reasons for the good financial statement before us, but, if we must have commercials, it is a great pity that we cannot have Irish commercials; it is a great pity that an <Col N="542" /> English accent should tell us to take this or that pill or to look around this bend or that bend.  There are firms in this country at the moment that specialise in producing that type of film and I would suggest that these film studios should be sought out for use by Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>We should see to it that far more youth are involved in programmes. One of the most interesting programmes on Telefís Éireann is &ldquo;Teen Talk&rdquo; where some of us who are getting on in years get some idea about the kind of ferment in thinking that is going on amongst teenagers in our country today.  Certainly, we should do our best to involve young people generally in discussion programmes on Telefís Éireann.  I do not think the result necessarily must be a kind of dead solemn result.  &ldquo;Teen Talk&rdquo; is there to show that teenage discussion can be extremely interesting and exciting.</P>
      <P>There is an excellent drama department attached to the station.  They are doing an excellent job.  Some of the producers are internationally known.  It remains a wonder to me how these producers remain in Telefís Éireann when, I am sure, their talents would earn them much more in cash elsewhere.  I presume that patriotism is not dead yet.</P>
      <P>In the treatment of politics, much more could be done from the point of view of really bringing politics home to the people and demonstrating what politics actually means.  That is what the people who are involved in this particular job are trying to do but they are not always successful.  It would be no harm, in my opinion, to bring politicians out from behind the facade of certainty and put them in the position of having to answer awkward questions, unscripted, unprepared, off-the-cuff questions.  I would be in favour of having television in this House. That would bring home to the people better than anything else the eloquence of empty seats.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Open House&rdquo; has not been in my constituency yet.  The <Col N="543" /> fact is that &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; does not succeed in bringing home political questions.  There is too much of the claque from the point of view of applause.  It seems almost to be organised.  The questions are trivial and no effort is made to get to the heart of the matter.  I would be in favour of asking politicians awkward questions, asking them to explain what their policy means in pounds, shillings and pence.  I should like to see them brought face to face with real problems.  My Party are not afraid of overexposure to the cameras, either those of Telefís Éireann or elsewhere. Indeed, we would welcome such exposure.  I believe the Authority is doing its best.  I should like to see more Irishmen taking over the top positions.  One is not in any way chauvinistic in saying that we all believe television should be staffed by Irishmen and programming and decisions should be the responsibility of Irishmen.  In view of its importance and its influence on attitudes, it is most desirable that these things should be in the hands of Irishmen.</P>
      <P>With regard to the language, there are some excellent programmes but I should like to see a more imaginative use made of Irish.  &ldquo;Amuigh faoin Spéir&rdquo; on Sunday evening is really magnificent.  There are many others. It would be invidious to choose between them.</P>
      <P>To sum up, I should like more exposure of politicians before the television cameras.  I should like to hear them asked awkward questions.  I should like to see them brought face to face with the issues of the day.  Those who produce these programmes do their best and it is the political Parties themselves who are to blame because of their near-nervous prostration at the prospect of television exposure.  I claim, on behalf of my own Party, that we want as much of it as possible.  I suppose that is only natural since there are only 22 of us.</P>

      <P>This is the usual measure which we have every year for the purpose of transferring the moneys <Col N="544" /> collected by way of licence to the Television and Radio Authority.  It is welcome inasmuch as it is proposed to go ahead with the VHF service. Good reception is of inestimable benefit. That will be possible with VHF. Home reception should equal the kind of reception we get from across the water.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to learn that it is proposed to extend the hours.  At the moment there is quite a gap and the inclination naturally is to tune in to some other station in order to fill that gap.  I am sure it will be possible to earn some extra revenue through advertising. More sponsored programmes would earn extra revenue.  Some of the factories are providing music for their workers.  The value of that was discovered in Britain during the war &mdash;hence &ldquo;Music While You Work&rdquo;.  I understand that that programme is being retired now.  But the value of music during working hours was recognised and I see no reason why we should not have a similar programme here.</P>
      <P>Telefís Éireann is providing an excellent service, with good programmes on a wide variety of subjects. Remembering the revenue earned by the big corporations across the water and the revenue earned by Telefís Éireann, the service is really commendable. Theirs is a tight budget in comparison with the corporations I mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable, of course, that there should be some criticism.  Here we have a higher standard, particularly from the point of view of advertising, than obtains elsewhere.  I remember, before our own service started, people telling me in my constituency that it would be a great thing when we had our own television service because they would be able to let the children watch every programme and there would be no need to censor programmes.</P>

      <P>The portrayal of young girls drinking beer and other alcoholic beverages is not desirable.  Drink should not be emphasised to the extent to which it is being emphasised. There is one foreign commodity which it is sought to put over as an Irish product; it is advertised in Irish although it is manufactured in Europe. Telefís Éireann should take a stand on that sort of thing and should ensure that advertisements are portrayed in a fair manner.</P>
      <P>It is rarely that I can see television but sometimes late at night I get an opportunity of seeing some of the programmes particularly those of the drama department.  At times the language used in the plays is rather strong.  Many of the personnel in this department have been trained in stations abroad where the standards would not be nearly as high as they are here.  This is a very powerful medium and even though most children would not be up late at night, there will always be some of them there and they will take in everything that appears on television.  Our playwrights can produce good material and there is no need for the use of strong or obscene language.  Producers can play an important part in seeing that certain standards are upheld, as was evident at the last minute in connection with last Saturday night's show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are my criticisms, but I believe that Telefís Éireann is giving an exceptionally good service.  There is a wide variety of programmes.  The home-produced programmes represent a percentage slightly higher than that of our neighbouring television programmes where they have greater facilities.  Naturally we welcome programmes from all over the world because that is a form of education. It is always interesting to see what is happening in Australia, how they are living there, how they are living in America and so on.  There are also the cowboy films which provide light entertainment. They do not do anybody any harm.  The good man always succeeds <Col N="546" /> and the bad fellow gets his deserts.</P>

It is amazing the number of people who will mention points that come up in these programmes, who will seek your opinion on something that is mentioned or will ask: &ldquo;When you were there what way did it sound?&rdquo; That type of programme was neglected in the thirties, forties and possibly in the fifties, but now there is a re-awakening and there is a demand for this reporting.  People are anxious to listen in to discussions and the opinions of different reporters as they see the activities of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>To sum up, may I say that Telefís Éireann should be more careful in the type of advertisements selected.  However, I should like to compliment them on the good work they are doing.  This Bill will enable Telefís Éireann to do the work we expect from them.</P>

      <P>God is good.  It is an end devoutly to be wished.  It struck me, at any rate, that Telefís Éireann are doing as good a job as is being done by any of the television stations within reach of this country.  In the matter of drama, with which I have a passing acquaintance, I, like most people, do not enjoy over-indulgence in language which some people use in an effort to buttress their so-called maleness, their masculinity, but there are certain levels of language, certain modes of language, which have become part of the vernacular of the people and which are not, in fact, regarded at all as lewd in the same sense as they were in Victorian days, and I incline to the view that Deputy Crinion has been pre-Edwardian in this.  On certain subjects I appreciated what he had to say, particularly about his care for children, but good children should be in bed when programmes of this kind are anticipated.</P>
      <P>There were no television programmes then, but I know I was in bed long before such times and I do not think it interferes in the slightest with my vocabulary: I absorbed just as much in my time around the streets. In this matter there is a great deal of unreality.  Some of the words are definitely objectionable.  None of us likes the inverted exhibitionism of Kenneth Tynan and his type.  Television dramatists must have regard to the facts of ordinary existence and if they are to produce something which is to have any relevance at all to life or is to have any integrity or truth, it is necessary at times for them to be forceful in the dialogue they use.  There is nothing wrong there.  Children should be out of the way and if it is too much for the adults, then all I can say is the adults must have led a very sheltered existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to payments to people who write for television.  There have been complaints about the standard of material appearing on Telefís <Col N="548" /> Éireann.  My view is that it is as good as is available elsewhere in these islands but the payments made by Telefís Éireann for the work done by television writers are of such a nature as to discourage any effort in that direction.  An effort to compose an hour-long television play requires considerable concentration and takes some considerable length of time if it is to be done properly.  The amount paid for such efforts by Telefís Éireann is a fraction of what is paid elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It has been said quite properly that we must cut our cloth according to our measure but I should like to feel an effort was being made to encourage young people to write for Telefís Éireann by giving them some kind of return for their labour.  At the moment, the return is niggardly in the extreme. It is no wonder we find so many excellent writers making for the boat as quickly as they can because they know they can go across to England and earn very much more than they can make here.  If writers were given some encouragement in the shape of better financial returns, we could keep some of them here at any rate.  We might not keep all of them but we could hope to keep some of them because writers as a group are intensely nationalistic people.</P>
    <P>In the case of those of them who had to emigrate, especially the great ones such as Shaw and O'Casey, any reading of their material shows their intense love of this country.  It shines out through their works.  Very often their love of country is expressed in a peculiar way which may seem to the superficial to be a dislike or a hatred of their origins, but that is merely a superficial view.  I should like to see the policy of Telefís Éireann so developed as to give young writers a chance of getting a better deal than they are getting now in so far as the production of material is concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand we are about to appoint a new Controller of Programmes.  I assume the gentleman who has filled that position for some time is leaving us and I am interested to know from the Minister, if he can tell me, if the terms of appointment of the incoming Controller will be exactly similar to <Col N="549" /> those which applied to the man who is going.  The position of Controller of Programmes is very important in any television station.  He is responsible, more than any other man, for the kind of station it becomes.  My view is that we have been well served by the Controller we had and, indeed, by his predecessor and by the original Director. I hope that in the future the Controller of Programmes will, if at all possible, be one of our own countrymen.</P>
    <P>I do not press this point to the extent that we should excuse incompetence because of accident of birth. I do not think the fact that a man is born in this country gives him any abilities over people born elsewhere but I think the Government have an obligation, when spending money, as far as possible to employ our own nationals so that the money spent will, to the utmost possible extent, benefit the country itself.  As I say, there is the qualification that we want the best person for this job.  It could easily be that the appointment of an inefficient person could result in financial loss. That is something which must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>If people are discouraged in the matter of television viewing, this must eventually make its impact on the amount of money which is received by the State in the shape of fees for licence payments.  Apart from those couple of points, it does not seem to me that I should impose on the Minister's or the House's time except that I also would urge that more might be done in the matter of programmes relating to parts of this country which, so far as the population is concerned, are relatively unexplored.  They are relatively unexplored so far as the population of other countries are concerned.</P>
    <P>Something should be done especially in connection with the promotion abroad of television films produced here.  I understand that nothing is being done in regard to some very excellent television films which are made here by our own people and which are shown on Irish television.  Some of those should have very wide appeal in America amongst the Irish there. <Col N="550" /> There is no effort being made to push the sale of such productions in the States.  That is something to which the Minister should give his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to lend my voice to the well deserved tributes which have been paid to Telefís Éireann.  However, I am not 100 per cent satisfied with the type and quality of certain programmes. Certainly, as Deputy O'Leary mentioned, &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; is one programme which would seem to capture the imagination.  This has drawn quite a lot of local, and even national, viewing, but, unlike Deputy O'Leary, who wishes to have more exposures of politicians before the camera, I feel this might well produce quite a number of poor negatives.</P>
      <P>The standard of television, as such, in this country is high by comparison with other countries and, in particular, when we think of the short number of years for which many of our television technicians have been engaged in this particular field of work.  Many of the people who are now producers went in as apprentices, and with very little experience, in the initial stage. They have attained quite a high standard of efficiency in that limited time. Television, however, as such, is not being exploited to the full in this country.  We could, for instance, make far greater use of television in the promotion of civics, in the educational field and in the field of general information to people regarding their rights under various laws and regulations. This is something which has been built into BBC programmes which have national appeal in serial form.  They tend at all times to keep the public at large informed of changes in law and of specific duties on them as citizens, and their obligations to the State in any particular field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention just one programme, the Riordans, in this connection. Telefís Éireann have touched on those matters in this programme on a number of occasions.  It has been of immense value to the Department of Agriculture and the farming community generally that this aspect of the programme has been exploited. <Col N="551" /> Much more could be done on some of those programmes in regard to road safety.  We have had a few of those special programmes but much more could be done in the ordinary weekly serial to bring home the impact of those weekly or fortnightly campaigns. This could be indoctrinated into the people's minds particularly in regard to road safety and bathing safety in the summer time.  This type of thing would be far more beneficial than a campaign during the week or fortnight prior to Christmas or during the holiday period in the summer.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome, on another aspect of our television service, an assurance from the Minister that nepotism does not exist or, if it does, that it will quickly be plucked out from the Television Authority.  This is a charge which has been levelled at Telefís Éireann.  I am not in a position to know whether it is true or false but I would ask the Minister to advert to it and to give the lie to it, if it is false and, if he finds there is ground for it, to ensure that it will no longer be practised.</P>
    <P>I believe television has a tremendous impact on the young.  Unlike my colleague, Deputy Crinion, I am not averse to advertising of liquor be it strong or soft, but I think the young people&mdash;I speak not of children in the seven to ten age bracket but teenagers &mdash;should not be given as their idols people who are unsavoury.  We have had people brought in on various programmes at times at which it could be reasonably expected every one in the household and family would be at home.  We had an era in this country when a he-man such as Deputy Dunne would have been the idol of the day. Television seems to have changed the picture somehow and we now get this long-haired idol to whom I can refer as the she-man.  Really and truly, this is not the type of picture we want to present to Irish youth.  We want them to have a better idea of manliness than someone going around like a long-haired Molly.  When Telefís Éireann bring people like that on to the screen, they are doing a disservice to themselves and to the nation.  I <Col N="552" /> should hope that such types would not be suffered any longer in the Authority's broadcasting rooms or studios.</P>
    <P>Sufficient publicity and sufficient viewing time is not given to programmes on farming.  &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo; and &ldquo;Telefís Feirme&rdquo; are admirable programmes and they are looked forward to by young farmers in the country.  They are also looked forward to by the older farmers because they are informative and instructive.  They bring farmers in rural areas abreast of changing techniques and the best methods by which they can improve their standard of living.  This, if brought to its natural conclusion means that farming in every area will be kept abreast of the most modern techniques employed in the Agricultural Institute, or on any other scientifically run farm in the country.</P>
    <P>I also feel that national culture is not sufficiently catered for.  Programmes like &ldquo;Club Céilí&rdquo; are not numerous enough on Telefís Éireann. Those we have are, indeed, of the highest standard, and they give entertainment second to none.  As my colleague, Deputy Dockrell, has said, many of the farcical canned programmes could well be done without, and a little more of our native programmes could be inserted in their stead.</P>
    <P>The theatre which has been neglected to a large extent in this country could be given a boost through television. This could bring about a greater awareness of the assets this country possesses in its actors and actresses. We have had a good few films produced by our Abbey players and such people on television.  One which comes to mind at the moment was &ldquo;Letter from a General&rdquo;.  This was a very excellent play, well worthy of any cast in Europe or America.  When we have professional people who are able to give of this high standard, we should be ever ready to avail of them on more numerous occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer very briefly to this subject.  In my view, the annual fee is exorbitant.  I happen to have spent a few years in America and I know that in one town of 59,000 people, they could operate a television station free of charge to the residents of that town, which provided better programmes than we provide on Telefís Éireann.  They were locally produced programmes.  They also had their own radio station at no cost whatsoever to the people of the town. There were not half as many advertisements on the television and the radio service in this American town as we have here.  If we are to continue charging this fee, Telefís Éireann should start earlier in the day, or else it should be abolished altogether.  It could be done.  The Minister should examine this problem a little more to see what could be done about it.</P>
      <P>I do not think we have enough programmes for schools or enough educational programmes.  It is time the Minister looked very carefully into this very important aspect, because television could be of tremendous service to our school pupils.  I agree with many of my colleagues who said we should have more home-produced programmes. This is not given enough attention.  I am not a great television viewer.  It is only in the past few weeks that I watched Telefís Éireann and I was not terribly impressed by the foreign films I saw.  I was not terribly impressed by the Polish films. I would prefer to watch a play from the Abbey or one of our theatres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertising is one of the most irritating things so far as I am concerned. We have too much advertising on Telefís Éireann.  We must realise that this is mass-hypnosis.  If we have to be subjected to this tremendous advertising, we will have cigarette addicts and alcoholics.  We have too much cigarette advertising on Telefís Éireann.  I checked this last night and I found that the film was interrupted every 16 minutes for advertising, and <Col N="554" /> on average there were eight advertisements in the interval each time.  That is far too much advertising.</P>
    <P>On the question of cigarette advertising, it has been made abundantly clear by medical authorities in the States and in Britain that cigarettes are harmful and cancer-producing.  I think the onus is on the Minister to ensure that cigarette advertising, if not banned altogether, is reduced considerably. There is also too much emphasis on drink.  I may be a little biassed because I am not a drinker, but I think we have too many advertisements for alcohol on Telefís Éireann.  We should have programmes giving the basic facts about health and hygiene. They are needed; they have been asked for; and the Minister is aware of this, and he should accede to the requests of the many people who asked for them.</P>
    <P>On the question of road safety, it is important that we should have more than just a road safety week once a year.  We should make more use of Telefís Éireann to explain the hazards, to give more details about road safety, and to explain how motorists and pedestrians can help.  Telefís Éireann should devote more time to this very important aspect.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish, the bilingual programmes are very helpful. They have stimulated interest in the Irish language.  They have served a very good purpose and should be fostered a little more.</P>
    <P>We should have earlier programmes for children.  On average, Telefís Éireann opens at 5.30 p.m. and the children's programmes are not over until 7 o'clock.  The station should open at 4 o'clock and the children's programmes should be finished at 6.30 p.m.  This is a medium which has a very great influence over the people and because of that, our advertising should be up to a proper standard and based on a proper code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief because about everything has been said so far as I can see.  I should like to add my voice to those who have asked for more school programmes. This is very important.  If the Minister replies that the budget will not allow <Col N="555" /> for the introduction of extra school programmes, or the making of such films, we should not be so narrow-minded as not to avail of material from the BBC who have made many very good school programmes.  Some of these programmes should include a subject in which we all have a keen interest, civics.  There would be no better means of presenting the subject than the programme &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; for which I have the highest praise.  This could be shown also to school children to illustrate the various aspects of our life.</P>
      <P>I do not think we cover national events sufficiently and we could well have more coverage in this field.  In this regard I have in mind something to which I referred last year on the Estimate for the Department of Education, the Casement funeral, which was watched by a lot of children and which encouraged them to seek further information about Casement.  There are other aspects of our national life which could be introduced in children's programmes to encourage children to dig deeper.</P>
      <P>I want to leave that now and discuss television personalities.  I do not want to discuss these too deeply, or discuss anyone in particular, but I have noticed a certain amount of this &ldquo;tin god&rdquo; business coming in where a man is interviewing somebody.  I have always said that a good television interviewer is a man who is never more important than the least important person he is interviewing.  Unfortunately, too many of them are inclined to like the sound of their own voices.  Some of the questions they put to visitors from abroad can be embarrassing and it is not good manners to embarrass visitors, unless they invite direct questioning on a particular matter.</P>
      <P>Another point is that we do not really have any Saturday afternoon television, and we should.  We have events on Saturday afternoons, and although I might not be permitted to watch, there are many people who would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be more control over commercials.  I realise that Telefís Éireann gets its revenue from commercials <Col N="556" /> and without the companies who buy time, we would not have a television station at all.  There are, however, advertisements which tend to be offensive and one hears people complaining about this.  Some of the companies who make the advertisements go on the principle that if it is talked about, it is a good advertisement, whether it is good or bad.  Deputy O'Leary referred to English advertisements and I have noticed that very often advertisements which have been made in England, with English people in them, have Irish accents dubbed on to them.  I do not object to this at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also said that he would welcome television coming into the Dáil.  I think we have enough actors in here without giving them the added encouragement of television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Too many hams.  Also in television there is a tendency for many interviewers who were previously on newspapers to interview people as if they were interviewing them for a newspaper instead of realising that television is a completely different medium.  I have already praised one programme, &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;, and another one which I would like to praise is &ldquo;Teen Talk&rdquo;.  The compere of this programme is a man with a great sense of responsibility and he is fully aware of his responsibility.  I wish that more of the people who spend a lot of their time on television were more conscious of their tremendous responsibility to the people to whom they are presenting programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see more provincial and county talent contests.  These have always proved popular and there are not enough of them.  I notice that we appear to be very restricted in the number of popular entertainers we have on television.  I do not think that we are really giving a fair share of the time to all the people who are available. There are many whom I could name&mdash;I will not&mdash;and whom I have not seen on television at all.  They probably have their own reasons; perhaps they have a grievance.  We have the introduction of too many brothers, <Col N="557" /> sisters and other relatives on television programmes and these people become the &ldquo;tin gods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion suggested that there should be a &ldquo;Music While You Work&rdquo; programme on Radio Éireann and the only comment I have to make in this regard is that if the Minister decides to introduce such a programme in the mornings, he should make sure that it is quick music because it was discovered in one country that where they played slow music, the people worked slowly.</P>

      <P>There are very conflicting views in regard to the television service we have here.  I feel that television time should be extended, having regard to what we might call a rather excessive licence fee.  I also think that more time might be devoted to agricultural programmes, to programmes on health and hygiene and also to more programmes for children. However, generally I think they are doing a rather good job.</P>
      <P>The last speaker referred to personalities and I have the impression from viewing one programme, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, that some of those participating might well be chastised by the Minister.  While the last speaker was reluctant to mention names, I do not hesitate to say that the behaviour of one man, Mr. Ulick O'Connor, while discussing people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when a Vote of this character was before the House, I had some observations to make on the radio and television services.  I want to elaborate on them now.  On the other hand, I think our obligation here is to speak frankly and honestly of what we think of the service generally provided by Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann for the Minister's information.  By and large, I do not think that service compares unfavourably with the service provided by any other national broadcasting company, particularly bearing in mind that Telefís Éireann are obliged to derive part of their revenue from advertising. There is not any doubt, if you compare the service provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation with that of Telefís Éireann, there is the immense advantage which the BBC enjoys that its programmes are not interrupted by advertising material.  I do not think any unprejudiced observer can doubt that the constant intervention of advertising material does materially react against the effectiveness of the programmes offered.  We have got to bear that in mind when seeking to pass judgment on the general service provided by Telefís Éireann. That is a burden they have to carry which was imposed on them by us. Allowance must be made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When approaching this whole question of television, one has constantly to ask oneself: what is the fundamental purpose of a national broadcasting and television station?  One is bound to say that a Director-General faced with that query must in the last analysis reply: to entertain.  If he fails to entertain the public, the public will not look at the programmes he has to offer.  Therefore, when some of us go to town for the purpose of exhorting the Director-General to provide more educational and loftier content in his programmes, if he is ready to accept all this well-intended advice he might find himself with a programme which would do credit to Sophocles but with <Col N="559" /> an audience which would do credit to nobody.  In a large part of the country the service provided by Telefís Éireann is practically the only service they have.  If they pay their licences, these people are entitled to expect decent entertainment from Telefís Éireann; and on the whole I think they get that. There are certain anachronisms to which I would wish, however, to address the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I have a profound belief that it is a bad thing to persuade the public that the Government authority in this country is acting dishonestly.  I think the people are entitled to expect that not only will a Government act honestly but appear to act honestly. We are getting into a most extraordinary situation in that regard. Telefís Éireann, in search of revenue by our direction, rely heavily on the cigarette companies for advertising.  As we see ourselves, every evening&mdash; admittedly in the later part of the evening&mdash;a very intensive campaign to recommend a wide variety of cigarettes proceeds on Telefís Éireann.  At the same time, I remember Deputy MacEntee, when Minister for Health, used to reduce us all almost to tears by his solicitude for fear any young people in this country would take up cigarette smoking.  He used to pour forth tons of literature, write introductions to pamphlets signed &ldquo;Seán MacEntee&rdquo; asking all and sundry to forbear from smoking cigarettes.  Every national teacher in the country was adjured to instruct his pupils not to smoke cigarettes.  There is something odd to the mind of the unsophisticated young if Deputy O'Malley, the present Minister for Health, and his predecessor, tear passion to tatters in Dáil Éireann about the evils of smoking while the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs derives a large part of his revenue from persuading everybody that they have no prospects of winning their heart's desire&mdash;the lady they are walking out with&mdash;unless they press upon her a particular brand of cigarettes.  Cool waters, the shade of trees, pastoral scenes, the charm of rural Ireland&mdash;all are invoked to persuade us to smoke cigarettes, while <Col N="560" /> Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Health, is bursting his boiler persuading us not to smoke them.</P>
    <P>Who is right?  I see a Labour Deputy up here on my right straining at the leash to warn us that Telefís Éireann should never be used to induce anybody to smoke cigarettes.</P>

      <P>Has he?  I can read the Deputies' minds as well as their scripts.  I admit there is here a strange conflict which creates an unfavourable impression.  Let us face the facts.  I think I am right in saying that in Great Britain tobacco advertising has been excluded from television.  I smoke cigarettes.  I have been a cigarette smoker all my life.  I think some of the people who go to town on this subject are perhaps getting too excited.  I do not deny that the evidence seems to be coercive that cigarette smoking does contribute to the small incidence of cancer of the lung which exists in the total population here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to minimise cancer of the lung.  It is a very severe affliction.  Let us not overpaint the picture.  I know it is a very lethal condition.  I know it is a condition which the absolute abolition of smoking would probably help to reduce. But I believe there are a number of other contributory factors.  I do not like to see people in the DTs.  I have seen people in the DTs, but that does not mean I never take a drink.  I do not mind confessing I like to see a fellow with a Total Abstinence pin up.  I always get a comfortable feeling that that chap is safer than the fellow who has not one up.  But I do not call on everybody to engage in heroic devotion. I admit that it is wiser, perhaps, not to smoke; but I do not believe in trying to put the whole population in glass cases just to satisfy ardent practitioners who can make you live forever.  I do not want to live forever.  Therefore, one must take a reasonable, sensible course in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> To be quite honest&mdash;and this is emphasised by what I am saying&mdash;I am not yet clear in my own mind as to whether the circumstances as we know them demand that Telefís Éireann should surrender the revenue they derive from cigarette advertisements.  If we could establish with certainty that morally that was a necessary thing to do, it ought to be done.  But I think the time has come for the Minister to apply his mind to this problem and discuss it with the Minister for Health and it is for this reason I have raised it here today.  I am not prepared to come down emphatically on one side or the other in this argument.  I feel the situation is developing in which this dichotomy of mind is causing legitimate scandal, particularly to the young.  If it is wrong that Telefís Éireann should not be used to promote it, if it is relatively indifferent, then possibly the revenue derived from it is justifiable.  I think my friend, the Deputy on my right, will agree a case could be made for the prohibition of all advertising of alcohol on television.</P>
    <P>Now it may be that the DTs are not as lethal a catastrophe to overtake the average person, but I think the Deputy will agree the affliction on a family created by an alcoholic in the family is often as great as the affliction of the death of a loved one in the rare occurrence of cancer of the lung.  If we were to ask whether the use of alcohol produced more alcoholics than cigarettes produce cancer of the lungs, I do not think the Deputy would challenge for a moment that proposition that the injudicious use of alcohol produces more alcoholics, overt and secret, than there are cases of cancer of the lung.  Therefore, the moment you make your national Television Authority dependent on advertising revenue, you are brought smack up against these problems. A different responsibility devolves upon a national broadcasting company than that which devolves upon a commercial one.  Because the national broadcasting authority is controlled by us here in Dáil Éireann, we have a duty to do in so far as we know what is right.  I shall be glad to hear the <Col N="562" /> Minister discuss, in his concluding observations, such exchange of views as he may have had with the Minister for Health with regard to tobacco advertising.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I hear a lot of talk about the celluloid shown on Telefís Éireann. I think that is largely nonsense.  Any television service which has to carry on for the length of time Telefís Éireann provides entertainment every day must have recourse to a great deal of recorded programmes and must use films.  What absolutely astonishes me is that when they use films for the providing of entertainment why they must use such old ones and why they must use such idiotic ones.</P>
    <P>I used to be a most ardent cinema fan for 30 years of my life.  For many years, I am sure I went to the cinema twice a week.  I loved the cinema as an art medium.  But, glory be, some of the films I see trotted out today, which admittedly are 20 and 30 years old, are not only venerable and whiskered but the most idiotic examples of the period when they were made.  When I think of the great actresses who adorned the screen of 30 years ago and see the films that are put on television today, I am absolutely aghast.</P>
    <P>There is not a single film in which Marie Dressler, a character actress, appears which could not, with advantage, be displayed today.  It would be an education of the young today to see a great actress like Marie Dressler whom they could never hope to see again and who is long dead.  I think of Bette Davis as a young woman, one of the greatest dramatic actresses that appeared on the screen.  I recall films such as &ldquo;The Little Foxes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Watch on the Rhine&rdquo;.  These were great masterpieces of superb acting which would be an education to the youth of any generation and a very useful criterion by which to judge current performances.  I think of great actresses such as Dame Edith Evans, who is now in the evening of her days. Any of these would, in themselves, be a guarantee that the film being shown was worth showing.  Some would appeal more than others but the fact that our young people of today were given the opportunity of seeing these <Col N="563" /> great performances, whatever the vehicle in which they appeared, would be a useful education as well as an entertainment.  I remember Greta Garbo was a great actress and a superb performer.  She has long since ceased to act but to see her in &ldquo;Anna Karenina&rdquo; would be a great entertainment and a great education.</P>
    <P>Probably we can get the rubbish in bargain lots at a very low figure but I do not believe that the difference in the cost of getting 30 year old films which feature great artistes of the day and getting 30 year old films which contain the rubbish of the past can be so great.  Just imagine poor old Paulette Goddard thumping around and trying to look romantic in these days when she did not look romantic in the 'thirties and just imagine trying to get us all to swoon about her now&mdash;why, you might as well ask us to fall in love with a two-hundredweight sack of flour. It seems fantastic.  What puzzles me is how discerning people could possibly make that mistake whereas the performances of the great actresses of that time were eternal and an education for anyone who saw them.  Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister to point out that to stir the emotions of an audience of 1966 with the so-called beauties of the 'thirties is futile, but to stir their admiration by the great artistes of those days is not only entertainment but educational.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister for Health has arrived and is now in conference with the Minister for Post and Telegraphs. Doubtless, my representations have been relayed to him and he has hurried in here to prompt the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on how to deal with the matter in his concluding observations.</P>

      <P>There is now another matter to which I want to refer, that is, the cost of the Orchestra.  The Orchestra is a very precious national asset.  Heretofore, it has been most unjustly charged up against the accounts of Radio Éireann.  It is now being brought to light but, of course, the Vote for Radio Éireann, as heretofore, carries it.  I understand that the Votes of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann are now to be amalgamated and that there is to be no differential of that kind.  In those circumstances, it might be well to segregate the cost of the Orchestra and to let us know what the Orchestra actually costs so that we may vote the money in full knowledge of the facts and defend the Orchestra against anyone who alleges that the charge may be excessive although I am certain that there are few institutions in the country which give us better value.  In that regard, I would bespeak the Minister's special attention to the recent observations of Mr. Galbraith, the distinguished American economist, who said he had come to the conclusion that economists ought to be shot.</P>

The last time I spoke on this matter of television, I <Col N="565" /> said that if the reporting of the proceedings of this House did not improve, I would name names and particularise defects.  I hope the House believes me that if that necessity existed today, I would have availed of this occasion, even if I had to move the Adjournment.  I think there has been an improvement, objectively, in reporting the proceedings in this House.  I am, for the present, persuaded that perhaps any defect in that regard in the past may have been due to lack of expertise.  If the present improvement continues, no one will rejoice more than I.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude with this: there is a governing body but, in that governing body, there are a couple of Fianna Fáil hacks.  If the Minister wants the confidence of the House in regard to the administration of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann, let us get rid of political hacks.  I am a politician&mdash;I am proud of it&mdash;and so is the Minister, but I do not believe in putting political hatchetmen on the boards of what are supposed to be national institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that a large number of military service pensioners, who played a large part in the foundation of the State, receive exceedingly small pensions which are quite inadequate to meet the present cost of living, and in view of the fact that with the passing of time these pensioners are both decreasing in numbers and advancing in age, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the past services of these people should be more generously recognised and calls on the Government both to increase the pensions paid to them and, in particular, to <Col N="566" /> ensure that when such pensioners receive any increase in social welfare payments their pensions are not reduced by a corresponding amount.</P>
    <P>One year ago a similar motion was tabled by Deputy Tierney and myself. As we made it clear then, I wish to make it clear now that neither he nor I expect, or can gain, any personal financial improvement, should this motion be recommended by this House and accepted by the Government. Neither is there any personal political motive.  This is not an attempt, either, to cash in on the Jubilee Year of 1916, because this motion was placed on the Order Paper and indeed, in normal circumstances, would have been taken last year, were it not that the Government found it necessary to stop Private Members' Time for quite a considerable time before the Christmas recess.  This motion is placed here with quite a genuine desire to draw the attention of the House to the inadequacy, and to glean from the members of all Parties in this House their wishes and views on that inadequacy, of both service pensions and special allowance pensions which, in many cases, are scarcely above existence rate for the people in receipt of them.  I suggest to the Minister, as we suggested when a similar motion was before the House a year ago, that this should be left to a free vote of the House, as an expression of opinion of all sides and of all Parties, rather than that it should appear to be a political effort designed to embarrass the Government.  I am quite sure the Minister as an individual, is as much, if not more, in sympathy with people who, when the country was in its hour of need, gave their services, be they little or great, without stint.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this motion and of the speeches which will be made during the debate, something will be done which will prevent people with small service pensions and, particularly, special allowance pensioners, being forced to depend on charity, home assistance or to have to avail of the limited comforts of a county home. Practically since 1932 onwards, past Ministers for Defence have been circularised by brigade organisations of <Col N="567" /> the Old IRA, county organisations, and organisations throughout the whole country, appealing in the very same terms as this motion, that justice be done to those who, either by reason of old age or illness, are unable to provide an adequate income for themselves or their dependants.  These people should be in receipt of a minimum pension; a relaxation of the means test should be brought about and a standard should be reached so that they would, at least, be able to have a modest existence in their declining years.</P>
    <P>I speak mainly for those in receipt of special allowances, but anything I may say with regard to them could equally well be said of those who are in receipt of service pensions of a small amount.</P>
    <P>There is a case in my constituency of a man from Waterford city who served from 1918 to 1922.  Having taken part in the earlier days of the Civil War he was forced to flee the country.  He went into exile and remained away for a considerable number of years.  Dogged by ill health and perhaps by ill luck, he was forced to return some four or five years ago. He applied for a special allowance and received a full award for a single man but that award was completely inadequate to keep him and he has had to depend on the charity of relatives ever since.  Otherwise, he would have to seek the cold comforts of a county home.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and to this House that it is unreasonable to expect a man broken in health, advanced in years, although not yet 70, to exist on a weekly sum that would not keep him for two or three days.  Unless he got the assistance of relatives, he would have to go into the county home.  Surely, that is not adequate repayment for services rendered?  This man does not seek much.  All he asks&mdash;and he has repeatedly written to various Ministers for Defence&mdash;is sufficient on which to exist until such time as he reaches the qualifying age for old age pension.</P>
    <P>I am aware that increases have been granted in special allowance cases within the past two years.  An increase of £4 a year was granted in <Col N="568" /> October, 1954.  An increase of £4 a year in a pension itself a miserable pittance could not possibly be considered adequate.  Again, in 1965, an increase of £8 a year was granted.  An increase of 8/- a week on a pension well below subsistence level is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Ministers in the past and perhaps the present Minister for Defence have been circularised by various Old IRA organisations throughout the country. The Kilkenny Brigade, in 1954, suggested to the then Minister that a single man's special allowance pension should be £4 10/- per week as a minimum and that a married man should have £6 10/- per week.  In 1960, the Kilkenny Brigade suggested that in view of the increased cost of living since 1954 a single special allowance pensioner should receive a pension of £5 per week and a married pensioner on special allowance should receive £7 10/- per week.</P>
    <P>In view of this and in view of the increase in the cost of living index figure that has occurred since 1960, I would reiterate what has been already proposed by organisations of Old IRA men, people who are interested and who cannot be accused of acting for political motives, comprised of all political Parties, that is, that there should be a special allowance pension of £6 per week for a single man and £8 10/- for a married man.  In 1966, that is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>In a circular issued by the Kilkenny Brigade of the Old IRA and signed by Patrick Walsh, sent to the Minister for Defence on 7th July, 1960, it was stated:</P>
    <P>The sums paid in special allowances are, judged by present day standards, inadequate and should be increased to £7 10s. in the case of a married man and to £5 in the case of a single man, income from all sources to count in both cases.</P>
    <P>To pin-point a specific case, may I cite the difficulty of men in the 60 to 70 age group obtaining employment against younger competitors in manual labour grades?  The difficulties here can only be understood by those who experience them.  Many of the hardships endured by the old IRA can be removed by granting the <Col N="569" /> special allowance at 65 years of age, increasing the sums allocated and modifying the income calculations. Almost all recipients of special allowances have been subjected to irritating examinations by investigations by investigation officers relative to their income and the earning of an extra shilling per week by one holding an allowance or by a member of his family is taken as a reason for a reduction in the special allowance and, unfortunately, the Pension Board decision is final in all cases. There is no appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>The sums paid under the special allowance scheme are very low and in a memorandum sent to the Minister for Defence, Seán MacEoin, in 1954, by this Association, it was requested that the overall income of a single man be increased to £4 10s. per week and a married man's income in this grade increased to £6 10s., comparable to the lowest economic wage of the period.</P>
    <P>That statement from a responsible organisation, a brigade organisation of Old IRA men, of all political opinions, should be taken seriously by a Minister of State charged with the responsibility of seeing to the defence of the country and to the welfare of those who have taken part and are taking part in the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if this Dáil recommends this motion to the Cabinet and if the Minister sees his way to support the motion if passed here, it will not impose an everlasting expense on the country.  By the very nature of things, the number of these pensioners will decline.  Anyone who is entitled to a medal, by which I mean anyone who got a medal worthily, must by reason of the fact that the latest date on which he could have served in the Old IRA would have been June, 1923, must now be over 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question that I put to the Minister for Defence on last Tuesday, I was informed that between 1960 and 1965 some 2,000 pensioners had died.  On that basis it is fairly easy to forecast that in the next ten to 20 years the number in receipt of <Col N="570" /> special allowance or service pensions will not be counted in thousands but rather in hundreds.  So that, if it is expensive at the moment to make provision for pensions of the figures I have suggested, that provision will be reducing gradually each year.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to stress the need for acceptance of the motion or to make political capital in regard to it but I was surprised to hear the Minister saying in reply to a supplementary question today that this was never intended as an income.  I beg the Minister's pardon if I have misquoted him.  I have the quotation here:</P>
    <P>These are special allowances which were brought in with the object of providing an allowance, not a means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Surely, if a man claiming a special allowance has no other means of any sort that fact must be taken into account and the allowance must be of such an amount as will enable him to exist outside a workhouse, of such amount as will enable him to live without having to appeal to a local authority for home assistance or to a charitable organisation for a subvention. Surely he is entitled to that?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I shall not use the fact that this is Jubilee Year to make a special appeal to the Minister.  I shall use the fact that there are throughout the length and breadth of this country thousands of Old IRA who served their country in whatever way they were called upon to do so; they may not have been called upon to take part in ambushes or active engagements, but that was not their fault.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They also serve who only stand and wait.&rdquo;  Many of them were available if called upon and the fact that they were available has been recognised by granting them service medals. Attached to those medals is the right to an allowance if, through illness or old age, they are unable to provide for themselves.  I appeal to the Minister and the House to make the increase asked for now a memorial in honour of the Jubilee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I shall be very brief.  A grave injustice has been done to these people all <Col N="571" /> down through the years.  For the past 45 years they have been sadly neglected.  No doubt the Minister will say that their lot has been improved. It has been improved to some extent but the allowance was so small initially that even a meagre addition looks like an improvement.  There is need for greater change now.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of those drawing service pensions are in receipt of a sum of £16 10s. 4d. a year.  When the original £10 per year was granted, the value of money was greater than it is today.  The value of the £ today is about 8/4 to 8/9, though we were told recently it was roughly 10/-.  I believe it is lower than that.  As Deputy Kyne has pointed out, when we tabled the motion we momentarily forgot the Jubilee Year was approaching.  However, this is a very appropriate year in which the Irish people and their Government should show their appreciation for the small body now left with us of those who made it possible for us to have our own parliament and our own government.  The way in which to show our gratitude to them is by treating them generously in their declining years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the pension legislation needs drastic overhaul.  There are two Acts, the 1924 and the 1934.  Those who fought on the republican side got orders not to apply under the 1924 Act.  The Minister will remember this because he himself was very high up at that particular time.  In 1934, after the change of Government, a new Act was introduced.  It reacted unfavourably against those who were loyal to the instructions they got not to apply under the 1924 Act.  Under the 1924 Act things were easier; the mere fact that one wore a uniform counted for service.  Up to a point the 1924 Act was generous to those who applied under it.  The others applied under the 1934 Act and the strange thing is they never got any recommendation, good, bad, or indifferent.  They never received anything.  They lost 10 years pension by obeying instructions.  They would have qualified had they applied under the 1924 Act.  I believe the Minister would have some what the same outlook <Col N="572" /> as I have in this matter.  He knows the injustices.  He should use his influence with the Cabinet now to see that these are rectified in realation to the very small number of Old IRA left.</P>
    <P>Every nation treats its soldiers generously.  Every nation respects and honours its soldiers.  Every nation pays them a generous pension.  Here we are content to pay tribute, but very little else.  When they die we wrap the coffin in a flag and we fire three volleys over the grave; we go back to the house then and talk about the great man he was, what he did, all he saved.  Ultimately we discover he was in receipt of £10 or £12 a year.  I believe that governments in this country are of the opinion that the only good IRA man is a dead IRA man because it is only then we hear of how good the IRA man was.  While he is alive there is no great appreciation for him.</P>
    <P>Pensions should be increased substantially. As far as disability pension is concerned, I pay tribute to the Minister. I am sure he has used his influence, but I think the whole system is wrong. Disability pension should be paid to all over 65 who are no longer able to compete in the labour market.  That disability pension should be granted without a medical certificate.  At the moment an old IRA man under 70 years claiming disability pension must get a medical certificate from his doctor.  He has to prove that he is incapable of work and almost has to prove that he has nowhere else to go except into the county home.  If the applicant is able to prove that he is incapable of work at 65 years of age, he should be granted a special allowance. It is very degrading to have the social welfare officer going to the home of the applicant to find out the applicant's means, if any, if the applicant's sons or daughters are bringing money into the house, and so on, in order to qualify for the special allowance.  Some change should be made in that.</P>
    <P>The number of people in receipt of these special allowances is dwindling every year, even though, strange to relate, the figure for medal-holders has increased.  It is easy, I suppose, to explain that because, in regard to the vast <Col N="573" /> number of people who are applying for various things, the Minister is just notifying them that he has discovered that the medal has been unduly awarded.  Medal holders do not necessarily qualify for a special allowance or a pension.  What we propose will not cost the country a great deal of money. We can afford to neglect a great number of things but we cannot afford to neglect our Old IRA men.  Some years ago the Federation of Old IRA made this proposal to the Minister: that anyone with a pension of £100 should receive a 50 per cent increase; anyone with a pension exceeding £100 but not exceeding £125 should receive an increase of 50 per cent; exceeding £125 a year but not exceeding £150, a 40 per cent increase; exceeding £150 but not exceeding £200, an increase of 40 per cent; exceeding £200 but not exceeding £346, a 30 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Our proposal is a moderate one. Many people hold medals but when they apply for either a special allowance or a service pension they are told the medal was unduly awarded, so, naturally, there would not be such a great number involved.  If the Minister left it to a free vote of the House, I think all Parties would agree to give those people a substantial increase in their pensions.  As Deputy Kyne said, it might be thought that because we are discussing this motion in 1966 we are taking advantage of the commemoration of 1916.  That was not in our minds when this motion was tabled.  As Deputy Kyne pointed out, this motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time but we could not move it.  However, seeing that this is a year of commemoration, no better gesture could be made to that body of men than to increase their special allowances substantially.  It would be a generous act on the Minister's part, and I am sure if the Minister had his own way he would do his best for these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion by Deputy Tierney and Deputy Kyne.  The Minister will recognise straight away that a considerable injustice is being done to these people.  Most of them are in their latter days.  They are elderly <Col N="574" /> people and any of them I have come across are suffering from ill-health, and largely suffering from ill-health as a result of the privations they underwent in their youth.  It is not always realised that people who do things in their youth have to pay for it in later life. Many of them suffer from rheumatism and other disabilities as a result of these privations, and they are unable to compete on the ordinary employment market.  The majority of them probably have not very much longer left to them on account of the state of their health and their advanced years, to enjoy any benefits that the State may wish to give them.</P>
      <P>I have always felt that the average IRA man has got a pretty raw deal in this country.  Although I have served in Dáil Éireann for 12 or 14 years, only a very small number of those on whose behalf I made representations were granted the service allowance.  They did not qualify according to the Minister's means test or else they did not comply with the necessary requirement that they had active service in the face of the enemy.  As Deputy Kyne mentioned, many of them carried out their duties as they were ordered to carry them out and even though they did not come into active service, that is not their fault.  Many of them spent long periods out in bad weather on the run or in the mountains, as a result of which they are suffering the physical disabilities of which I spoke.</P>
      <P>I do not think it can be reasonably argued by the Minister that on account of the credit squeeze it is not possible to accept this proposal.  I fully realise that every Minister has to go to the Department of Finance to get the requisite funds, but this motion is intended to cover only those who were on active service, which takes us away back to the early 1920s.  For that reason there could not be a great many of them left.  When the Minister is speaking, perhaps he will give us some idea what it would cost to meet the requirements of the motion.  I believe it would be a very small amount.  Perhaps he could also give us some idea of the number of pensioners who will be covered by this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a free conscience I can recommend <Col N="575" /> this proposal.  As everybody in this House knows, I am not a IRA man.  At the same time I am of nationalist stock and I have always had sympathy for anybody who did what he could, according to his lights, to procure for us the right to arrange our own affairs in this country.  The treatment we have meted out to this category of persons is nothing short of outrageous.  Every other country, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, has looked after those who gave active service.  They have looked after them well, seeing to it that they had the wherewithal to live.</P>
    <P>In this country there are people in this category who have only a few pounds a year pension, with no other means of subsistence, relying on the State in their old age.  The motion covers those in receipt of social welfare benefits and suggests that these benefits should not be reduced because of receipt of pensions.  I am not sure whether the social welfare benefits are reduced because of pensions or whether special allowances are taken into consideration in this respect.  It is a matter to which the Minister should give his earnest attention.  I suggest that the Minister accept this motion and give a guarantee to the House that he will do all he can to get the small amount of money necessary from his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there might be more speakers on the motion at this stage but since there are not, I shall make my contribution now rather than later. Let me say at the outset that I am not accepting the motion.  I have listened attentively to the proposer and the seconder, and to Deputy Esmonde. The motion deals with service pensions only.  Service pensions, as I understand them, are pensions granted on the face of a military service certificate issued under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1924 Act, the certificates were awarded by the Board of Assessors and under the 1934 Act, by a Referee appointed under that Act. Service pensions are based on certain standards.  The 1924 Military Service <Col N="576" /> Pensions Act had written into it that to qualify a person had to have service in the Defence Forces, or whatever they were called at the time, subsequent to 1st July, 1922.  The 1934 Act provided that a service certificate applicant qualified on the basis of service in the IRA prior to 11th July, 1921.  Persons who had active service in 1916 qualified for pensions under the 1934 Act only, unless they had service in the Defence Forces as I have already indicated, and persons who had no service after 11th July, 1921, who, in other words, took no part in the Civil War, qualified only under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>The service certificate was awarded on service calculated according to the rules laid down in the Acts, by the Board of Assessors or the Referee. There are no deductions made in respect of any other payment from public funds, social welfare or otherwise. Some of these service pensions were abated when the recipients enjoyed State employment but abatement of these pensions has long since been removed. As far as the motion is concerned, there is no such thing as a deduction from service pensions because of any other payment made by the State to people in receipt of these pensions.</P>
    <P>There is another main code of pensions payable to men and women who had service with the forces as specified in the two Acts mentioned.  That is known as the Army Pensions Code which provides for disability pensions. Disability pensions are payable to an applicant in respect of a wound received on service, or a disease contracted or aggravated by service or by the wound.  These pensions have not been mentioned by speakers to this motion.  As time passed, it was found that some people who had service in the 1916 Insurrection were in need of some support from the State to enable them to continue to support themselves and there was an extension of the Army Pensions Act which introduced what is known as a special allowance to help survivors of the 1916 Insurrection who were in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>That provision was extended to cover <Col N="577" /> members of organisations specifically named in the Army Pensions and the Military Service Pensions Acts.  They are the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rifles, the IRA, Cumann na mBan and Fianna Éireann.  People in these organisations are entitled to apply for medals. Having applied for medals and having the medals duly awarded to them, they can then apply for special allowances. Under the 1924 and 1934 Acts, 18,186 pensions were awarded and all those people were entitled to get a medal with bar with the pensions when the medals were struck.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that some of the military service pensions were not at a very high rate.  They were based, as I have said, on the service awarded by the Board of Assessors or the Referee and if a man could show he had the requisite service, they assessed him with a year's or one and a half years' service or whatever it was.  That was applicable in the main to people with pre-Truce service.  Men who served in the armed forces subsequent to the opening of the Civil War had their full number of years added, which meant three years, to the qualified service they had and that meant a fair pension which was based on rank as well as on the years of service awarded.  Men graded as privates were paid £5 for each year of service and that was stepped up so that a captain had £10 for each year of service and a commandant had £15 for each year of service awarded, and so on.</P>
    <P>The case has been made for a long number of years that we should have the lowest pensions at fixed rates assessed at a certain figure so that we would not have men paid at a very low rate per year.  When you come to examine that question, you would find that the men who had been awarded pensions at a higher rate, for more years' service and who rendered exceptional service to the State, might not be too well satisfied to find they were not treated on the same basis as the rest of the members of those organisations.  This aspect of the pensions code, and possible amendment of it, have often been brought to the <Col N="578" /> notice of people like myself who are intimately acquainted with large numbers of the people who served in the movement.  This has been brought to my notice on a number of occasions in view of the fact that some years ago there was a steeper increase in the lower paid service pensions than in the higher paid ones.</P>
    <P>You will notice, if you look at this question of increases in military service pensions, the years in which they were increased, the percentage increases and the amounts by which they were increased, military service pensions have been increased on seven occasions since 1953.  Pensions not exceeding £100 per annum were increased by 50 per cent and pensions exceeding £100 were increased on a diminishing scale with effect from the 1st January, 1953. All military service pensions were increased by 6 per cent with effect from 1st August, 1959, by 5 per cent with effect from 1st August, 1960, by 20 per cent with effect from the 1st August, 1962, by 5 per cent with effect from the 1st November, 1963, by 5 per cent with effect from the 1st October, 1964 and by a further 9 per cent with effect from 1st August, 1965. Those pensions not exceeding £100 per year, which would be the bulk of the pensions awarded, have been increased by 141 per cent since the 1st January, 1953.  I would draw the Deputies' attention to the years in which those pensions were increased.</P>
    <P>Many military service pensioners fitted themselves into the community after the end of hostilities in 1923 or 1924.  It is true that a considerable number, who were very active men in the movement, emigrated at that time and went to America.  Many of them came back from America.  Many of them did very well in America and many of them did very well at home here in Ireland.  The bulk of those pensioners belong to the small farming classes in this country.  Many more of them are artisans and small business men.  They were men who worked for their living serving other people as ordinary working men earning an honest living.  They fitted themselves into the community in the course of time.  Many of them got married and <Col N="579" /> raised families the same as any other citizen in the State.  They made their contributions to the social welfare funds in this country.  As time passed they qualified to receive whatever social benefits were due to them as ordinary citizens of the State.  Military service pensions were never intended to be a source of livelihood to the men and women who took part in the fight for freedom in the country.  They were paid on the basis I have indicated to the House and in the manner in which I have indicated they were awarded under the two main Acts.</P>
    <P>The other portion of the motion is mainly concerned with the special allowances.  I have indicated how the special allowances were brought in in the first instance to deal with men who had taken part in the 1916 Insurrection. They were extended to cover people who were in the other organisations specified in the Acts.  A person, to qualify for a special allowance, must have a certificate of military service under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, or a Service Certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, in respect of service during any part of the period which commenced on 23rd day of April, 1916, and ended on the 11th day of July, 1921, or a wound or disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of a wound received or a disability contracted in the said period, or a medal in respect of service during any part of the week which commenced on the 23rd day of April, 1916, or a medal in respect of continuous membership of Óglaigh na hÉireann (Old IRA) or kindred organisation during the period of three months which ended on the 11th day of July, 1921, provided that medal was duly awarded, or a service, wound or disability pension or a gratuity under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts.</P>
    <P>That is the first essential.  The next item is that a special allowance may be granted to any eligible applicant who fulfils the conditions that his yearly means do not equal or exceed the appropriate annual sum.  Therefore, it must be assumed the framers of the Act assumed the applicant had some means. It is found, on investigation, that there <Col N="580" /> are a few people&mdash;not so many&mdash;who have not any means whatsoever other than what they obtain from the State under some other Act.  The next condition is that the applicant is incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of body or mind. Persons over 70 years are regarded as incapable of self-support by reason of age.</P>
    <P>The appropriate annual sum from the 1st August, 1965 is: in the case of a single man or woman, a widower or widow whose age is 70 years or more, £120 per year, and £146 per year in the case of a person whose age is less than 70 years.  In the case of a married man or woman whose spouse is living and whose age is 70 years or more, the appropriate annual sum is £139 10s. in respect of a married couple and, where the age is less than 70 years £172 in respect of the married couple When the age is 70 years or more and the person is not in receipt of a contributory old age pension and his spouse is not in receipt of a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts, the annual sum is £163 in respect of the married couple.  There is something else in respect of each child under 18 years of age.  It is very seldom, in the case of Old IRA men, that you will find children under that age at the moment.  The special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as, when added to the applicant's yearly means, will not equal or exceed the appropriate annual sum.  The means are investigated by the social welfare officers and we consider it a suitable method of investigating means because the social welfare officers in many cases have already investigated, or are in the process of investigating, means under the Old Age Pensions Acts, or in respect of other benefits under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Means for the purpose of special allowances are assessed in accordance with the rules laid down.  They are assessed in a liberal way that has been explained here in the House on many occasions.  When a person applies for a special allowance there are certain incomes that are not taken into account as assessable.  As I said already, a great number of these people are small <Col N="581" /> farmers and when their means are being assessed by the social welfare officers the following are not taken into account: children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts; public assistance; free maintenance which imposes a hardship on the provider; maintenance in a hospital, sanatorium, county home or like institution; old age pensions in whole or in part, and certain other social welfare benefits that affect so few cases that they are hardly worth mentioning; blind welfare grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Half of disability benefit is taken into account.  A number of other benefits under the Social Welfare Acts are not taken into account. Contributions excluding annuity, received from a recognised charitable institution and gifts of a <i>bona fide</i> kind are not taken into account.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means of an applicant for a special allowance these are the broad items which are taken into account: the value of a house, plot or farm; the value of capital, the first £25 being disregarded, the next £375 taken at one-twentieth and the remainder at one-tenth; the amount of wages, profit from trade or business or other cash income; one half of the amount of disability benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts; some portion of the old age pensions, widows' pensions, unemployment benefit and assistance; the amount exceeding £60 of a military service pension or a disability or wound pension or a Connaught Ranger's pension, or a combination of such pensions as at 1st October, 1964, where the applicant is under 70 years; the amount exceeding £30 where the applicant is over 70 years; the value of free maintenance to the extent to which it does not impose hardship on the provider and the value of earned maintenance; the value of free lodging, taken at £3.18.0 per annum in the case of an individual and at £7.16.0 in the case of a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profit from the weekly contributions of members of the family over 18 years who are living at home <Col N="582" /> is assessed on this scale in the urban areas.  If the contribution is 40/- nothing is taken into account.  If the contribution is 42/-, 1/- is taken into account, and if it goes up to 52/-, 6/- is taken into account.  In the rural areas if the contribution from members of the family over 18 years living at home is 40/- nothing is taken into account.  If it is 42/-, 1/- is taken into account, and it goes up to 50/-, when 5/- is taken into account.  There are other items that might affect just a few cases: where the yearly value of the means of a child under 18 years exceeds £39.2 but does not exceed £50.16, the amount of the excess is assessed.  Only half of a disability benefit is taken into account.</P>

      <P>With regard to disability benefits a single person can have a weekly rate of £2. 2. 6 and £58. 8. 0 per year is assessable.  On the question of the old age and blind pensions the amount that is assessable can be a great deal less than the actual amount of the blind or non-contributory pension.  The contributory pension is now £3 for a single person and £2. 7. 6 is disregarded.  For a married person it is £5. 7. 6 and the amount assessed is £1. 11.  That will give Deputies a fair picture of the assessment of means.  They are assessed on a liberal basis and there is no question of trying to assess an applicant's means to such an extent that he cannot get a special allowance.</P>
      <P>I might say that the average special allowance payable stands at £84 per year.  It is true that some are very low because of the fact that the assessable income comes close to the amount of the appropriate sum.  I may add that 46,283 medals without bar were issued to people who had only to show that they were members of the specified organisations, that they were members for at least three months up to and before 11th July, 1921, of the organisations named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Since I became Minister for Defence I heard different points of view expressed on a few occasions by Deputies in relation to these pensions and special allowances.  It was thrown across the House at me that the assessment of the military service pensions was not in accordance with ordinary common justice, that it was a fraud, and that the fraud was perpetrated before the Boards of Assessors and the referees in the obtaining of certificates. That is absolutely untrue.  Some Deputy mentioned the case of a boy who was 12 years at the time who has a service medal.  If he joined Fianna Éireann at 12 years of age and had the requisite membership in 1921, he is entitled to a medal.  I do not know which case that was, but expressions of opinion of that nature were hurled across the floor of the House criticising and throwing doubts on the evidence given by the verifying officers who, in their own time and out of their own funds, came before the referee or the Boards of Assessors, as the case may be, and went to all the trouble they did go to, to give honest and straightforward evidence in the cases with which they were dealing.</P>
    <P>Here we are now dealing with this huge number of people.  I have given the figures of the number of medal holders, the number of service pensions, and the number of people in receipt of special allowances.  You can add to the figure of 8,500 approximately, who are now in receipt of special allowances, some 4,000 who have died since they were granted their special allowances.  I do not want to delay the house and I think my time is finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that on this motion my first interest would be for those in receipt of special allowances because this is the type of person who, having given military service, is subject to a means test when he has <Col N="584" /> occasion to apply for an allowance from the State.  I know there may be many pensioners who would find it somewhat difficult to maintain a normal standard of living and that on the other hand there may be a number, even though a minority, of pensioners who have reasonably good pensions but also pretty good incomes from some other source.  That is why I say that my first interest would be in respect of those who are to a large extent dependent on special allowances.</P>
      <P>These people are recognised as having given service to the State and this service is recognised in the initial stage by reason of the issue of a Pre-Truce medal to them.  Before I talk about the allowances, I think I should once again bring to the Minister's notice a practice that sprang up in the past ten or 15 years, a practice that is applied particularly when a member of the IRA decides to apply for a special allowance.  The practice is that on reinvestigation, a man is told that he was not entitled to a Pre-Truce medal.  I cannot understand that sort of behaviour.  I know of cases of men who qualified many years ago for this service medal and who, when they applied for the special allowance, were told that they should not have got it in the first place.  I do not know whether that was ever adequately explained or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister did.  The particular case I have in mind did not occur when he was Minister for Defence.  Does the Minister not admit that it is a shocking thing, 45 years afterwards, to say to a man applying for a special allowance &ldquo;We have to investigate you again&rdquo; and in some cases to say &ldquo;You were never entitled to a medal, please send it back&rdquo;?  That is an awful thing, particularly if the man's neighbours hear about it and more particularly if the medal which he received for service to the country and which is the pride of his family, perhaps a young family, is to be returned.  What are these children to think if some day the father or mother reads out a letter to the effect <Col N="585" /> that &ldquo;Daddy has to send back his medal.  Daddy is a fraud and did not deserve the medal&rdquo;?  I will give way to the Minister for 30 seconds or so if he wishes to say something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went to some pains to explain the procedure which is adopted in order to determine whether or not a man is entitled to a medal and he paid tribute, a deserved tribute I suppose, to the verifying officers who travelled to Dublin at their own expense to give evidence and so on.  Surely the man's entitlement to the medal should have been copperfastened when he first applied for it. The few people I know of are somewhat ashamed, not to say disgusted, that the medals they wore on public parades going to Mass cannot be worn again because some board or person decided on reinvestigation that they were not entitled to them.  This sort of practice should stop and if the Minister can do anything to restore the position of these men&mdash;whether they get special allowances or not does not make any difference I suppose&mdash;he should at least restore the medals to them.  They believe that they gave service to a free and united Ireland and their neighbours and friends believe it <Col N="586" /> and it is a terrible thing, 45 years later, to strip them of the honour conferred on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister paid tribute, and well deserved tribute, to the majority of the verifying officers but there were some who did not behave very well and some who were influenced by political considerations.  I am not saying they were Fianna Fáil, or Fine Gael, or Labour, but there were political considerations in the evidence given.  I know of a man in my constituency who believed he was entitled to a medal and the verifying officer, either at his home or in the street, made a statement to him to the effect that the evidence he gave in Dublin in the Department of Defence was to the effect that the man had the proper service but it was discovered afterwards that he had done no such thing, that he had done the contrary and sold the man down the river, so to speak.  That was merely because he had a different political opinion to the man.  That does not speak too highly for certain of the verifying officers who were influenced by other considerations rather than the truth.</P>
      <P>I regret I was not here for the opening part of the Minister's speech but I assume from some of the remarks I heard that there is not much hope that the special allowances will be increased in this the 50th anniversary of the Rising of 1916.  I do not think that it would be premature if the Government were to make that decision now.  Perhaps the Minister is inhibited by the fact that he cannot make statements which will commit the Exchequer to a certain amount of expense but I believe that the gesture should be made in 1966 before we start the anniversary celebrations. All of us agree that there should be celebrations and all of us agree that every single section of the community, irrespective of creed or politics or sporting affiliations, should be combined to give honour to those, whether alive or dead, who made sacrifices in the 1916 Rising and those who subsequently contributed to the struggle right up to 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the House last week it was unanimously agreed by all Parties that a <Col N="587" /> special 10/- coin should be struck in order to ensure that the celebrations would be of such magnitude as to be worthy of the occasion.  But all the celebrations, all the striking of special coins, all these gestures by the Government and by this House will ring very hollow in the ears of those who at present are living on very small special allowances.  The Minister indicated the type of means test applied.  For example, a single man under 70 qualified for a special allowance if he had less than £146 per annum, that is, less than £3 per week.</P>
    <P>I do not say there should be extra special consideration for certain sections of the community, but this year the emphasis will be on the position Ireland has attained, due to the efforts of the people we commemorate.  There were not so many of them in it.  Anybody who has read anything about 1916, and particularly those of that generation now in the Dáil who participated in it, know there were not hoardes of Irishmen bursting to take up arms against the British Empire.  As the Minister said in a Parliamentary reply, there are 8,500 in the special allowance class.  I do not think this country will go broke if we made some sort of generous gesture towards these people. It would not cost us £1 million, £500,000 or anything like it.  The Minister also stated that an increase had been given to these people, to operate from August, 1965, of about £8 per year and that in the previous October, there had been an increase of £4 per year.  These increases were generally welcome.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that most of these people are old.  As the motion suggests, their number is decreasing gradually and year after year they are becoming fewer and fewer.  They will not live to see the 75th anniversary of 1916.  They are alive for the 50th anniversary.  The House would gladly welcome and support any special measure of taxation to raise that sum of money not alone to do them honour but to assist them and see they are recognised.  I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;It is all very well for you people in the Opposition.  You have <Col N="588" /> merely to ask; we have to get the money.&rdquo;  I remember the Minister on this side of the House; I remember the former Deputy Davern, the former Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Gilbride. Down through the years they have been the champions of those who served in the IRA, the IRB, Cumann na mBan and the other organisations formed to secure a measure of freedom.  All due credit to Pearse, Connolly, Clarke, MacDiarmada, MacDonagh&mdash;all the leaders who are being commemorated in a special way.  Those who participated actively have pensions.  Some of them have not alone reasonably good pensions but good incomes as well.  But the people about whom we are talking are the destitute of the Old IRA, or else they would not qualify for any allowance.  In this year of 1966, the anniversary of the Rising, we should not turn our back on them.  The cost to the State is small but the contribution they and their colleagues made 50 years ago was big indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add to Deputy Corish's remarks concerning the reinvestiagtion of claims.  Every man who got the medal had his case investigated.  Most of those who verified for them have now gone to their reward.  Who is doing the verifying now?  On whom are we depending to take away the miserable little bit of honour given to men who risked their lives that we might be here?  I had occasion to raise a case with the Minister recently concerning a man named William Finn of Doneraile.  He is living outside at the foot of a mountain on a miserable 11 acres of land with a wife and family.  The decision was to give him an increase of £9 per year.  That was from a worker who came up by his bootstraps into a fat job because of the sacrifices made by these people.  I had to take the matter up and have it reinvestigated to get him a few shillings more.  This kind of thing is a disgrace and an insult to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case I had to investigate concerned a man whose name, I was told, was not on the roll submitted.  I knew the lad personally.  He was a member of the Carrigtwohill Company. We used to call him by different names from his actual name.  He was <Col N="589" /> a very young lad, but he was prepared to do his bit every time he was asked and to go anywhere he was sent.  That unfortunate lad was turned down and, I suppose, ordered to return his medal, because his name was not on the original roll submitted by that company. We all know what happened with rolls, the amount of trouble we had in endeavouring to see that the full number of men in any one company were put into the roll.  The Brigade OC of that brigade and I were prepared to verify for that man.  I do not know where the devil they found the verifying officer to say this man was not a member of the IRA for the three months preceding the Truce.  I challenge them to bring that out into the open.  Let us have a look at who those verifying officers are.</P>
    <P>There are not so many of these Old IRA men left.  We all know what little prevented them from being entitled to a service pension instead of the medal without bar, as they call it.  If you took 20 men in the morning for an attack on a barracks and were able to use only eight of them in the actual attack and had the others half a mile out the road on each side to prevent reinforcements arriving, those unfortunate men, though they were in that attack, though they would be at the front of it if anything came, were not entitled to &ldquo;actice service&rdquo; of any name.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long but I should like to make a few comments.  I think Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann on the whole are doing a good job.  I commend the move that they shall jointly be known as Radio Telefís Éireann.  It will cut through a lot of the confusion which has existed in regard to the two bodies.  I also welcome the move, in relation to section 12 of the Principal Act, whereby more promotion will be allowed: red tape should not prevent people of ability <Col N="590" /> from getting promotion.  I congratulate the Minister on that step.  There were fears, at the beginning, that our television service would cost the country a fortune and it is good to know that the very opposite is the case.  Indeed, we should be looked upon as a very backward country today if we had not our own television service.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks about programmes generally.  We should have a lot more programmes with our own actors and actresses.  We hear a lot about good actors and actresses who must go abroad to earn a living because there is not enough work for them here.  This is one field where we could give them more work and also provide more work for our playwrights.  They could take over from a lot of this so-called entertainment which is not of a very high grade. Some imported entertainment may be all right and I believe is all right, if it has educational value, but some of it is of a very low standard.</P>
      <P>A few short months ago, we saw a certain type of play depicting the stage Irishman.  There was the ordinary country boy who went across the Channel to earn a living and who fell into bad company.  All the time, he is held up as a &ldquo;gom&rdquo; Irishman.  We know that that type of thing is shown on films but to have it shown on Telefis Éireann is another matter.</P>
      <P>This year, the 50th Anniversary of the Rising, Radio Telefís Éireann can play a big part in honouring that occasion.  I am glad to hear that all concerned are doing their utmost to ensure a proper image of the time and I wish that venture every success.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we hear references to the accents of announcers and it may be that somebody has an accent that has not a great lot of the brogue about it. I have in mind one or two good announcers who are engaged mostly on advertising.  I could guarantee that the owners of these accents are good Irishmen but, even if they have not a real broque, I consider that they are worth their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telefis Eireann runs plays depicting rural life in Ireland.  The series &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; is said to reflect the life of our agricultural community, but I doubt it.  If one goes through the <Col N="591" /> country, one will not find many farmers or farm labourers as well dressed as the people who appear in that series.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Telefís Feirme&rdquo; gives the facts and figures of farming.  It is very educational for the rising generation.  I hope it will continue along its present lines and I wish the programme luck.</P>
    <P>Another feature is &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;. I do not think any great film star has emerged from it yet.  We welcome this feature.  We are not a bit afraid to have a debate but frequently those in the hall where it is being recorded and those viewing the programme may get a wrong impression.  Time is limited. Whoever is in charge of the show is bound to take as many questions as possible.  Then, all of a sudden, the feature is brought to a halt, just when somebody wants to answer, but he is cut off.  That sort of thing has happened more than once.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some quarters that we should have longer programmes.  Any programme throughout the day should be confined to the schools.  What percentage of our population wants a television service all day&mdash;only a very small percentage. Furthermore, it would cost a great amount of money.  I cannot see that it would be useful.  Who would be able to view during the day?  The man would be working and his wife at home would be busy doing the chores. The farmer would be in the fields. Only about three per cent of what I might describe as the affluent society would be able to view television during the day and the country would have to pay a large sum for it.</P>
    <P>Some people want Telefís Éireann to lengthen the children's programmes in the afternoon.  That is something about which we must be careful. Children go to school and are confined, maybe in a stuffy room, for some hours.  When they get home after school closes at 3 o'clock, they must do their homework.  The next thing is that the television set is turned on and they watch it for a couple of hours.  Any child who is properly reared is out in the open playing games and roaming around.  I think the afternoon television programme starts quite early enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Generally, we give a fairly good radio and television service to our community.  The reception in some areas, especially in my county of Cork, is not all we should like it to be.  There are areas where reception is very poor indeed.  I was told lately that this matter is being looked into and I hope that this is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because the field has been very well covered.  One thing that has emerged from the discussion is that a lot of Deputies are not aware of the on-off switch on their television set.  If they were, they would not make complaints about various types of programmes and about having to look at certain items because, in fact, they do not have to look at them.  In my area of Meath, we are lucky that, for the £5 we pay for our television licence, we can view programmes on three different channels.  Even so, we find we can do without television for a while.  One does not have to turn on the set the moment programmes start and keep it going until the station closes down.  The biggest complaint in this country about television is that there seems to be compulsive viewing. There seems to be the feeling that if the set is not on in the house, there must be something wrong.</P>
      <P>I consider that Telefís Éireann are doing a reasonably good job.  This talk about all the canned nonsense they show is, to my mind, overcriticism. It would cost an awful lot of money to have a high proportion of live programmes.  If we want to have live programmes all the time, why do we not say so and make provision to pay for them?  As things are, Telefís Éireann are doing a reasonably good job.  All of the canned stuff they show is not good but the same can be said of other stations also and it does not mean that the station itself is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put his finger on it when he pointed out that the first function of a television or radio station is to entertain.  If we want real live drama, then we can find it every day in the country in which we live.  Many people seem to forget that a little nonsense now and then is relished by the <Col N="593" /> wisest men is an attitude we should have to television.  At least, it breaks the tedium of ordinary life and takes one's mind off the things which people, particularly politicians, meet with all the time.  That is what those stations are doing and they are, therefore, fulfilling their function.</P>
    <P>A comment about Radio Telefís Éireann news programmes is that they follow too rigidly the news patterns of British stations.  Apart from the world headlines, which must be given, there would be greater interest amongst Irish people if our stations paid more attention to local news.  If they did so, there would be greater interest amongst the Irish people.  I know most people listening to the 1.30 p.m. news on Radio Éireann prefer to wait until the end and hear what is happening around the country.  That is a point which might be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I believe also that Telefís Éireann are doing a tremendous job with regard to their outdoor programmes. Their sporting programmes compare more than favourably with those in other countries, but that does not exclude wrestling on UTV on a Saturday afternoon.  I agree with the last Deputy who has spoken about the fact that many people would not be able to watch television if it was on all day; they would not have either the time or inclination to do so.  But I think an effort should be made to have earlier opening of Telefís Éireann on Saturday because do not forget most people turn on UTV or BBC on Saturday afternoon when they can get it.  If Telefís Éireann could open at an earlier hour on Saturday, they would be doing a good job.  That should not cost such an awful lot of money.</P>
    <P>Another comment made here was the objection by many viewers to the continuous interruptions in television programmes for the commercials.  Now I commented here&mdash;and many people say here&mdash;that sometimes the commercial may be better than the programme but, if one sits down to watch a programme, there is nothing so annoying as, just at an important part of that programme, its interruption for a commercial. The ITV or UTV stations do not do it to the same extent.  The <Col N="594" /> result is one finds many people switching from a good programme on Telefís Éireann to a not so good programme on one of the other stations because of the fact that they do not get so many irritating breaks in transmission.</P>
    <P>Something else was referred to here on which I should like to make a comment, that is, this question of the canned applause.  There is nothing so annoying, particularly on the radio programmes.  Many people have a radio in their car and driving along they listen to it.  I ask any Deputy to deny that, while he cannot hear what is being spoken on the set, the moment the applause starts, it blows him out of the place.  I think an effort should be made to cut down on this stupid thing.  It may be just a way of covering a certain amount of time but, all in all, it is stupid.</P>
    <P>The question of political broadcasts has been mentioned.  All of us, being politicians, will watch political broadcasts, either from this country or any other country, when we can.  The broadcasts here have been good, bad, and indifferent.  Some of them have been going on a long time.  There is one thing about &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;, that is, it has separated the men from the boys.  People who have been sailing into this House on their father's or grandfather's laurels have had to stand up and talk for themselves.  These people have had to give some kind of opinion on &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe so, but it is true that at least it has proved to the people who come and sit in the Gallery here and find that Deputies who do not speak in this House can speak; they are not dumb and, when it comes to that programme, they have to talk.  If it did nothing else, it did that.  It is rather a pity that this programme is drawing to a close because had it been continuing longer it would have been possible to improve the programme as it went along by changes here and there and, thus, make it a far more interesting programme.  What will replace it I do not know.  While <Col N="595" /> people have an objection to bringing television cameras into this House, at least, it might fill the benches.  We had a discussion here earlier on the Old IRA pensions, and this country will be filled with people shouting about 1916; yet we could only get half a dozen Deputies to sit in this House while that debate was going on.  If we could have had television cameras in here while that discussion was going on, we should, at least, have had full benches.</P>
      <P>The manner in which political discussions are debated by the professional newsmen has been mentioned here.  I think they are not doing a bad job.  I am rather interested in one programme which I have a great regard for, that is, the one generally referred to as &ldquo;The Hurler on the Ditch&rdquo;.  The only thing about that was they were not inclined to discuss what was said in the House here; they now discuss what they themselves say, which makes a change anyway, and maybe it is more intelligent than what is being said in the House.</P>
      <P>I am rather pleased it has been decided to run the station as one station and that a long name has been specified for the two.  It is hard enough to pronounce it as it is without adding to it.  It is not right that we should have a balance sheet produced each year showing Telefís Éireann making money and Radio Éireann losing money.</P>

      <P>We will see how that goes.  I think it would be a much better idea if we had one balance sheet covering all.  After all, there is the question of £5 covering the television set and the radio set and the whole point of this Bill is to give permission for the transfer of that money to the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should consider the question of the radio and television licences.  At present, if one has a television set and a radio set, a £5 licence covers both&mdash;they are in the same building.  But, if you have a radio in a car, it is in another building, and you must have another licence <Col N="596" /> for that.  The Minister should reconsider that the houseowner, who takes out a joint television and radio licence, should not have to take out another one for the radio he has in his car.</P>

      <P>The second thing I should like to suggest is that there would be specially installed in Telefís Éireann a sheep shears for those hairy animals whose only justification for appearing on television would appear to be the fact that they have hair hanging over their eyes and wear whiskers.  I would suggest that they be shorn before being shown.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I hate having to mention.  I wonder who in Telefís Éireann was responsible for the play that was shown dealing with the life of Charles Stewart Parnell.  It was the most disgusting, disgraceful thing that ever appeared in connection with a great Irishman who was known as the uncrowned king of Ireland.  It is abhorrent to me that nothing else could be depicted of that man's life but one disgraceful incident whereby the young people of today could judge a great Irishman who did great work for this nation.  It was a disgrace.  I know what I would do with the person responsible for that production.  If we cannot say anything good of the dead, let us not vilify them in the manner in which Parnell was vilified in that play screened by Telefís Éireann.</P>

    <P>If we have not anything but third-rate Yankee murder trials to screen on Telefís Éireann, let us not show anything at all.  There are many incidents in Irish history that could be televised and that would be an education <Col N="597" /> for the youth of the country. There are many good Irish plays that could be televised successfully, rather than the third-rate Yankee slang that the youngsters are picking up so aptly.</P>
    <P>Again, I would suggest that the Minister should inquire as to who was responsible for the play about Charles Stewart Parnell shown by Telefís Éireann.  If I could get my hands on him, I would tear the windpipe out of him.  Whoever was responsible should be kicked out.  If we have not anything good to say of a man who was known as the uncrowned king of Ireland, let us not vilify his memory in the manner in which it was vilified in that play which was shown for our alleged benefit and, moryah, education.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the shears for the teddy-boys.</P>

      <P>Telefís Éireann is a young enterprise and therefore criticism of it should be helpful and constructive and that is the kind of criticism which I propose briefly to offer here this evening.</P>
      <P>Since its inception the presentation and mechanical management of Telefís Éireann have been something of which we can be reasonably proud.  Its engineers are doing an extremely good job, in spite of the fact that they did some sort of small messing up around my home country of Belmullet last week in connection with a new booster from Achill, but that has been righted by a very prompt reaction to a prompt complaint.  If other Departments reacted as swiftly to a complaint as Telefís Éireann did on that occasion last week, there would be far less grumbling than there is.</P>
      <P>There are some Telefís Éireann programmes comprising canned material of which I do not approve in full but perhaps there is some reason of expense for it.  Telefís Éireann are probably doing their best to get material of that kind in order to avoid rather costly live appearances because Telefís Éireann, like television generally in every country, has jacked itself up salary-wise to Hollywood standards.  The salaries are very much higher than in any other walk of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the <Col N="598" /> nature study programme where the drawings are done simultaneously.  It is an excellent programme, to which longer time could be given.  Not alone does it incorporate the wild life of the country but it makes a contribution towards geographical knowledge and is also educational from the point of view of children interested in nature study.</P>
    <P>Although it was on UTV for a considerable period, I am glad that Telefís Éireann is now running the &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; series.  &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; is probably one of the nicest programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I like Lassie on television.  The news presentation is good, although there are times when I am told by my supporters that the Government people are getting more than their share.  Be that as it may, I think the Telefís Éireann authorities do their best to make the presentation as impartial as possible.  That may not be so of certain people who have to present things from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that politically there could be more use made of television.  Deputies and Ministers should be brought on live much more often and grilled by competent interviewers. I should like to see the Taoiseach and any of his Ministers or <Col N="599" /> Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Corish subjected to strong, serious questioning such as British Ministers and even the President of the United States have to submit to from time to time.  That is the real way to get things across.  I do not think it is fair to political correspondents of daily papers that they should have to try to set the tone politically for us.  They have enough to do without having to try to give things a slant.  They should give their own views.  By and large, they are doing their best, but I do not think that their best gives the view to the nation that it should get.</P>
      <P>I support the view expressed by Deputy Tully that, if one is paying a £5 licence fee for one's household reception for television and sound, one should not have to pay extra for a radio in one's car.  Cars are so common and radios are so common&mdash;I do not like them personally&mdash;that this is all part of a family scheme and I see no reason why a family should have to pay extra if they want to go sightseeing in the country and take their sound programme with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture on Telefís Éireann has improved considerably since the beginning. That was to be expected because every beginning is weak.  I am very pleased at the way in which faults have been either corrected or eradicated altogether from the presentations. There are times when one hears all kinds of criticism about the way in which television is used&mdash;Deputy Corry and the long-haired men.  You will always have people objecting to things like that.  Long hair is part of our life at the present time.  I do not think long hair any more objectionable than the regulation short skirt appearing on television.  We will always have that kind of thing, but, and this is particularly true in relation to live shows, the producers and promoters should be more careful about the people they select.  They should be educated people. They should be representative.  They should not make dreadful mistakes in pronunciation, like someone I heard recently pronouncing epitome &ldquo;eppi-tome&rdquo;. <Col N="600" /> If people are paid £10 per night, or whatever it is, the least one would expect is that they would pronounce the particular words they use correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  These are things that should be kept in mind.  By and large, I am quite satisfied with the work being done by Telefís Éireann. Eventually these grounds for criticism, be they justified or not, will disappear. So far as political presentation is concerned, television being such an important medium of mass communication, it is vitally important that it should be absolutely independent of the Government of the day or of any other pressures, because Governments are not the only pressures that operate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish them well.  May they continue along the good lines on which they are proceeding, taking note of criticism, particularly when that criticism is of a constructive nature, and trying to make the whole enterprise as presentable as possible and, side by side with that, acceptable as an independent presentation to the majority of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to think this debate has done some good, but, if the Minister replies in the way his predecessors have done in the past, then it will have been in vain.  Were I to believe that the board of directors of Telefís and Radio Éireann take any interest in what is said here, I should consider the debate worth while. Since, however, Telefís and Radio Éireann have been handed over to separate bodies, so to speak, nobody has had any idea from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether or not he is satisfied with the type of programme we get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, he has a legal responsibility in this matter.  He is charged under a particular section of the Act with responsibility for ensuring that Telefís and Radio Éireann are run in accordance with national aspirations, national culture, and so on.  I have never yet heard a Minister say what <Col N="601" /> he thought of the programmes.  I appreciate that in this matter he can only talk, like the rest of us here, as an individual, but he should tell us in rough outline, at least, of a discussion which, I am sure, he must have had with the Director General of Telefís Éireann and his co-directors.</P>
    <P>Different Deputies have criticised different programmes.  A former Deputy, Mr. Anthony Barry, said that, if one wanted to please the Deputies of Dáil Éireann, one would need 144 television stations.  However, this is the only voice on behalf of the public in relation to a service for which they are paying.  It is similar, I suppose, to other semi-State bodies: whilst we may talk all we like, our views can have no real effect.  Television presentation and entertainment from Radio Éireann are not a cause of any political wrangling or political controversy, but I think the views of the ordinary people ought to be known and the only way they can express those views is through Deputies in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I said on one occasion that if someone complains to me about a programme, I believe it is my duty to convey to those in authority what public opinion is because that is what we are paid for.  From that point of view, I think it would be a good thing if the Minister in this debate would give us an idea of what the view of the Director General and the board of directors is in all this matter.</P>
    <P>This may be an encouraging discussion for the Minister and for those in charge of Telefís and Radio Éireann, because, whilst in other years we have had pretty severe criticism of certain programmes and of radio and television generally, there seems now to be an acknowledgment of the fact that both Telefís and Radio Éireann are doing a pretty good job.  It is unfair, and many unfortunately fall into the trap, to compare Telefís and Radio Éireann with the corporations in Britain.  Deputy Tully is correct when he says that the type of presentation we have from both Telefís and Radio Éireann compares very favourably with others.  That is a tremendous achievement, especially when we have regard to our limited funds from <Col N="602" /> licence money and advertising.</P>
    <P>Exception has been taken to the frequency of the advertisements.  I do not think anyone suggested they should be cut down in number; if they were cut down, revenue would likewise be reduced.  To have advertising at the beginning of a half-hour programme and spend twice the time on advertising instead of interrupting half-hour programmes after a quarter of an hour would be a little more acceptable.  They must be gratified with the advertisements they are getting.  The revenue must be considerable, and that in itself demonstrates the popularity of Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is the added fact that while some of us on the east coast and in Dublin and up towards the north can receive BBC and UTV, the majority of the country still depends on Telefís Éireann, but for the likes of Deputy Tully and myself, who have a choice of stations, we recognise that Telefís Éireann is as good as the other two. It has its limitations.  I do not know anything about the technical side of the business but it does appear to me that the sound in Telefís Éireann is inferior to the sound on Independent Television or the BBC.  That is no reflection on anybody, particularly those who are employed there, but the picture can be somewhat distorted, especially background pictures.  I suspect that because the station is only five years in operation, No. 1, they have not got 100 per cent technique, and, No. 2, they may not have the efficient and up-to-date equipment that I am sure is available both to the BBC and ITV.</P>
    <P>We could all comment on the various programmes and we could differ to 144 degrees, the number of us who are in Dáil Éireann, but it is good that we should comment on the programmes. Despite all the TAM ratings &mdash;how they do this I do not know; I do not think they can be very reliable &mdash;the voice of the people through the public representatives is best able to express the viewpoint of the public.</P>
    <P>Any of us of a certain age will be prone to criticise the teenage group. We can be very unfair.  When we criticise <Col N="603" /> these young people who are very keen on pop music, we, of my generation, forget how we used to rave about Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee and our parents thought we were crazy, that we were ignorant boors who did not have a clue about good music.  Now we are on the other side of the fence and we cannot understand the viewpoint of the people who want a certain type of music which is not alone pop but pep.  I am sure people were very critical when hair oil was first used. Now there are critics of those who want to let their hair grow long.  I do not mind if they let their hair grow long, nor do I think we should advocate the introduction of a shears.  All we would ask of those who wear long hair and beards is that they would wash them now and again.</P>
    <P>I do not blame Telefís Éireann for the amount of time they devote to this pop music.  Like many of my colleagues, I have not the opportunity of looking at all the programmes, but as far as I can see, there is not an inordinate amount of time devoted to this type of music.  However, there is far too little time given to better music.  We all have to go through the phase of the Beatles, Rudy Vallee and Bing Crosby, and after a few years we graduate to light music, light opera, and even further.  The objection I have to Radio Telefís Éireann, and even to the BBC, is that there does not seem to be any attempt to bridge that gap.  Another fact is that Radio Éireann is a sound station and is doing something in this regard; I believe it is doing less than it did but Telefís Éireann is doing absolutely nothing to get from the pop music to another type of music.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann must, I am afraid, continue to have canned programmes, the cowboy films, detective films, adventure stories, and so on.  I suppose they get these films through a certain agency, maybe for £20 or £25, to do a half-hour show.  To present a home-produced programme would cost £200 or £250 and Telefís Éireann have not got that sort of money.  I think the hours are as much as one could expect and any increase in showing <Col N="604" /> time as far as Telefís Éireann are concerned should be devoted to education.</P>
    <P>A tribute has been paid to Telefís Éireann for their sports coverage.  In my opinion it is not a deserved one. They could do a little more.  It is true that they do an admirable job in regard to the All-Ireland Football Final, the Hurling Final and the international rugby matches, and so on, but they could use Saturday afternoon to greater advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at one, so. This country has a great reputation for horses and horse racing but Telefís Éireann give far too little coverage to it.  They should utilise Saturday afternoon to better effect.  In regard to the political broadcasts, the &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; programme is a bit staid and stilted.  Maybe that is because most of us who appear on that programme are there for the first time and there is a certain amount of terror associated with it.  It looks too school-boyish to have four public representatives behind a kind of desk up on a platform being questioned by John Skehan, who is extremely good at the job but who appears like a schoolmaster examining them.  It is true he is putting questions from the floor, but I do agree with Deputy Tully or Deputy O'Leary&mdash;I do not know which of them it was&mdash;that the questions are too small and too detailed for representatives of Dáil Éireann. Some questions will be asked in respect of a particular area in which the Deputy himself is living.  The questions should be of broader, national interest rather than the puny questions selected by the person in charge of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tully in regard to the programme, &ldquo;The Hurler on the Ditch&rdquo;, which I hope will be continued, that the participants should devote their discussion to what was said rather than to some particular subject or an aspect of the subject that was discussed in Dáil Éireann and giving their own opinions.  I have the <Col N="605" /> greatest respect for these &ldquo;Hurlers on the Ditch&rdquo;.  They have demonstrated over the years that as political correspondents, they are second to none. They certainly know how to write and I would say their comments are objective and, as far as my Party are concerned, in the main, I would say they are unbiased.</P>
    <P>The people have come to regard &ldquo;Hurler on the Ditch&rdquo; as a round-up, a summing up of what happens in Parliament.  I should like to remind the five of them that, though they are political correspondents, what the people are concerned with, in the main, is what their representatives are doing.  Though we appreciate bouquets, we do not mind criticism and what the people want to know is who in Dáil Éireann said what and how he said it. The programme has been a very useful contribution not only to television out to the public life of the country. One of the things we have always grumbled about is lack of interest in politics.  These political broadcasts have not only given the people an interest is politics but also in the policies of the various Parties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not the appropriate occasion for this type of debate.  Nevertheless, I suggest the Minister should take a broad view of the operation of Telefís Éireann.  I do not think there will be any controversy about it.  All the information he requires he can get from the Director General.  Generally speaking, the majority of Deputies believe that Telefís Éireann are doing a reasonably good job and that those responsible should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. All I shall do is add my voice to the tributes already paid to Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  It must be remembered that Telefís Éireann must cater for all tastes and all kinds of people. It is a very difficult task and we should not be too anxious to criticise if our own peculiar tastes are not satisfied. We are not the best group of people to go into any great detail in discussing the programmes because, due to the type of work we do, we are not in a position to be at home as often as we should like.</P>

      <P>We meet a considerable number of people, in our work and otherwise, and we hear a lot of comment, and I should like to say that in general the programmes provided are accepted as being very good.  Many people have told me they would welcome more programmes of educational value such as &ldquo;Telefís Feirme&rdquo;, &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo; and programmes of that nature.  &ldquo;Telefís Feirme&rdquo; is of great educational value to the farming community. I have no doubt that as a result of this programme, production in agriculture will be stepped up, a very desirable feature.  &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo; is also very interesting and helps to give people in urban areas a better understanding of the work and the difficulties of their brothers in rural parts. This, too, is very desirable.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers said they wished Telefís Éireann would commence broadcasting at an earlier hour and suggested they should begin at 4 p.m. with children's programmes.  As the father of a family, I do not agree. When children arrive home from school, they must get through their homework and it would be altogether wrong to put on a children's programme at such an hour.  It would only interfere with their studies and for that reason I think Telefís Éireann are on the air sufficiently early.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any other comment I wish to make except to say that Telefís Éireann are worthy of any support we can give them, if only for the pleasure the programmes bring to people confined to their homes, either through old age or illness.  That is a wonderful thing.  People living in remote areas would also enjoy the programmes but many of them suffer from lack of electricity and therefore cannot avail of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate but there are one or two points of which I should like the Minister to take note.  Some Deputies have praised some of the programmes; some Deputies have said such a programme should not be broadcast or that another programme should replace it.  Coming from the <Col N="607" /> Fíor-Ghaeltacht, I feel very strongly that 15 minutes, one item a week, is too short a time to give to our native language.  Certainly, anybody who watches &ldquo;Labhair Gaeilge Linn&rdquo;, presented by Eoin Ó Súilleabháin must be proud of it.  We should have more such programmes or we should extend the time of that programme.  Eoin Ó Súilleabháin is doing a very good job, particularly for people who are new to the language.  The Irish used is very plain and easy to follow.  We hear people on all sides talking about that programme.</P>
      <P>That is all right for people who can get a good picture from Telefís Éireann.  In my part of the country, there are the mountains, the lakes and the sea, and two-thirds of the time we cannot get a picture, though we pay our licences just as they do beside the booster stations.  I think that is wrong and I hope the Board can see their way to erect a booster station on one of the Twelve Pins.  Some months ago I asked the Minister what the Board were doing about it and I got the answer that a booster station was being provided on Curraun Hill.  I do not know if the Minister realises how far away Curraun Hill is from my area, how the mountains and the lakes and the sea intervene.  I was in a house on Sunday evening last and the Curraun Hill booster had no effect whatsoever on the picture.  The people there assured me the reception had been like that since the booster was erected.  I suggest that officials of the authority visit these houses themselves and see the position.  I feel very strongly that a booster station should be erected on one of the Twelve Pins.  At times when we turn on Telefís Éireann, we get a bull fight from Spain.</P>

      <P>Often it may be worth more than a fiver but if we are paying for Telefís Éireann, we should have reception from it.  Deputy Corish objected to the frequency with which advertisements interrupt programmes.  I agree there should not be so many advertisements coming into the middle <Col N="608" /> of programmes.  Perhaps they could give more of them before the programmes begin.  I again urge the Minister to get authority to erect a booster station on one of the Twelve Pins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to reply to this debate, I have the feeling that I am not called on to reply to any very serious criticism.  As Deputy Corish has said, the Minister should feel very proud at the tone of the debate.  I think every one of the 14 or so speakers started off by saying that on the whole, relatively speaking, it was not a bad medium and it had made considerable progress and so forth.  I feel I should almost start off criticising the medium myself in case the Authority would become so complacent that they would think they had nothing to worry about in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to start off, first, by referring to one of the last speakers if the first speaker, for the moment, will forgive me, because he seemed to think that no Minister had expressed an opinion.  I have during my short time here on a number of occasions expressed my opinion in regard to television and radio.  That can only be a personal opinion except in so far as I feel obliged by the directives given in the Act to ensure that the medium progresses along those lines.  This is exactly what I have been trying to say on other occasions when the opportunity presented itself in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, under section 31, has a directive to compel Telefís Éireann to take off a particular programme.  That is only a safety clause, or section, which would be used only in the most extreme circumstances.  The fact remains that while the Authority has, should have, and is given a free hand in the preparation of programme matter it is only natural that the Minister should take a fairly keen interest in the overall success or otherwise of the medium over the year or over a long term.  It is only, in so far as I felt it was not living up to its obligations under the Act, over a protracted period that I would be obliged to seriously interfere with anything I did not feel was in <Col N="609" /> accordance with what is imposed on the Authority by the Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say that Telefís Éireann since its inception has been a success.  One has only to think of the speeches made at the time it was inaugurated and of the great deal of speculation and doubt as to whether it would be able to pay its way and whether it would be the success that everybody hoped it would be.  Nobody could quite visualise, it being a new medium, how it was likely to turn out.  We would not have been surprised if I had to come into the House after its five years of operating, looking for a heavy subsidy to keep the medium going in the years ahead.  This is something which many people felt at the beginning might have happened because the whole thing was an innovation so far as we were concerned.  The fact that it has succeeded in going ahead and giving good entertainment to a great many people is, in the first instance, a matter in regard to which any Minister can be entirely proud and happy.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question with regard to the Minister's comments and what Deputy Corish said about consultation with the Authority's director and so on, I should like to say that those are not the only people I should like to consult.  I would rather listen to a cross-section of the public and responsible people who view from time to time about what they think, what the Government think from time to time and the people who brought the Act into force.</P>
    <P>No person during the debate mentioned section 17.  This is the section which I like to keep continuously in mind and it is the section which I should like to implore the members of the Authority also to keep constantly in mind.  It says:</P>
    <P>In performing its function the Authority shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>This is an obligation imposed on the Authority and it is one which we cannot lose sight of.  I may have <Col N="610" /> certain views which may not entirely conform with what others have in regard to the interpretation or development of the medium in accordance with that section but they are views which are supported by a fairly wide section of the community and a very large school of thought in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe television and sound broadcasting should gradually, but definitely, develop a distinctive national character, use the Irish language on suitable occasions and, progressively, give more and more time to it.  This is not always adhered to but I am satisfied that that spirit is growing. A good deal was said here about bilingualism in programmes and I like the people who use the national language whenever the occasion presents itself to do so even in the context of a programme that may have nothing whatever to do with it.  It is not entirely the language alone one visualises. There is also the type of programme. We have got a few that are racy of the soil, the type of programme in accord with our Irish heritage, our Irish culture and our way of life generally without being stage Irish at the same time.  Those things can be done and be highly entertaining, even educational and informative.</P>
    <P>If the House could give a few million pounds and I could cast aside all commercials and put a television station to entertain around the clock, with the most beautiful programmes that everybody could desire, then we could look forward to having something that would please most of the people, but not all of them.  Remember, we must not forget the fact that we have a television service at all is due to the manner in which it is run on a commercial basis.  That brings me to the points made by most of the speakers.</P>
    <P>Most of the speakers mentioned advertising.  The Minister must approve of the time allocated to advertising. It is approximately 10 per cent of the time used for broadcasting and not more than six minutes per hour.  During the actual time of broadcasting the advertising must not be unduly long. I think the Authority try to ensure <Col N="611" /> that in the main the advertising is bright and that it conforms to good viewing, as far as it is possible to do that.  It is asking the Authority to do something which would be almost equivalent to telling them not to do it at all if we ask them to put advertising on at a time when it would not interrupt the actual programme, to have all the advertisements in the middle of the day and the programmes at night, but the people who pay for the advertisements, and pay dearly for them, expect to get the best viewing time.  If we are to capture the best priced and the best quality advertisements, I am afraid the Authority must give them good viewing time, time when most people are viewing.  We cannot brush them aside and give them any old time.</P>
    <P>Dealing with advertising, I should say that on the last occasion when an adjustment of the rates for advertising was due the Government intervened and refused to allow the rates to be adjusted upwards as they were due to be adjusted.  This is something that must be re-examined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people who advertise have to sell goods and they have a happy knack of passing on costs to the consumer.  It is not a question of increasing prices.  It is not a question of working out the rate card whereby the cost of advertising is increased in accordance with the set count.  At the moment we have around 300,000 sets in the country, and we are charging the same as we were last year when the number was considerably less.  This readjustment will have to take place, and I hope Deputies will understand that it is not an increase in price.  It is a progressive rate which is charged, and on which the Authority have to purchase when they are buying programme matter.  It is the rate which governs the price.</P>

      <P>Reference was made by a number of speakers to the problem of cigarette advertising.  No decision has been taken to preclude the advertising of cigarette smoking, or any type of smoking.  There is a code to which the advertisers are expected to conform, and to which they do conform.  A decision to do as they did in England, to cut out cigarette advertising entirely, would be a very big step which in my opinion would have to be taken in conjunction with the Department of Health, on a national scale, and the advertising of cigarettes would have to be entirely precluded from any medium, the national newspapers, magazines, and any other form of advertising.  This they did not do in England.  Cigarette advertising is precluded in England but the advertisers can use any other medium, so far as I know, which only means that they concentrate further and spend the extra money on other media of advertising.</P>
      <P>If cigarettes are advertised on our television it does not mean that this House, or the Government, or the Authority, are recommending to the people that they must use everything advertised.  This is a medium of advertising.  We are not asking the people to smoke cigarettes, any more than we are asking them to use a particular detergent to wash their shirts. The fact is that as of now a decision to ban cigarette advertising has not been taken, and I do not see any point in taking it in respect of one medium alone and leaving out the others.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the merging of sound radio and television.  This Bill does not denote any further merger of the two media.  It is merely simplifying the name by which they are known.  I hope we will use the abbreviated form of the initials, RTE.  The use of Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann is rather confusing and we are changing it to Radio Telefís Éireann.  It does not denote any further merger between the two.  The two are under one authority and accounts are presented in the same way too.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary, who was the next speaker, in common with many other Deputies, referred to &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;. One would expect that Deputies would be interested in a programme in which they themselves are involved.  Most people seem to think this programme should be continued.  Personally I do not think there is much entertainment value in it but it certainly has a good viewing public.  Talking about &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;, we must remember that no matter what Government are in power, in a symposium or a debate of this kind the Government must be prepared to be on the defensive.  In matters like this there are some complaints&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a simple matter.  Many Deputies suggested that there should be more broadcasting time and I think most of them had television in mind.  We would all like to see sound radio broadcasting time extended and I hope we will get around to extending it in the not too distant future, thus giving the housewife a <Col N="615" /> fuller day's broadcasting.  I should like if this could be synchronised with the coming into effect of VHF when many areas which are not getting a pure reception at the moment will be in a position to get better reception.</P>

In Denmark, for 29 hours of programmes per week the combined fee is £7 5s. and they have a set count of 1,020,000.

      <P>Deputy Briscoe and a few other Deputies referred to a developing personality cult on television. That, again, is something that can be looked at from two points of view.  Recently, the BBC decided to prevent people from building up a personal image; but others take the view that one must build up a good image to be good, the same as some of the outstanding journalists we know in other countries.  It is only by constant contact and work that they ultimately become known as able and capable people.  By and large, the people working on Irish television and radio have <Col N="619" /> come on well.  If at times they feel a little important, perhaps a bit of a superiority complex is no harm.  In any event, I do not think we have reached the stage where personality cult is a problem here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne was very complimentary but was very generous in the type of programmes he would like to have.  In this he was expressing the minds of us all.  He asked for more time for agriculture, health, hygiene, children's programmes.  But the important thing to remember is this: we would all like more programmes of one sort or another but, as many speakers pointed out, it is a question of £ s. d. Because of economics, the Authority must have, as Deputy Dillon said, a measure of celluloid.  In that context it would be no harm to give the House a comparison of the figures of every-day costs based on hours of operation of the station.  Telefís Éireann are spending approximately £845 per hour on production and the BBC are spending approximately £4,700 per hour.  Anybody who attempts to compare the two stations must take into account the level of the finances available to Telefís Éireann for producing programmes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon covered a good many matters, many of which I have already touched on.  He was complimentary and made allowances for the short-comings any station must have.  He paid tribute to the progress made.  He repeated his warning of last year with regard to political broadcasts.</P>

I think the best measure of the impartiality of both radio and television is the fact that I get complaints from my people&mdash;others say they get complaints from theirs&mdash;with regard to who is getting most of what.  As Ministers of State, our Ministers are bound to appear on television from time to time.

      <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the cost of the Orchestra being borne by the sound radio expense account.  For the moment I can think of no better way of paying for the national orchestra unless we have a direct State subsidy.  We have given a fair amount of financial assistance to Telefís Éireann to set it up in the first instance.  While they are paying interest, they have not used all the repayable advances available to them. I suppose they are doing us a good service by carrying what we know is a very heavy load.  Whether it is shown in equal parts by the accounts of television and radio or entirely by one is immaterial, although it may give an incorrect picture of the returns from sound broadcasting.  However, most people are aware of how the Orchestra is paid for.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would look at the annual report, I think he will find that it gives an account of them all.  They are pretty widely dispersed all over the country, south and north, but they have not completely eliminated all the black spots.  I have discussed this matter with the Authority.  They hope to follow up in areas where there will be black spots such as in the case of Deputy Geoghegan who is surrounded by the Twelve Pins.  There are small black spots in respect of which further arrangements will have to be made in order to ensure that the service reaches them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the outset, before Deputy Dillon came in, and perhaps I should repeat it, that the television Authority are responsible for the programming with as little interference as possible by me unless, on the overall, I feel some change should be effected in a particular direction <Col N="622" /> or that they have not lived up to the obligations imposed upon them by the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that some film material will not be up to a standard that will satisfy everybody.  I think Deputy Dillon was anxious to have all films of very good standard brought back or some of the better new films. There can be a certain amount of technical difficulty in this respect.  All films are not available and very often I suppose the Authority have to select the best available.  I am not entirely supposing this because it has been mentioned to me.  We are confined largely to the English-speaking world for films.  Continental films are not always suitable.</P>
      <P>I do not think all the films shown are of the type Deputy Dillon described.  Some quite good films are shown.  Sometimes a film which is not very popular with the grown-ups is quite popular with the young people. As Deputy Dillon mentioned, some of the younger people would not know of Greta Garbo or some of the other outstanding film personalities of the past.</P>

Most Deputies paid tribute to the effort by the Authority to do their work to the best of their ability within the resources available. I should not like the Authority, because there is so much unanimity in regard to the job they are doing, to be lulled into a sense of complacency.  We would always expect that their one desire would be to do better and, above all, to endeavour to present a more distinctive national image.  This is something we are aiming at and I think will succeed in doing.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am not very intelligent: at least, I want to know what it is about.  Examinations are held in the Civil Service from time to time. If you sit for them, you become an established civil servant of the lowest grade and can look forward to permanent employment until the time comes when you are entitled to the customary pension provided in the Civil Service.  If you enter as a temporary civil servant, you do not necessarily come in through the Civil Service Commission at all and you can get to be an established civil servant only through a very exceptional procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision where, in certain circumstances, a Minister may say that So-and-So should be made a permanent civil servant.  Ordinarily what happens is that from time to time confined examinations are held.  That was quite common in the Department of Agriculture, particularly in regard to inspectors in the West.  The Department <Col N="626" /> would hold confined examinations and those people would be entitled to go in for those examinations and graduate to be full-time inspectors in the Department of Agriculture. What I want to know is not whether or not even a driver can be turned into a technician in Radio Éireann; what I want to be clear on is this: are we creating a situation now under which you can get ordinary employment in Telefís Éireann which you have not got as a result of the usual competitive examination associated with permanent employment?  I do not care whether it is a driver or singer or engineer, or who it is.  Are we now giving to the Authority the power, once a person has got in on what ordinarily is understood to be a temporary basis, to elevate him into a permanent established position without passing through the normal machinery through which the ordinary person gets into established service of Telefís Éireann? If we are, I think we are doing a bad thing.  We are opening the back door, which will give rise to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if this is the same procedure as is in his own Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it gives them that opportunity.  If some young person does start on the ground floor and finds that he becomes familiar with the working of a more difficult job within the place, he should be free, in my opinion, to do a limited examination and reach that stage of qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us clarify this. Are we not establishing here an entirely new precedent?  There are the confined examinations of the Civil Service, of which we are all well aware, typified by the inspectors in the congested areas.  We often held confined examinations in the Department of Agriculture so that these inspectors might have an opportunity <Col N="627" /> of graduating up to the category of permanent established inspectors in the Department of Agriculture.  That is a perfectly normal thing because the old congested area men are an acrimonious survival from the past.</P>
      <P>But are we now establishing this principle that if you can get any type of employment in Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann, that Authority can then hold a confined examination&mdash; confined only to those who are already in some form of employment, whether it is a gardener or temporary engineer or prima donna, or anything else&mdash; which will exclude every graduate of a technical school?  It will exclude every graduate of an academy of music and will exclude hundreds of other people who may have got the kind of experience which would equip them for the vacancy in Telefís Éireann outside Telefís Éireann.  Why should we do that?</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if you get your engineering experience in Bolton Street technical school or if you got it in Telefís Éireann and if there is a desirable post going in the Telefís Éireann Authority, then the boys from Bolton Street, from Telefís Éireann or the boy from a Cork technical school should all be allowed to enter and let the best man win.  If you do not watch that, what will happen sooner or later is that allegations will be made.  It will be said: &ldquo;My son went to Bolton Street technical school and I know somebody else whose boy also went there and who put his boy in as a messenger in Telefís Éireann &mdash;they both qualified but, because one was a messenger boy in Telefís Éireann, he could go in for the examination and my lad, who was working side by side with him in Bolton Street, would not be allowed enter for the examination. I cannot understand that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may have one girl who has been singing or performing on Telefís Éireann and she is a fellow-student in the Academy of Music with another girl just as good.  A vacancy arises for the position of violinist or vocalist in the Television Authority.  One girl is allowed to go in because she has been temporarily employed in Telefís Éireann prior to the examination and <Col N="628" /> the pupil sitting beside her in the academy will not be allowed to compete because she has not got in.  I put it to the House that if that is going to happen it must give rise sooner or later to a feeling, justified or unjustified, that there has been a wangle.  Surely, the whole purpose of the examination system ought to be that the child of any citizen would have an equal chance with any other child.  I do not know what the purpose of this is.  What advantage is there in it?  What harm is there in leaving an examination open to all contenders to do the best they can?</P>

Is it proposed, not that somebody who is in for a few weeks or a few months, but somebody who has already given service with the Authority over a pretty lengthy period, should be promoted? Is that the type of person who is in mind?</P>

      <P>Therefore, the singer who goes in for one night is not eligible.  That is number one.  Secondly, will this give an opportunity to people <Col N="629" /> who have not had the opportunity of getting the training to which Deputy Dillon refers and who did not get the educational training because their parents had not got the money and because there are not enough scholarships available to give it to them free, and who are trying to work their way up, as happens in other countries, and which is a good idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Committee Stage.  Deputy Tully is no mean performer when he is engaged in special pleading.  I am putting a simple case. There is a position of a junior engineer, we will say, in the Television Authority. There is an excellent boy who has gone into the Television Authority as a messenger and he has graduated slowly up until eventually he is working in and about that part of the establishment where the engineers work.  As a messenger, his day's work is done at five and he has gone to Bolton Street from seven to nine every night. Side by side with him is sitting a boy who is perhaps working as a messenger boy in Findlater's shop or somewhere else because he was not fortunate enough to get a job as messenger boy in Telefís Éireann, and he also has gone to Bolton Street.  Now, there is an established post in the engineering branch.  Both boys have spent their spare time studying to improve themselves.  But, there is a confined examination and the boy who has been a messenger boy in Findlater's or Switzer's or Brown Thomas or wherever else he works and spent his spare time in Bolton Street is excluded and for no better reason than that he could not get into Telefís Éireann as an unestablished messenger boy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to exclude the boy who went into Telefís Éireann as an unskilled messenger boy.  I want to give him the same chance in the examination as any other boy will get and if he has been as diligent in studying in the technical school as the other boy, then he will get the job.  He has the natural advantage that he is peculiarly familiar with the procedures at Montrose where he has been working.  That is a considerable advantage to him in an examination set by the Authority <Col N="630" /> who are seeking an employee on the established staff of Montrose.  But it is wholly wrong to hold a confined examination for no other reason than that the juniors have gone into Montrose as unskilled employees by one means or another.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House you are doing something wrong here and there is no analogy at all between the case made by Deputy Tully or the case raised by myself of which I have ample knowledge in the Department of Agriculture. There you can see an obvious reason why, if a boy has been working as a boy messenger for a long time in the Post Office and there become vacancies for postmen, it is not unreasonable to say they should get first preference because of their service. Here is an entirely new situation in which you are creating a privileged class of young people and in its creation you are excluding other citizens who ought to be allowed to compete on equal terms and who must be that much better in order to get the post in that they have not had the experience that the unestablished boy has acquired by knocking around Montrose and talking to the permanent staff there and even working with the permanent staff.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to prevent the kind of <i>scandale</i> that may arise, whether Fianna Fáil are in office or we are in office or whoever is in office, of suggesting that pressure was brought to bear on the Authority or anybody in Montrose to let fellows in through the back door.  So long as we are always able to say that there is only one way on to the established staff of the Television Authority and that is through open competitive examination then Dáil Éireann is out of it and, indeed, the Authority is out of it.  They simply say that they took whoever the examination threw up.  But, if you depart from that principle you are creating a privileged class and that is not right and it will give rise to abuses.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself says that this was put up to him by the Authority, that personally he does not give a fiddle-de-dee.  We are the people here in Dáil Éireann who are to establish the standards of public employment <Col N="631" /> and if the Director General has gone wrong here it may be no harm for the Dáil to remind him that forty years' experience has taught us that it is a much better system to have a public examination and the anonymous candidate who proves himself to be best equipped thrown up so that he is the person who will get the established post.</P>
    <P>If you depart from that principle in this minor category you are opening the door to very considerable abuses. I would strongly advise the Minister to drop this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I want to refer to.  There are two weaknesses in Deputy Dillon's argument.  One is: if the position were reversed and the vacancy were in Findlater's, does Deputy Dillon suggest that the boy in Telefís Éireann will be considered?  We all know that in Findlater's or any other private concern people already working in the firm will be considered for promotion and those outside will not be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, if Deputy Dillon wants competitive examination, as he says he is suggesting, it is not the two boys who are working as messengers and going to night school for the purpose of picking up the education that they did not formerly get who will be considered but a different class altogether, a privileged class, who will not be going to that school at all.  That is my argument.  It is the privileged class of people who can afford to get a better education than a messenger boy gets or the labouring class get, who will get the jobs either in Montrose or in any other place in the city.  For that reason the examination which I assume the Minister is talking about is one which will allow those who have started life under a handicap and who have had the intelligence to pick up certain techniques in the job after a period of years, if a vacancy occurs, and they are able to pass the examination to compete and that examination would be confined to those working in the job and those outside would not be allowed to compete.  I do <Col N="632" /> not see anything wrong with that.  I think it is a good idea to include it in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this is to give a man a chance to raise himself by virtue of his experience in a job and earn better pay and transfer into the pensionable section of the Authority. He will do that through the medium of the skill he has achieved in the job.  The fact that he did not pass an examination, perhaps, years before will not be held against him.  The Authority is empowered to raise him in certain circumstances in the ranks. That is something of which, I think, we ought to approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy too well.  Consider the position.  There are in the Department of Agriculture hundreds of unestablished jobs every single one of which is within the absolute gift of the Minister.  That right is widely exercised.  It was frequently put to me when I was Minister for Agriculture that I ought to hold an examination confined to those who were already working in the Department. There are very wide categories of unestablished persons.  When a vacancy occurred for an established post I always insisted that every unestablished person eligible to compete would be informed and that great care would be taken to bring the pending examination to the attention of everybody who might conceivably aspire to the post.  But I insisted that there must be an examination and that the best man must get the job.  I believe that is a sound principle and I believe we are driving a coach and four through it by section 4 of this Bill.  I <Col N="633" /> think we are making a great mistake. In practice, in nine cases out of ten, the category of person Deputy Tully is thinking about will in fact get the job because the experience of working in Montrose, plus the technical skills picked up, will in the vast majority of cases outweigh the merits of those who sit for the examination without any prior experience of the day-to-day administration in Montrose.  But you do assume that those who have gone to the trouble of acquiring superior qualifications are not absolutely excluded from competing and you do ensure&mdash; mark you, the Authority itself had an experience of this&mdash;that doubt can never be raised in the public mind: &ldquo;Ah-ha, so-and-so has got the job as a messenger&rdquo; or in some minor post in Montrose.  &ldquo;What do you think of that?  That fellow's uncle is the Fianna Fáil T.D. in Kildare.&rdquo;&ldquo;How well that fellow came up from Kerry to get the job of gardener in Montrose. His first cousin is the head of the Fianna Fáil cumann in Tralee.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Observe the phrase Deputy Corish employs; as bad as the Board of Works.  I do not want to introduce that to Montrose.  That is all I am asking for; I am asking that an examination should be open to all. That seems to me to be so self-evident as not to require argument.  But I particularly urge on the House not to let us deliberately drive a coach and four through a principle that was established with great difficulty in this country, and that is that merit should prevail.  We all know there are holes punched in that doctrine from time to time one way or another but, when we hear of these things being done, we resent them.  We resent the good fellow being turned down for the fellow who has acquired some kind of pull. Mark you, our people resent that.  But there are too many in the country who believe that that principle operates and anything we can do to make it clear that, so far as lies within our power, it will not be allowed to operate is, in my opinion, a public service.  I say to Deputy Dockrell that not everybody <Col N="634" /> is as high principled as he would have us believe.  The average man believes that pull is powerful and I want to make it quite clear to the average man that, so far as Dáil Éireann can do it, we will ensure that pull will not be a barricade in front of a good man.</P>

Is there not a Department of Finance regulation that she has to be appointed through the labour exchange?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but provision was made for that, too. There was a fellow above in the Castle and we used to telephone him and say: &lsquo;We are applying to the labour exchange in Athenry for the names of three women, one of whom we must appoint as charwoman of Athenry.&rsquo; He telephoned to Athenry and said: &lsquo;Send up the names of any three women you like but see that Mary O'Grady's name is one of them.&rsquo;&rdquo; And right enough, three names would come up: Mary Sweeney, Maria McArdle and Patricia Jones, but Mary Sweeney would get the job.</P>

But the Department of Finance regulations had been observed, that the person had to apply from the labour exchange.  These are the facts of life, of which a decent man like Deputy Dockrell knows nothing.  I learned them painfully.  We are faced with a proposal, and it is not what we intend to do but what is written in this Bill that matters.  There may be an engineering post in Telefís Éireann in the morning and there is some poor devil who just got his examination by the skin of his teeth. He is going around with the toe out of his boot because nobody will employ him as an engineer.  What does he do? He goes out to Monrose and gets a job planting tulip bulbs in the bins outside <Col N="637" /> in the garden.  Three weeks later there is a confined examination for a junior engineer in Montrose, confined to Deputy Tully's anxiety, to those who have worked their way up from the lowest grade of employment in Montrose.</P>

That is crazy and it is wrong.  My sole purpose is to ensure that, if there is a vacancy for permanent established staff in any Government Department, in a semi-State body or State body in this country, it will be open to every person who presents himself for the competition and that there will be no restriction on the entries, so that the best man will get the job.  I advocate that on its merits as a principle.  I advocate it because the alternative is to spread the impression throughout this country that a wangle can be done.  I know of my own experience that wangles were the practice in this country and there is not a Deputy who does not know it now. That kind of thing goes on.  I am seeking to prevent this being sanctioned by a section in this Bill, and if Deputies have any regard for the public service of this State, they ought to support me and reject the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a confined examination and the best temporary postman gets the job, in certain cases <Col N="640" /> but not in all cases.  In the Department of Agriculture there was an anachronistic survival from the old CDB days. The instructors in congested areas were never established.  I got them established when I was Minister for Agriculture.  Up to the time I was appointed to the office for the second time they had never been established and while I was Minister for Agriculture I saw men go out without pensions after 40 years of service.  We deliberately held examinations confined to those men for the post of instructor&mdash;junior inspectors in the Department&mdash;because we wanted to lift them out of the old anachronistic, antiquated system which precluded them from ever getting established so long as they were working in the congested areas.</P>
      <P>That was brought before Dáil Éireann and no apology made for it and it is all cod for Deputy James Tully to be talking about snobbery. Snobbery my foot.  It is corruption I am after.  I could not employ a messenger in the Department of Agriculture, I could not employ a gardener in the Botanic Gardens and if I wanted to go through all the abracadabra of filling the posts I could have consulted the TDs in my Party about what local man they had in mind for the job, and great abuse I often got for not doing it. They are not all angels on either side of the House.  But if I appointed a messenger on my own initiative in the Department of Agriculture and then there emerged a post as a paper-keeper or clerk, an established post in the Department, I put it to the House it would have been wholly wrong for me to hold an examination confined to the personnel in my Department and say no outsider could sit for the post of paper-keeper or junior clerk in the Department of Agriculture.  They all came from the same kind of families and God knows in this country there is damn little room for snobbery.  What the hell have we to snob about?</P>

      <P>My grandfather was put <Col N="641" /> out on the side of the road as an evicted tenant and I am as respectable a man as you will find in this House. I do not think there is any room for snobbery in the country but there is room for corruption and there is room for people against corruption and there is room for doubts in the minds of our people that corruption is possible under our Government, and anything we can do to right that position is good. Deputy James Tully might look around the world and see what corruption is doing in some emergent States in Africa.  I heard him being angry not so very long ago when pointing out that the postmen in County Meath were being treated unfairly.</P>

      <P>It does not matter. When he thought the postmen were treated unfairly he was shocked that corruption could occur in this country. I say it would have been wrong if I, as Minister for Agriculture, had power to do what we can authorise the Television Authority to do in section 4 of the Bill.  The Minister says he does not think it is necessary.  He was asked to put it in and he stuck it in because he was asked.  His mind never adverted to the possibility of any question of principle being established&mdash;that it was only an administrative convenience and that he was glad to oblige the Director General with it. We are experienced in the life of this country and the Director of Telefís Éireann is not.  What may appear to him to be a simple administrative convenience can appear to us, who are experienced in public life&mdash;let us remember it is we who were appointed by the people to run the country, not the Director General of Telefís Éireann &mdash;to be something different altogether. We have a special type of experience in this House and I think we ought to say to the Director General: &ldquo;We understand your anxiety to simplify your administration but we do not think this is a prudent simplification&rdquo;. It is easy to leap on Deputy Briscoe because Deputy Briscoe has shown more moral courage than he ought to have done in this case.</P>

      <P>If there is to be criticism let it come from this side of the House. I fully understand that the Director General may seek this power for what appears to him to be a purely administrative convenience.  I put it to every experienced Deputy that there is a lot more in this than administrative convenience and we should all go on record as saying that all employment in the public service must be based on merit and merit alone in so far as we can possibly control it.  We do that with our eyes open in the full knowledge we cannot control it absolutely, but in so far as we can, we will.  The insertion of section 4 in this Bill is the first time I have ever seen that principle challenged in legislation in this House.  That is why I am making so strong a case against it.  What the hell do I care who is employed in Montrose?  I will be dead and buried before the people who are now there will ever reach pension age.  It does not matter a damn to me but I am concerned to preserve, particularly in the minds of the people, that the convictions of this House are incorruptible. I know the standards of Deputy Maurice Dockrell are perhaps more rigid than most of us but taking us, by and large, with a few exceptions to which I shall not go into detail now, we are an incorruptible bunch and that is the way we want it to stay.  Perhaps one of the reasons why we are incorruptible is that we are afraid of exposure in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the law.  In public life the beginning of wisdom is the fear of publicity.  I do not know whether our reasons are good or bad but, by <Col N="643" /> and large, we are a pretty incorruptible bunch.  For the love of providence, let us stay that way and do not let us have section 4 of this Bill thrown in our teeth hereafter.  As sure as we do, I warn Deputy Tully that there will be other Bills with sections like this in them and when he gets up to raise them, it will be cast up to him: &ldquo;Who was the first man to defend them in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1965?  If it was all right then, why is it not all right now?&rdquo; He will find people, much more successfully than Deputy Briscoe, trying to explain what he said today is not what he said the day after and he will back his way out of it.  It is the precedent I am afraid of.  Do not let us establish a precedent that there is to be any breach in the principle that the best man wins in the public service.</P>

I have no axe to grind with regard to this particular case except that from my point of view it appears the Broadcasting Authority are seeking permission to do something which is an established fact at the present time in the Civil Service.  If that is so, then I see no reason why the House should refuse to allow it to be extended to the Broadcasting Authority.  If in fact it turns out otherwise, that there is advantage taken by some politician&mdash; sometimes they can do that, no matter what side of the House they belong to&mdash;then I would reserve my right as long as I am in this House to raise that matter on the floor of the House, as I did in the case of the two postmen, one in Meath and one in Monaghan.</P>

      <P>I do not think we can have it both ways in this particular case.  This is a plain question of fact. There is one point which Deputy Dillon has missed and which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has missed also. The television end of the Broadcasting Authority has not been so long in existence.  If we went back to the original appointments in that service, we would find that everybody there did not go in through an examination, confined or otherwise.  Despite that, no matter what way they went in, I think all of us are prepared to agree they are doing a very good job and I would be the last to condemn them.  We are making a mountain out of a molehill here.  I agree that Deputy Dillon if he thinks something is right, will fight to the last for it but I think, in this particular case, there is an established practice being extended to another service. If that is so, then I propose to support the extension of it and to ask my Party to do the same.  If at a future date, on the other hand, I find it wrong, I will be only too glad to tell Deputy Dillon so and to tell the House so if there is any skulduggery going on.</P>

I think Deputy Tully knows as well as I know that in the Civil Service it is established practice at the moment.  If there are 25 <Col N="645" /> vacancies, it is quite a normal thing for 20 of those vacancies to be filled from an open competition and five confined to maybe clerical grades, who wish to reach that position.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should have mentioned the question of the promotion of postmen. I would like to remind him that about five months ago I brought up the case of a young postman who had 17 years successful service in Connemara. The permanent post became available but he was not promoted.  Who was promoted?  A gentleman who had just signed on at the labour exchange, the secretary of the local cumann, and if the Minister wants the facts, I will give them to him.  We all know the reason for this set-up.  When this Authority was set up originally, a bunch of Party hacks, sons of Fianna Fáil TD's, which cannot be denied, square plugs in round holes, were taken in.  Now they want to establish them without a competition. If this is the Fianna Fáil attitude, it is not the attitude of this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is really to facilitate the Authority in dealing with programme material. The amendment of section 16, subsection (2) will allow the Authority to arrange with other broadcasting authorities for the distribution, receipt, exchange and relay of programmes, whether live or recorded.  The word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is added and &ldquo;whether live or recorded&rdquo;.  This broadens the scope with regard to the material with which they may deal.  With the passage of time in the short time the Authority is in existence, this has been found necessary.  It is merely a technical matter.</P>

      <P>Exactly the same thing: &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister, to compile, publish and distribute, with or without charge, recorded aural and visual material&rdquo;. It is exactly the same.  It involves the compilation of material, and the publication or distribution of material otherwise than to a broadcasting authority.</P>

      <P>What is the meaning of &ldquo;subject to the consent of the <Col N="647" /> Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;? I held my fire when we were discussing this on Second Stage because it seemed to me that there was a good deal of force in what the Minister said, that, in the ordinary course the programmes could contain a good deal of reference to Ministers of State, and that they would be sent to bun fights and dog fights, dog races and hooleys. It often causes amusement to the viewing public to see the machinery brought down to record Ministers at some hooley which it is grotesque to broadcast at all, except for the publicity which the Minister seeks.</P>
      <P>I remember the Minister for Agriculture used to be a great man for rooting around when he was more prominent in the Taoiseach stakes than he now appears to be.  You could not turn on the television news but the Minister for Agriculture was starting a dog race, or twisting a cow's tail, or holding a horse's fetlock, or performing in one capacity or another. What is the meaning now of paragraph (n) which says, &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;? Does it mean that Ministers of State will be able to get publicity material prepared by the television authority on their own fiat, or why is this new paragraph inserted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A new subsection 16 (2) (n) proposes to give the Authority a specific power, subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Government Departments.  At present the Authority act as agent for the Department of Education in the matter of Telefís Scoile programmes and they are refunded the cost of these programmes by that Department.  It may be that in the future the Authority may be requested to act as agent for some other Department, for instance, for the Department of External Affairs, the transcription service, or the Department of Agriculture, the special agricultural programmes outside normal broadcasting hours.  It could easily be visualised that the service might have to be used for some specific matter, the <Col N="648" /> same as for Telefís Scoile, for which the Authority are paid by the Department of Education.  Irrespective of what Government may be in power, it is desirable that that power should be there.  If the Deputy is suggesting that we are taking some power to use or misuse the Authority, that does not quite make sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He does not need any new power.

      <P>What is in my heart is coming out of my mouth.  If programmes are to be instituted at the instance of the Minister for Agriculture, I have no doubt that the Authority will consult with the Minister. There are already numerous agricultural programmes.  There are the farming programmes on television and the farming programmes on radio. They will collaborate in every possible way with the Minister, but I do not understand why we have &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; a power to place upon the broadcasting Authority an obligation to provide &ldquo;services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;.  I cannot conceive any situation arising in which the present powers disposed of by the Director General and the Authority are not amply adequate. They recognise that they have a certain public service to discharge.  Can they not do it at the request of the <Col N="649" /> Minister?  Are they not at present doing it at the request of the Minister?</P>
      <P>Is there any statutory block at present existing to prevent the Authority from collaborating with the Minister? At the present time there are special features.  There are special features about road safety which are broadcast by the Television Authority presumably at the request of the Minister for Local Government.  I know of no statutory block existing to prevent the Authority from collaborating in so far as it is conceivably desirable with any Minister of State, but it is quite a new principle if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is to be given power to direct the Authority to carry out the instructions of certain Ministers of State.  That is something we have never legislated for before, so far as I know. What is to prevent the Authority at present from collaborating in any way they like with Ministers of State?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is pretending he does not see the point.  It is a question of providing some service for which the Department would be expected to pay just the same as the Department of Education pay for the Telefís Scoile programmes at present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is suggesting now is that this paragraph would authorise the Authority to provide a service at the instance of a Minister for State, subject to the approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, out of their existing revenue, whereas heretofore if the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for External Affairs, or the Minister for Health, wanted a service provided the Authority could provide it but could indent upon the Vote of the Minister for the cost of the programme.  That left the provision we made for television intact, and the burden of the expense was carried by the Minister who sought the service.  Now the Minister is saying that the other Minister, subject to his approval, could indent upon the resources of Telefís Éireann, and that if the Authority could be persuaded to provide a service it would be provided at the expense of Telefís Éireann.  This diminishes the provision we have made for Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following recommendations on land acquisition were received from the housing authority in question, namely, that the Housing and Local Government codes be extended as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  power be given to acquire an estate or area of land by private treaty or auction, notwithstanding that the council may not require all the property concerned for the purposes of the council's powers and duties in the foreseeable future;</P>
      <P>(2)  a legal presumption be created that the council has a statutory need of land wherever the council has less than five vacant building sites in any town having a population exceeding 500;</P>
      <P>(3)  power be given to include in a compulsory purchase order</P>
      <P>(a)  the site(s) recommended on engineering and planning grounds;</P>
      <P>(b)  second preference site(s) recommended in (a);</P>
      <P>(c)  sites recommended by resolution of the council;</P>
      <P>(4)  power be given to restrict building in any area until the council's needs have been satisfied;</P>
      <P>(5)  the council be obliged to declare every year (in respect of each district):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> (a)  the number of houses (and sites for private houses) required immediately;</P>
    <P>(b)  the estimated demand for houses (and sites for private houses) in the ensuring period of five years;</P>
    <P>(c)  a declaration under (a) or (b) to have the effect of determining the council's need for the purpose of compulsory acquisition proceedings.</P>
    <P>Recommendation (1) was fully debated in the Committee Stage debates on the Housing Bill, 1965, on 11th and 17th November, 1965 (see cols. 1794 and 1960 of the Dáil Debates for those days).  As I indicated there, I consider that the existing powers of local authorities are adequate.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied as to the need to incorporate recommendations (2), (3) and (4) in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 53 and 55 of the Bill, dealing with the assessment of needs and <Col N="528" /> the preparation of building programmes, will require housing authorities to have regard to the factors mentioned in recommendation (5).  Under section 76, a housing authority may be authorised to acquire land compulsorily in advance of needs if the Minister is satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that the land will be required to attain any of the objectives of a building programme, including the objective mentioned in recommendation (5).</P>
