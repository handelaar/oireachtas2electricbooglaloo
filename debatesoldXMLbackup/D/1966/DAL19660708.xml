    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night on this vote of censure, I was <Col N="2438" /> referring to the housing situation.  I promised today for the record to turn to a matter which I think it is particularly desirable to ventilate in this House, particularly for the benefit of younger Deputies who are frequently misled by the kind of propaganda on which they are reared by Fianna Fáil. Before undertaking that assignment, I want to direct the attention of the House to two very disturbing facts that have come to light in the past 24 hours.</P>
      <P>One is the receipt this morning of the record of the Live Register of unemployed.  On 27th June, 1964, there were in receipt of unemployment benefit, which excludes people in receipt of unemployment assistance, 22,470 persons.  On 2nd July, 1965, there were 22,664 and on 1st July, 1966, 26,694.  Unemployment is rising compared with last year.  There are 4,000 more persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, that is, people drawing money on foot of the stamps they have affixed to their social welfare cards.  It is not untypical of Fianna Fáil that the general figures for unemployment as we used to use them in this House are no longer available to us because they have changed the whole basis of reckoning the total number of unemployed.  For years, the practice was to put them on the boat and ship them to Great Britain or anywhere else they could get rid of them.  At present there are approximately, I understand, one million people of Irish birth working in Great Britain.  Fianna Fáil made an abundant contribution to that great diaspora of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, not content with shipping them out of the country, according to the footnote on the returns made by the Central Statistics Office, as from 7th January, 1966, the Live Register excludes persons who are in beneficial occupation of agricultural land and a number of other categories who are here set out.  Thus the figures sound less remarkable than they would if they were calculated on the basis with which we were all familiar over the past ten years, but it is gravely significant that we have 4,000 more people drawing unemployment benefit as a result of <Col N="2439" /> being out of work today than we had this day 12 months or this day two years ago.</P>
    <P>The second remarkable fact that has come to light in the past 24 hours is the fact mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Desmond when speaking last night. There are some Deputies who are a bit liberal in their interpretation of current statistics but that is not the reputation Deputy Mrs. Desmond has. She was talking about the circumstances of a family living in the environs of Cork and sending their children to school, and the head of which had secured the £1 a week increase agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In her reckoning, which I do not believe to be extravagant, she pointed out that one item of domestic expenditure alone, the transport of those children going to school in Cork city from their home outside the city, on five days a week, had absorbed practically the entire £1 a week.  Practically the entire £1 had been absorbed by increased transport costs in getting the children to school and all the other elements of increases in the cost of living of that family have to be met out of the wages they got before they received the £1 under the general agreement which is in course of being put into effect at the suggestion of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I want to say this: I hear a lot of people talking about the reckless irresponsibility of the trade union movement. I have said in this House before, and I am saying it again, that all my life.  I have been dealing with trade unions.  I never found them irresponsible or reckless.  I found them tough; I found them very often unbending in the course of negotiation, but I recognise that that was their job, and they may have found me on many occasions tough and unbending too, and we had our collisions.  However, if we expect the trade union movement to maintain their record of responsibility and prudence, we have got to recognise that all the obligations are not on one side.  We have got to do two things.  One is to ensure that we will not let the cost of living run away and sweep out of <Col N="2440" /> the wage-earner's hand any benefit he may have secured as a result of legitimate negotiations.  We have also got to try to bear in mind that if we want trade unionists to exercise reasonable restraint in their demands for increased wages for the benefit of the community as a whole, if we want industry which employs them to play its part in efficiency and economy and prudent administration, then exhortations from the Government Front Bench are not enough.  Example is a very desirable additional contribution to the solution of this problem.  Whether or not it is good example to increase the number of Ministers to the maximum the Constitution will allow, when it is notorious that more than one Minister in the present administration has nothing to do, is open to doubt.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the matter which I promised to refer to yesterday. I have heard it frequently stated, and I believe that several honest young Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party believe it to be true, that when this country borrowed £40 million sterling in dollars from the Government of the United States of America in 1949, under the Marshall Aid plan, and accepted the corresponding grant at that time, in fact what happened was that the Government borrowed £40 million and spent it improvidently and that it was gone.  I want to try to explain to them a complex series of facts.  I want to try to explain this extremely complex transaction and in a sense I apologise to the House for dealing with history, but it is important that it should be understood in order to differentiate from the situation with which we are now confronted.</P>
    <P>In 1948, there was no scarcity of capital.  The House should understand that.  We had just finished the European war during which we were importing virtually nothing but exporting everything that we would permit to be exported.  All during the war we were controlling exports, for if we did not control them, everything we had to sell would have been swept out of the country to a hungry people who were beleaguered in Great Britain and savagely rationed, with the result that <Col N="2441" /> at the end of the war, one thing that was not scarce was capital.  The great problem was to find, in addition to the social investment we considered essential, productive investment which would absorb the capital available if we could get productive enterprises under way.  We were looking everywhere to get people to set up industries which would export.  What we ought to remember is that at that time the problem was that the whole of Europe was devastated and they were all trying to rebuild their own countries.</P>
    <P>We were almost unique in Europe in that we had a surplus of capital. Every other country in Europe&mdash;Great Britain, France, Germany, Holland and Belgium&mdash;were all on the flat of their backs, with their countries devastated and with an acute shortage of capital.  However, we shared with Europe one serious problem and that was that we had no dollars.  Now, no country in Europe had anything to sell to us.  They wanted it all for themselves. France wanted it to buy building materials she had not got; Belgium wanted it to buy building materials she had not got; and Germany wanted it to buy building materials she had not got.  They all wanted those building materials to rebuild their shattered countries.  We wanted it to build houses. The sterling we had in abundance was negotiable only in countries that had nothing to sell us.  The same was true in England; the same was true in France, Belgium and Germany.  I well remember speaking to a prominent miller in this country in 1947.  He said to me: &ldquo;The Americans' problem very shortly will be that they will have an abundance to sell and they will have no one to buy it&rdquo;.  I remember saying to him: &ldquo;What do you think they will do?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;They are going to have the greatest economic catastrophe the world has even seen.  They will have to close down their agricultural industry.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;They have a major problem.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;What will they do?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;They will give it away. They cannot do anything else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I still remember that man's horror at the idea that any country would give its produce away.  Of course, in 1948, when President <Col N="2442" /> Truman took office and the Secretary of State, General Marshall, realised the magnitude of that dilemma, they launched the Marshall Plan.  The whole purpose of that plan was to put launched the Marshall Plan.  The whole purpose of that plan was to put into the hands of the European countries dollars with which to buy all the USA could produce in abundance, building materials, machinery, food. Remember, all Europe was starving.</P>
    <P>When I took office as Minister for Agriculture, all we had in this country was rationing.  Even in this country the ration was only two ounces of butter a week and half an ounce of tea.  On the Continent of Europe and in Great Britain, it was much worse. I remember going into one of the most fashionable clubs in London and asking for my lunch and being told the only thing available was fish sausage.  The reason that it was made into sausage was that the appearance of the only fish available was so revolting nobody would eat it if it was not converted into sausage.</P>
    <P>The Marshall Plan was launched in that situation.  We did not want capital: we wanted dollars, hard currency.  The British wanted dollars, too, and accordingly the Marshall Plan was launched.  Remember, we had been neutral during the war and a very grave question was: &ldquo;Would the USA include us in the Marshall Plan at all?&rdquo;  Largely through the superb skill of Deputy Seán MacBride, who was then Minister for External Affairs, and Deputy J.A. Costello, who was then Taoiseach, we succeeded in getting in on the Marshall Plan.  We got our allocation of dollars.  Despite the Fianna Fáil Leader trying to persuade his younger, inexperienced supporters, that we went out on a spending spree, and that 40 million dollars was dissipated, I am producing here the American Counterpart Fund Account for the years 1963-64, 1962-63, 1961-62, 1960-61, 1959-60, 1958-59, 1957-58, 1956-57, 1955-56, 1954-55, 1953-54, 1952-53, 1951-52, 1950-51, 1949-50 and 1948-49.  I ask you: how can you keep an account, and present it annually to Dáil Éireann, of a fund that does not exist?  If that 40 million dollars were spent by the inter-Party Government in 1948, 1949 and 1950, <Col N="2443" /> why are we still keeping an account of it in 1964-65?  Those are not private documents.  I borrowed them from the Library.  They are there for all to read but they tell an extraordinary story.</P>
    <P>What happened?  The Irish Government borrowed the dollars and we deposited them in the Central Bank. A building contractor undertook to build 1,000 houses for the working people of this country.  He came to us and he said: &ldquo;I cannot get steel in England, Germany or Belgium.  The only place I can get steel is in Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.  I can get abundant steel there but they will not take payment in sterling.  They want it in dollars&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Very Well&rdquo;, we said, &ldquo;that is why we borrowed the dollars from America.  We have dollars in the Central Bank.  How much do you want?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I need dollars for £100,000.&rdquo;  We said to him: &ldquo;Give us your cheque for £100,000 and we will give you the dollars&rdquo;.  We took his cheque for £100,000 and we gave him 300,000 dollars.  He went off with those dollars in his pocket to Pennsylvania.  He bought the steel there and he built the houses.  We had the dollars and we were able to build the houses.  We were, by our foresight, able to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the dollars which we swapped for sterling and accumulated it gradually in the Central Bank.  We had sterling and we <Col N="2444" /> borrowed the dollars.  I well remember Paddy McGilligan was then Minister for Finance.  His plan was that he issued a National Loan every year to meet the immense cost we had to meet to build hospitals and sanatoria.  Remember, when we took office in 1948, if you wanted to get a TB child into hospital, it took 16 to 18 months.  We built sanatoria then and a great many of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are now sitting there, said we were mad.  We had to do all this building and we proceeded to do it as an emergency.  As I said, Paddy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, issued a National Loan and so far as that failed to meet the total amount of money we needed, we borrowed from the funds on deposit in the Central Bank that were there to pay back the Marshall Loan as it fell due.</P>
      <P>Some of the younger men might ask: &ldquo;If you got the £40 million in the Central Bank in exchange for the dollars, why did you not pay off the loan?&rdquo;  We did not pay it because the Americans would not take sterling. Sterling would be no good to pay a dollar loan in those days.  We could only pay a dollar loan with dollars but we got the loan at 2½ per cent and we got it for five years interest-free, certainly with no obligation to pay the capital, and at the end of five years, we agreed to pay so much per annum of the capital and the interest at 2½ per cent, and now we are paying the Bank of Nova Scotia seven per cent and undertaking to pay it back in ten years.  The Marshall Aid loan was to be paid in 40 years at 2½ per cent. So every year the Irish Government would borrow from the Counterpart Loan Fund in the Central Bank so much for ways and means advances to meet our capital requirements. We went out of office in 1951 and I want to read out to you what the account of that year showed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year we went out of office the account of the Minister for Finance with the Central Bank shows that there was a balance of £23,503,632 14s 10d lying on the desk of Deputy Seán MacEntee the day he went into office as Minister for Finance.  Let us not forget <Col N="2445" /> that&mdash;£23,503,632 14s 10d.  Now, I want to turn your attention to the account of the following year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen, at the end of the following year, what was left?  It was £267,000.  What had become of the rest of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every penny of it had been taken by Deputy Seán MacEntee not to build hospitals, not to build houses, not to construct roads, not to carry out any civic or urban amenity but to balance his Budget.  What was the result?  We had a raging, tearing inflation and the following year, we had Deputy MacEntee's famous Budget. Now, a great many of the younger Deputies will not remember that Budget, but it sacrificed and crucified our people to such an extent that they rose up in revolution and chased him out of the country in 1954 and ever since he has been like a sore thumb in the Fianna Fáil Party, until, eventually, they squeezed him out and when Deputy Jack Lynch, as Minister for Finance, found himself in difficulties this year, the dagger came stealing down Deputy MacEntee's sleeve and he wrote: &ldquo;If he is in trouble, I know why: Because he let these necromancers and soothsayers dictate his policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is the type of history I think the young fellows of this House ought to know.  When you think, or when you are persuaded, or when you have people thinking that in 1948, Bill Norton, God be good to him, Tim Murphy and Michael Keyes&mdash;Brendan Corish was only a lad then and I do not think he was in the Government&mdash;prostituted their trust and when you are told they squandered the public money in collaboration with their Fine Gael colleagues and their Clann na Talmhan colleagues and their Clann na Poblachta colleagues in the Government, go down and take these accounts, which are still being kept because the fund is still there, and read the history of one of the greatest services ever done to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> First, there were thousands of families housed that would have been broken up and driven out of this country by emigration but for that fund and the masterly use made of it by the Government of which we were members.  There are living monuments in every town and village to the extent to which they were financed by that fund.  There are fathers of families today healthy and strong all over Ireland who would have been mouldering in their graves as a result of tuberculosis, but for the way we spent the money from that fund, and the glory of it is that as we look around the country today, one half the santatoria we built are empty.  That is why we built them, so that 20 years afterwards, they would be like white elephants, empty.  We want them empty, but we desperately wanted them in 1948 and they were all full the day they were built.</P>
    <P>Was that extravagance?  Was that folly?  Go and ask the mothers who did not lose their children, go and ask the wives whose husbands survived to rear their families, go and ask the children would they have sooner never known their fathers than that we should have spent the money we spent to see that they survived.  That is a story I wanted to tell and the documentation of it is no secret.  There are public documents in the library of Dáil Éireann and any Deputy can go down and read and study them.  There was never a read penny of net debt due to the United States of America in respect of the Marshall loan fund.  It was purely a currency transaction, to secure the materials we bought to build houses, sanatoria and hospitals.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that the day I took office as Minister for Agriculture, there were fewer cattle, fewer sheep and fewer pigs on the land of Ireland than at any time since the famine of 1847. That is the situation I was confronted with the day I came into the Department of Agriculture.  I had to produce the pigs, the sheep and the cattle but there was no use producing them if I could not feed them.  Do not forget that in 1948 Ymer feeding barely was unknown in this country.  Do not forget this crop was unknown in Ireland.  The <Col N="2447" /> only barley grown in Ireland in 1948 was malting barley, the average yield of which was 19 cwt. per statute acre. Ymer barley which yielded 40 cwt. per statute acre made it possible to feed our pigs from our own land, but the day I started, there was no grain crop available in this country that would economically feed pigs.  The only place I could get grain to feed them was the United States of America and if I had not dollars to pay for it, the farmers of this country would have had to slaughter their pigs.  I shall not talk about calves.  That arose in the days gone by. I bought maize, hundreds of thousands of tons of maize, so that the farmers would have the wherewithal to feed their livestock.</P>
    <P>I remember during that period we had no fertilisers in this country.  The French would not sell us phosphate and they controlled it in Algiers.  I remember a Dutch firm coming into the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I thought they were bluffing&mdash;and saying to me: &ldquo;Minister, would you take 100,000 tons of super at £8 a ton?&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;Are you offering it?&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;Yes, we are.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said &ldquo;you have sold it&rdquo;, and I remember picking up the telephone and ringing Deputy McGilligan in the Department of Finance and saying to him: &ldquo;Paddy, I have spent a million&rdquo;.  He said to me: &ldquo;In the name of God, what on?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;On super for the farmers,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;All right; I will find the money for any raw materials for the farmers&rdquo;.  In one split second, because we had to, we brought into this country 100,000 tons of super, where there had not been a pound put out for the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>So I would say to any young Fianna Fáil Deputy, if anyone talks to him about the £40 million again, let him go down to the Library and read those papers; let him go down to the sanatoria, empty now, and say to himself: &ldquo;I myself might be in the grave and there might be Deputies here amongst us who would be dead and gone but for the sanatoria built by Dr. Noel Browne.&rdquo;  But then there are none of <Col N="2448" /> the houses or livestock of this country which could not have been brought back to the levels at which they stood when we left the office if that currency had not been borrowed.  Bear in mind, there was never a penny of net debt. We took in the dollars but no man got a dollar to spend who did not put down a pound in exchange for it. No, not one cent of that money was spent if it was not to buy raw materials for our agricultural industry, or the means of housing our people or to save those who must otherwise have died.</P>
    <P>This is a vote of no confidence in the Government and you were apprehensive a moment ago, Sir, that I would be primarily concerned to deal with the vindication of things past.  I do not want to talk about things past at all, except in so far as it is appropriate to set the present in its right perspective.  This is a vote of censure on the Government and it is a demand upon them to get out and make way for other men.  The ground upon which we make that motion is that we charge this Government with having deliberately, recklessly and improvidently led our people down the alluring road to an inflation and we are now faced with the moment of truth.  Let us fact the truth for what it is.  This country is bust.</P>
    <P>Now, I know those are harsh words but let us make up our minds to this &mdash;do not let any Deputy imagine that the world of international finance will estimate our economic circumstances by what we say or do not say in Dáil Éireann.  They knew all that we knew six months ago.  They sit in Zurich; they sit in Wall Street; they sit in Threadneedle Street; they sit in Sweeden.  Their business is to know and they are not one bit impressed by Ministers for Finance here, or Taoisigh, or anybody else, who get up and say: &ldquo;Everything in the garden is lovely&rdquo;.  They put the statistics through the computers; they look at the picture that comes out and they mutter under their breath: &ldquo;Not bloody likely&rdquo;.  And, when we go to borrow 10 million in Eurodollars, or USA dollars, or any other dollars, we cannot find the man we want to meet; he is at a tea party.  The next <Col N="2449" /> day we go to call, he has gone to the country; the following week he has received an urgent call to leave for California and, in the heel of the hunt, we come home without the Eurodollars.</P>
    <P>Then we go to Bonn and we say to them: &ldquo;We are the only country in the world on which you never declared war; is it not time we did something about it?&rdquo; And they say: &ldquo;Well, I suppose it is&rdquo;&mdash;£7 million, and we borrow £7 million, but, when it comes to the practical question about terms of repayment, they are seven per cent for 15 years, and we come home with the £7 million rejoicing, only to discover that we have spent it before we got it. We have spent it, not to build hospitals, not to build houses, not to invest in industries but to balance last year's Budget, £50 million of which were to pay the previous years' debts.</P>
    <P>Then we go to negotiate a loan in London and the Minister for Finance gets very angry with me, shocked, dismayed, distressed and, mind you, he is a nice, decent kind of fellow&mdash; Deputy Jack Lynch&mdash;and he says&mdash; I quote him from columns 1615 and 1616, volume 223, of the Official Report of 29th June, 1966:</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Dillon, the country, and I want to quote him, &ldquo;had its back to the wall and never stood in greater economic peril than it is in today&rdquo;.  These assertions, I think, went beyond legitimate criticism of the Government, both as being untrue and harmful to the country's credit and reputation.  He made other assertions which I think I can establish as being unfounded as well.  I hesitate to repeat these lest I give them further currency but I can only describe them as not only hysterical but malicious&mdash;the assertions that this Government were unable to raise £5 million in sterling and that the general reserves of the Central Bank were, again to use his own particular term, &ldquo;gone and spent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the announcement on the day following the Deputy's remarks, 15th June, of the negotiation of a loan of £5 million on good market conditions and good market terms <Col N="2450" /> with the Bank of Nova Scotia gave the lie to these assertions.</P>
    <P>Now, my assertion was that we went to negotiate a loan in London and we failed to get a loan in London.  We then went to the Bank of Nova Scotia, which we had admitted to this country not so long ago, and we said to the Bank of Nova Scotia: The Joint Stock Banks of this country have been on strike for the last two months; now you have raked in a lot of deposits here; what are you going to do with them?  I suggest you did not come in here for a month, or 12 months; you came in here to stay.  We expect you to cough up and, if you do not cough up, we will not burn down the houses around you, but we will remember it and we can get very awkward out here. And the Bank of Nova Scotia said: &ldquo;Now do you want anything?&rdquo;; to which we replied: &ldquo;Yes, £5 million.&rdquo; The Bank of Nova Scotia said: &ldquo;That is all right, but what about paying it back?&rdquo;  What were the terms for paying it back?  &mdash;seven per cent and ten years.  I want to ask the House this question.  Has any other sovereign Government in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, or Australia ever borrowed £5 million at seven per cent with an undertaking to pay it back in ten years?</P>
    <P>I want to put this analogy.  The Minister for Finance is a kindly and a friendly man.  If I met him one morning and said: &ldquo;Look, Jack, I left my wallet at home.  There is something I want to pay.  Will you give me £10?&rdquo;, he would take out his wallet and give me £10.  But if I sidled up to him and said: &ldquo;Would you ever lend me half a crown?&rdquo; he would say: &ldquo;What in the name of God has happened to Dillon?  Is he drinking secretly?&rdquo; I do not think he would say it maliciously. He would go to the other Ministers and say: &ldquo;Do you know what happened to me this morning?  Dillon came sidling up to me and asked for a loan of half a crown.  He must be bust. Is there anything wrong with him?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that a fair analogy?  I think it is, and that is what causes me alarm.  You may ask yourself why is it that we are driven to this extremity.  I am obliged to say that in my considered judgment, <Col N="2451" /> we are driven to this extremity because we have borrowed every penny the Joint Stock Banks in this country are in a position to lend.  We owe the Joint Stock Banks on the short-term a debt of £60 million sterling.  I want to tell the House that to the best of my information the Joint Stock Banks told the Government, when they went to them before the strike to ask for a further loan, that they had not got it and could not lend it.  To the best of my knowledge and belief, they got from the Government the reply: &ldquo;If you have not got it, go and get it from your customers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I now assert that until the banks closed, there was pressure being brought to bear on businessmen in this country, small and large, to reduce their overdrafts at a pace and to a level which put many of them in very serious peril of survival.  It is very difficult to explain to people who are not in business how vital an element to an ordinary small business in this country bank overdraft accommodation is.  I remember saying to the Government when they brought in the turnover tax that one of the progeny of that tax would be the arrival of Garfield&mdash;Weston Tesco and all the big international combines, with a corresponding burden thrown on small family businesses who would have to compete with those great combines.</P>
    <P>I remember saying to the Government: &ldquo;Do not be under any illusion. These big combines are prepared to spend £½ million, £1 million or £2 million to do what they call making the market.&rdquo;  What does making the market mean?  It means closing up 20 or 30 shops in the neighbourhood which are competing with them.  While these people, our own neighbours, our own people, are fighting for their lives to meet that kind of competition, our own people, are fighting for their lives to meet that kind of competition, our own Government come up behind them with a stiletto and sink it in their backs by saying to the banks: &ldquo;Go to John Byrne or Pat Tynan and tell him, battling as he is with the big combines who are trying to take his business away from him: &lsquo;You must reduce your overdraft by £1,000 by this day <Col N="2452" /> three months or get out.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Between Tesco on the one side and the banks on the other, he is out.</P>
    <P>I beg Deputies to listen to this story I am telling now.  They will never hear from the victims who are about to die because if you are a small businessman and the word goes around that you are under pressure from the bank, you might as well go out and cut your throat on the market square.  The minute the word goes out that a small businessman has been sent for by the bank manager, or if he is seen looking worried going along the street to the bank, all the commercial travellers in the whole province leap into their cars and fly like the wind to line up in a queue outside his door.</P>
    <P>They greet him: &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Fleming.  You are looking well. I am glad to see you.  I have a little business with you.&rdquo;  Then they produce the bill.  If Pat Fleming is lucky enough to have the money to pay the bill, he is all right, but if he says he will post it on, the traveller is off like a scalded cat to the nearest hotel to tell the other travellers: &ldquo;I gave Pat Fleming a bill for £17 3s 4d and he told me he would post it.&rdquo;  They are all down on him and Pat Fleming's credit is gone.  I am not naming any individual.  It could be John Smith.  I am talking of my own neighbours in Monaghan, Clones, Castleblayney, Ballaghaderreen or Elphin.</P>
    <P>When I say the country has gone bust, what I mean is that our own Government are reduced to straits which constrain them to join in the crucifixion of our own people.  I do not think I am guilty of any exaggeration, I do not think I am guilty of any reckless language, if in those circumstances I say the country is bust. A country does not sink under the sea if it is bankrupt and bust.  What happens is that the people suffer.  I now allege that the kind of people I came from, the kind of people I belong to, are suffering.  I now allege that old-established businesses, which are run on what I suppose might be described as old-fashioned lines, where the employees are friends and have been with the business for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years, are being wiped <Col N="2453" /> out and not only the owners but the workers are being put on the road. I say a country whose Government are constrained to act in that fashion is bust.</P>
    <P>That alone would not, in my opinion, adequately describe the syndrome of being &ldquo;bust.&rdquo;  You must add to that the fact that in the capital city of Ireland any family of fewer than five people living in one room will not even be considered for a house, while at the same time we see London public companies coming into the country, buying up property and building skyscrapers to be let at 25/-or £1 per square foot.</P>
    <P>Am I justified in saying the country is bust? Am I justified in saying we have got our priorities madly wrong? We have allowed people to come in and build skyscrapers and let them at £1 or 25/- per square foot while we cannot find a place for a family of five persons&mdash;father, mother and three children&mdash;living in one room, bearing in mind that since 1963 no residential unit in this city has been condemned as unfit for human habitation by Dublin Corporation.  There are two branches of the corporation dealing with habitations: one is the architectural department which exists to find out what buildings are in danger of falling down and injuring people; the other is the sanitary section which determines whether a room or house or cottage is fit for human habitation.  I now allege that there has not been a single condemnation of a building or a room in this city since 1963 on the ground that it was unfit for human habitation and I know of houses, I know of rooms, which are rat-infested, damp, unhealthy and dangerous to health and in some of them a father, mother and three children are living, cooking, eating and sleeping while we are building skyscrapers to set at 20/- or 25/- per square foot.</P>
    <P>It is not people who have no place to work in, not people who could not do their work if these skyscrapers were not there who are being put into them.  It is people who have been working in offices better than I ever had, people who have been working in Georgian and Victorian Buildings, some of them erected at the end of <Col N="2454" /> the last century but much better than any office I have ever worked in in my life.  They have now moved in, largely Government employees, into two floors at a time because we took a lease of two floors of a new building for I do not know how many years and undertook to spend £80,000 decorating it before ever we went in. I think we are stark, starting mad.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about ulterior motives.  All I am asking is did I say too much, did I speak too harshly when I said a country in that situation is bust?  We have sold ourselves; we have sold the things that matter for money.  My God, if the British Government had attempted to do that by fire and sword 100 years ago, is there a man or woman in this House who would not have gone out and manned the barricades to stop them?  If the British Government by force had said: &ldquo;We will put the bloody Irish out; we will put them to live five in a room so that the servants of the State and of the plutocracy will have wall to wall carpeting, central heating and airconditioning&rdquo;, what would we have said?  We would have said: &ldquo;Not bloody likely, so long as we are here to fight&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What staggers me, what terrifies me is that the British and the Germans and the Americans have discovered they can conquer us with a cheque book, we who are the children and the grandchildren of men and women who fought with their bare hands in their bare feet.  I remember my father told me he saw them walking to meet Parnell in the town of Ennis to fight the Vandeleur evictions in their bare feet and with nothing but their bare hands.  Why?  Because Vandeleur wanted to put them in the workhouse and they fought for their homes because they would not submit. If Vandeleur had known, the right way was for Vandeleur to come around with his cheque book and say: &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It makes me quite ill.  I do not know if anybody else feels that way.  Have we all changed?  Are we all corrupt? We have just moved ourselves into a great air-conditioned five-storey building, carpeted from wall to wall.  I do <Col N="2455" /> not complain about that: I think it is reasonable that the premises in which we work should be efficient, but as we are sitting here, do we think of the families of five in one room?  What appals me is that sometimes I do not think we are thinking of them.  We think of them sometimes in a vague, general kind of way.  Are we thinking now of a mother, living with her husband and three children in one room? She has sent the father out to work, perhaps sent one or two of the children to school and put the baby in a corner with a bottle.</P>
    <P>There she is now washing potatoes for the father's dinner.  The children will probably come home and she will have to feed them.  She will have to give the baby a bottle.  She has to try to keep the room clean; she has to make the beds.  She must say to herself: &ldquo;If he goes out to the pub tonight, can I blame him?  If he is not going to the pub but to a place where there is mixed bathing, can I blame him?&rdquo;  In conscience, she could not blame him.  He has come home to one room, three children and a wife worn out trying to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Would any of us like it?  The husband comes home to a worn-out woman.  He has his wages and he can say: &ldquo;I have the money to pay for a house but I was down at the corporation today and they told me they will not put me on the list.&rdquo;  All would be well if he could say to her that he had been put on the list, that she would have to hang on perhaps for 12 months but he had been promised a house.  If he had been put on the list, he would have been told by the corporation of the houses they were building and the claims for those houses.  All he can tell her is that he had not even been put on the list.</P>
    <P>I never was poor.  Sometimes that is a disadvantage.  I do not know what it means to have been hungry.  Maybe I would be all the better for it if I had.  Maybe it is because I have never been poor, never hungry, that I feel such compassion and personal distress at the thought of the misery of my neighbours.  I cannot dissociate myself from them.  I cannot think of them as <Col N="2456" /> other people: I was born among them and I lived among them in George's Street in this city in the early years of my life.  The rest of the time I have spent in the country.  They are my neighbours and I know no difference between them and me.  I know how they face their problems.</P>
    <P>I love this parliamentary system of Government because I know it to be the true symbol of freedom, but how long can people be patient and accept it, if it proves so callous and indifferent to their intolerable woes?  The problem in rural Ireland is not as unbearable as in the city.  Even in rural Ireland it is not a good thing for a young couple to have to go and live with a father and mother but it is not as intolerable as it is in the city.  In rural Ireland there is the farmyard: there is the road; there is the crossroads. The young man can take the father down to the crossroads and if he wants to take his wife to the pictures occasionally, the mother will look after the baby.</P>
    <P>However, it is a great evil that the authorities in this country cannot build the houses so urgently needed in rural Ireland.  It is even a greater evil that we are urging the young people to get married when the first thing any sensible girl would ask a chap who wanted to marry her is: &ldquo;Have we a house?&rdquo; If he says: &ldquo;We have. We have my father's house,&rdquo; she goes out and she sees the house without water, and other facilities, a house which maybe 150 years ago was comfortable, and she says: &ldquo;How am I going to keep the place clean?&rdquo;  and he says: &ldquo;You can go to the well for water.&rdquo;  She replies: &ldquo;Maybe I am in love with you but I am not all that much in love with you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That fellow goes to the local authority; he has the money to put down a deposit and he has the income to pay the interest on the loan.  He says he wants a Small Dwellings Acquisition loan to build himself a house.  In County Monaghan if he makes application now, he will be told his application will not be considered for at least 12 months.  Some of my colleagues may think perhaps I am unduly conscious of my age, but there are some <Col N="2457" /> of them young enough to realise that if you are in love and you want to get married, there is nothing standing between you and the altar but a house. You have the bird but you have no cage to put it in, and there is a danger that somebody else might provide the cage or find a more attractive cage than the one you have.  You go to the bank manager and he says: &ldquo;I would not lend you 6d.&rdquo;  You inquire if there is anywhere else you can get the money, and the answer is &ldquo;No, you will have to go without it for the present.&rdquo;  This may be considered a problem for the young, but it is not their problem only.  It is the problem of us all.  We who are in middle age ought to understand the problems of the young.  It is really their problem, but they have not the means nor the wisdom to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I say the Government that cannot give that help to our own people are &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  Am I wrong in saying that? I do not think so.  I represent Monaghan, and I live in Mayo.  Those are two congested areas at the present moment.  The rural improvements schemes, the special employments schemes, and the bog roads schemes are all being closed down in these counties.  That does not only mean that a variety of amenities are going to be withheld from people.  It means the ganger, the supervisor, the other people who got temporary work to help out with their income are being refused employment, and it means they are going to England because they have no other means of subsistence.  Am I wrong in saying a Government which finds itself in these circumstances is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Does anybody maintain that Deputy Gibbons is doing it out of malice?  I think he is doing it because he has not got the money.  We find poor Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, being lambasted because he will not provide houses and finance sewerage and all the other things local authorities want to do.  I often feel compassion for him.  I think he wants to do it, that he would like to do it, but the answer is he has not the money. That is the one alibi he cannot advance here because as a member of the Government, he has to accept responsibility with the rest of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2458" /> These are the facts as I see them. Some Deputies may think I have spoken too strongly if I say a country which is reduced to these circumstances is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  I do not, and I claim I have the right to say that now, because I warned them of it years ago.  At great political cost I went out to the country and I warned the people, not yesterday or a month ago or a year ago, but two years ago.  Fifteen times at public meetings during the general election and the by-election campaigns I warned people of the dangers that lay ahead. Fianna Fáil beat us in Cork and Kildare, the two dearest by-elections that ever were bought in the history of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But we beat them in North-East Dublin, in Roscommon and in Galway, and Labour defeated them in Cork.  Then we had the election with the slogan &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo; We were told: &ldquo;If you let Lemass lead on, there will be nothing but milk and honey for all our people, and all the prophets of doom are saboteurs.&rdquo; Now I am entitled to stand up and ask: &ldquo;Who spoke the truth?  Who kept faith with our people, and who betrayed them?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to deal with another matter about which the Minister for Finance, in his usual decent kind of way, expressed great distress.  At column 1616, volumn 223 of the Official Report of 29th June, 1966, he said:</P>
      <P>The validity of the other assertions can be judged from the fact, and I want to stress this particularly for the benefit of Deputy Dillon, that the assets of the general fund of the Central Bank stand at over £100 million, of which £75 million is in gold and in foreign securities. These assets, I would like to remind the Deputy, are distinct from those of the Legal Tender Note Fund which amount to about £110 million.  However much astray Deputy Dillon may be led by his horrible imaginings and reckless utterances, this country's financial position is sound.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: I hope you are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> He was referring to my statement reported in the same column where he said:</P>
    <P>... the assertions that this Government were unable to raise £6 million in sterling and that the general reserves of the Central Bank were, again to use his own particular term, &ldquo;gone and spent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know these are very important statements to make.  I know that my word carries some authority in the country and I must not make statements which are not provable up to the hilt, especially about matters relating to finance or to the Central Bank of the country. Therefore, I felt it my duty to bring here for inspection by every Deputy the reports of the Central Bank.  I refer to the annual report of the Central Bank 1963-64 which says:</P>
    <P>Of the assets in the Legal Tender Note Fund at 31st March 1964 totalling £100,123,967 the value of currency and securities of the Federal Government of the United States of America was £11,056,428 11s 5d. On the same date total advances to the Minister for Finance under subsection (7) of Section 3 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957 amounted to £5,877,365 1s 1d, the sum advanced under this head during the year having been £1,064,525 4s 2d.  The amount of the Balance in the General Fund on 31st March 1964 was £22,448,535 10s.</P>
    <P>I now allege that the Government borrowed that from the Central Bank last year on foot of the funding operations they carried out to redeem the Treasury Bills that they were not in a position to renew and they issued a £20 million loan to the Joint Stock Banks on the understanding that, if the Joint Stock Banks would take it up, the Central Bank would take it off their hands and use that fund to do it.</P>
    <P>Now we wonder how he could have the daring to deny that.  I want to tell you how.  He knows, or at least his advisers know, that these are very complex matters and very intricate matters and, as you observe, the prospect of educating the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2460" /> Party, of which not one single member is now present in the House, except the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is extremely laborious.  I do not blame them.  The truth is harsh and one must not complain if they cannot listen to it.  I refer the House to the Report of the Central Bank for 1964/65, page 16.  Listen:</P>
    <P>To provide greater flexibility in rediscount operations, to extend the capacity of the Central Bank to act as lender of last resort and generally to develop operations through the General Fund, a transfer of assets from the Legal Tender Note Fund was made under the authority of an order made by the Minister for Finance, at the request of the Central Bank, on 29 August, 1961, entitled Legal Tender Note Fund (Additional Form of Asset) Order, 1961.  This order empowered the Central Bank to include among the assets of the Legal Tender Note Fund a Balance in the General Fund.  At the same time the Minister made consequential regulations entitled &ldquo;Central Bank of Ireland (Form of Statement of Accounts) Regulations, 1961&rdquo; to provide for the new item in the accounts of the two Funds.  In exercise of the new power a transfer from the Legal Tender Note Fund to the General Fund of British Government securities and cash amounting in total to £20 million was made on 30 November 1961.  On 6 February 1963 the Board of the Central Bank decided to allow the balance in the General Fund to be held in the Legal Tender Note Fund to fluctuate between £20 million and £22 million.  On 11 November 1963 the upper limit was increased to £25 million.</P>
    <P>That is the last reference we have and I draw the attention of the House to this significant fact: the Report of the Central Bank for 1965-66 has not been published.  This is the first year in my memory that the Report of the Central Bank was not available before 1st July. It is true that last year they published quarterly reports but the annual general report has not been published.  It may be due to the printing strike or to a <Col N="2461" /> variety of factors.  I have not got the annual report for this year but I challenge the Minister for Finance to deny that he got from the joint stock banks of this country last year £20 million of a funding loan to repay Treasury Bills that he was not in a position to renew, on the understanding that that would be taken over from the joint stock banks by the Central Bank out of its General Fund.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have delayed the House somewhat long but these are matters that I want to put on record because it is very important that they should be put on record.  The House will notice with satisfaction that, without reference to my notes, I have managed to dispose of a great many of them.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of warning to Deputy Moore, who has kindly come in to join us, to Deputy Geoghegan from Carna, who is here vigilantly watching the interests of the Gaeltacht and to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whose body may be in Dublin but whose heart and whose spirit, no doubt, are in West Donegal. I want to warn the House of a very serious development in the agricultural industry.  I think Deputy Paddy Smith had the best intentions in the world when he brought in the heifer scheme.  I had grave misgivings about it, but, I must be honest, when it came to formulating those misgivings I found it very hard to crystallise them in my own mind but I had an instinctive feeling that this represented so radical an interference with the ordinary flow of a thing like the livestock industry that there were grave dangers inherent in it and I was apprehensive on behalf of the small farmer.  The worst of my apprehensions have come to pass.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House that as of today strong cattle in forward condition are doing fairly well; strong cattle in thin condition are selling badly but the kind of cattle that are kept by the people I represent in this House and the people amongst whom I live in Mayo, the cattle from 12 months to 18 or 20 months, are unsaleable. Cattle for which I could have got £50 this day 12 months, I would not get £30 for today and most people <Col N="2462" /> are not asked where they are going when they drive them to a fair.  I warn that that is creating an acute problem in the congested areas of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are now joined by Deputy O'Connor from Kerry.  They come in in ones and go out in ones.  I think Deputy O'Connor will confirm what I say.</P>

      <P>The cattle I had were well done.  I had not run out of grass or silage until the grass began to grow. I agree that there is a lot of poor cattle and that is one of the by-products of a scheme I think Deputy Smith initiated with the best of intentions but he had the misfortune in the year when the increase in the young cattle came &mdash; this year &mdash; that we had the worst winter I remember and the latest spring.  I think Deputy O'Connor will sympathise with me.  I am warning the House that there is a condition of acute crisis amongst small farmers I know.  I am a small farmer and a shopkeeper serving small farmers.  Ask any small farmer or any shopkeeper serving them and they will tell you that it is not the bank strike that prevents the small farmer from buying a hat for the wife or a lb of tea or boots for the children.  They <Col N="2463" /> have the money in the jug if they have it at all.  The trouble is, they cannot sell their stock.</P>
      <P>I do not know what business I have to warn the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but he is all I have to warn.  He is there cocked in front of me.  I suppose he will tell his colleagues.  I am bound to tell you. I need not tell you that egg production is dead.  That is not the fault of our Government.  That is due to the fact that the British are now producing a surplus and are themselves egg exporters and the British market for eggs is gone and we are sharing that misfortune with the Danes.  But pigkeeping is becoming uneconomic for the smallholder.  There is a combination of reasons for that.  One is that the grading has become too complicated and, secondly, the people in the factory kind of production of 500, 1,000 and 2,000 pigs, have adopted entirely new techniques and they can take a profit of about 10/- a pig, turning them out in hundreds and thousands, which the small farmer cannot live on. It is the same kind of thing as the broiler fowl have done to the fowl industry that you knew in the old days in West Cork and parts of Kerry where it was very profitable.  It has been wiped out by the broiler industry.</P>
      <P>Sheepkeeping on the small farm is becoming a very grave problem.  I know some of my colleagues feel the fall in the price of sheep and lambs at the moment is a great menace.  I think that dramatic fall at present is possibly a passing phase but there is this problem that keeping sheep on small holdings gives rise to problems of infestation of the land with worms and the old traditional problem of fluke is making sheepkeeping on smallholdings more and more complex.  I agree that so far as mountain sheepkeeping is concerned &mdash; and Deputy O'Connor probably knows a good deal more about that than I do coming, as he does, from Kerry &mdash; it may not be so badly affected but I mean small farmers in Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo and these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2464" /> I am just warning the House.  There is one remedy and one remedy only. I am coming to the end of what I have to say.  I implore the country to face this.  There is only one hope of stopping the haemorrhage of people from the land because no young man is going back to try to farm under the conditions I have described.  He will not stay on a holding of 30 or 40 acres which, in my boyhood, was wealth.  He is just leaving it and going into industrial employment in England in preference to it.  There is only one hope of saving the situation &mdash; if we are not too late &mdash; and that is the immediate and urgent implementation of the parish plan.  The maddening thing to me is that the Minister for Agriculture is starting pilot areas and this plan and that plan and the real fact is that he is moving over to the parish plan and is ashamed to say so.  Nothing but a crash programme can save the small farm and for the first time in my life, I am obliged to say in public with full sense of responsibility that I am not certain any longer that it is possible to save it.</P>
    <P>I think this is largely as a result of our own failure to put the parish plan into operation in time and reorganise the whole life of the small farmer in rural Ireland on an effective co-operative basis.  We could have done that at one time.  I remember when we started the land project and when we had the Young Farmers Association starting.  We had the enthusiastic young men then who would have been able to do it.  I doubt if they would be so enthusiastic now.</P>
    <P>I have a great regard for Deputy Dowling.  He reminded me yesterday of an old French grenadier coming back from the siege of Moscow, staggering along with his bayonet bent and his shoes flapping as he tramped through the Fianna Fáil snow but with his last shot he was trying to fight it out to the bitter end.  I like a man who can fight to the end.  But he has a hard task.  Every time he goes to his constituency in Dublin South-West his life must be agony.  He is as brave as a lion.  He had his papers there and he was diverted from them but he returned to them.  He dropped the papers and picked them up again and carried on <Col N="2465" /> but eventually he threw his hat at it and went out.  As he went, I said to myself: &ldquo;That is a loyal old grenadier. He does not let down his own.&rdquo;  I like that.  I am not sure that all the grenadiers are as loyal.  I see some heads poking out through the portholes looking for the hawser.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is a healthy thing to have Dáil Éireann full of rumours of which the country does not know. The rumour floating around this House for the last couple of months is that the Taoiseach is going to retire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You must say one thing for the Taoiseach: he is as hardworking a public servant as this country ever saw.  Nobody will deny him that.  If he did not work half as hard, he might not have done half as much harm.  Nobody will deny he worked hard: his worst enemy could not do that, but it is a common rumour that he is going to resign.  To tell the truth, I think he would be very well advised to do it.  There comes a time in the life of every man when he has done his part and it is no harm for him to move on to fresh woods and pastures new.  That is one rumour. A second rumour is that the Minister for Finance is going to succeed him after all the bloody bodies in the battle for succession have been laid in parallel rows, having slaughtered one another.  I think poor Deputy Lynch will be the ultimate victim and will be the next Taoiseach to control the warriors.  He will not be troubled with that burden very long if my judgment of politics is worth anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention this aspiration of his.  I wish people would read the speech he made in the Seanad last week when he said that everything was lovely, that the sun was coming up over the horizon and that we could all throw off our coats and bask in it. Capri would be nothing to Ireland.  I wish he would go and tell that to the hotel keepers in Rosslare.  However, I think he will get the job.  It is right that the people of the country should know what is going on but if he is <Col N="2466" /> going to take up that position, I hope he will learn a little more economics than he now appears to know.  I cannot undertake the task of educating him.  I have been at it too long but he should get some other mentor because whoever is instructing him now is off the beam.  He may have degrees a mile long but what he badly wants is a year's residence in proximity to our own people.  When all the theses are written and when all the soothsayers have finished saying &ldquo;sooth&rdquo; and when all the necromancers have concluded their magic and their tricks, it is ordinary people like myself and Deputy Moore and the Deputy from Kerry who live among and understand our people who are the best advisers on policy for Ireland. It was not right for Deputy MacEntee to say what he said when he said it but there was a hell of a lot of truth in what he said.</P>
    <P>Here is the last word I have to say. Mr. Roosa delivered a lecture in Washington recently and explained how an expanding economy, an investment in expansion, depends on a stable cost of living.  I beg Deputies to read it.  I shall not read it to the House now but I shall show it to Deputies: here it is.  It is available to anybody who writes and asks for it to the Per Jacobson Foundation, Washington, D.C.  If anyone wants it, I shall give him the address.  He has only to ask for it and he will get it.</P>
    <P>It was Mr. Frere, speaking under the same patronage in the context of a rising cost of living and a decline in the value of money, who said:</P>
    <P>In the presence of unstable money, the country's economy is, in any case, destined to stagnate until such time as the Government collapse and make way for new men.</P>
    <P>That time has come in Ireland.  When my friend, Deputy Dowling, from South Dublin says, in effect, &ldquo;You did not make any constructive suggestion in the course of this long debate&rdquo;, I shall make to him, in conclusion, the same suggestion as I made when I began.  There is only one constructive proposal that Fine Gael or any responsible Opposition <Col N="2467" /> could make in our present circumstances, &ldquo;bust&rdquo; as we are: go away and make room for new men.</P>

I think I can honestly say, probably in company with all the members of this House, that there is no Deputy to whom it is a greater pleasure to listen than Deputy Dillon.

      <P>The purpose of this debate is, of course, to review the economy of the State and the performance of the Government in relation to the economy and in relation to all aspects of Government policy.  It does appear to me, from what has been said on the Fine Gael benches, in particular, earlier in the debate, and even from the short amount I have heard from Deputy Dillon, that certain things have gone to their heads.  It perpetually amazes me how the Fine Gael Party can, with monotonous regularity, go into an election saying&mdash; and I think believing &mdash; that they will win and, having lost, come back and tell us and the country that they have won.  I suppose it is a defence mechanism which has been built in, over the years, in a Party who have not now, who have not had for many years and who never will in the future have any prospect whatsoever of forming a Government as a Party on their own.</P>

For their own peace of mind, perhaps it is just as well that they cannot, but, for the rest of us, it is necessary, perhaps, now and again to draw attention to the facts.  We know that the recent Presidential election has been regarded apparently by the Fine Gael Party as an indication that they are going to sweep the country.</P>

      <P>It might be worth while spending a little time dwelling on just what can be read into the Presidential election.  In the first place, it is quite clear that the Fine Gael Party went into the election and conducted the campaign on the basis that they were asking people to vote against the Government.  It is equally clear that we went into the election telling the people that this was not the issue before the people, that the issue was the election of the best man for President.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the symptoms were somewhat similar.  The principal difficulty was the balance of payments problem, but it was accompanied by other difficulties, too.  It has not escaped the notice of many people that, in dealing with the situation now, we had this advantage: since 1959, the country was making unprecedented strides, averaging an annual growth rate of four per cent and that, of course, helped the economy very much to take the strain.  Perhaps more important was the fact that, unlike our predecessors in 1956, we did not panic, but every effort was made on the other side of this House to cause us to panic. We did not panic.  We took the measures necessary, and no more measures than were necessary, and in quite a short time, signs are already showing that these measures are paying off and, by the end of the year, we shall certainly be back on an even keel again.</P>

      <P>There was, of course, an international capital shortage, balance of payments difficulties in other countries, particularly in Britain, inflation. All these things, apart from any difficulties within our own economy, contributed to the difficulty.

I prefer to take the more charitable view that the misrepresentation was due to the usual Fine Gael lazy amateurism, their failure to do their homework, a failure to which the Taoiseach has referred on numerous occasions.</P>

      <P>If Deputy L'Estrange would pay a little attention, instead of spewing out silly remarks, remarks which are not based on fact, he might learn something and, as a result, he might make less of a fool of himself. I am trying to save the Fine Gael <Col N="2474" /> Party from themselves.  The actual words I used were in Irish and the translation into English &mdash; I should say I was referring to the policy which had been adopted at the foundation of the State in relation to the teaching of Irish in the schools &mdash; for those who apparently did not understand what I said in Irish was:</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary in any case to go beyond the scientific principle of osmosis which ordains that it is the stronger solution which absorbs the weaker and not the reverse.</P>
      <P>Unilingualism was the aim and Irish was to be the language.  That aim was based, of course, on the incontrovertible principle that there is no such thing as a bilingual community or a bilingual culture. Nothing such exists anywhere. There are communities which have two languages, or even more&mdash; Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, for example.  But in each such case the communities existing within the greater community are basically unilingual: that is they have one language as a mould and thesaurus for creative literature and a second (or even a third) language as a means of communication with the world outside....  That is a linguistic fact which cannot be gain-said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore the philosophy which ordained that Irish should be restored through the schools was fundamentally sound.  But the mistake which was made was to believe that that could be done suddenly. It was not understood that there would be more than one stage in the process: that as a first step a basic knowledge of the language would have to be imparted to the great majority of the people of the country; that there would then be a period&mdash;however long or short&mdash; when all the people would know both Irish and English, but that Irish during that period would be more a means of communication than a vehicle of culture; and finally, as Irish gained strength, that it would eventually take the place of English as the vehicle of culture so that <Col N="2475" /> English would be (finally) the second language, the language of converse with the world outside.</P>

I said that at no stage had I ever advocated the abandonment of English in this country and that, in fact, if by any chance we found ourselves without English, we would have to start in the morning to learn English, because it is obvious that we must have at least one world language and preferably more than one.  It would be crazy for us to think otherwise. Those are the facts.  As I say, I am trying to save the Fine Gael Party from themselves in basing any of their alleged policies on misconceptions.</P>

      <P>Our society is changing and changing rapidly.  Already we are in an era of free trade with Britain and close to an era of free trade with Europe.  It is clear that the requirements of our people are such that we must modernise as far as we can all our institutions.  We must ensure as far as we can that we increase production. We must ensure that we can export. This country is more dependent than any other country in the world on exports.  If we do not export not alone will we fail to provide full employment but we will lose the employment we have, our standard of living will go down and efforts to create a just social order will be futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that in these circumstances it is very necessary that measures should be taken in relation to workers who are going to be affected adversely by the changes that will <Col N="2478" /> take place.  How can we do this unless our economy is progressing, unless we are making enough money to provide for this?  Therefore, my complaint, largely, against the Labour Party in this matter is that they have been guilty of the gravest conservatism in their approach to free trade in their approach to the modernisation of the trade union structure.  They stand up and they preach about the doctrines which evolved at the beginning of this century, and earlier, in Britain and they hold these up as the Sermon on the Mount.  They know surely as well as we do that it is not in the interests of the trade unions or of their members, or in the interests of the community, but they are afraid to get up and say that changes are needed, that changes must take place.</P>
    <P>They know as well as I do that when any change takes place, there is always an element in the community who are basically conservative and against any change.  They know there will be resistance and that they will be attacked by such people, but they have been unable to summon up the moral courage to say, as some trade union leaders have said, that this has to be done.  What do we get here from the Labour Party?  We get allegations that we are trying to ruin the trade union movement, trying to take away the rights of the trade unions.  They know that if there is any Party in this country with a record it can be proud of in regard to its relations with workers, it is the Fianna Fáil Party. We are very proud of that record and the electorate have shown that they believe this, too.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my view that the Labour Party have been guilty of the grossest conservatism and they are holding back, to the extent that they can, the progress of the country. There is an urgent necessity for progress in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  We cannot afford this kind of delay; we cannot afford this kind of obstruction.</P>

      <P>The structure of our <Col N="2479" /> society is changing and changing rapidly.  The relationships between town and country, between church and people, between Government and governed, between employees and workers, are all changing and changing rapidly.  The educational plans under way at present will accelerate that process of change.  The proportion of young people to old is changing and with the lowering average marriage rate, that change is going to accelerate also.</P>
      <P>All of this means that we now have an opportunity to shape a new pattern of society, retaining what is best in our past to ensure that the society we get has the kind of moral fibre we all want to see but with a more just social order than we have had.  In other words, we have an opportunity, and a great opportunity, to achieve the aims of the 1916 Proclamation.  But these aims will not be achieved by faint-heartedness, by conservatism, by playing on grouses, or by denigrating things Irish and national.  This will merely sap our own self-confidence and make us waste our energies in futile dispute.  What is required is a mobilising of all that is best in our people, a mobilising of their enthusiasm and their well-demonstrated willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of the nation.  But they must know what the nation is.  They must not have doubts cast in their minds as to whether we have a nation at all. If we are to make progress, and if we are to harness all that is best in our people, they must be helped to realise we are a nation and must work as a nation and that, if we fail to do so, we will fail completely.  This nation has this opportunity, a great opportunity. There is a place in that work for every Party in this House.  I hope every Party will play their part but, whether they do or not, we in Fianna Fáil will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party have submitted a motion to the effect that this House has no confidence in the Government and we set out the reasons we felt it necessary to do this.  The main reason for our <Col N="2480" /> putting down that motion was that there is no doubt that it is a clear reflection of the people's thoughts.  This Dáil has been in existence for a little over 12 months.  During the 1965 election campaign, the Taoiseach and his Ministers went around telling the people how prosperous we were and how good things were under a Fianna Fáil Administration.  They told the people that the only way in which they could not only maintain our prosperity but improve the lot of the people was to return a Fianna Fáil Government. There is no doubt that that was the utmost in political dishonesty, because whatever about the sheep, the Government must have known how serious was the situation into which we were drifting.</P>
      <P>I said in this House before, and I repeat, that &ldquo;Lemass leading on&rdquo; was not too sure that he would be leading on and he wanted to have an each way bet.  The whole trick was to tell the people how good things were and that they would continue to be good if Fianna Fáil were returned to power. If that worked, it would be grand, and if it did not, they knew that all this trouble was coming up and they could blame the other fellows who came in. We now find that there is no money available for health, education, housing or anything else that is required by the ordinary people.  We know that as far as the housing situation is concerned, there are no prospects in this city of Dublin of houses being provided for people with four, five or six in family in some cases.  There is no prospect in the immediate future of very many of those people with that size family being housed.  They are condemned to live in one room and they have no prospect of being offered alternative accommodation.  They are not only living in one room but they are living in a room that has been declared unfit for human habitation. That is as a result of: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  We have heard the Minister &mdash; I am not sure whether he is for Education or Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We in the Labour Party welcomed his remarks this morning because it has suddenly dawned on him and his colleagues in the Government that the danger to Fianna Fáil lies here.  That is why the Minister was so concerned about making such an attack on the Labour Party.  He is right: we are the danger. I want to tell the Minister what the workers of this country have received from the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is a great pity that a few of the Dublin Deputies are not here, who were such staunch Fianna Fáil men and, according to themselves, such staunch trade unionists, although to me it is a contradiction.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have handed out a standstill order to the workers, a turnover tax which can only be described as vicious, which puts taxation on clothes, food, medicines and every conceivable thing necessary for an ordinary workingman to buy in order to live.  We had the Taoiseach and his Ministers telling the workers of this country a very short while ago that all they could possibly get was three per cent but the workers knew where their interest lay then.  It lay in their trade unions and it lay in this Party here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the Party the Minister would invite the workers to support?  As the Minister indicated very clearly by his attack this morning on the Labour Party, it has even dawned on Fianna Fáil that the jig is up.  Yesterday evening Deputy Corry from Cork said that the Presidential election was a vote of confidence by the people.  I do not want to dwell on the Presidential election.  We will leave that between the two contestants but I would like to comment and say this in all sincerity.  I find it hard to make such a comment on a man who is so much older than myself but I think it has to be made.  I find it hard to believe that a Deputy, probably one of the staunchest workers of this House, could make a statement to the effect that because Dublin exercised its democratic right and rejected the Fianna Fáil candidate for the presidency &mdash; this, mind you, is a Deputy of this House talking about the capital city of this country &mdash; the only mistake the Germans made when they bombed this city during the war was that they did not wipe it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know one family at least who lost both mother and father as a result of that bombing.  I did not mind Deputy Corry so much because, quite frankly, his remarks could only be inspired by his ignorance, but what I took grave exception to was those staunch Fianna Fáil Deputies, and Deputy Dowling in particular, sitting listening &mdash; I do not know where the Minister was: it was his constituency which was bombed &mdash; in silence.  Because of Deputy Dowling's silence, one can only conclude he agreed with Deputy Corry, or there might be another explanation. Obviously, it has been handed down to the lower rank: any slanderous remark you can think up about the Labour Party or members of the Labour Party, use it because they are the danger.  We had Deputy Dowling <Col N="2483" /> who was so preoccupied in thinking up a slanderous remark &mdash; or possibly he aspires to take over from the archmudslinger, Deputy MacEntee &mdash; that he had not time to dissociate himself from such a despicable comment by one who is reputed to be a responsible Deputy in this House.  What Dublin city did in the Presidential election is only a warning of things to come for Fianna Fáil in this city, and there is no doubt, and I repeat this, Sir, that the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly those at the top &mdash; it might not have filtered through to the others yet &mdash; realise that Labour is definitely arriving.  They are worried because they also know that when they were rejected so overwhelmingly in this city in the Presidential election what Dublin does today Ireland does tomorrow. The Government the Minister invites the workers of this country to support &mdash; and, let us face it and be honest, the workers have been misguided enough in the past to give them a considerable amount of support &mdash; this benevolent Government who are so concerned about the interests of the workers, and who have warned them against the conservatism of the Labour Party, are responsible for the conditions in this country today.</P>
    <P>They are responsible for employment, for housing, for health and for education, and in none of these fields is there money available.  I know, and I am sure the Minister for Education must know, as he is a Deputy elected for Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They <Col N="2484" /> were told &ldquo;You have all the qualifications and we did tell you that if you met these requirements the money would be available to you but there is no money&rdquo;.  The local authority will tell you there is no money.  The Minister for Local Government will tell you anything except that there is no money.  He will tell you, when he is asked about the housing scheme in Ballymun that was supposed to cure all our ills, that it actually rains in Ballymun.  What a revelation!  It rains in Ballymun.  It apparently does not rain in Edenmore or Coolock.  They are building houses there.  I envy the Minister a constituency with such a wonderful climate.</P>
      <P>The people made a mistake in 1965 when they elected a Fianna Fáil Government.  They are entitled to make a mistake: that is their democratic right.  But it is also their democratic right to change their minds and wake up, and they have done that.  The only honest thing the people can expect from the Government is to be allowed an opportunity of giving their effective opinion on the mismanagement of the Fianna Fáil Government and also, we are quite confident, of giving the Minister for Education his answer as to where they think the workers' interests lie.  We have no doubt in the world. We have no fears of an election.  Have Fianna Fáil any fears?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are drawing to the end of one of the most eventful parliamentary years since the foundation of this State, a year in which there has been unprecedented industrial unrest, an unprecedented shortage of capital for worthwhile projects, a year in which on two occasions it has been found necessary by the Government to operate the Offences against the State Act against, first of all, workers who were demanding what they considered to be their rights and, in the second place, against the farming community who found it necessary to parade outside Leinster House to focus the attention of the Government and the public on the fact that they were being neglected, and disgracefully neglected.  This is a <Col N="2485" /> year in which the Government found it necessary to introduce emergency legislation at short notice to compel workers to work, to make it illegal for workers to strike and to prescribe penalties which would mean the imprisonment of workers, and a year in which we have had a Budget introduced in the early days of March, two months earlier than ever before, and yet followed by another Budget nine weeks later, both of which imposed blistering taxation without prescribing any incentives of any description to encourage production, to encourage employment or to improve the lot of the people.  It is a year, as I said, in which we have had unprecedented industrial unrest.</P>
      <P>The best known name in this country in the year 1966 must surely be the name of Mr. Dermot McDermott, the Chief Conciliation Officer of the Labour Court whose name we have heard on every news bulletin and whose name we have read in the newspapers every day intervening in strikes, trying to get people back to work.  In this year of 1966 as the parliamentary year draws to an end, we have had the banks of this country on strike for, I think, nearly three months now.  The extraordinary thing about the bankers' strike is that nobody seems to be in the slightest concerned about it; it seems to be a relief to many people because, for months past and indeed for years past, the principal occupation or exercise of the banks in this country had been to try to get in money due to them.  They had ceased, over 12 months ago, to be a source of credit to the farming community, the industrial community or the business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, therefore, any surprise that this parliamentary year should end with a debate on two motions of no confidence in the present Government. The object of the introduction of the votes of no confidence is to defeat the Government Party in the Dáil, to force a general election and bring about a change of Government. Unfortunately we know that, due to the present constitution of this House and the fact that the majority of the <Col N="2486" /> Members were elected under false pretences and the fact that certain Independent Deputies in this House will take no part in this debate or in the vote which follows, the Government Party will not be defeated.  But even in those circumstances, it is the duty of the Opposition Parties to challenge the Government on occasions like this at the end of a parliamentary year.  However, these votes of no confidence should not be necessary because the people of this country, particularly the people of Dublin and Greater Dublin, the people of Cork city and county and the people of Ireland in general, have already indicated to this Government that they have no confidence in them and want a change of Government.</P>
    <P>I believe the Labour Party honestly put down their vote of no confidence in the hope of bringing about a general election and a change of Government. However, I am afraid the Labour Party, while being honest, have, nevertheless, been guilty of tactics which were less effective than tactics they might have employed in bringing about a change of Government.  Already, on 1st June, thousands and thousands of Labour supporters in this country, without any definite lead from the Parliamentary Labour Party, and indeed against the advice of some of the members of that Party, registered an emphatic protest against the present Government and demanded in no uncertain terms that there be a general election and a change of Government.</P>
    <P>However, I feel &mdash; and I say this in no critical spirit but only in the sense that I believe it is a pity the Labour Party did not use the most effective means at their disposal to put out this Government &mdash; I believe that the Labour Party should have, through one means of communication or another, in the month of May, indicated to the people of this country that they believed this Government were as bad, as rotten and as unsound as the House says they are; they should have communicated to the people of the country, to their supporters that they should have registered a protest on 1st June &mdash; that is all I say: should have registered a protest <Col N="2487" /> against the present Government and present Government policy &mdash; by voting against the Fianna Fáil nominee in the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that, had they done that, they would have done a good service to this country.  The candidate who opposed Government policy in that election would not have been defeated by a paltry 10,000 votes. He would have won and we would not now be debating in the Eighteenth Dáil.  We would have been here, re-assembled, in the Nineteenth Dáil with a different Government, a different policy and a different outlook.  However, all we can do now is remind the Government that they have been rejected by the people, that notice to quit has been served upon them and that they should take heed of that fact and accede to the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>Now I know, as the House knows, that this debate, coupled with two votes of no confidence in the Government, is an important occasion, an occasion when one would expect the Government Party to come in, first of all, to defend their record and, secondly, to put before the people their plans for the future.  From the Government side of the House, since this debate began at 10.30 yesterday morning, we have heard the Taoiseach in a speech which lasted half an hour, although there was no time limit on him.  I think I am correct in saying he was supported during yesterday by Deputy Corry from Cork, who, as I said here last week, is part of the price a country must pay for democracy. The Taoiseach was supported by Deputy Dowling and then it did appear that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would intervene in this debate.  He offered to speak but he gave away to Deputy Dillon and, as this debate proceeded, it became apparent that the Government considered that the ex-Minister for Education, now the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should speak instead.</P>
    <P>That appeared to me to be an indication that we were to hear the record of the Government defended, and to hear the Government's plans <Col N="2488" /> for the future from a man who is regarded as one of the top brass of the Fianna Fáil Party, a member of the economic cabinet, a man for whom I have the greatest respect, both as an individual and as a Minister.  I must say that nothing made it clearer to me during this debate, or during this parliamentary year, that the Government had no defence for their record and no plans for the future, than the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce a short time ago.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley, then, betwixt and between the Ministries of Education and Industry and Commerce.  I believe that if there were a case to be made, if there were a defence to be put forward for the state of the country at present, if the Government had any plans for the future, they could instruct no better man, to use a modernism, to put it forward than Deputy Colley, Minister for Education at the moment, and shortly to be Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>He made a short speech.  He resurrected the patriot dead and accused the Labour Party of appropriating the patriot dead.  To me that sounds extraordinary coming from the Party who, since the foundation of the State, have more than any other Party claimed an exclusive right in the men who died in 1916, who never endorsed any of the Fianna Fáil Party's programmes because that Party was not founded until 1926.  He went on to say there were wonderful opportunities for this country and that, whether or not other Parties did so, the Fianna Fáil Party would exploit these opportunities to the full.  One thing Deputy Colley did not tell us was what these opportunities were.  Three things he did not tell us: how this country got into the present mess; what the opportunities for the future are; and how the Government propose to exploit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have treated <Col N="2489" /> this debate and these votes of no confidence in the casual manner in which they have been treating the Irish people for a great many years.  I admit they have got away with it for a good many years, but I think they will not get away with it any longer.  That was clearly indicated on 1st June when, despite their cunning, despite their political ingenuity, despite their political experience, in putting forward what they considered to be the best and only candidate at their disposal, they escaped from the people by a mere whisker.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude my remarks on this aspect of the matter by saying that I do not think it is good enough for the Government who have got the country into the state it is now in, to come in here to an important debate like this and offer the Taoiseach for half an hour, followed by Deputy Corry with a display of buffoonery for I do not know how long, followed by a well-meaning but junior back bencher, Deputy Dowling, followed by the disappointing performance of the Minister for Education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in opening this debate glibly dismissed these votes of no confidence as being of no importance. He said the important point was that the Government should continue to have confidence in themselves and in their policies.  I think I am quoting him correctly.  I want to say there is abundant evidence up and <Col N="2490" /> down the country that the Government have confidence neither in themselves nor in their policies.  Their policies are changing from day to day.  I think I can prove that conclusively by discussing for a short time the happenings in this House during 1966.  The Taoiseach says the Government have confidence in themselves and in their policies, but in the early days of March of this year, they introduced a Budget in which they said there was no necessity to provide additional supports for the farming community and, during the course of that debate, the claims of the farmers were resisted, although everyone knew that the door of the Department of Agriculture was being hammered upon, and that appeals were being made to the Taoiseach by the NFA and the ICMSA demanding that the farmers should get fair play, demanding that the farmers should get a fair share of the national income.</P>
    <P>Yet, in the early days of March of this year, this Government who have confidence in themselves and their policies introduced a Budget in which they did not provide one brass farthing for additional agriculture supports, but, before the debate on that Budget had terminated, additional supports were given to the farming community for milk, for lambs, etc., which had not been provided for in the Budget and which were resisted and resisted strongly.  Are they a Government confident in themselves and in their policies, as the Taoiseach said &mdash; a Government who cannot budget for nine weeks ahead, a Government who cannot make up their minds in the month of March what the requirements of the farmers will be in the month of May?</P>
    <P>This Government who, as the Taoiseach says, are confident in themselves and confident in their policies, resisted at the last general election, the necessity for a Ministry of Labour, though it was advocated by the Fine Gael Party.  Now they come in here with legislation implementing the Fine Gael policy on the necessity for a Ministry of Labour.  The same Government who say they are confident in <Col N="2491" /> themselves and in their policies spoke through their Taoiseach in March, 1965, and said they believed an incomes policy was so much nonesense &mdash; that an incomes policy worked only in Communist countries, that they would not operate it in Government and would resist it in Opposition.</P>
    <P>That same Taoiseach comes in here during the present parliamentary year and advocates an incomes policy and says it is necessary if the economy of the country is to progress.  We have further evidence that this Government are neither confident in themselves nor in their policies in the recent change of Ministers.  This Government have been in office only since April, 1965, and we then had appointed Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Health and Deputy Colley as Minister for Education. There can be no doubt whatever about it that those two Departments were controversial Departments in the last general election campaign.  The health policy of the Government was attacked right, left and centre.  The educational policy was attacked from all angles.</P>
    <P>We had appointed to these two Departments two young, energetic Ministers.  During the year the Minister for Health produced a White Paper in which he promised to implement the Fine Gael policy on health. Admittedly, he stated that he could not implement it until next year, but surely if that is the continued health policy of the Government, one would have thought the Minister for Health should be allowed to remain in the Custom House and introduce the legislation he promised to introduce in November of this year.  That was his promise during the debate on the White Paper.  He said that in November, 1966, he would lay before the House legislation to implement a great portion of his White Paper.</P>
    <P>Are we to be told now that Deputy Seán Flanagan, the new Minister for Health, could not be expected in a few months to become sufficiently familiar with his Department to introduce the necessary Bills to implement the White Paper?  It seems to me to be an indication that there is a <Col N="2492" /> change in the Government's policy on health.  Usually a change of Ministers means that.  If the Government were confident in themselves and in their policies, why did they not leave the Minister for Health in the Custom House to introduce the necessary Bills to implement the White Paper or to explain to the country why he did not introduce them?</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Education, an able man, a likeable man, an approachable man, a man of considerable ability, removed from the Department of Education and transplanted to the filleted Department of Industry and Commerce which is not now responsible for semi-State bodies, not responsible for labour troubles &mdash; indeed it is difficult to see what he will have to do there.  Is his transfer an indication that the Government are accepting the Fine Gael policy on education?  Is it an indication from the Government that they are about to have second thoughts on educational policy?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It does not seem to me to be the action of a Taoiseach who is confident in his Government, confident in their policies, a Taoiseach who believes he has the best Cabinet in Europe and probably the best placed Ministers in Europe. The Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to extricate himself from the statement that has been attributed to him that he would convert this country not into a bilingual society but into an Irish-speaking country.  He now denies that and, like so many of his illustrious predecessors, states that he has been wrongly reported or wrongly translated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his short speech had something to promise, something that would solve all our difficulties. On this occasion it was his old friend the European Economic Community. When I entered the Seanad for the first time, it was a foregone conclusion that we would be in the Common Market by 1st January, 1964.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers were then confident that the turnover tax and everything else would be forgotten, would be submerged in the state of <Col N="2493" /> affairs that would exist following our admission into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We did not get into the Common Market; neither did England, and I am not blaming the Taoiseach for that.  I am sure he was very disappointed. However, he told us yesterday that we may be invited into the EEC at very short notice &mdash; that we may not even have time to change our clothes before accepting the invitation.  I charge the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, with creating a situation here which equips us badly to enter into competition with the other countries of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach, as I interpret his speech, the only solution he has for our present ills is entry into the Common Market.  If we go into the Common Market, there may be advantages to be reaped but there will also be keen competition to be met.  It is not going to be a question of take all and give nothing.  We shall have to prove ourselves.  Our farmers and industrialists will have to be able to compete with the best, and it is the duty of the Government, particularly a Government who have for years past been advocating our entry into the Common Market, so to regulate our economy, so to regulate industry and agriculture, that our industrialists and farmers will not go in under a severe handicap.</P>
    <P>Let us think for a moment about what Government policy has done to equip us for entry into the Common Market.  We have a state of industrial unrest here the like of which this country never experienced, except perhaps in the fateful year 1913, before I was born.  I blame the Government for the industrial unrest there is today.  The Government have been in power since 1957 without a break, and they cannot pass this baby on to anybody else.  I blame them for the present industrial unrest and accuse them of bringing it about by the removal of the food subsidies in 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Coupled with, as Deputy L'Estrange says, the status increase, the child of Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I believe that he and the former Deputy Lenehan begot the status increase.  In 1962 in the Seanad they were saying the national cake had grown to such proportions that it would be unfair or unjust to debar any section of the community, whether they had enough money or not, from sharing the fruits of the buoyant and flourishing national economy.  I blame them for bringing the present situation about.  In 1964, the Taoiseach said the economy could afford an increase of only seven per cent, at the most, in the national wage packet.  Yet, for dishonest political motives, in order to avoid a national wage discussion at the same time as two vital by-elections, he said: &ldquo;Let it rip; give them the 12 per cent and things will work out.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is entering into the Common Market, we are told by the Taoiseach, at a time when there is no capital for agriculture, when there is no capital for industry, when there is no money available for anything. This Government have a heavy sin to answer for if we are accepted into the Common Market under a severe handicap. <Col N="2495" /> I should like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to tell us, if he speaks, and if not, whoever is concluding on this debate, whether the Government believe we are as well equipped to enter into and compete in the EEC as the other members.</P>
    <P>There has been a long discussion here about housing and who built how many houses, about whether Dublin Corporation discharged their obligations, whether there are enough houses in Dublin or whether Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government fell down on housing in Dublin.  I should like to question whether the housing programme in the country in general has met the requirements of the people.  I do not propose to spend any time arguing as to whether or not there are enough houses for the workers of Dublin: it is evident there are not.  It is evident that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance have fallen down and fallen down miserably in the provision of houses for the people of Dublin.  We do not have to do any reading or any great research to establish that fact.</P>
    <P>I was utterly amazed, as a country Deputy, to hear the Minister for Local Government say that unless a man and his wife and three children, constituting a family of five, are occupying one room in the city of Dublin, Dublin Corporation are not interested in them and are not prepared to do anything about them.  That is what I understood the Minister for Local Government to say in reply to a Parliamentary Question, and I understood that there are 700 such families.  If that is so, it is a national disgrace; if it is not so, it should be contradicted.  I should have thought it would be a disgrace to have an elderly man and woman, sleeping, washing, cooking and living in one room, but when I hear that there are married people with one child, two, three and four children, living in one room, and that Dublin Corporation are not prepared even to take their names at the present time, I think that is scandalous.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The people cannot be blamed for that. The Minister for Local Government should enlist the good offices of the Minister for Transport and Power in getting that little matter attended to. There are these houses there and the people are not getting them.  I understand that there is a long delay in the completion of the Ballymun scheme and that the weather has been blamed. I should like the Minister for Local Government to tell us what proportion of the delay is attributable to bad weather.  That is a fair question to which we should get an answer.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in opening the debate, stated that he had confidence in the Government and confidence in his policy.  The Department of Education is behaving in a most extraordinary manner.  They are advocating more extensive education and the introduction of comprehensive schools and a common intermediate certificate and at the same time they are reducing the amount of money available to vocational education committees. Other Deputies have dealt with their failure to implement their promises about secondary schools.  I shall deal only with vocational education because I happen to be a member of a committee and know what I am talking about in that connection.</P>
      <P>The grant payable to Cavan Vocational Education Committee is being reduced in the year 1966-67 as compared with 1965-66 by £4,587 and at the same time, we are expected to provide better facilities for education and to extend the common intermediate certificate course to various schools.  I ask myself have the Government taken leave of their senses or do they think the people are dumb or do not know what is going on.  Deputy Colley, Minister for Education, seemed to say to me yesterday that more education could be provided in 1966 than in 1965 for less money.  That was his argument as I understood it.  That is their policy on education.</P>
      <P>During the past few days we had a long discussion in this House on housing.  In regard to Dublin city, they are not really concerned about entrances to houses.  Deputy Dillon spoke this morning about young people getting married and young men inviting girls to join them in matrimony and live in the ancestral home. The rural improvements scheme was a scheme which enabled country lanes, some one mile long leading to houses, to be repaired.  That scheme, for all practical purposes, has been dropped.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is merged into the rural improvements scheme.  I am telling Deputy O'Connor, because he interrupted me, that my information is that only half the amount of money will be spent on these schemes this year compared with last year &mdash; that is reliable information &mdash; notwithstanding that the cost of doing these schemes has increased considerably. That is something the Government must take responsibility for, something that will drive people out of rural Ireland.  Teenagers, and people of 20 years of age or so, do not want to walk out through these lanes up to their ankles in water and muck.  A <Col N="2502" /> comparatively small sum of money &mdash; it could be dealt with in thousands and certainly would not go into the million &mdash; would do much of this work. It is a sorry state of affairs when the country has gone so far that the hatchet must be used on rural improvements schemes.</P>
      <P>Last year we had a Bill introduced with a great fanfare of trumpets.  That was the Land Bill which was supposed to provide land for everybody when it became an Act.  We were accused of obstructing it because we insisted on some objectionable sections being deleted and we fought tooth and nail, through Deputy Hogan and other Deputies, about the section which would prevent the sale of land to foreigners.  The Bill became law and we were told the effect would be that congestion would be relieved and there would be more land for forestry and all the rest of it.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I was told by the Minister for Lands that in County Cavan in 1963-64 his Department acquired 737 acres for forestry; in 1964-65, they acquired 730 acres and in 1965-66, after the coming into operation of this Land Act, they acquired 172 acres. For the relief of congestion in the same county in 1963-65, they acquired 827 acres; in 1964-65, 543 acres; and in 1965-66, 341 acres.  That is what the Land Act has brought about. Cavan is a county in which there is plenty of land suitable for forestry and where there are hordes of people seeking to be transferred to larger farms in richer counties and many people are prepared to surrender their small farms for more suitable farms elsewhere, which operation would effect the relief of congestion in County Cavan.  But the Government's approach to it is to cut down the acreage acquired from 827 in 1963-64 to 341 in 1965-66.  That is something of which the Government should be ashamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the economic state of the country, I should like to deal in a general way with some other points. I think the Government discriminate unfairly against their opponents.  They could not even organise the 1916 <Col N="2503" /> Commemoration ceremonies on a fair and decent basis.  They excluded, either deliberately or through incompetence, many leaders, many public men from a place of honour on the platform at the GPO on Easter Sunday. The Taoiseach said it happened through a mistake.  It is a mistake that should not happen.  If there had been Members of the Opposition on the Committee, it could not have happened. Invitations for the Easter Week Ceremonies were sent out by the Government on Wednesday of Holy Week, Good Friday and Holy Saturday being bank holidays.  We were told that the other invitations were accidentally excluded, a page of names. Surely it is not reasonable to send somebody important, a busy person, an invitation on Wednesday of Holy Week to attend ceremonies during Easter Week?  I accuse the Government at best of bungling and, at worst, of absolutely dishonest and unfair discrimination.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with the disgraceful presentation by Telefís Éireann of the Presidential election campaign.  I say there was discrimination in the worst possible form and it is no answer for the Minister or the Chairman of Telefís Éireann to tell the people of the country that it was the practice never to cover the Presidential election. Did they not know perfectly well that while they were blacking out one candidate completely, they were building up the other candidate day after day and night after night on Telefís Éireann?  That is something I charge the Government with, something of which they should be ashamed.  If those who were operating Telefís Éireann honestly believe they were impartial, they are not fit to be in charge of Telefís Éireann or of any service paid for at public expense.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Mention has been made here on several occasions &mdash; I am dealing with Telefís Éireann &mdash; of the appointment of the new Chairman of Telefís Éireann, Dr. Andrews.  I want to deal <Col N="2504" /> with this as fairly as I can.  I personally am not blaming the Government for giving Dr. Andrews a gratuity on his retirement because apparently the terms of his appointment provided for that; I am not blaming the Government for giving Dr. Andrews a pension on his retirement because apparently his terms of appointment provided for that.  I am blaming the Government for giving a man who has been adequately provided for, by both a large gratuity and a generous pension, another job at £1,000 a year, in a field for which his years do not suit him.</P>
      <P>It may be going back very far but I am old enough to remember the time when the Minister's Party were saying that nobody was worth more than £1,000 a year.  I know the value of money has changed since then; of course I do.  I do not expect that £1,000 in 1930 is the same as £1,000 now but I do believe that when a man has served in the Civil Service or in any other sphere and has retired with a generous gratuity and on a more than adequate pension, he should not, over the heads of younger men, be put into another job at £1,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his remarks today, Deputy Dillon stated that the only salvation for rural Ireland is the implementation of the parish plan.  He stated that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries believed that but was not man enough to say it.  I was present at a function in County Cavan organised by the Killeshandra Co-Operative Society, one of the biggest societies in the country, a function to present prizes for a farm prize scheme, a scheme to encourage young farmers to keep their farm buildings better, to engage in better farming methods, to keep better stock and, generally, to organise their farms so that they will have better incomes and better lives.  The Minister was present at that function, as, indeed, were the heads of many bodies interested in agriculture.  That very worthwhile scheme was started in Killeshandra by the parish agent appointed by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  How right he was.  The great pity is that many more such parish agents were <Col N="2505" /> not appointed &mdash; indeed, one in every parish in the country.  If that had been done, and if they had not been ridiculed, we should be much better equipped today from an agricultural point of view to enter into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>These votes of no confidence will not be carried because, as I said in the beginning, the 72 Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting opposite me were elected in the last general election on false pretences.  They were elected on the speeches of the Taoiseach that conditions were never so good, that the people never had it so good and that all that was necessary to continue that state of affairs was to return them to office.  Deputy Gilbride laughs; I shall ask him if I am wrong.  I hope I shall be able to explain to him, in a very brief way, that what I am saying is correct.  Take the three slogans &ldquo;Stay with Prosperity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do not put back the Clock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Was Deputy Gilbride in the House in the month of July, 1965, when the Taoiseach came in here and, without a blush, without an explanation and without an apology, told Dáil Éireann that the country was in a bad way, that everybody would have to tighten his belt and pull his weight, wear a hairshirt <Col N="2506" /> and put up with sacrifices in order to get the country right again?

There is one thing that really disgusts me, and I say this in all sincerity: every time we come back, we are not three months back until the Opposition are shouting for another election.  Go to the country: face the people.  Yet, when we do go to the country, the result shows that the Opposition are not fit to be returned to office.  We have gone to the country time and time again.

They are taking no notice whatsoever of all these speeches, just as the electorate takes no notice when an election takes place.  Here is the Official Report carrying a Budget Statement by Deputy Sweetman.  I listened to it sitting on those benches over there.

      <P>This is not the last time this country will have to face a similar situation.  These things have a habit of recurring and no economist so far has been able to come up with the answer as to how they can be prevented.  There is, however, one thing we can do; we can strengthen the economy to enable us to ride the storm when the chill wind blows.  That is the difference between this occasion and the earlier occasion.  The country <Col N="2512" /> will pass through on this occasion unscathed.  As the figures show, it is already emerging.  We will be able to move on rapidly in a short time.</P>
      <P>Writing recently, one of the best known economists in the country said:</P>
      <P>No person could yet find an answer for an expanding economy when incomes increased that would prevent extra imports.  The increase in imports must always automatically follow on improved purchasing power in any country where the economy is expanding.</P>
      <P>No person has attempted to give the answer to that.  I do not think anybody really has the answer.  In an integrated community like Europe or even larger than Europe, it might be possible to have a centralised monetary fund which would enable that sort of thing to be avoided.  But, as society is organised in the world today, it seems to be quite unavoidable.  It is our ability to overcome that situation which is more important than anything else.  I think this one has been overcome very successfully.</P>
      <P>Does anybody think the day will ever come in this House when somebody will not be able to get up and say there is a poor man living somewhere in the country?  I do not think any Party will ever be in that position, but that is the sort of thing we have to listen to.  We had Deputy Dillon taking out of context a statement regarding somebody.  We had Deputy Mrs. Desmond talking about people who had to travel on a bus and whose increase was absorbed by this.  We will never reach a stage where you cannot pick out some unfortunate member of the community.  But, by and large, the people are enjoying a better standard of living than ever before.  Nobody is hungry.  Deputy Reynolds made a silly statement that farmers are dying of hunger.  That sort of thing does not get one anywhere.</P>

They have done it in every year in which there was an election and they will do so again.</P>
      <P>We have this talk about there being no confidence in the Government, but the fact remains there is confidence everywhere in the country today. People are prepared to come and invest in business enterprises of every type here, in spite of the fact that you people are trying to denigrate our efforts and undermine the economy in all your statements over the past six months.  This should prove to you how ineffective your efforts are.  If you ever did achieve Government, it would be better for yourselves when in Opposition to be realistic, face up to the situation and give credit where credit is due.  But making exaggerated statements only serves to undermine the confidence of anybody who ever had confidence in the Opposition.  The whole thing is stupid.

      <P>Last night Deputy Dillon did not speak on the no confidence motion &mdash; perhaps he does not agree with it &mdash; but he gave us a history <Col N="2515" /> of the time he was Minister.  It is on the record and should prove amusing reading.  He took a new line, but otherwise his speech was entirely the one we have heard a thousand times. As the Minister for Education has said, Deputy Dillon with his histrionics and demagogy is always worth hearing.  But, as I say, he gave his speech a new twist in that he claimed the Coalition ran the country into debt in an effort to build houses.  He went on to try to prove that the Marshall Aid was used to get dollars for people who were importing steel to build houses. He said last night that he would build no skyscrapers and I do not know where one uses steel to build houses. He said last night that he would build no skyscrapers and I do not know where one uses steel to build residential houses.  He said these people applied for money because they wanted steel to erect houses and the Coalition were glad to give it to them.</P>

As I said, it is a speech we heard a thousand times with a little new bit thrown in to the effect that they ran this country into debt in their attempt to build houses.  When we came into office, it was to find houses lying vacant.  It took us a long time to get back to the level of advancement again because the people were not there.  The position has improved very much now, or disimproved if you like, in so far as the number looking for houses are concerned, because the population of this city is growing every year.  It continues to expand but that is something that is happening all over the world; people are fleeing from the land to the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housebuilding is an activity with a fairly worthwhile labour content.  Very often when housebuilding is growing apace, it is creating problems for itself <Col N="2516" /> because you are building houses for people employed building houses. This is the type of vicious circle you have to face.  The prosperity of this city is considerably enhanced by the building trade.  As I say, you will actually reach the stage where you are building houses for people who build them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are thousands of people in Dublin looking for houses at present.  In 1957, there were houses vacant in Ballyfermot because there was nobody to occupy them, but today people there are living in overcrowded conditions, living in sub-tenancies which are not really legitimate.  Much time has been devoted to this question of housing because the Coalition Government in their time failed to do the job.  Now they want to harp on a situation which they feel will win them some sympathy, and to stress and overstress a situation we are tackling and will overcome. When that stage is reached, they will have to turn their attention to criticising something else, which we will most surely deal with successfully as we have often dealt with them before.  You need not have nay worries.  The harder the tasks the better we like them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon dealt with the question of priorities in housing and social services.  These are priorities certainly of a type and must always remain priorities, but if the economy is not advancing, there is not much good talking about social services or about extra money for education, extra money for social welfare, or extra money for anything. There is no use talking about these things unless the economy is sound <Col N="2517" /> and moving and made to move as rapidly as possible.  These other things are consequential and must necessarily follow so long as the Government have the will, as this Government always have had.</P>
      <P>The economy as a whole is most important and while Deputy Dillon would have us forget about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, there is not much good building houses if you have not got the people who can live in comfort in them and pay the rent and be able to support themselves and their families.  This is something which has been done and something which should automatically follow as the economy expands.  Any Government who think that they can continue their expansion of the economy, without having the problems which must necessarily follow, are living in a fool's paradise.  We are aware that the expansion which has taken place in the economy over the past five years, particularly the improved standard of living which has been brought about, must necessarily bring with it its own problems and its own difficulties.  That always happens.  I think our action in showing our cognisance of these things is in itself a sufficient guarantee that we will deal with them accordingly.  I do not think there is much time left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first to correct two misstatements of fact which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seems to have made.  First of all, he referred to the Marshall Aid loan after the last war and he queried the things upon which portion of that money was spent.  For the record, let it be said that in so far as the inter-Party Government of that period were concerned, the Marshall Aid funds were devoted towards the essential raw materials for building up this country.  I do not think anyone will controvert that.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister in referring to these funds, and in referring to what he regards as attacks on the economic position of the country, did not recall that very shortly after 1948, when Ireland received Marshall Aid assistance, the hoardings and billboards of this city were decorated with the pawnbroker's sign.  I wonder who did that?  That was an effort made in a contemptible fashion by the then Opposition to suggest that the sharing of this country in the Marshall Aid scheme for the building up of Europe was in some way putting this country into bond and endangering its future.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs also seems to forget that during the period of the then inter-Party Government, £16 million of the Marshall Aid fund was devoted to productive purposes and when they left office, they left £24 million of that fund behind.  How it was spent, what was done with it, is a matter of record but any Minister of a Fianna Fáil Government who is curious about it had better ask the Fianna Fáil Government as to the object to which it was devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to housing.  I do not intend to go in detail over the debates we have had on housing but it is fair to say that, when the present Fianna Fáil administration came into office in 1957, housing of all kinds, for the ensuing five years, decreased and declined, so much so that by 1962 the amount of local authority housing being carried out was at a dangerously <Col N="2519" /> low level.  Indeed, it was the strong reaction of the Opposition Parties at that time which eventually convinced the Government that they had to do something about housing.  Whatever progress has been made since &mdash; and it is very small &mdash; has been due to the determined role which the Opposition played in and around the years after 1957.</P>
    <P>I would like, having said that, to come back to this debate.  The debate, as was expected, has ranged around the economic and social policies, or perhaps lack of policies, of the Government. I do not think it unreasonable, or an exaggeration, for me to say that today there exists considerable uneasiness amongst many people as to where we are going.  Not only is there uneasiness but there is also cynicism amongst far too many people with regard to politicians, political Parties and political promises.  They have heard it all before.  Most young people today disregard the promises and undertakings given on behalf of the Government. That is due to the known contrast between the promises made not so long ago and the performances which the people can actually see. There is uneasiness and cynicism in Ireland in 1966, among people who only three years ago were told that by this year, 1966, there would be 35,000 new jobs for young men and women in this country &mdash; 35,000 extra Irish men and women were promised they would have, this year, gainful, lucrative employment in their own country.</P>
    <P>That was the promise.  The actual performance shows that in this year there are 6,000 fewer jobs and, compared with the promises, we have gone backwards to the extent of 41,000 jobs. There have been promises repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Taoiseach, and members of this Government over the years.  There have been promises of an expansion in health services and there have been promises of what would be done for education.  Indeed, it is worth recalling that in one of the major taxation debates and controversies in this House, only three years ago, concerning the turnover tax, the Fianna <Col N="2520" /> Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party at that time were so concerned with the public doubt and apprehension with regard to the turnover tax that they issued a public advertisement in the daily papers indicating to the people the benefits that were to flow from the imposition of that tax.</P>
    <P>What were those benefits?  They were an expansion in health services, an expansion in education, an expansion in housing, an expansion in employment and a definite move towards full employment.  We are now at a point almost four years after that advertisement was issued and those pledges given but, so far as the ordinary people are concerned, nothing has been done.  Our health services are still the same.  They are creaking with age, antiquated, embodying the poor-house, Victorian philosophy of the last century.  They are still good enough to allow any expansion being postponed until next year or the year after.</P>
    <P>The same applies to education. Something is about to be done but nevertheless, now in 1966, in an era of the greatest possible competition and strife amongst the people of the world, we are allowing our children every year to leave our schools, many of whom are forced to emigrate, without the educational qualifications to compete with the people in other countries. Yesterday, we had more of this from the Taoiseach.  We had another of those long speeches promising things to come.  He was at it again yesterday. We are to have full employment some day, somehow.  We are to have better health services, some day somehow. Now he has realised that a scientific explosion has hit the world.  Mothers and fathers have been talking about this for a number of years.  A scientific explosion has hit the world and we are to have an expansion in education some day somehow.</P>
    <P>I wonder how long the Taoiseach expects the people to accept from him the admonition: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;?  The plain fact is the people are not living now: they are leaving.  They are leaving every week and every month.  Even yesterday the Taoiseach conceded that the rate of <Col N="2521" /> emigration is a disappointment.  Of course it is.  That has been known to many people for many years.  We had blueprints about prosperity.  We had programmes that were to build up our country.  The plain fact is we seem to be going backwards.  There is less employment; more of our people are emigrating; taxation is increasing and social services are not attended to.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Taoiseach expects from the people?  He cannot say that the people have not been patient. He leads a Government now who are possibly the oldest Government in western Europe.  They are there for almost ten years.  The Taoiseach has been given every opportunity to fulfil his promises and his policies and I do not think he can complain that he has had a disruptive Opposition to contend with.  Certainly there have been no pawnbroking signs.  There have been no posters of that kind indicating that this country was being put in pawn.  The plain fact is that the progress which should have been made has not been made.</P>
    <P>Now, I believe that we will get out of the economic difficulties we have experienced.  I believe we could have got out of them sooner and earlier, were it not for the budgetary policies adopted this year, the fact that the two Budgets introduced prolonged the period of difficulty in the country.  I hope things will improve, and that we will see some solid advance being made by the Government in providing for the people the things they need now rather than at some indefinite date in the future.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that in the course of this debate reference should be made to the Presidential election campaign and to its result.  I am not going to make any comment on the significance of the result.  Everyone is entitled to his own opinion with regard to that, but I think certain things should be said about that election, about how it was conducted and about the features which appear to have engaged public attention and imagination, and I am glad to have the opportunity here in the closing debate of this <Col N="2522" /> session of the Dáil to say a few things on my own behalf.</P>
    <P>As one of the two candidates, I was subjected at times to virulent abuse from certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that those who were most vocal in the election campaign have been conspicuous by their absence in this debate and have had very little to contribute in a constructive way to the discussion here on the real economic and political problems that face the country.  I believe that in that election the people were prepared to reject any claim by any political Party that that Party alone were entitled to speak for this country.  I believe the people resented as arrogance, and without foundation, the claims made on behalf of Fianna Fáil that they alone were able to express Irish national ideals in modern times.  I believe the people generally felt that most political Parties and most people who engage in the public life of this country are endeavouring in their own way to contribute to the advancement of this country and I believe people desire more tolerance and less political character assassination.  I am certain that is one of the lessons that can be learned by those who are willing to learn from that election.</P>
      <P>Some things were said, and I am glad the Taoiseach is here at this moment. The Taoiseach at the commencement of the campaign proceeded to state what our national ideals were.</P>

      <P>As reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 11th May this year, the Taoiseach said that the national aims today are an Ireland not free merely but Gaelic as well, not Gaelic merely but free as well, not only free and Gaelic, but united as well.  That is a cliché, a catchphrase borrowed from the past.  It is something that many of us learned to say many years ago and it represented the <Col N="2523" /> idealism of a young nation struggling for freedom in the years before the Treaty, but it was used by the leader of a modern Government in 1966 in a Presidential election campaign.  For what purpose?  Was it to suggest that he, and the candidate he supported, alone can express Irish nationalism? Was it to impute in a snide kind of way a reflection on anyone who dared to oppose him?  He has an obligation now to express what he meant, to express in terms of Ireland in 1966 what he means by saying we are aiming today for a Gaelic Ireland and at the same time, a united Ireland.</P>
      <P>He has an obligation not to throw these phrases into the arena and leave them there to confuse and mystify young people, to confuse and mystify people who are still believing and hoping that some day all the people who live on this island will again accept responsibility for the country. What does he mean by a Gaelic Ireland and a united Ireland? Obviously, that speech was made in reply to, or certainly taking notice of, a speech I had made earlier in which I referred to the fact that 25 per cent of our people, people who live on this island, do not share the Celtic and Gaelic background of the majority but are nonetheless Irishmen, and merely because of that accident of history, are not to be banished and regarded as second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>I said that, in my view, their position had to be recognised and their right to pursue and hold dear their own background and their own culture must be protected.  I should like the Taoiseach now to tell us his views. Are we going to wipe out 25 per cent of our people the majority of whom live in the north-east portion of our country?  If we are not going to wipe them out why do we say we are aiming still to establish a Gaelic and United Ireland?  Is it any wonder when things like this are said, and not thought out, that young people are bewildered?  They do not know where we are going and what national ideals we are to pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that no responsible political leader today would <Col N="2524" /> aim at uniting our country, except with the support and the goodwill and the consent of all Irishmen concerned. Then, in a later speech, the Taoiseach went on to say that if there were not overwhelming support for the candidate he supported that would be taken as a signal and a sign of a national retreat.  I want to ask him now does he think this country as a nation is in retreat?  Does he think that the people who voted in that election were any the less Irishmen because they exercised a democratic right and a democratic choice?</P>
    <P>Then, he went on in another speech to say that if the candidate he supported did not receive a substantial majority our position would be misunderstood outside.  Again, I want to ask was there any reality in that, or was it merely an effort to suggest that the candidate whom he was not supporting was in some way nationally unsound and was not entitled to speak to Irishmen as an Irishman concerned, with them, for the future of the country?</P>
    <P>I do not mind what the Minister for Lands may have said; I disregard what the Minister for Social Welfare did say; I do not mind what Deputy MacEntee said.  It helped considerably, but I do resent the snide suggestion by the Taoiseach in that election campaign that, merely because I had not the support of the Fianna Fáil Party, I was in some way to be regarded as an object of scorn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in my view, the election has taught many people a lesson.  I believe it has indicated, whatever the political significance may be, that our people are beginning to think again.  They are beginning to realise that, in a highly competitive world, new solutions and new thinking must be applied to the problems which face our country.  We all recognise here &mdash; and I believe more people in the North in the long run will recognise &mdash; how essential it is to the benefit of our country that we achieve re-union.  If we do not achieve <Col N="2525" /> the unity of Ireland in the years ahead, we will find ourselves &mdash; all the people who live in this island &mdash; at a considerable disadvantage in the economic difficulties we may have to face.  I believe people will expect from the Government and from the Taoiseach some worthwhile thinking on these lines, not borrowing phrases from 50 years ago and throwing them around as if they represented considered thought in 1966.</P>
      <P>I believe young people in particular are fed up with clichés, with catchphrases, with the bromides which are doled out to them so often.  I believe young people today, just the same as young people in every age, in every year, in every generation, have an idealism, an idealism which is there to serve the country.  They are thirsting for some worthwhile national aim, thirsting for some target which can be attained, some aim which can be realised and it is because they are not getting that that so many of them are cynical and not very concerned with the future of the country.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael, as the main Opposition, are, I believe, playing a constructive role in the political life of the country.  If we are not succeeding, at least we are trying to do it; we are endeavouring to promote new thinking on many of the endemic problems, problems which always seem to be there.  We believe our policy, if implemented, will bring about a just society.  Our views on health, on employment and housing, on taxation and on planning &mdash; are all designed to provide more justice for the ordinary people of this country.  We have not the opportunity at the moment of implementing the things we advocate but we do rejoice to see that so many of the things we have said, so many of the proposals we have put forward, are gradually being accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our proposals on health were regarded as unnecessary by the Minister for Health prior to the last election and the Taoiseach himself indicated that he approved of that view.  This is for us a sign that our point of view is commanding more and more support, that some kind of promise has now been <Col N="2526" /> given by the Government of a new health policy.  In education, there is need for the application of more justice, of more tolerance.  The Taoiseach said, in announcing the change of Ministers the other day, that that did not indicate any change of policy.  We will wait and see with interest because I believe that in the field of education, there is a growing demand for more tolerance of the difficulties of young people and a growing demand to bring our educational standards up to that of other countries.</P>
    <P>I can say now, at the end of this session of the Dáil, that we have had many general debates, many economic debates and all of us have said as much as we possibly could say.  I know the Taoiseach has had to listen to a surfeit of speeches in recent months and for that I extend to him my deep sympathy. But we have come to the end of this session and I believe we can go away to our constituencies, to our other work, feeling that in this Dáil, all of us, according to our likes, according to our talents and according to our views, are endeavouring to work for the betterment of the country.  I believe that if we accept that &mdash; and the people outside expect us to accept it &mdash; if we have more tolerance for one another, the country will be advanced and the future will be served.  As far as my Party are concerned, we will continue to play a constructive role until such time as we have an opportunity to undertake the obligations and the duty of implementing in full our policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate started yesterday, the Taoiseach used an expression, and I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of today, Friday 8th July, 1966: He said he proposed:</P>
      <P>to take advantage of the occasion to give a survey of the more important matters affecting the economic, national and international situation. The debate would cover two confidence motions which had appeared on the Order Paper by reason of the rather childish jockeying for political advantage in precedence in Dáil debates between the two Opposition Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that maybe <Col N="2527" /> by virtue of the fact that the Taoiseach owns the course upon which the race is being run, he is the jockey who has won the first position because there was no need for Fianna Fáil to put down the motion for the Adjournment. The House would have adjourned in the ordinary way but he put down a motion to adjourn so that he would get in first and get in last.  So, if he wants to talk about people being childish, he has succeeded in winning the child's game.</P>
    <P>He said he would give us a survey of the matters affecting the economic, national and international situation.  If that is what he did when he was opening the debate, he must have been using words and expressions which nobody in the House except himself understood; there must have been some kind of a code he used because if anybody were to accuse him of giving any kind of a survey, he would be entirely wrong.  He got up and started &mdash; as some commentators said &mdash; in first gear and stayed in first gear right through the whole time.  In the half-hour or so he was speaking, he said very little.  What he did say was not very important and, maybe, he is waiting until the conclusion to fire his big guns.  But if he really took the debate seriously, and if his Party took this debate seriously, what has happened during this debate would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Yesterday no one moved in the Fianna Fáil benches until last night when &mdash; whether he got permission to do so, or whether in his usual way, he decided to do so himself &mdash; Deputy Corry came in to explain the Fianna Fáil attitude on everything happening in the country.  He ranged from all the industries he said he had started in his own constituency to the fact that he regretted that the German bombers had not finished off Dublin, and to the fact that Dublin city and county having defeated the Government resoundingly in the Presidential election would not have it forgotten to them by the Fianna Fáil Party.  These are the kind of things which I am sure the Taoiseach would have been delighted to have sat here <Col N="2528" /> listening to when Deputy Corry trotted them out.</P>
    <P>I suppose he was a better policitian than many people gave him credit for, because he mentioned what he thought were the national priorities.  The former Taoiseach, now the President, and the present Taoiseach have repeated on more than one occasion, when they thought it suitable, that the two most important matters before the Irish nation were the restoration of the Irish language and the uniting of the country.  I want the Taoiseach when he is replying to say honestly if he thinks they are the two most important things before the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry did not agree, and I do not think that 90 per cent of the people would agree, with the Taoiseach if he said they are the two most important things.  Deputy Corry placed full employment, housing &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; education, and better health services for the people as being the most important things.  If the Taoiseach would come out of what the late Deputy Norton so often referred to as cloud-cuckooland and realise that in this day and age we must face up to the fact that we have far too many people unemployed, far too many people emigrating, far too few facilities for education, far too few facilities for health services, then he would be justifying his existence as Taoiseach.  I propose to give some figures in support of what I am saying, but I am afraid these things have not dawned on the Taoiseach or the Government.</P>
    <P>Late yesterday evening, efforts were made by some members of Fianna Fáil to explain their attitude on this debate. I respect Deputy Dowling because of the fact that he, like myself, served in the Defence Forces during the emergency.  He had to work pretty hard to get into this House.  When Deputy Dowling on those benches accused the Labour Party of going Red or being associated with Reds, he was talking through his hat.  I wonder is he to be the mudslinger with whom Fianna Fáil always seem to be well armed.</P>

He bragged about his trade union card but we know what he thought of his trade union card three weeks ago when the vote in relation to the ESB strike took place.  If Deputy Dowling wants to engage in those tactics, he will have to take the criticisms which will be directed towards him in this House.</P>
      <P>This morning the new Minister for Industry and Commerce decided to say a little bit of his new piece. Whether he was shooting a line, as someone suggested, to show that he would make a better prospective Taoiseach than the Minister for Finance, or whether he was trying to impress everyone with the fact that he was a tough guy, I do not know.  I do know that as Minister for Education we had great respect for him because we felt that he was at least trying to do something.  That he was not allowed to do anything was not his fault.  He has moved into Industry and Commerce and started off by doing something to which we did not think even Fianna Fáil would stoop.</P>
      <P>During the Easter commemorations and during all the pageants that took place, one figure stood out miles above everyone else, the figure of James Connolly, despite efforts made over the years by certain people to denigrate him.  Because of the fact that James Connolly stood head and shoulders above everyone else, he is now to be adopted by Fianna Fáil and Deputy Colley claimed this morning that if James Connolly were alive today, he would be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, or words to that effect.  If James Connolly were alive today and heard Deputy Colley say that, I would not like to be in Deputy Colley's shoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I will say this much for him.  He did not hurt anything because <Col N="2530" /> he did not say anything.  He spoke for a certain length of time and I hope he understood what he was saying because I and others certainly did not know what it was all about.</P>
    <P>I had better refer to the new Minister for Industry and Commerce as Deputy Colley because otherwise he might be confused with someone else. Deputy Colley tried to prove, and seemed to prove to himself, that the Labour Party were really a conservative party.  He wanted us to go out on a limb to the left to prove that we were socialists of the first water.  I do not think we need lessons from Deputy Colley or anyone else to show that we represent the workingclass of this country, first and foremost.  So far as we are concerned, we have proved that here in the past few weeks when many of their so-called friends seemed to desert them in their need.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a lot of talk about changing the trade union laws.  A question was raised here yesterday which proved the sort of thing of which the Government are capable.  Some months ago the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Department of Industry and Commerce had discussions on legislation which was to result in changing the trade union law so that the effects of what has become known as the Fitzpatrick judgment would be dealt with and, as a result, the draft of a Bill called the Trade Union Bill, 1963, was introduced. Congress were informed that this was what the Government proposed to do and, in addition, that that Bill would be introduced together with two other Bills dealing with trade union law and labour relations.</P>
    <P>The two other Bills were introduced last week and this one was not.  It took a lot of checking to find out why.  The reason was that one section of the Bills which were introduced cuts completely across and is directly contrary to the section of the Bill which is dealing with the Fitzpatrick judgment. So much for guarantees given by the Government and by the Department of Industry and Commerce that they would look after the trade union legislation and deal in a fair way with the workers of the country.  This <Col N="2531" /> indeed is evidence, if we need evidence &mdash; and we do not need it, I may say &mdash; that the Government believe that they are here to represent the monied classes having been put here unfortunately on the votes of the trade unions, but backed by the monied people of the country.  They feel they will look after that section no matter what happens, even if it means breaking their word and slipping into legislation sections that would tie down the trade unionists to the small concessions they have at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have had before the House two Budgets this year but we have no guarantee that there is not another coming.  The Minister for Finance was prepared to say on the Finance (No. 2) Bill that he did not intend to introduce any more penal legislation later, but he was not so sure, and he seemed to indicate that if certain things did not go right, it might be necessary to come back.  Can anybody understand how a Government act when in a country as small as this they cannot at the beginning of a financial year decide how much it will take to keep the country going?  They introduced one Budget and then tried to impress the country until the Presidential election was over. Then they came back with a second one and that they could even dream of a third Budget is past all understanding. It is nearly certain they are because a statement made by a member of the Government suggested it was not proposed to borrow any more money.  They found it hard enough to borrow what they got, but if there is not to be more external borrowing, they are bound to attempt to get the money in some other way and apparently the only way this Government know to get money is to add more taxation to an already overtaxed community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said recently that it was proposed or intended to ease the financial situation in September.  Why September?  Is it because a Bill which will come before the House after the recess will fix the date for the local elections for June of next year?  Are the Government already prepared to agree that it is <Col N="2532" /> necessary to get money flowing so that if we are to have local elections, Fianna Fáil will have a chance of winning?  We know, and everybody in the country knows, that the reason the local elections were not held this year was that the Government realised that if they were held, the Government Party would have been badly beaten in practically every local authority.  I can assue them that even if they come along next year, unless something wonderful happens in the meantime, that same beating is awaiting them.</P>
    <P>The Government may decide they will start money flowing, no matter where it comes from, so that in May or June of next year they can say to the country that there is an improvement in the financial position.  One of the things that will not be accepted here is the antics of a Government who repeat, as the Minister for Local Government has, that there is plenty of money for necessaries.  The Minister for Local Government has been saying right up to the present day that money is available for housing, that there is plenty of money and that all anybody has to do is ask for it.</P>
    <P>In County Meath we have a few small towns where we had hoped to build houses and where we have been building houses whenever we get the necessary money.  This year Trim got no money for housebuilding; Navan got £3,000, which the Minister for Local Government subsequently raised to £6,000; Kells got nothing.  Perhaps it will be said there is not any money needed for housing in these towns.  It is true that Navan requires £100,000 for housing: not alone do they require it but they had in fact plans prepared and the plans have been with the Department since December last.  In Trim, they required approximately £30,000 to carry out a scheme for which they had prepared plans which are before the Department.  In Kells, £70,000 is needed and they got nothing.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas of the county, the position is much worse.  Meath County Council got a grant of £23,000 for rural housing.  A deputation went to the Department and the Minister agreed to add £10,000, making a total of £33,000.  What are the county council <Col N="2533" /> supposed to do with that?  All they could do was start four cottages in Oldcastle, eight in Athboy and 16 rural cottages, the plans for which have been before the Department. Of course, the Minister's idea is that we should make a start, giving the impression that something is being done.  I tell him here that we have 431 applicants for houses, 206 of whom, with families, live in unfit houses, 147 in overcrowded conditions and 78 in more or less normal conditions.  In answer to that problem, we get £33,000 from the Department to pay SDA loans.</P>
    <P>We promised the money.  Many people began to build houses and since then, many small contractors have gone out of business and many small and not so small contractors have gone bankrupt.  The people they supplied with materials were not able to pay for them and the Department eventually produced money, but when they produced it, it was found that all that could be done was pay up to 1st April last which left us, coming into April, with a balance of £65,000 which we owed and could not pay.  Then the Department decided they would give us £13,000 for the year 1966-67 to meet all our requirements for last year and this year, and when we went to the Minister to ask how he expected us to continue our housing programme, he made the wonderful suggestion that there is no reason why we should not promise people looking for houses that they would get loans and let them go ahead and build their houses, and next year we would get the following year's share and the people who were building the houses could pay then.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the country is in the state it is?  If that is the kind of book-keeping the Government are capable of, I do not wonder we are not able to pay as we go along. Parenthetically, I may add that I omitted to mention that the Minister suggested, with regard to hundreds of people looking for rural cottages, that we should buy land from the farmers and promise to pay them by instalments. He also told us that we should advertise for contractors and when we got the contracts, to send them to the <Col N="2534" /> Department.  When that happened, he would not sanction the money because it would interfere with the Government's public capital expenditure programme.  He said it will be all right, so, because there will be some money next year.  This is the Minister who, during the past six months has said everything is all right, that there is plenty of money available, that all we have to do is plan and we will get housing for our people.  Is it any wonder people are getting fed up with the stories they are being given by Government Departments?  Is it any wonder people are disappointed?</P>
    <P>Employment and unemployment have been mentioned.  It is awfully difficult at times to understand, when people start quoting statistics, where the statistics come from.  They seem just to suit the occasion.  I shall now give some figures from the Research Department of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their <i>Economic Review</i> for June, 1966.  It is easy enough to check.  This shows that the number at work this year is 7,000 fewer than in 1964.  It also shows that for the first time since 1961 the number of people in employment has fallen over the last 12 months.  There was an increase of 4,000 in industry, and 3,000 in services, but this has been offset by a drop in employment in agriculture of 14,000 people.  Fourteen thousand people have left the land in the past 12 months.  The total number at work in April of this year was 1,050,000, of whom 330,000 were in agriculture, 291,000 in industry, and 421,000 in services.  I should like the Taoiseach to consider these figures, because we hear so much talk about the expansion of industry and the fact that the vast-majority of our people are now being employed in industry, that those figures show whether or not that is true.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and emigration give a very clear picture of what is happening. At 17th June of this year, the number registered as unemployed was 42,462.  It is impossible to get comparable figures because the Department of Social Welfare tricked around with the statistics, I believe, for no other reason than to make comparisons impossible.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any other reason why it should be done.  Up to then we could compare year with year but this new idea prevents that being done.  However, this is a significant thing.  The numbers getting unemployment benefit or with unemployment benefit claims current on 17th June at 27,701 was 5,306, or one-fourth higher than a year ago.  If the Taoiseach does not get the significance of that, let me point out to him that the people on unemployment benefit can only draw for six months and those people, therefore, who are drawing unemployment benefit are extra people who have come within the past six months. Therefore the number of people in insurable employment must be dropping even more at the present time.  Of course, the unemployment rate in respect of insured persons at mid-April was 6.6 per cent, and the figure last year was 6.3 per cent, so even there the evidence is that the figure for unemployed is going up.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Corish said yesterday, the hardest hit by this wave of unemployment are those in the building industry.  It is very annoying to hear Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, mainly by interruption, attempting to prove that the position now is better than it was in 1956, because even though there was a considerable number of people unemployed in 1956, there were very many thousands more people in employment in 1956 than there are at the present time.</P>

      <P>Yes, there were 79,000 more in employment in 1956 than at the present time.  The Deputies who make comments of that sort should remember that position.  In addition to that, they should remember that right through 1954, 1955 and 1956, which were supposed to be the black years, the number of houses being erected &mdash; right into 1957, when <Col N="2536" /> Fianna Fáil got control and when the slide started going down the other way &mdash; were many thousands more than are being built at the present time.  I do not know whether it is, as somebody else said here today, a matter of not knowing the facts or whether it is a deliberate attempt to distort them that causes Deputies to make such comments but those are the facts and they might as well know them.  At mid-May, the number out of work in general building was 4,620, and this was 1,349 higher than last year.  There was also increased unemployment in the distributive trades, food industries, dock work, woollen industry and tailoring.</P>
      <P>In regard to emigration, I remember that a few years ago the Government were bragging that emigration was finished and that we were not going to have any more worries about it.  Again they told us all about the years when the last inter-Party Government were in office and about all the people who were leaving the country.  It is only fair to put on record that the net outward passenger movement by sea and air &mdash; which is the only way in which these figures can be checked in the 12 months ended February last was 30,000, compared with 27,400 in the previous 12 months.  That does not look as if the country is on the up and up.  That does not look as if the Government are doing the wonderful job which we are informed by the Taoiseach and the Government they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as gross national product is concerned, in real terms there was an increase last year of 2½ per cent compared with an increase of 4 per cent in 1963 and 1964.  Production in manufacturing industries increased by 3½ per cent in the year 1965, but in the fourth quarter of the year the increase was only two per cent.  I am quite prepared to agree that this being an increase on the existing position, it is a difficult thing to maintain, that for every increase that is gained each year, it requires a greater effort to get even the same increase the following year. However, how can we have an increase in the gross national product when the number of people in employment is dropping year by year and when the <Col N="2537" /> number of people emigrating is increasing year by year?  Surely, if we are going to do anything about increasing production, we must first find employment for our people at home?</P>
    <P>The biggest snag of the whole lot is that our social welfare benefits are pretty low.  If we had full employment, it would follow naturally that we would have very much more money available for those who were receiving social welfare benefits.  It also follows that the more people who are drawing unemployment benefit, the smaller the amount of money available in the pool.  There is one thing I can never understand, and in all the years the Fianna Fáil Government have been in office, they have never, apparently, got around even to considering it.  It is this problem that a man who is earning £8 or £10 per week doing productive work can be laid off by a semi-State body or by a local authority and goes to the labour exchange, to which he does not want to go if he can get employment, where he gets almost as much for doing nothing, on condition he does nothing for six months.  I can never see why some Department of State could not be set up to try to ensure the money which is available in this country is used in the proper way and end this complete waste of money and manpower in forcing people to stay unemployed rather than give them productive employment.</P>
    <P>A typical example of this is what has happened this year in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands. They have reduced the acreage from 25,000 to 20,000 and have reduced the number of people employed in forestry by hundreds.  Men who have been employed in the forests for a number of years have simply been laid off without any explanation except that there has been a reduction in the programme. Surely it should not be beyond the ability of the Minister for Lands and of his Department and the Department of Social Welfare to regulate matters in such a way that the money which those people are reluctantly forced to draw from the employment exchange will be channelled into keeping them in full employment.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment <Col N="2538" /> here over the past few weeks about labour relations.  Everybody is blamed, except the Government.  The Government do not believe that they have any responsibility here.  Their principal whipping boy is the trade unions.  The trade unions are responsible, according to them, for this, that and the other thing.  Somebody suggested that there should be compulsory arbitration.  Others suggested that trade union leaders are not doing their stuff.  Everybody has his own solution, Like the thinkers problem, it is a case of everybody having a solution except the people concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a democracy and we have a free country as far as workers are concerned. If workers vote to go on strike, let me make it very clear, neither the trade union officials nor the executive of the union have the right to tell them not to go on strike.  After 20 years' experience as a trade union official my experience is that in 99 cases out of 100 the workers who go on strike have a damn good reason for doing so. Otherwise, they would not do it.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we are told that the problem of strikes is causing a great loss to the national economy.  I wonder if anybody has gone to the trouble of calculating the loss to the national economy represented by the people who cannot get work?  Would the Taoiseach consider that that would be an interesting exercise?  Who causes strikes?  We are all blamed but we have an example in the State.  The State is a very big employer.  The State employs people in various Departments.  The State employs people in the Civil Service at reasonably good salaries, regulated in a certain way.  There is an appeals tribunal.  There is a salary or wages tribunal that sets up the wages and salaries in a certain way and ensures that they are decent wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>What about manual workers, people outside, most of whom work at ordinary labouring work?  Does the State consider that it is an example to employers in that field.  Is it not true the £1 a week which we were told the Government had adopted as the guide-line, and was all right, therefore, <Col N="2539" /> must apply to these workers?  Is it not true that, so far, not one word has been heard from the State as to whether that £1 will be paid?  Not alone that, but when something happens which causes trouble in State employment, such as the rotten system adopted by the Department of Lands, whereby they start men's holidays on a Friday night because Saturday is a non-working day, and count that non-working day, the whole of the following week, and the final Saturday, and deduct two days from the annual holidays, is there an appeal against that?  Of course not.  There is nobody at all to deal with that type of thing. Then we are told that there should be good labour relations, that trade unions should see to it that they carry out negotiations to the full before attempting to take any action.</P>
    <P>Dealing with a State Department is going to court with the devil and holding the court in hell because the only appeal is back to the man who made the original offer and he is not the Minister for the particular Department but some official, junior or otherwise, who says what he is allowed to do and that he cannot go any further.</P>
    <P>The State has a responsibility which it is not prepared to face up to.  It is quite obvious to anybody who wants to see that under half a dozen different headings the State has failed, the Government have failed and the motion which the Labour Party have put down is perfectly justified.  We honestly believe &mdash; if we did not we would not have put down the motion of no confidence &mdash; that the time has come for the Government to test the country.  Let us see what the people feel about the Government!  Do not mind what happened in the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>We did not take part in the Presidential election.  I am quite satisfied that a very great number of our people voted for Deputy O'Higgins in the Presidential election, not because they were told to do so but because they were voting against the Government. It is a peculiar situation when <Col N="2540" /> somebody who made the Fianna Fáil Party, who brought it to its hour of greatness, who brought it into this House, must have felt very ashamed that that same Fianna Fáil Party nearly put him out of his seat in the Phoenix Park at the end of his days.</P>
    <P>The Government, in fairness to themselves and knowing what the situation is, as they must, should put this matter to the test.  They could have, if they wanted to, earlier this year and can even do it now if they want to see whether or not what has been said from these benches is true. They could have a test through the local elections and see what the results will be.  It does not take too long to arrange local elections.  The people would soon prove that what we are saying is true, that the complete confidence of the people has been taken from the Government.</P>
    <P>Do not let anyone try, as was tried here today, to prove that confidence in the people and confidence in the Government are the one thing.  I had the pleasure the other night of being present when a mining company which was introduced here during the period of office of the last inter-Party Government, announced that they had succeeded in financing their second mine in this country and hoped over the years to come to be selling so much of their product abroad that it will represent an income one-half as great as the entire cattle industry of the country, and hoped to develop, as I hope they will, further mines in this country.  These people were able, not because of the Government but because of the fact that there was confidence in the people and confidence that mines could be found here, to produce the necessary money from abroad not only to back up the mining and refining but the exportation and sale of the ore after it had been taken out of the ground.  That was confidence in Ireland as a country and there is a great deal of difference between that and confidence in a Government who have lost the complete confidence of their own people which is, I suggest, the position of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are <Col N="2541" /> Members of this House and of the other House go around the country as we do.  I am sure quite a number of them are very hard workers and go in and out of the houses of the ordinary people and hear what they have to say, just as we do.  One of the most extraordinary things that I have found, over the past six months particularly, is the number of former rabid Fianna Fáil supporters who were prepared to come to me and to say that they were dissatisfied with the Government, that they thought they had been let down.  When that movement starts, the Government have a right to look out for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach who, before the last general election, felt that the country was on the crest of a wave of prosperity and kept saying so &mdash; he was perfectly entitled if that was the way he felt to continue to say that the country was doing well &mdash; would now have to be honest about it and say that that is not so.  The accusation was made here yesterday evening by Deputy Corry &mdash; I do not think Deputy Corry meant any slur but I would like to put the record straight because Fine Gael also made the same assertion &mdash; that, the Taoiseach finding a situation before the ninth round of wage increases in which the employers had arrived at eight per cent and the workers were looking for 14 per cent, had said: &ldquo;O.K. Take 12 per cent&rdquo;, and we decided it on that.  Of course, the Taoiseach knows as well as I do that that is entirely untrue. What the Taoiseach did, and I give him credit for it, was to call both sides together.  He called the employers first; he called the workers.  He told them what he thought and succeeded in getting them together again, after which an agreement was made.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat for the benefit of Deputy Corry and the Fine Gael Party and anybody else who wants to hear it, that the ninth round wage increase was negotiated directly between the trade unions and the employers and the Taoiseach did not make an order by which the increase was given, any more than he made an order that the three per cent he was talking about a couple of weeks ago would be the wage increase for the country, because it would not be taken from him or anybody <Col N="2542" /> else.  The three per cent was what he suggested could be paid.  The trade unions made a very reasonable arrangement that they would take £1.  That £1 is being put into operation by practically everybody except the State.  I suggest the State should do so now and do so from a date, not as they are apparently doing in the case of the higher paid officers, from 1st June, but date it back to a reasonable date as is being done in the case of other employees throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, whether we like it or not, the people have lost confidence in the present Government.  In those benches we feel there is only one way to test that confidence.  If the Taoiseach is able to go to the country and come back with a live majority, then he is entitled to do the things he has been doing.  If he is unable to get a majority sufficient to rule the House, what we have said here will have been proved.  The country is sick and fed up with Fianna Fáil talk and no action.</P>

They were just routine, in almost ritual conformity with the unimaginative and uninspiring roles of their Parties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish began by explaining that this no confidence motion which appears on the Order Paper in his name, was put there because of his Party's concern with certain political aspect of our affairs.  He realised during the course of the Presidential Election that people tended to forget his Party existed.  Almost everybody did except the <i>Irish Times</i> and he felt that it was necessary to do something to bring the Party back into public notice.  I have not the slightest objection. I note they are publishing a new paper for non-delinquent juveniles and if they will take my advice, if the next issue is going to be like the first, they should suppress it quickly.  The image of the Party will not stand up to it.</P>

      <P>When the next election does occur, I am certain people will be concerned mainly with evidence that the country is being well managed, not with the outcome of <Col N="2544" /> minor tactical engagements that the Opposition Parties appear to delight in.  I believe the people are much more intelligent than Deputy Corish assumes, much more informed and much more reasonable in their approach to crucial political decisions. Deputy Corish gave us a very pessimistic and gloomy forecast of our prospects in 1966.  But pessimism is the stock in trade of the Labour Party. They have changed their party hymn from the Red Flag, as Deputy Tully assures us, to the &ldquo;De Profundis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is the slightest reason for pessimism.  Anybody who can leave party politics aside will see there is a possibility of a very considerable upsurge of economic activity in this country this year.  Events may not enable all these possibilities to be fully realised but it can be said that provided we can assume there will be no further serious disruptions of production for any cause, external or internal, including strikes, there is scope for very considerable expansion this year and the prospects for next year are quite good.  This expansion of production must be realised if employment is to expand and if our national development policies for education and health and so on are to be carried out, and particularly if the higher wages now being paid or negotiated in a number of trades, can be sustained without serious consequences on employment and prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what would be the attitude of the Opposition Parties to the proposition that the aim of increasing employment should, in this period in Irish history, have priority over the aim of improving living standards.  I suspect their reaction would be to run for cover straightaway.  I am well aware that this would, in many circumstances, be a council of perfection, that those who are in employment and who do not fear for the security of their employment, are not likely to be persuaded to forgo any personal advantage that might be open to them for the benefit of other workers in other areas who are seeking employment.  In a totalitarian state this would be ordered and they could do nothing about it but in a democracy <Col N="2545" /> we have to secure acceptance of these concepts by persuasion.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Parties opposite join us in this work of persuasion because I think it is true to say that this nation has now, and in this respect, a choice to make.  We are not strong enough at this time to take up all the options and if we elect to enjoy the benefit of higher national output in the form of rising incomes for those already employed we know we are weakening our capacity to organise at the same time the expansion of employment on a scale that would eventually equate to full employment. This applies not merely in respect of the national economy as a whole but applies in respect of many major economic activities carried on in the country.  It applies particularly to construction activity, house building, water supplies, and road construction to which both Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave, in common with other speakers, devoted a large part of their remarks.  The amount being spent this year on these public constructural activities is higher than in any previous year.  If output and employment are not rising in the same degree it is because the output which can be achieved within any fixed level of expenditure is contracting as costs go up and this is affecting employment also.</P>
    <P>The financial problem of expanding output at a time when construction costs are continuously rising is very considerable.  I know Opposition Deputies can put it aside or dispose of it with a meaningless phrase but the Government have to relate their construction programme in a very precise way to the resources that are available to pay for it.  In this year, the output of State-aided and local authority houses will, we expect, be equal to and probably slightly higher than the output last year which was an all-time record.  It is quite obvious that Deputies who have been addressing themselves to these matters either do not want to or are unable to understand the problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish asked about prices.  Sooner or later, Deputy Corish and his colleagues will have to face up to the facts of life.  If an increase in wages of £1 a week is being paid to workers in industry and other employments then, in many instances, that increase will cause an increase in prices and no system of price control could possibly avoid this in all cases. If the Government were to maintain a system of price control and were to say that in no circumstances may prices be increased because of increases in wages, then, in many cases the increased wages could not be paid or, if they were paid, they would have to be withdrawn.  Deputies opposite are quite unmoved by solid arguments of that kind and have an extraordinary capacity to ignore facts but it is one of the facts of life which the Government have to deal with.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Cosgrave's speech with increasing curiosity. Almost every statement he made was contradicted by the following one. I was particularly intrigued by his suggestion that the Government could raise more money to maintain an increasing output of houses and other forms of local construction activity and similar purposes and then he argued that, if it is true that it is possible to envisage the release of greater resources for productive purposes then the Government must not attempt to secure them for these purposes, then the Government must not them to become available to private enterprise for the expansion of their activities.  Make up your minds about what you want.  That is something the Government must do.  I hope Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues will appreciate my difficulty in dealing intelligently with that kind of comment. We cannot win because no matter what course we decide upon they will always be able to say that we should have taken the opposite course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter of some seriousness to which I want to refer in order to avoid misunderstanding. <Col N="2549" /> Deputy Cosgrave asked how our application for membership of the EEC now stands.

Deputy Cosgrave asked if we were thinking in terms of a joint application to the EEC in conjunction with other countries seeking membership.  We do not contemplate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The brains of Fine Gael are calling.  I think every Deputy understands very well that the political problem &mdash; and it is a political problem &mdash; for the EEC relates only to the British application.  Until that political problem is solved, it is unlikely that the EEC will wish to reactivate their consideration of any of the other applications.  This would be true even if we decided it was in our interest to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  When the way is cleared by reason of a settlement between Britain and EEC then we shall want to pursue our application without reference to any other application except Britain's because, in that case, our new Trade Agreement will be involved.  The effect of the new Trade Agreement with Britain has a two-way application.  I do not think that is likely to be a problem for Britain and ourselves.  It was made on the understanding of our position as an applicant country seeking and desiring membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was slightly perturbed by the manner in which certain newspapers reported my statements yesterday <Col N="2550" /> regarding the intention to send a Ministerial delegation to Brussels during the Recess.  I should not like the importance of that delegation to be exaggerated in any way.  Its work will be completely exploratory and no active negotiations are likely to be involved.  What they said regarding the composition of the delegation and the time of its departure was speculation. No decisions have yet been made in that regard and these decisions will depend to some degree upon developments in the interim.</P>
    <P>I note that some Irish newspaper correspondents recently went to Brussels and met there representatives of the Commission of the EEC and have since been writing in their newspapers about the impressions they formed there.  It seems to me that they behaved very much like innocents abroad and did not even make any attempt to check the motives of their informants. I should like them and every Deputy to keep in mind that when negotiations on our application for membership are taking place they will take place with the six Member countries of the EEC, and I say straightaway that we have from these six Member countries all the assurances we could desire at this stage in relation to their attitudes to our application.  That does not mean that we shall not be in for a great deal of hard bargaining when the time comes, particularly as we will try to carry over into the European Community provisions somewhat similar to those we succeeded in negotiating with the British Government.</P>
    <P>I gather from Deputy Tully that someone accused the Labour Party of going &ldquo;Red&rdquo;, which hurt his feelings very much.  May I straightaway dissociate myself from any such suggestion? The Labour Party are, and always have been, the most conservative element in our community.  Far from the Labour Party going &ldquo;Red&rdquo;, they are not going anywhere.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to cover all the points made in speeches by Opposition Deputies.  A large number of these speeches raised doubts in my mind as to the desirability of sending out to them all the documentary information we do with regard to the state of the economy and various reports and statistical returns.  It is quite clear now that a large number never read them and those who do read them for the purpose of distorting their contents.  In any case it is quite clear that no Deputy opposite had anything new to say.  Their speeches were the usual stereotyped catalogue of complaints, unrelieved by any constructive idea, the catalogue we heard again and again throughout the session.</P>
      <P>New ideas, or a new way of presenting ideas, is the mainspring of political activity and it is quite clear now in respect of both the Opposition Parties that their mainsprings are running down.  The world is changing and the pace of change is always accelerating. Ireland is changing and the pace of change in Ireland is accelerating also. Both Fine Gael and Labour should try to find out what is happening in the country and overcome this innate revulsion of theirs to face new ideas. Deputies are not reading the information we are giving to them correctly.</P>
