    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any further action is proposed by the Government in respect of the application of this country to join the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the emergence of conditions favourable to an enlargement of the European Economic Community, the Government continue to follow with the closest attention developments bearing on our application for membership of the Community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to questions on the 27th September last that Ministers will, in the coming months, have a series of discussions with members of the European Economic Community Commission. Through these discussions and our contacts with the Governments of the Six, we shall continue to emphasise our desire to secure membership of the Community at the earliest appropriate date.  We shall also keep ourselves fully informed of Community policies and developments and make known to the Community our special interests in so far as these policies and developments are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that recently Professor Hallstein indicated that while the present balance of payments problem <Col N="1978" /> remained in Britain, it is unlikely that the Community will be enlarged.  In those circumstances, is it proposed to take any action or any initiative on behalf of this country to press for membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, in effect, the question to which I have replied. We will, of course, ensure that the Community is aware of our desire to obtain membership at the earliest opportunity, and we shall certainly be seeking action, upon our application for membership as soon as the conditions develop which will ensure that this will be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending actual membership, has the question of association or the possibility of a special trade agreement been considered further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These possibilities are not available.  Association is not, as I understand it, available to a country which is eligible for membership, and special trade agreements are not being considered, pending the outcome of the negotiations in the GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Taoiseach to say in the course of his reply that his contacts with Brussels were designed to keep the Government constantly informed of impending developments in their policies.  Did these contacts give him or the Government any timely notice of the increase in the import duties on cattle applicable to cattle exported from Great Britain and from this country which have precipitated the appalling crisis in which we now find ourselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully understand he might not have the precise information available to him at the moment, one would have thought when <Col N="1979" /> drafting this reply referring to the notice available to the Government of the Six's intentions as a result of the close contacts, he would have been able to tell us how this catastrophe came upon us without notice or the situation where the Minister for Agriculture had to tell us three months ago he had no information that such a thing could happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the impasse which has arisen between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers Association, he will invite the National Farmers Association to meet him with a view to restoring satisfactory relations between the National Farmers Association and the Government.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the serious situation which has developed because of the refusal of the Minister for Agriculture to meet representatives of the National Farmers Association, he will arrange for the resumption of discussions between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has stated, on a number of occasions, that if the National Farmers Association decide to resume normal and reasonable discussions with him on farm problems, and so inform him, there will be no difficulty so far as he is concerned in arranging this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have, however, no reason to think that the National Farmers Association leaders desire normal and reasonable discussions. On the contrary, their parades and the harassing of Ministers attending public functions appear to be designed to intimidate the Government.  It is reasonable to assume that the issuing of an invitation as suggested in Deputy <Col N="1980" /> Cosgrave's question would be regarded by them as implying the success of this policy of intimidation.  A Government which made concessions to such tacties would be not only defaulting on their obligations to preserve the elementary principles of democracy, but would also sacrifice any entitlement to public respect.  In these circumstances it would be a matter for the Government, and not the Minister, to decide when and in what manner discussions with the National Farmers Association representatives should be resumed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the member of the Government with special responsibility in agricultural matters.  The Government have collective responsibility, and in regard to this matter as in all others the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has acted with the full approval of the Government and I would not take any course which would carry an implication that this has not been the case.</P>
    <P>To avoid the possibility of any future misunderstanding, it is necessary perhaps to remind the Dáil that there have been two Budgets in this financial year, each of which imposed considerable additional taxation, the proceeds of which are being spent, in the most part, for the benefit of agriculture. The money available to the Government for the financing of the public services in the present financial year is now fully allocated, and the Government are not prepared to contemplate a third Budget.  Any discussions which may take place with farmers organisations, as with others, must be within the context of the financial realities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While not wishing to enter into the merits of the present dispute between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers Association, or to comment in any way on the remarks of the Taoiseach, does the Taoiseach not think, that while preserving the special responsibility which the Minister for Agriculture has, no procedural technicalities or differences as to a method of approach <Col N="1981" /> should be allowed to stand in the way of direct consultation merely for the purpose of discussing whatever problems are at issue between the Minister for Agriculture, on the one hand, and the NFA on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very naive interpretation of this situation.  The issue between the Minister for Agriculture and the NFA is not a question of discussions.  It is a campaign by the NFA to bully the Government into transferring to them the responsibility for agricultural policy now exercised by the Government through the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not to look too far for a recent example in which the British Prime Minister was faced with the strength of the British trade union movement in circumstances which could be described as an attempt either to barrack or to bully and the Prime Minister, without any set agenda in advance, came out openly and met the assembled representatives. He said: &ldquo;I am prepared to receive a deputation.&rdquo; If he was prepared to do this, recognising the power, force and influence the British trade union movement means for the British Government, does the Taoiseach not consider that a rational and detached look at this situation would force anyone to the conclusion that if the Minister, without any preconceived conditions or pre-laid-down agenda would say: &ldquo;I am prepared to meet their elected representatives and discuss the matter with them&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are laying down preconditions are the NFA.  May I refer the Deputy to the statement made by the President of the NFA when he said that even if Mr. Haughey were to meet them tomorrow, it would not mean the end of the agitation.  The Minister would have to give certain guarantees and unless these were satisfactory, the agitation would continue and they would continue the squatting outside Government Buildings.  These are impossible conditions and the Government that would accept them would not be worthy of the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1982" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was wise to make that statement but that is a matter for Mr. Deasy.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that after parading and being out in the present inclement weather, a person who made a statement in those physical conditions could be excused some exaggeration.  I suggest there is close at hand a much more impressive example of a member of a Government being prepared to meet and discuss questions in conditions in which his Government's life was much more likely to be at Stake. The British Prime Minister was prepared to discuss and he said: &ldquo;Come in and discuss it,&rdquo; without laying down any conditions and as far as I know, the trade unions did not lay down any conditions in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the NFA announced their intention of organising this agitation months ago.  The fact is that they have used as a pretext for this demonstration the refusal of the Minister to receive a deputation but the refusal to receive the deputation last week has no relevancy to the matter at all.  If they want to resume reasonable and normal discussions, there is no difficulty about that.  My advice to the NFA is that they should get off the ground, walk over to their office, write a letter and say: &ldquo;Let us sit down and talk over this matter.&rdquo; If they do that, these discussions will take place.  Why are Deputies laughing?  I have no doubt that the NFA is an important organisation but the Government of the country is equally important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in a free democracy people are entitled to agitate within the law, whether it is embarrassing to the Government or to a Minister, to the Opposition or to Parliament?  We may have different views as to whether it is a wise course or the most productive but it is not in the public interest and in the interests of the farmers that whatever procedural questions or technical questions of protocol may have arisen should be waived and people should be prepared to enter into discussions to see what measure of agreement can <Col N="1983" /> be arrived at or what the prospects are of discussing in a rational way the questions at issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem of procedure or protocol.  As I understand it, an agitation is being conducted by this farmers organisation for the purpose of forcing the Government to transfer to their leaders the responsibility for agricultural policy which the Government exercise. That is an impossible agitation for any Government to take cognisance of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the method adopted, provided that people, whether trade unionists, industrialists or farmers, act within the law, are they not entitled to put their case in the way they think best?  That is an essential right in any democratic society, though it may be embarrassing to the Government of the day.  Does it not seem rational that a Government who have responsibility for over-all economic questions should enter into discussions with those engaged in that industry, even if these discussions should break down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the responsibility of the Government for national policy is recognised, there is no problem, but this is a demand that it should be transferred to the NFA leaders.  That is the real issue involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Government and Parliament have the ultimate responsibility but I suggest that any procedural difficulties or any ill-feeling, whether of a personal character or otherwise, there may be between individuals in this organisation and the Minister or between certain members and certain Ministers, should be submerged in the national interest and that discussions should be initiated on some rational and reasonable basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been misled about the situation.  The question of whether the Minister for Agriculture receives a deputation or not is of no importance in this regard. The NFA decided on this agitation months before that question arose and I am certain they would have conducted it, as they made it clear they would, whether the Minister received the deputation or not.  This is only a red herring.  The real issue is whether the Government are going to remain responsible for agricultural policy or going to abdicate that responsibility to the leaders of this organisation.  We are not going to do that.</P>

      <P>The estimated number of persons at work in agriculture is prepared as part of the annual labour force estimates.  These are not yet available for 1966.  However, a preliminary estimate of the number of males engaged in agriculture, based on the sample of the returns made at the June, 1966 agricultural enumeration shows a drop of 7,000 below the corresponding 1965 level.</P>
      <P>In 1955 the estimated number of persons at work in agriculture was 435,000.  For 1965 the estimated figure of 330,000 was 105,000 below the 1955 level.  The 1965 figure is subject to revision when the relevant results of the 1966 Census of Population become available.</P>

      <P>While a State grant of £175,000 was approved in principle in August 1960 towards the estimated cost of a comprehensive improvement scheme for Drogheda Harbour amounting to £350,000, no specific dredging programme has been sanctioned pending the outcome of a hydraulic model investigation commissioned by the Harbour Commissioners.

      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy at all.  The preliminary investigation has taken place. Certain conclusions have been arrived at and the consultants thought that it would be possible to dredge, on a very extensive scale, the bar of the river.  It was then found not to be practicable because of the tidal race which, as the Deputy knows, goes across the harbour mouth.  So we had to have this investigation, as in the case of other harbours.  The Deputy knows that this <Col N="1990" /> questions of what constitutes a policy for any kind of dredging in a harbour mouth is extremely complex and that investigations have to be made and are being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cheap fuel scheme areas were fixed when the scheme was introduced in the winter of 1942.  The scheme is automatically extended whenever the boundaries of the urban areas affected are extended.  Furthermore, <Col N="1998" /> persons who leave the urban areas to live in houses built by the local authority outside the boundary, may qualify for fuel if they are otherwise eligible under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister see if an effort could be made to extend these boundaries so as to bring within them the vast urban areas which have grown on to Dublin since the city boundary was last fixed as a matter of law?  Today, in comparison with 1942, something like 25 per cent of the population of Dublin as we know it are now living outside what is technically the city boundary.</P>

Either you abandon the scheme, since the circumstances which caused it to be brought into operation no longer exist, or else you extend it to the country as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to replies I gave to questions on this subject on the 14th June and the 28th ultimo and to my statement on the subject in reply to the recent debate on the Estimate for my Department (Vol. 224, No. 12, Cols. 1739-1740).</P>

      <P>Having regard to the very large number of people affected, comprising some 2,000 persons, who have sustained reductions in their non-contributory pensions, both widows' and old age pensions, averaging 30/-and further having regard to the very large number of persons who have had their non-contributory old age pension withdrawn altogether, would the Minister not consider this a violation of the spirit and intention of the reciprocal agreement entered into between his Department and the British Ministry with regard to the increases in the British pensions which recently accured to our people?  Would the Minister not agree that the intention of this reciprocal agreement was to assist Irish pensioners rather than to worsen their financial position, as has transpired as a result of the means test which he has applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this provision in the reciprocal agreement was that the British Government would pay the increases granted in their pensions to their pensioners residing in this country.  That intention has been carried out.  With regard to the suggestion that this particular item of means should be disregarded, I think it is a ridiculous suggestion and it has no appeal whatever to me.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the opinion of many medical practitioners that some of these old age pensioners, and others, have suffered in their health by reason of the recent action of the social welfare officers of his Department and, in view of that fact, will he at least go into this whole matter again and realise the serious consequences of sending round officers to collect pension books, thus causing general panic among these poor old people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not send round my officers at all.  Non-contributory pensions are issued on the basis of a means test and this item of means is included in the assessment of means, the same as with other incomes.  It is specifically provided that nobody could lose as a result of this transaction and nobody is any worse off. The vast majority of the people in receipt of these pensions from Great Britain have gained considerably as a result of the reciprocal agreement.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="2006" /> Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Subsection 97 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 of 1954), paragraph 10 of Defence Force Regulations Q.6 and paragraph 43 of Defence Force Regulations S.3 Authorise the deduction from the pay of soldiers living in married quarters, in equal proportion, of the assessed amount of damage caused to public property in the area of the married quarters where such damage is not traceable to an individual or individuals or where it appears to have been occasioned by children of members of a unit who cannot be identified.</P>
      <P>The total cost of repairs arising out of recent damage to public property in the vicinity of soldiers' married quarters in Dún Cathal Brugha attributable to children was £50 9s 6d.  The cost was apportioned amongst 90 occupants of soldiers' married quarters.  These represent the occupants of all soldiers' married quarters excepting those with no children and those who went into occupation of quarters after the damage was caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the section to which the Minister refers is the Ministerial application of St. Paul's advice that the innocent must suffer for the guilty?  May that regulation properly be applied to civilian occupants of married quarters, that is, people who have retired from the Army, who are now not subject to military discipline and who are living in the married quarters because of the inability of the local authority to provide them with alternative accommodation? Further, will the Minister tell the House the Army's defination of &ldquo;a child&rdquo;?  When is a person assumed to reach an age at which he or she would not be deemed likely to cause the kind of damage children usually cause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that in this instance there is anything in the point about the age up to which a person is designated &ldquo;a child&rdquo;.  Does the Deputy object to the Department of Defence seeking to recover from occupants of married quarters their share of the damage caused by the <Col N="2007" /> general body of the occupants' children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of that reply, I understand the Army has no information in the case in question which justifies the accusation that the children of married quarters were responsible for the damage.  Furthermore, would the Minister have regard to the particular case to which I have already referred, which concerns an overholder who has no children within the normal understanding of the word certainly, the youngest member being 18 years of age, working as a shop assistant and not likely to be involved in damage caused by children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

      <P>While an estimate of the number of persons at work in agriculture in 1966 is not yet available the preliminary indications are that the fall in the numbers engaged between 1965 and 1966 was substantially lower than in the previous year.  The movement of workers out of agriculture is common to all European countries and its extent is influenced by a variety of factors including the demand for labour in the non-agricultural sectors.  I do not agree with the Deputy's description of conditions in agriculture.  Farm income in recent years, despite occasional setbacks, has been rising steadily.  The Government have provided a comprehensive programme of assistance and support of the agricultural industry and will take any further measures within the limit of the resources available to it which may seem to be necessary from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, we are all agreed that it would be highly undesirable if the radio and television services were <Col N="2017" /> found to be working in some way to undermine fundamental national policies and ideals.  That question is not in dispute.  We accept that in the highly unlikely event of this happening, the Government would have the duty and responsibility to take action to correct such a situation.  The recent attempt by the Taoiseach to invoke this basic principle to justify what happened in the event of an interference with news broadcasts by a particular Minister is totally unacceptable.  There is no suggestion, nor is there any evidence whatever for arguing, that Telefís Éireann is or was acting to undermine fundamental national ideals or policies. Should that be so, the Government have available, under the terms of the Broadcasting Authority Act, a prescribed method of approach to the radio and television Authority, either directly by withdrawing the warrants of appointment for the members of the Board, or by the power invested in the Act which entitles the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and that Minister alone, to direct in writing that a particular item should or should not be broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore entirely unacceptable that any Minister other than the Minister responsible to the Dáil for the radio and television services, namely the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, should surreptitiously approach individual members of the staff who, because of the position of a Minister, may act, and in this case did act, in a particular way.  I think it departed from the terms of section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act which lays down broadly that in presenting news, it shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature shall be presented objectively and impartially without any expression of the Authority's own view.  As a result of the interference, in the manner in which it was done, no direct request apparently being made that the item should be dropped, but because the Board of Radio Telefís Éireann is appointed by the Government, and to <Col N="2018" /> the extent that they are Government-appointed, are creatures of the Government in office, and because the staff of Radio Éireann, or some of them, may feel that they are obliged to conform with the views or directions or opinions, or in some way not to conflict with what may be the view or opinion of a Minister, a certain action was taken.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the description that this was an editorial error of judgement. It is well settled, and the terms of section 18 make it abundantly clear, that where news is to be presented, it must be presented impartially and objectively.  It may be that many items of news &mdash; in fact, it is inevitable &mdash; will be critical of Government policy or of Opposition viewpoints but provided these news items, provided the statements made or the opinions expressed are not contrary to the fundamental liberties of the citizens or, in some way, in conflict with the law, then the person or persons responsible for expressing these views are entitled, if section 18 is to be interpreted as this House intended, to have those views expressed and disseminated over the radio or television network.  Of course it is open, and must be open, to the Government or to any Minister &mdash; and it should be open to any Deputy &mdash; to have on a matter of this kind his views or opinions stated and given equal publicity.</P>
    <P>The members of the RTE Authority are appointed by the Government under the terms of the Act as laid down here for the very purpose of ensuring that the service is run in accordance with broadly accepted national policies.  The members of the Authority and nobody else are responsible to the Government for the conduct of the service.  If the Government are dissatisfied with the manner in which the Board they have appointed is performing its duties, they may legitimately either bring their dissatisfaction directly to the notice of the Board or do so through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Government have the ultimate safeguard of being able to replace the members if they become dissatisfied with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> Members of the staff of Telefís Éireann are responsible only to the Board: it is for the Board to take what action it may consider desirable with individual members of the staff if it feels such action to be desirable in the light of the views expressed to it by the Government.  In fact it was for the very reason and for the express purpose of ensuring that there would be no undue pressure on the Board by the Government that the Act establishing the Authority laid down that communications of this kind from the Government to the Board must be in writing, thus providing a record of a particular intervention, both for the members of the Oireachtas and the public.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, so far from envisaging as acceptable the kind of interference which has recently been exposed, Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann when passing the legislation establishing the RTE Authority, were most anxious that not even the Board itself should be subject to informal or hidden pressures by the Government.  I have said already and it is no harm to repeat, that it is common knowledge&mdash; and I do not think the members of the RTE Authority would deny &mdash; that the vast majority of the Board are well-known supporters of the Government. It is therefore reasonable and natural that in those circumstances the Board would view sympathetically any complaints made to it by the Government. For that reason it is important that the whole matter should be considered in the perspective that the Board could not be, and certainly the vast majority of the Board could never be, regarded as unfriendly to the present Government.</P>
    <P>The recent example of interference which was acted upon with what one can only regard as undue alacrity in having a particular item deleted from the news may of itself not be of very great significance but what is at stake here is the danger of interference with the authority vested in the Board of Telefís Éireann and the obligation expressly laid down in section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act that the presentation of news should be <Col N="2020" /> impartial and objective.  The recent event must give rise to anxiety as to the dangers inherent in individual action by individual Ministers because a particular item or a particular programme or a proposed broadcast may in some way conflict with the policy of or cause embrassment to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the course of a reply to a Parliamentary Question, delivered himself of certain views and opinions which are reported in volume 224 at column 1046.  Some of these views and opinions are in no way included in the express provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act.  There is no obligation in that Act to present or not to present a particular viewpoint because it may or may not be in conflict with Government policy. Provided the individuals in the community or any group or section in the community act within the law, they are entitled to coverage and in fact, provided it does not conflict with the law or with the Constitution, free public expression is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile contrasting the manner in which certain recent events were covered by RTE and a particular dispute or difference of opinion to which we have been referring with the situation which exists in respect of the BBC in which not merely was every meeting and expression, every parade or agitation carried on by the trade union representatives, in which they conflicted with the current policy of the Government given full coverage on the television service, but, of course, the Government or the responsible Minister, during some of the time the Prime Minister, was given equal coverage.  It is vital that the essential liberties which we value as the <i>raison d'être</i> of democracy should be ensured and guaranteed and that no one should be allowed to interfere with those rights.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act under which the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority was established meant and intended that the Authority would be independent of the Government.  By independence was meant that in preparing news bulletins <Col N="2021" /> and in presenting news to the public, the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann engaged in that broadcasting part of the service would be free to apply exactly the same standards as those applied by reputable newspapers and the journalists employed by them, that is, that items for inclusion should be selected on the basis of their news value, and the amount of prominence given to them should be determined by the same standard.  There would be no need and, in fact, it would be quite wrong for such a news item to have to get the approval of Government Ministers or to have their views taken into account in preparing news bulletins. No employee of Radio Telefís Éireann should feel under any pressure from Government Ministers or anybody else in preparing material for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is therefore essential that there should be a very clear and unambiguous statement by the Minister in replying to this debate that the unfortunate recent incident will not be regarded as standard method of operation, and I hope that those members of the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann who may have felt compelled to act in this way will, in the future, have enough backbone to stand on the terms of the Act.  It is an essential part of the democratic system that, provided people are acting within the law, they are entitled to have their views, whether for or against the Government, broadcast.</P>
    <P>I believe the vast majority of the people of this country would not wish to see Radio Telefís Éireann services in the same relationship with the Government as, say, the <i>Irish Press</i> or for that matter with any other Government that may be in power.  This is a healthy thing in a democracy, provided there is no attempt to interfere with the law or with the essential guarantees of freedom, provided there is no attempt to weaken or jeopardise respect for the institutions of the State established and maintained in the public interest, but once that is done, those responsible for disseminating either news broadcasts or any other programme should not have to look over their shoulder to see whether <Col N="2022" /> there is a Minister or a member of the Board there.</P>
    <P>It is all the more important, because this Board is well known to have a particular political colour, or the majority of it, that excessive care should be taken to ensure that everything is done impartially and that broadcasts of any category should be presented because of their news value or their entertainment value or for any other reason, subject to the single safeguard that nothing is allowed to undermine public confidence or to conflict with the law.  However, conflicting with Government opinions, conflicting with what may be Government policy, is not undermining public confidence or the institutions established by the State.</P>
    <P>There is a very great difference between conflicting with the law, a very great difference between a policy designed to undermine or weaken the structure of the State, and the policy designed to criticise or to express opinions or views on policy or on decisions, however much they may conflict with the views of the Government of the day on particular matters. This incident may well serve to highlight the need ever present in any democracy, and just as much here as anywhere else, for eternal vigilance as the surest guarantee of the liberty of the individual and ultimately the liberty of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate affords one an opportunity of mentioning a number of matters which come within the ambit of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It would be wrong of me if I did not raise a number of matters which have been brought to my attention by a considerable number of my constituents.  For example, very often I have been asked to explain, if I can, the system operated by the Department in the allocation of telephones: what is the order of priorities?  How does one succeed in getting a much-needed telephone?  In a number of cases people have been denied a telephone service in their homes, although there was formerly a telephone in the house.  Quite a number of nurses made application in different <Col N="2023" /> parts of the country for a telephone to enable them to carry out their work, and they have been unable to obtain it.  I know also of a number of trade union officials who are still awaiting a telephone.  I know of some people who have had to forgo promotion in employment because they have not a telephone in their house and could not give any assurance to their employers who were offering the promotion that they would have a telephone within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I believe that in relation to the allocation of telephones there is discrimination against the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; in favour of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;.  This is borne out by the fact that new applicants are now required to pay in advance a year's rental of £12, together with an installation fee of £10, a total of £22.  It is not unusual for persons in employment to find themselves in need of a telephone because of the responsible position they hold.  However, this does not mean that they are men of affluence, and sometimes it is not easy for them to put their hands immediately on £22.  This is something to which the Minister should give consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very poor effort on the part of the Minister's Department in providing more public telephones throughout the country.  In that connection I am sure the Minister is very conscious of the fact that in many parts of this country one can make quicker contact with London than with another part of this country.  The exasperation expressed by people in Kilkee about the time it takes them to get through to Dublin is beyond description.  I wonder why the Minister and his predecessor have not done anything positive about this matter.  I also feel that insufficient attention is being given to the maintenance of the public telephone system.  That is particularly true in the city of Dublin.  In the area I represent, the phones are frequently out of order.  The Minister may say that this is due to vandalism but surely there is some liaison between one Department and another and the situation should not be allowed to arise in which people are left for a <Col N="2024" /> considerable time without service while the telephone is being repaired?  The condition of our telephone boxes leaves much to be desired and it is time something was done about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be inundated with complaints about lost letters recently.  I am aware of a number of cases of lost letters and the satisfaction given to people who complain about this matter is not very great.  There should be a thorough investigation of this matter.  There is a need for more pillarboxes in built-up areas.  It would appear that although it is common knowledge that a number of new houses are being built in an area and that the population is increasing, the Department ignores the need for pillarboxes in such areas.  It is not a nice exercise to have to travel a considerable distance to post a letter or even to take a bus into town to do so. The Minister must also do something about the frequency of collections from these pillarboxes.</P>
    <P>I would ask him if he would indicate whether he has any intention of remedying the situation in regard to temporary postmen.  That situation is ridiculous when one takes into consideration that these people are employed by a Department which is supposed to have their interests at heart.  Many of them have now been working for the Department for a long number of years and they have neither security nor pension rights.  The time is overdue for the Minister to give postmen civil rights, to afford them an opportunity of seeking election to local authorities or to this parliament.  Other State employees holding much more lucrative posts have been given this right but for some reason postmen are denied the opportunity of representing the people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister in answer to a question said that it was his intention to have more stamp vending machines installed in different parts of Dublin. I hope that steps will be taken to see that when these machines are installed, they will operate satisfactorily, that they will not just be placed there and remain unworkable as frequently happens in the Phibsboro area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> People are frequently being asked to put their savings into the Post Office. The majority of people to whom this appeal is made are people who have not got large amounts to invest and the amount of interest offered to them is no inducement to them to use the Post Office Savings Bank.  It is time for the Minister to take another look at the interest rates extended to people who use the Post Office as a savings bank.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk and newspaper publicity about the treatment of Tibor Paul.  In fairness to the people in Telefís Éireann, some statement should now be made telling exactly what happened in that case.  I am very conscious of the fact that there are two sides to the story.  I have heard a lot about Tibor Paul.  I know that he was not a very easy man to get along with.  I know that there have been complaints about the manner in which he approached people and treated them but surely the manner in which he was himself treated is not in keeping with the way in which we Irish people would like to do things?  It was wrong, no matter what he was guilty of, and I do not know what he was guilty of, that a man about to perform on an important occasion should be given a letter indicating that he was finished.  This is not the way things should be done.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not a new trend in Telefís Éireann.  If it is, the trade unions who protect the various classes of people working in Telefís Éireann will not stand for it.  In the interests of everybody who has any connection with Telefís Éireann the atmosphere should be cleared and some explanation given of the treatment of Tibor Paul.  I know that he held two positions in Telefís Éireann, Director of Music and Director of the Symphony Orchestra.  He has been described as a very talented person.  Apart from his many talents and the fact that he is a temperamental person, I have had people telling me that he was a hard taskmaster and difficult to get on with but a genius at his work.</P>
    <P>Surely the treatment meted out to him was wrong?  It will do real harm to this country if the people who are <Col N="2026" /> looking into it believe that we are a people who have no culture, no manners and no regard as to how human beings should be treated.  Even if Tibor Paul were a man detested by the people about him, the way in which he was treated is scandalous.  This whole happening convinced me that there is a need for a public relations officer in Telefís Éireann.  There is a need for somebody there who will be allowed to explain things without being incited to do this, that or the other thing.  We should not forget that television is the most modern method of communication and a great medium of propaganda, a great medium of education.  That being so, we must be extremely careful to ensure that nobody arrogates to himself the right to censor what goes on television. This is undoubtedly being attempted and is what is promised, if one has regard to what the Taoiseach said quite recently as to whether or not he would interfere with television.  It will certainly be a most peculiar situation we will find ourselves in.</P>
    <P>I remember when I tried to put down Parliamentary Questions about things that had appeared on television, the answer I got was that it was not a matter for the Minister.  There is no better example of that than the attitude adopted by the Minister for Transport and Power when he says that he has no responsibility for CIE.  This is a peculiar situation.  We now find the Taoiseach indicating that any Minister, if he feels like it, on a whim, can pick up a telephone and make a complaint and stop something from going on television.  John Citizen cannot do that.  I maintain that neither the Taoiseach nor any Minister of State was ever given authority to perform in such a manner.  It is absolutely wrong.  It is about time it was realised that Ministers of State, no matter who they are, are appointed, having placed themselves before the people on given issues, and have no right to take unto themselves the right to decide as to whether or not a matter will be presented to the people.  It seems to me that Fianna Fáil, like everybody else, have grown very much alive to the usefulness of television and have become <Col N="2027" /> extremely afraid of being exposed on television.  This is the only conclusion that one can come to.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is not the first time that there has been this blatant interference with what was attempted to be put on television.  I am very conscious of the fact that more often than not a one-sided version of a story has been given on television and it did appear that somebody was playing a part in insisting that that one-sided version went across.  Television has been used repeatedly to give a one-sided version in relation to industrial disputes.  Only a few weeks ago it was announced on television that a strike in Dublin had been settled and, to everybody's surprise, the next morning the strike was still on.  What sort of carry-on that was remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that television is an important medium of access to the people, better use can be made of television to enable the people to appreciate the problems of the day. I would ask the Minister to use his influence to try to have more programmes dealing with trade union-employer relations.  The Minister could well utilise the services of the NIEC who could undoubtedly put on suitable programmes which would give the employers' point of view and the workers' point of view in relation to important matters and perhaps bring about a better understanding of matters of vital interest to the nation's economy.  Far too infrequently is there any type of discussion of that kind on Telefís Éireann.  On the other hand, there are a number of programmes which serve out absolute tripe.  There is a lot of pretence going on.  As a Dublin man, I can say that one of the recent objectionable programmes was under the title &ldquo;Noble Call&rdquo;.  This was supposed to be a portrayal of what happens in singing pubs, which are a very well-known feature of parts of Dublin.  One imagined that the television camera crew would go around the pubs and show the people disporting themselves and singing, reciting, and so on.  That is not the case.  This programme is televised in the station, not in the pubs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> There is amateurish handling of some of the shows that are put on.  It has been suggested to me that the reason for this is the cutting down of expenditure and allowing people to attempt things for which they are not really trained.</P>
    <P>Having said what I have said by way of criticism, I must say that the Minister's Department are to be complimented on the progress they have made in the personnel department of Radio Telefís Éireann.  At last, somebody has wakened up to the importance of having a sufficient number of personnel and competent personnel staff in the establishment.  It has been said that there were very awkward situations in the past few years.  Being a young and new station, it could have very easily happened that all sorts of disputes could have arisen, all brought about by the wrong people being placed in positions and being put into jobs because of the influence they had with the Government.  As a result of consistent agitation and, I understand also, an indication by trade union representatives that they would not tolerate this carry-on any longer, the personnel staff has been increased and some competent persons have been put in there and, in consequence, a great deal of understanding has been created and there is comparative peace in Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>While we realise the importance of that being the case, we cannot ignore the importance of the men at the top doing what they should do to create a proper image for Radio Telefís Éireann.  This brings me back again to the point I have made about having a proper PRO and about the necessity to explain what exactly happened when Eamonn Andrews ceased to be Chairman and what exactly happened in connection with Tibor Paul, and not to have everybody giving free play to his imagination and circulating rumours.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is not without knowing the many rumours that were in circulation about 12 months ago in connection with persons in high positions in Telefís Éireann.  They were supposedly involved in this, that and the other thing.  Shocking rumours went <Col N="2029" /> about.  Some of the persons found it necessary to publish statements in the newspapers.  This is all wrong.  If the job is to be done right, the people should be told why this or that action is taken.  Care should also be taken to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann are kept free from interference in regard to programmes.  In particular, the news should not be lop-sided.  The Minister, his colleagues and the Taoiseach should be the last persons to pick up the telephone and object to criticism, whether it be good or bad.  We are supposed to be living in a democratic State.  One can only come to the conclusion that this is merely pretence when we find the Taoiseach stating clearly that he or any other Minister can and will interfere with what goes on in Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have moved to refer back this Estimate.  That is a procedure deliberately taken by the Opposition for the purpose of indicating to the House and the country that there is a grave matter involved relating to the administration of the Minister's Department during the previous year.  There is such a grave matter involved. It arises from the administration of the Act under which the Minister answers to this House for the radio and television service operated by Radio Telefís Éireann.  Section 18 of the Act passed by this House states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy, or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Legislature when enacting that Act of Parliament did not stop there. It went on in section 31 to make provision for the very exceptional circumstances in which the Government thought it right to notify the Authority that some specific item of news was inimical to the public interest or constituted a national hazard.  In this very exceptional circumstance, the Minister <Col N="2030" /> was given authority, under strictly defined and limited conditions, to issue an order to RTE which they had a statutory duty to comply with.  But Oireachtas Éireann laid down that in any such circumstance there was a statutory duty on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if questioned, to render an account to this House as to why he did it, in what circumstances he did it and what the particular item of news or information or other feature was that he had to direct the RTE Authority to delete from its programmes.</P>
    <P>There is a well-known doctrine of the law, the doctrine of exclusion. The doctrine of exclusion provides that where the Oireachtas lays down certain specified conditions for the exercise of power, it says by implication that this power must not be used except in accordance with the specific proviso it has laid down for the use of it.  I want to say it is a shocking thing, and a very dangerous thing, that individual Ministers of State should claim the right to ring up RTE and ask them to delete items of news. The awful thing about this is that in matters relating to our fundamental rights, it is unquestionably true that, if they are overtly or openly challenged, we have a long democratic tradition in this country which will excite the vast majority of our people energetically to resist.  But the danger is that these fundamental rights are nibbled away without the people perceiving what is afoot.  It is the function of Dáil Éireann primarily, because we are trained politicians and proud of it, to call the attention of the public at large to such minor infractions of fundamental rights as may hereafter be used on which to base intolerable claims of censorship which would reduce this country to the position of a byword before the world.</P>
    <P>A good many people, the fathers and grandfathers of us all, made very substantial sacrifies to set up a free, independent republic in this country.  We have every right to hold our heads high among the countries of the world that we have <Col N="2031" /> in this country maintained under great stress and trouble our democratic institutions. It is something we can be very proud of, that we carried them safe and secure through a Civil War, through the years that ensured on that Civil War, through the changes of Government that have since taken place &mdash; all in strict accord with the highest principles of democratic action. That has been in no small measure due to the fact that we had functioning in this country throughout this whole period a free press.  We had Government papers; we had papers that did not support the Government; we had papers that sometimes went one way and sometimes the other.  But at all times no Government would seek to order a newspaper to delete from its columns an item of news because they did not like it.</P>
    <P>There is added to the great media of public communication, which heretofore have been the press, a new medium, that is, radio and television. Unless the Government of the day are prepared to impose on themselves, whatever Government are in office, the self-denying ordinance that they shall treat the independent Authority set up by this House on the same basis as they would treat the Fourth Estate, that is, the Press taken as a whole, we are on the highroad to the vilest form of censorship.  I deliberately use the adjective &ldquo;the vilest form&rdquo; because it will be a form of censorship masquerading as freedom.  If the Government came out bluntly and said: &ldquo;We claim the right to censor,&rdquo; you can fight that and the people are at once awake to the danger with which they are confronted. But the Government are trying sleazily to hold: &ldquo;We do not claim the right to censorship,&rdquo; but in effect are carrying out a vicious, unauthorised and shameful form of censorship which they themselves are ashamed to avow.</P>
    <P>There is one crude instance of this. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made a statement in Dáil Éireann in which he advised the small farmers to hold on to their cattle.  That statement was challenged by the chairman of the NFA organisation who <Col N="2032" /> made a comment upon it.  That was broadcast, whereupon the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries &mdash; not the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; rings up RTE and says: &ldquo;I think you are failing in your public duty in publishing what the NFA said about my statement.&rdquo;  He did not complain that his statement was not being published: he complained that the comment on the statement would be published. He said, further, that he thought the comment ought to be taken off and, to the eternal discredit of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, they submitted to that covert threat.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in the exercise of the duties imposed on him by section 31 of the Act, that he must be prepared to act within the ambit of his authority as the Minister responsible to this House.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries honestly believed that the comment to which he objected constituted a hazard to the welfare of the State, was not his proper course of action to ring up the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and to say to his colleague in Government, in effect: &ldquo;I ask you to exercise your functions under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to write an order to Montrose asking them to withdraw the paragraph which seems to cast doubt on the veracity of my prognostication and advice in regard to holding cattle by the farmer&rdquo;?  There is not a Deputy who does not know that if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries were acting in good faith, he had the means to act in accordance with the law.  The Minister had the means to delete the paragraph which, in the judgement of the Government, was contrary to public authority and then he had the subsequent duty to defend that decision in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I will defend the ultimate authority of Dáil Éireann against any other authority in this country, Radio Telefís Éireann or anybody else.  We are the supreme judge; we are the representatives of the people.  We choose the Government.  The Government are entitled to act executively, subject to <Col N="2033" /> their obligation to answer to Dáil Éireann for their executive acts.  But here is employed a sleazy, backdoor, corner-boy procedure to get by devious and dishonest means that which the Minister could have got if he were entitled to get it through the ordinary channels provided by Dáil Éireann under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority &mdash; I think deplorably &mdash; published a statement that the paragraph subsequently deleted at the request of the Minister for Agriculture was an editorial error.  They would have done much more for the dignity of this country, and particularly for the dignity of this House, if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when introducing this Estimate, had said frankly, in effect: &ldquo;I will admit that this misunderstanding arose from an executive error on the part of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who, if he wanted something deleted from the programme in the public interest, should have asked me to exercise my powers under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, when I would have done so if it appeared to the Government that it was my duty so to act.&rdquo;  Instead, we have this silly position of the Taoiseach, in an effort to cover up for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, making a new claim which, if pursued to its logical authority, would reduce this country to the deplorable situation in which France finds itself today, of protesting it is a democracy but allowing its Government shamelessly to slant the public service on the national radio and television service.</P>
    <P>There may be Deputies who will say that what is good enough for France is good enough for us.  There is nothing good enough for us but the best.  We have no atomic bomb; we have no mighty armies; we have no vast wealth. However, we have a long tradition in this country of faithfulness to the fundamental principles of freedom.  In the troubled world in which we live, it is useful to have some democracy to point to that, in fair whether and foul, has clung fast to that.  Furthermore, in <Col N="2034" /> this country, even the most unpopular man in Ireland can be certain of one thing, namely, that if, within the law, he seeks to make his point heard in any public place, then all resources of the state will be employed to protect his right to say it.</P>
    <P>If an unpopular man gets up on a barrel at a street corner anywhere in Dublin or throughout the country and proceeds, within the law, to promulgate unpopular views it is edifying and dramatic to see the Garda Síochána throw a cordon around him to protect him against any mob that seeks to deprive him of that right.  What are we to say about that situation while, at the same time, the sneakthief, like a pickpocket, is reaching into the people's breast-pocket to take by stealth from them the freedom which, in public, they alleged they are concerned to protect for the humblest citizen of the land?  Which is the greater injury &mdash; to stop a man from speaking his mind in the public streets of Dublin or to say to Radio Telefís Éireann, whose programmes enter the parlour of every home in Ireland, in effect: &ldquo;We do not like that item of news.  Take it off&rdquo;?  If they claim that right, then I put it to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that, if he is true to the Oath of office which he took when his seals of office were given to him, he must reconcile that claims with the section of the Act under which he acts, section 18, which states:</P>
    <P>(1) It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>That was not done on the night the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries intervened to remove an item of news.</P>
    <P>Now I shall make an allegation which I know to be true.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and many other Ministers are making it a more and more frequent practice to make representations of the character <Col N="2035" /> made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on that occasion to Radio Telefís Éireann.  They are simply ignoring their own colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and I want to say to him that if he had the spirit of a jack rabbit, he would rise in his wrath at his own Government and say, in effect: &ldquo;Either you make me responsible for this to Dáil Éireann, or you make the whole bunch of you responsible but you cannot have it both ways.  If I am the Minister responsible for controlling Radio Telefís Éireann, and answering to Dáil Éireann, for it, I shall not have every Minister and Parliamentary Secretary interfering with the discretion reposed in the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority under section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  If there is to be any abatement of that discretion, then I am the Minister to make it under section 31, in accordance with the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs presents to this House a ludicrous spectacle if, holding the seals of office that he does hold, at the same time he suffers himself to be turned into a despised doormat by any colleague who chooses to ignore him, and go behind his back, to do by stealth what he, in the exercise of the statutory authority conferred upon him by section 31, has decided cannot or should not be done.</P>
    <P>If I am to judge the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the claim will be made that anyone can make representations.  Of course he can and anyone has a remedy against Radio Telefís Éireann if that body makes a statement which is libellous or slanderous, according to the decision of the courts, and they can sue for damages and recover damages. Any citizen of this State has a right to ring up the Radio Telefís Éireann authority and protest against the quality of a programme, but no citizen has the right to order them to take it off.</P>
    <P>I want to make this proposition now: nobody in this country has the right to order Radio Telefís Éireann <Col N="2036" /> to take an item out of a programme except the Minister for the Posts and Telegraphs under the authority conferred upon him by this House under section 31.  I do not want to make the extreme case that the Minister responsible for a State Department, hearing an item of news broadcast at, say, six o'clock, is not entitled to make a statement commenting on that item and is not entitled to ring up Radio Telefís Éireann or instruct the Government Information Bureau to communicate with Radio Telefís Éireann and say: &ldquo;You have published a statement that such-and-such is the case.  I ask you to publish with that statement in any future broadcast the following comment by me, to the effect that the facts related by you are not true and the Minister is in a position to say that the allegation made is without foundation&rdquo;, and such further comment as may be fair and equitable to keep the Minister's position as clearly before the people as the allegation complained of; but the one thing that is absolutely certain is that nobody in this country has the right to go to the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, as we constituted it, and, remember, we are the people who did constitute it, and order them to remove an item except the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and then only within the strict limitations of section 31, the major restriction of which is that in any such action taken he must do it in writing so that there can be no ambiguity about what he actually did, No. 1, and, No. 2, he must be prepared to answer to Dáil Éireann for whatever writing he issues under the appropriate section.</P>
    <P>I warn this House.  Mark you, it is nearly time this House began to flick its earns when I warn; some of my friends in the press complain sometimes that &ldquo;Mr. Dillon is making the same speech for the 15th time&rdquo;, the reason being, of course, that the first 15 times it did not penetrate the thick skull but, on the 16th time, the thick skull wakes up in astonishment to discover: &ldquo;My gracious, he said that 15 times and it only sounded like a feeble echo in my ears.  By heaven, it was true.  I was the gom who did not understand him the first 15 times.  Now that he has said it the 16th time, I <Col N="2037" /> understand it, when it is too late, when there is no money to build houses, when we are borrowing in Bonn, borrowing, or trying to borrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am discussing prophecies and I am going to go right on discussing them because I am going to make another one now, if you will listen a minute.  The simplest citizen in this country, never mind a public representative in Dáil Éireann, has the right to commend his wares for what they are to potential purchasers and I am offering prophecies now urging Deputies to heed them while there is time and not on the 16th time of repetition when the tornado is upon us.</P>
      <P>I am warning Dáil Éireann now, as certainly as you are sitting in your seats, this is the first step on the road to censorship of Radio Telefís Éireann.  Mark these words: people grew eloquent in warning others of the danger of the atomic bomb.  Compared with the power of television, the atomic bomb has not the significance of a popgun.  The worst the atomic bomb can do to any of us is to kill our bodies.  As surely as you are sitting in this House, it is in the power of television to corrupt our souls and, what is worse, to corrupt the souls of our children.  You are dealing now with the greatest power the world has ever seen for the corruption of the human soul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, when George Orwell wrote his famous book &ldquo;1984&rdquo;, prophesying the horrors that can come upon us, one of them was that into every home would be poured the voice of a great controller, who would mould the minds of men until ultimately the whole of society would be <Col N="2038" /> like putty in his hands.  Does none of you realise that that is what is happening? That voice is now speaking in every parlour in the country.  Go out and look at any of the suburbs of Dublin.  Go into any country town. Start now along the country roads of Ireland over which we carried rural electrification.  Village, town, city and country are all now subject to this omnipresent and devastating influence. No one can exaggerate its danger.  No one can exaggerate the complexity and difficulty of finding a method of control which, while preserving essential ultimate control in the hands of the people, will prevent the possibility of executive control by the Government for the time being.  It is an inexpressibly difficult thing to do.  I think we devised in our Television Act a very fair and prudent machine to achieve our purpose.  I warn Dáil Éireann that the first steps are now being taken, the first probes are being made, to discover whether we are prepared to connive at a breach in the citadel we raised for the protection of the public mind from indoctrination by any power in this country in relation to the facts.  Stand now, or you will never get the chance to stand.  It is because we feel the time has come to stand and fight, so that this detestable vision of George Orwell will not take shape in Ireland, that we put down this motion to refer back.  I have spoken strongly on this subject because I feel strongly on it and because I want the Deputies who share my passion for freedom to feel with me that now is the time to stand firm.</P>
    <P>I want now to make some cursory remarks on other matters which are of minor significance.  I have often pleaded for objective reporting of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann and by that I meant that the people should be told substantially what Deputies said here.  I want to compliment Radio Éireann on the success which attends their efforts to provide just that.  The programme at 10.30 &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;, is a good, conscientious effort to present, in the time available to them, what Deputies said here.  Sometimes it would appear to some of us <Col N="2039" /> that it does not adequately cover what we think to be of vital importance, and on other occasions it would appear to other Deputies that matters which were of deep interest to them have not been adequately covered.  However, taken by and large, it is fairly done and it is honestly done, bearing in mind the obligation on the newscaster to give a fair exposition of Ministers' replies to questions and the resultant apparent weighting of the news in favour of ministerial pronouncements. Once that duty has been discharged, and I see no escape from it, fair coverage must be given to Ministers' answers to questions proposed and in the subsequent reports of debates, the reporter goes as near to reaching the ideal of objectivity as it would be reasonable for the most captious critic to demand.  I do not know who he is and I do not give a damn.  If I did not like what he was doing, I would tell him so here, but whoever is doing it, I offer him my congratulations on a job discharged in accordance with the highest ethics of the profession to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now on some matters mentioned in the Minister's very sketchy statement.  In regard to one thing, I do think that the Minister does himself a great disservice. I do not know whether the story of what the postal, telegraphic and telephone services provide has ever been adequately told.  We all air, and rightly air, in the discussion on the Estimate our criticism of their shortcomings but we should sometimes hear&mdash;and we can hear it from nobody but the Minister because he is the only person who knows &mdash; that story.  While freely admitting that there are defects, perhaps once in every five years somebody might get up and say that bad and all as it is, it has this to claim, and then tell us of its difficulties and the measure of success that attended the efforts to overcome them, tell us of the expanded services and of the things that have been done.</P>
    <P>I see a reference in the Minister's statement to stamps.  There is a lot of philatelic interest in them.  As they are <Col N="2040" /> 5d apiece, certainly they have a financial interest, if not a philatelic interest, but why must all commemorative stamps be as big as a bench?  To carry them about in your wallet is a labour of love; to find room on the envelope to accommodate one, never mind two, unless you have an envelope which is five inches long, is virtually impossible. A stamp well designed and skilfully executed can be just as impressive in the ordinary square size as it is when, as I say, it is as big as a bench. From every point of view, I suggest that some attention be given to the convenience of the public as well as to the shortsightedness of the average philatelist.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister telling us&mdash;and it only exasperates Deputies when he does tell us&mdash;that we are not as badly off as we think we are in relation to operators answering 10 calls when we lift the telephone. I know the Minister's difficulties and I took the trouble, through his courtesy, to visit the central Dublin exchanges, the better to understand the problem they have, and it is a problem.  The problem is exacerbated by staff difficulties in the night time service.  As I understand the problem from my experience&mdash;and if I state it incorrectly, the Minister may correct me&mdash;most of the young ladies at these exchanges are young and attractive and therefore not unnaturally a very large proportion of them get married, God bless them.  A girl is not trained to the level of a high degree of skill, when she lands in with an engagement ring on her finger and gives three months notice that she is going to get married at Christmas.  That is a difficulty: by the time you have her trained, she has also been trained for matrimony, though that is a training that has been going on unknown to the Minister and he does not hear about it until she tells one of the lady superintendents.  Therefore, you have a continual turnover of young ladies getting married.  That unfortunately provides the Minister with the problem of trying to build up a large, permanent skilled staff and we must make allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> The second problem as far as I can see it&mdash;I do not know if Deputies have visited exchanges as I have &mdash; is that an operator sits in front of an array of lights, say, 12 rows of 12 lights, each light representing one contact point.  One of the most difficult things on God's earth is to persuade a temperamental, intelligent young lady all day long to pursue the weary task of reading her switchboard like a book. If she would start at the top left-hand corner and then read across line by line everything would go like a wedding bell, but unfortunately some of the more enthusiastic girls do not do this.  They read line I and attend to a call and then read line 2, where there is no call, then line 3, no call, and then line 4, and then the trouble starts because a call comes in on line 2 and she cannot resist going back to line 2.  If she would only realise that that call is appearing on 11 other boards and read on to lines 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, dealing with the calls as they come up, and leaving the other eleven girls in her block to deal with the lights coming on in the lines she has already scanned, the service probably would be largely maintained.</P>
    <P>However, the trouble is that as soon as you have trained her to realise that somewhat tedious discipline, some charming creature with whiskers has got her to apply for an alternative position and she is wheeling a pram before you know where she is.  None of us can complain and we can only rejoice because it is very natural, but one cannot help feeling &mdash; I am a little shy of saying it because I know how difficult it is to train people in special arts and crafts, and particularly in the techniques of a very mechanical and, one might say, dreary, occupation&mdash; that that created a very real defect in the operation of answering the 10 signal and that it ought to be possible to overcome it somewhat better than is being done at the moment.  I certainly got the impression, and I was not dead to the fact that my approaching visit was communicated to the staff, that those responsible for the administration of the day-to-day work of the exchange <Col N="2042" /> were highly competent people, most earnestly desirous of giving the public the best service it was possible to provide.</P>
    <P>The last problem&mdash;probably there are others in the administration&mdash;was that I thought one room rather gloomy whereas another seemed more cheerful and brighter and I said to one of the officials: &ldquo;If I have any criticism to make, it is why have you got one very cheerful, bright room and the other which is rather gloomy and drab by comparison?&rdquo; He replied that he would be inclined to agree with me but that they had asked the girls and that the girls would much rather work in what I thought was the rather gloomy room.  It seemed to be easier for them to work there.  These are things one has to learn by experience and therefore I do not set up to instruct the instructors.  That is a very highly skilled job but I think that probably one of the difficulties of this problem is trying to persuade the young ladies to read their switchboards like a book.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the night service in which connection Deputy Tully spoke about a lorry driver who drove a lorry for eight hours and worked four or five or six hours as a temporary telephone operator.  &ldquo;Surely one does not expect a man to work 18 hours a day,&rdquo; I said to Deputy Tully and he replied: &ldquo;If they do not, you will not be able to get operators at all.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that this practice is pretty general.  It is all based on the crazy notion that it is good economics for the Post Office to work with cheap labour.  I do not believe that: I think the Minister would be quite justified in coming to the House and saying he was going to stop this business of employing, as a normal thing, operators on a part-time basis and declaring that he would have a day staff and a night staff or three shifts, if necessary, I do not think that would be necessary; I think a day shift and night shift would be sufficient, with a skeleton staff, perhaps, to <Col N="2043" /> bridge the gap.  I think the Minister should go to the Government and tell them this cock will not fight, that no matter what they do, they cannot provide a tolerable service without permanent trained staff.  That simply means recruiting more girls.  We need them and whatever the cost we must pay it.  The telephone service is paying its way and will pay its way much better when the Minister is in a position to provide the appropriate equipment and services.</P>
      <P>I believe that one of the problems is that he is trying to operate with a part-time staff, not properly trained and who, if the truth were known, do not give a damn.  It is not their principal job.  I do not believe they have any pride in the work they do at the Post Office as temporary telephone operators.  They are lorry drivers, porters, carpenters or perhaps building workers and that is their normal avocation and the work in which they take the pride which makes a man give of his best.  Their work in the telephone exchange is merely a sideline to earn a bit of extra money.  You cannot possibly expect them to take the interest in that work that people earning their living in the Department ordinarily take.  Until the Minister makes that change, I do not believe he can solve the exasperating problem of interminable delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear on this.  I have no complaint if the telephonist comes in after four or five rings and says: &ldquo;Would you mind waiting a moment; the board is very busy.&rdquo; No rational man would complain about that, but it is absolutely infuriating to ring for five or ten minutes while nothing happens except that the bell buzzes. For the benefit of my colleagues, I can give one piece of information which the never-failing courtesy of the officials of the Department prompted them to give me.  It can happen that you have got a defective circuit so do not thump down the telephone, pick it up immediately and dial 10 again because if you had got a defective circuit in the first case, you will probably get it again.  Instead, you may thump down the telephone, <Col N="2044" /> then count ten and dial 10 again and if you have been on a defective circuit, the probability of getting back on to it after counting ten is reduced to virtually nil.  This may spare some of my colleagues trouble.</P>

      <P>Finally, I know nothing of the merits of the termination of Mr. Tibor Paul's contract.  I am not going to discuss the merits at all but I want to say that we live in a civilised community.  Artists are artists, and when dealing with them we recognise that we are dealing with temperamental people; they would not be artists if they were not.  How in the name of commonsense and humanity can anyone explain to me or to anybody else the alleged fact that the final notice of the termination of Mr. Paul's contract was given to him on the Royal Dublin Society's premises, three minutes before he began to conduct a concert?  Why was that done? Is it true that it was done, can the Minister tell us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to warn the Minister that I could not understand, no matter what the whole story is, how the final notice, when the period of uncertainly or ambiguity had concluded, could properly be delivered to any man at any address other than his home.  I do not think that is an unreasonable stipulation.  If he were a business man with an office, it could properly be delivered to his registered office, but in <Col N="2045" /> the alternative so categorical a document as that, albeit its advent was forecast, could not with propriety be delivered anywhere but to his home where he would have the privacy of the domestic circle in which to accept the finality of the inevitable, however distressing.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister&mdash;I suppose we politicians are artists in our own way&mdash;that if he were about to address an important dinner, with invited guests who had come from foreign countries to study Post Office methods in this country, if he were about to speak as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of the people and on behalf of the State and the Taoiseach suddenly took it into his head to reshuffle the Cabinet and sent him a message asking him to place his resignation in his hands, saying that for the time being he must ask him to accept the fact that there was no room for him in the Cabinet, would he think that the moment before he was called on to speak was the appropriate moment to send in that letter by hand to a public place which was not his home?  Even though the Taoiseach had said to him in the morning: &ldquo;Listen, Minister, I have to reshuffle the Cabinet and it may turn out that when it is done, I will have to ask you to retire to the back benches either permanently or for a period,&rdquo; would the Minister not think it was a cruel, brutally offensive thing to send the letter by hand to be delivered just as he was about to rise and speak at the dinner?  That is in substance what was done to Tibor Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care how inefficient the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might be.  I do not care how insubordinate he had been.  I do not care how difficult a colleague he had proved himself to be.  I would say if the Taoiseach was a man at all, he would have finalised this matter with a letter addressed to the Minister's home or at least to his residence in Dublin.  That is the only feature of the Tibor Paul incident of which I am qualified to speak.  I do not claim the qualification to speak on its artistic implications. However, on the ordinary fundamentals <Col N="2046" /> of decent relations between Christian men, I think, to say the least of it, a grave error of judgement was involved in the circumstances of the finalising of the notice Mr. Tibor Paul received.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has a better story to tell of the work of the Post Office and the telephone service than he has succeeded in indicating to this House.  Deputy Mullen was talking here about public relations and how useful they were.  Tell the House the truth. Tell the country the truth.  The Minister will agree with me he has a staff with an immensely good tradition.  He will agree with me they do extremely difficult things with a courtesy and skill which many other Departments of State and semi-State bodies could with great advantage, emulate.  They are entitled to have that story told, and if the Minister tells the whole story to the House, he will find he will not be addressing an unsympathetic audience.</P>
    <P>We have moved to refer this Estimate back, not on the record of the general administration of the Post Office but on the issue as to whether the foundation stone of censorship is to be laid in our presence and with our approbation through the medium of television.  Our answer is &ldquo;No, never&rdquo; and if you try to do it, some day we will get the opportunity of undoing the dirty work to which you put your hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has, as usual, performed a very necessary and a very useful parliamentary function in stating here in his own inimitably lucid and eloquent way one at least of the fundamental freedoms which go to make up what is loosely called a democratic society.  No thinking person who is a member of this House and no thinking person outside this House could but feel perturbed and anxious at the recent instances of intervention by a Minister and of the effective manipulation of a news item by a Minister of State.  I am not concerned with the discussion or arguments which coverage around this matter, but I am concerned with the violation of law which herein occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, and I do not want <Col N="2047" /> to be repetitious, that the Act which enabled the setting up of the Television Authority, while it provided in theory that there would be no censorship or no interference with the running of Radio Telefís Éireann from any quarter, that the policy of the Authority would be so to conduct its affairs as to ensure that all sections of the people would have their business, in so far as it was of interest to the public, reported objectively, at the same time, section 31 of the Act, to which reference has been made, did and does enable the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to direct, in writing, if he thinks it necessary, the removal from television programmes of an offensive item, or direct, if he thinks it necessary, the Authority to proceed in so far as its functions are concerned in a certain way, provided he is satisfied that the public interest is at stake and provided he does this in writing, the object of that being that there may be a record of any such interference or intervention on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the case which has been cited here, we have had the extraordinary experience of a Minister watching television, having his own statement of a matter concerning his Department reported, hearing a report of an opposition view from a spokesman of a section of the people with whom he was concerned, ringing up and, not just trying to achieve censorship but, in fact, securing censorship.  It may seem a matter of small moment but to me, at any rate and to the Labour Party it is a matter of very considerable importance.  Activity of this kind must be stamped on immediately it rears its head.  It is not to be thought that this administration is going to live much longer&mdash;the death wish is on it and certain of its members are busily engaged in assembling their own political coffins, but even in the short period in which it will remain in control of this country, we, in so far as we have any power as members of the Opposition in this House, will try to protect the fundamental liberties.</P>
    <P>It is of no moment to me what the political colour of the Government <Col N="2048" /> may be in a situation of this kind. Everybody who has made any kind of examination of the historical development of the Europe of the 'Thirties, who has given even the most cursory glance at that dramatic time, will know that the forces of evil, where they came to power, did so in the main by the manipulation and deployment of the organs of propaganda.  It has been said that no greater organ of propaganda exists in the world today than that of television.  It can affect even the illiterate. Formerly propaganda could have been said to be confined to the printed word or to the spoken word, whether addressed from platform or public roster, but&mdash;and I do not use the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; in any denigratory fashion&mdash;the propaganda that can be exercised through the medium of television is of such a fantastic nature that there is not any comparison with any other form heretofore known to man.</P>
    <P>That is why we have to be very jealous, very careful and very scrutinising when we come to discuss and examine how television in this country is being employed.  I could say a great deal about Telefís Éireann, both complimentary and uncomplimentary.  One could talk about nepotism in Telefís Éireann and we could have quite an illuminating half hour were we to trace relationships through blood or marriage in certain sections of it but one must also say that we are fortunate in having attracted to the service some of the keenest brains to be found in these islands in that avocation.</P>
    <P>To return to the most important thing with which this Parliament has to deal and with which it is our duty as members of the Dáil to deal, the question of the exercise of a political censorship, let me add that it is not alone this censorship which was so crudely exercised by the Minister for Agriculture on a recent occasion.  Let me add that this is not the only example of the attempt to seize Telefís Éireann by the Government Party, to make it their own, to use it for their own purposes and to use it to mould public opinion in their own interests.</P>
    <P>We have an example in the programme called &ldquo;Division&rdquo;.  I am not <Col N="2049" /> speaking of the actual discharge of this programme by the technicians.  I want to refer to the manner in which the Government have grabbed an unjustified representation in this programme. If we look at British television and their method of political reporting, not all is admirable but one aspect is.  If there is a question of national importance for discussion in Britain, we are accustomed to seeing one person speaking for the Government, one for the Conservative Opposition and one for the diminutive Liberal Party.  That is not the rule that Fianna Fáil follow.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> That Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that certain former employees of Córas Iompair Éireann have (a) pensions that lack uniformity, (b) pensions that have not increased in some instances when others have so increased, and (c) pensions wholly inadequate to meet the increasing cost of living, and calls upon the Government to take effective steps to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Lindsay.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion moved last night by my colleague, Deputy Lindsay, and standing in the names of Deputy Lindsay, Deputy Donegan, Deputy Tom O'Donnell and Deputy Ryan.  The motion calls attention to the scandalous treatment being meted out to certain categories of pensioners by our national transport company and is another effort to secure some measure of justice for a section of our community who are the victims of a pension scheme which is unjust, inequitable, inadequate and unnecessarily complicated.</P>
      <P>The question of CIE pensions has been raised in this House on numerous occasions.  Many Deputies have been approached by these unfortunate persons down the years.  In November, 1963, I moved a motion of a similar nature calling attention to this problem. Apart from a small increase granted to certain categories in 1954, the position is the same now.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that the pensions paid by CIE to certain categories of its pensioners are a disgrace in a Christian society and certainly reflect no credit on the national transport company or on the Minister.  The manner in which their pensioners are treated by CIE is the most glaring social injustice in our society at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIE pension scheme is so complex that it is very difficult to unravel it.  I have attempted to do so. The categories of pensioners in whom I am interested can be divided into three groups: first, those who retired prior to 1956 and who now receive £1 per week pension; secondly, those <Col N="2051" /> who retired since 1956 and who now receive a pension of £1 2s 6d per week; and thirdly, those between the ages of 65 and 70, who receive £2 11s 3d per week.</P>
    <P>A feature of the CIE pension scheme which has been commented upon on numerous occasions and which has been condemned is that all CIE pensions are reduced when the pensioner reaches the age of 70 years. The Ministers on several occasions, has justified this reduction on the ground that at the age of 70 years, the pensioner qualifies for contributory old age pension.  Before going into that, I shall try to put the pension scheme into perspective.  I have already enumerated the categories of pensions &mdash;persons receiving £1 per week, persons receiving £1 2s 6d per week and persons receiving £2 11s 3d.  The next question is: what is the number in each category?  In the debate on the Fine Gael motion on 27th November, 1963, at column 1009, volume 206 of the Dáil Debates, the Minister for Transport and Power said that on 1st November, 1963, there were 2,399 CIE pensioners altogether.  On 23rd February, 1966, in reply to a question which I tabled, the Minister told me that the numbers in the various categories were: 1,063 pensioners in receipt of £1 per week; 787 in receipt of £1 2s 6d per week and 372 in receipt of £2 11s 3d per week.</P>
    <P>In 1956, amending legislation was introduced but, unfortunately, the increase then granted in the pension at 65 years of age, from 37/6d to £2 11 3d did not apply to those who retired prior to 1st April, 1956 but, in 1964, certain increases were given.  Pensioners who now receive £1 per week received at that time only 12/- per week.  Their pension was brought from 12/- to £1.  The second category of pensioners were brought from £1 to £1 2s 6d and persons in receipt of £2 11s 3d, that is, persons aged 65 to 70 years, received no increase.</P>
    <P>We have, then, the outrageous situation that there are in this year, 1966, 1,063 persons in receipt of a pension of £1 a week from our national transport <Col N="2052" /> company.  Fifty years ago, transport workers when retiring received a gratuity of £500 approximately, plus a pension of 16/- per week.  So, in 50 years we have made wonderful progress in the matter of transport workers pensions! There is no justification whatever for the difference in the pensions paid.  There should be no grounds for having three different categories of pension.  I submit also that there is no justification for reducing the pension when the pensioner reaches the age of 70 years.  The pension of £2 11s 3d which he receives from the age of 65 to 70 is little enough without having it reduced to £1 2s 6d.</P>
    <P>There are 1,063 pensioners in receipt of £1 per week.  Comparatively speaking, that may seem a small number, but we are dealing with men, most of whom are over the age of 70, all of whom gave a life-time of service to our transport system and many of whom also gave sterling service in the struggle for freedom.  Surely in this year of 1966 it should not be beyond our capacity to pay a reasonable pension to these men?  Surely there must be something very wrong when we tolerate a situation in which a State company can give golden handshakes and exorbitant pensions to the top echelon and, at the same time, pay £1 or 22/6d per week to over 1,000 long-service employees?  We have on numerous occasions in this House voted millions for various projects.  I have no doubt whatever that the House will now readily agree to whatever measures the Minister will take to remedy this glaring social injustice.</P>
    <P>As I said, most of these men are over 70 years.  In five years time, or certainly in ten years, most of them will have passed away.  In fact, looking at the statistics relating to CIE pensioners for the past five years, one is struck by the annual reduction in their numbers.  I appeal to the Minister in the interests of justice and fair play to accept this motion and to give these unfortunate people some measure of comfort in their declining years.  I believe that justice and equity demand it and that public opinion will support it.  As I said, I have no doubt that this <Col N="2053" /> House will agree to whatever measures the Minister may take to remedy the glaring defects in the CIE pensions scheme.  I submit that when these pensioners reach the age of 70 their pensions of £2 11s 3d should not be reduced.  In the case of those who are now past the age of 70 and whose pensions have been reduced this pension of £2 11s 3d should be restored. This will give us a levelling out in pensions.  It would be an equitable arrangement and would remedy most of the defects and injustices in the CIE pension scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have greater sympathy for anybody outside the unfortunate recipients of these meagre pensions, it is for the movers of this motion.  I can forecast in advance the stereotyped reply they will get from the Minister for Transport and Power. It is hard for me to get enthusiastic about pressing my case here because I know in advance what the Minister will say.  I have been a Member of this House since the opening of the 17th Dáil on 2nd June 1964.  The first question I tabled for answer by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in relation to the matter now before the House.  I felt intensely that an injustice was being perpetrated on my colleagues in the railway.  As a railway man myself, I can perhaps understand their problems better than most Deputies.  I was in close contact with old railwayman who had given a lifetime of service to the GSR and, subsequently, to CIE.  I felt at that time I could blaze a trail and impress upon the House and the Minister what I regarded as the gross injustice perpetrated against these fine servants of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the Minister and his predecessors have turned it down before, I would appeal to him again, even at this late stage, to have regard to the case now made by Deputy T. O'Donnell.  He knows from the records that such a case was made previously by the late Deputy Norton, by myself and by several other Deputies.  It appears impossible to penetrate the thick skulls of the people advising the Minister on these matters.  These pensioners we refer to are disappearing <Col N="2054" /> rapidly.  I have raised this question often enough, goodness knows.  One thousand people receive a pension of £1 a week.  These are people, do not forget, with 40, 45, and over that, years of service with CIE and, in this year of 1966, they go to the railway station weekly and are doled out £1.  A certain number of others receive 2/6d more per week.  I do not know where the differentiation lies between the man with £1 per week and the man with 22/6d a week.  That adds up to over 1,800 people who are getting a pension from our proud State-sponsored transportation organisation.  I do not know how one could defend it.</P>
    <P>I have often raised the matter in this House.  I query the Minister, Curiously enough, most queries put to the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to CIE result in the information from the Minister that he has no function in the matter.  However, these questions have been designed to ascertain facts regarding the pensions available to retired employees in the conciliation grades.  On occasion and, like other questions I put down to him and which I propose to put down to him again, he has replied to these questions with weak and&mdash;with all due respect and in the broadest sense&mdash; stupid replies.  Time and time again I have received from the Minister replies that the CIE pensions are being supplemented by social welfare payments of one kind or another &mdash; disability benefit or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is allegedly governing the affairs, amongst other things, of CIE. He is not entitled in my view to welsh on his commitments to the ordinary railway worker because he says, in effect: &ldquo;The Department of Social Welfare are paying certain benefits per week.&rdquo;  The benefits being paid through the office of the Minister for Social Welfare are benefits that have been gathered and hazards that have been insured against by the employee.  It is his own money he is drawing and the money of the company he was working for and the State subvention in the same way as any other employee will draw benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> If the CIE pensions scheme provides that such an amount, through their superannuation scheme, should be provided for a man after 40 or 45 years service, then I think it is a miserable thing in the year 1966, in this Christian country of ours, that the Minister for Transport and Power should say to that unfortunate railwayman in effect: &ldquo;Look, my pal, the Minister for Social Welfare, is giving you so much.  Therefore, I shall reduce your pension by so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is apparently quite blasé about the whole thing.  The impression he conveyed to me was that these retired railwaymen were damn well off.  I cannot see it.  I had despaired of ever again trying, during the present régime and during the holding of office by the present Minister for Transport and Power to make an impact because quite obviously he does not understand the situation or, if he does understand the situation, his approach is unreasonable and uncharitable in the extreme.</P>
    <P>The replies I have got here from time to time on this important question indicate&mdash;certainly to me and I am sure to the rest of the House as well&mdash;a kind of Victorian attitude to people who gave tremendous service not alone to the transportation system, not alone to the old GSR and the GS and WR and to the present CIE but to their country.  Perhaps I am too close to the wood to see the trees, but, as a railwayman, coming from a long line of railway people, I feel very proud of the part played by railwaymen during the struggle for independence here.  If the Minister is not aware of that, I should certainly like to give him a memorandum on it any time he chooses to ask for it.</P>
    <P>Many railwaymen for whom I now speak&mdash;for instance, the fellows out on a pension of £1 a week&mdash;were engaged in various exercises during the War of Independence here.  The Minister cannot be unaware of the vast contribution they made by refusing to run trains at certain times, by refusing to carry arrangements, by refusing to do anything <Col N="2056" /> they regarded as against the national interest at that time.  Apparently recognition of their efforts, unlike the recognition of the efforts of some people who did not do half as much, is nil.  Outside of that, Sir, I should not like to rely on such a claim: I am simply relying on the humanity of the situation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any humanity in him, I invite him, as I have done in the past, to have a particular look at this picture.  I think the Minister is stultified inasmuch as he will probably take a note of what Deputy T. O'Donnell and I have said here tonight and pass it on to civil servants in his Department who will send him back a note telling him that I am talking all poppycock.  I can assure him that I am not talking poppycock.  I possibly know more about CIE and transport in this country than certain advisers of the Minister.  I should like him to have a personal look at the matter and, once and for all, not to come back with the reply that these pensions are adequate just because they are being supplemented&mdash;he used the word &ldquo;supplemented&rdquo;&mdash;by his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  They are not being supplemented by the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is a payment which the men paid for through their working lives and they are entitled to it without any blessing by the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Transport and Power.  Can we, once and for all, get rid of that attitude and not come back with a yarn that a child would not entertain for one moment?</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell mentioned that there are three categories of pensioners &mdash;I know he was referring to the conciliation grade&mdash;and gave very valuable figures.  Actually, there are very many more grades of pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> There is a certain category, a category I describe as the category of political pals, now in retirement.  These were the people who, in the alleged re-organisation of CIE, were literally dug up and rapidly promoted.  They were dug up out of all sorts of queer haunts and they were given wonderful titles: depot managers, area managers, local managers, personnel managers.  I can hardly remember all the titles they had.  The one qualification needed for this promotion was possession of a membership card of the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not interrupt the Minister and I hope he will not interrupt me.  Many Latter-Day Saints appeared overnight able to produce their Fianna Fáil membership cards.  If the Minister wants names and addresses, I shall give them to him. These gentlemen were shot into executive positions in CIE, over which, of course, Dr. Andrews, of happy memory was presiding.  The majority of them &mdash;they had not gone through the hard grind on the railway that I went through&mdash;could not do their work and they made such a mess of it that they had to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you think they were put out like the 1,063 to whom Deputy O'Donnell referred?  Not at all.  They were festooned with pensions.  They got the benefit of early retirement, not on health grounds but on redundancy provisions.  When the Transport Act was going through this House under the aegis of a more enlightened Minister, the present Taoiseach, I supported the redundancy provisions in that particular piece of legislation.  I did it because it was felt at the time there would be no hokery-pokery about it.  CIE had reached a stage at which they would have to re-organise, adopt more modern methods, and there would have to be pruning of one kind or another, particularly in the clerical grades.  I and my colleague.  Senator Murphy, supported the provisions to pay compensation for the redundancy that would undoubtedly be caused by the re-organisation of the working methods of CIE.  No sooner was that <Col N="2058" /> legislation passed than, lo and behold, there was a big invasion into CIE of &ldquo;pals of the palace&rdquo;.  I doubt if there is a Minister in that Front Bench who did not have some first cousin or some old pal appointed to some executive job in CIE.  I should clearly love to know&mdash;if I put down a question, I will not, of course, get an answer&mdash;how many people were drafted in by that political manoeuvre requiring them to hold Fianna Fáil membership cards.</P>

Many of them are now working in other jobs and enjoying quite a good pension from CIE, a pension paid of course by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I will not at this juncture give voice to my feelings about the retirement gratuity and the pension paid to the former Chairman of CIE, but I should like to ask can you imagine the feelings of a man&mdash;there are many such men in my own city&mdash;who has given 40 and 45 years' service to CIE in receipt of £1 per week, or £1 2s 6d or £2 11s 3d per week, when he opens his paper and discovers, as a result of a question here, the gratuity and pension payable to the former Chairman of CIE?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have kept within the rules of order of the House. One matter that has not been referred to so far in relation to these pensions is that employees in the conciliation grades, having accepted a pension, are then cut off or restricted in their privileged travel arrangements.  Not alone do they get these miserable pittances after 40 and 45 years' service but their travel concessions are very much restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> I am, of course, bumping my head against a stone wall in this.  That is quite obvious from the last remark by the Minister.  He regards me as irresponsible&mdash;a scandalmonger.  I can tell the Minister I have no ambition to engage in any activity that might be regarded as scandalmongering.  I suggest he has not got his ear very close to the ground if he feels that what Deputy T. O'Donnell, I and other speakers have to say on this motion is not valid.  Of course it is.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unduly critical of the Minister but I make him a present of this: I invite him to walk into any large CIE station, or workshop, or into the passenger or goods depots, or into the loco depot, or road freight depot, and try to assess the feelings of CIE employees towards his administration and the administration of his Department.  It is not without significance that over the years since the Minister took up the position of Minister for Transport and Power, we have had more strikes, official and unofficial, in CIE, the ESB, Bord na Móna and wherever his dead hand touches.  We have had more industrial discontent and lack of leadership and enthusiasm.  If the Minister is wise, he will have another look at the picture. I am in very close touch with the situation and I know that among CIE workers today, in all grades, supervisory, clerical, conciliation and so on, there is a lack of morale due to the handling of the affairs of CIE by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, <Col N="2063" /> Sir, I will not be interrupted by the Minister.  The Minister and the rest of the Cabinet are so sensitive to criticism of any kind that they refuse to discharge their ministerial duties, but the Minister will discharge his duty whether he wants to or not.  Whether or not it is painful we will endeavour to get him to discharge it in relation to the unfortunate CIE pensioners.</P>
      <P>What has been the sad history of CIE pensioners in recent times?  For years, week after week, in the Dáil, members of various Parties were obliged to table questions pleading with the Minister to improve the pensions of former transport employees of this State, and again and again the Minister refused to do so.  Unfortunately, as well as the Minister refusing to do it, the Board of CIE refused to do it and the unions, who might have been expected to have been concerned about pensioners, postponed the interests of the pensioners in the interests of what they considered to be more compelling, the needs of those who are still working in the transport industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the clamour raised here time and time again, the Minister, the Board and other people, refused to do anything about it until there was a transport strike not for improved conditions for those who were working, but improved pensions for those who would retire.  It is not very often in industrial history that there is a strike in order to get better pensions but so neglected were the pensioners and so worried were the workers about what would be available to them when they retired that there was a major transport strike here, something that was unique in the industrial sphere.  In the middle of all that, we in the Fine Gael Party did not confine our activities to questions.  We tabled a motion here in 1963 calling for improvements in CIE pensions and this had a consequence that, together with the embarrassment of the strike, it produced a commission.  The motion we moved three years ago was that Dáil Éireann was of opinion that in view of the <Col N="2064" /> severe hardship suffered by CIE pensioners due to the inadequacy of their pensions, amending legislation should be introduced to enable CIE to pay a just and equitable pension to those concerned.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister for Transport and Power do then?  The present incumbent of the office came into the House on behalf of the Government and moved a resolution which, in effect, was to negative the Fine Gael motion and they went into the lobbies and voted against us and carried the deadhand resolution which asked that consideration of the then existing pensioners should be deferred pending receipt and consideration of the report of a commission which was inquiring, not into the existing pensions or the plight of existing pensioners, but rather as to what pension scheme and sickness benefit scheme should be arranged for the future.  Because of the Minister's postponing tactics a number of pensioners in the winter of their days did not get whatever little comfort they were entitled to and the sad fact is that many of them died before there was any improvement, if improvement is the word to apply to the miserable pittances which were given to them in an effort to keep them quiet.</P>
    <P>The pensioners on whose behalf we are speaking are people who 30 or 40 years ago subscribed a shilling a week for their pensions.  We consider that society has a moral obligation to ensure that people who contribute to a pension fund receive a pension which is equivalent in kind to their subscription. If I may put it another way, one shilling contributed by these people 30 or 40 years ago should be producing, if we can take into account the depreciation in the value of money, a pension in the region of £7 or £8 a week at least today.  If society has failed to preserve the value of money, if it has depreciated the value of money and if we have allowed inflation to destroy the value of the contributions of pensioners who worked 30 or 40 years ago, we have a clear moral obligation, out of current income, if necessary, to boost the nominal pension we pay them so that they get a return <Col N="2065" /> equivalent in real value to the payments which they made out of their very small wages 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell has already given particulars of a number of people now in receipt of pensions.  We have the sad situation that men who gave four decades or more of their active lives to transport are receiving pensions of £1 a week, £1 2s 6d a week and £2 11s 3d a week.  What is the situation of a married man who retired from CIE a few years ago, say, a man who is now just turned 70?  He was in receipt from CIE of a weekly pension of £2 11s 3d and was also in receipt from the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;because he had contributed to it&mdash;of a weekly allowance of £4 12s 6d, making a total of £7 3s 9d to maintain himself and his wife in the autumn of their days.  When such a man turns 70, CIE reduces the £2 11s 3d to £1 2s 6d.  He receives the slightly higher old age pension of £5 7s 6d but his net weekly income now comes to only £6 10s, meaning that because the Lord has been good enough to allow him to live until 70, he has to suffer at the hands of CIE a reduction of 13/9 in his weekly income.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a widower who has lost his dear wife.  Such a widower, between 65 and 70, received a weekly CIE pension of £2 11s 3d and a weekly social welfare payment of £5 3s 9d to maintain himself.  When he became 70, CIE reduced his pension to £1 2s 6d, which, together with an old age pension&mdash;a contributory one, I emphasise&mdash;of £3, produced a weekly income of £4 2s 6d.  Thus such a man suffers a loss of £1 1s 3d because he lives until he is 70.  Men who have retired in the last couple of years are in receipt of CIE pensions at a somewhat higher figure, but certainly by no means a generous one, of £4 18s 6d. They will have their pensions cut when they reach the age of 70 to £3 15s 6d, a drop of 23/-.  Was there ever a more pitiful example of man's inhumanity to man?</P>
    <P>We find that these pensioners are <Col N="2066" /> not only treated in this deplorable manner so far as their monetary income is concerned but also that the fringe benefits which are available to them while still working in the transport industry are withdrawn as soon as they become pensioners.  In other concerns which have pension schemes, there are various fringe benefits maintained for the pensioner in the same way as they are for the employees.  For instance, Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, it is well known, treat their employees well.  They have a medical scheme for their employees like CIE but the Guinness company maintains the medical service after a man retires and a pensioner can enjoy the same medical service as a pensioner as he received when an employee.  Apparently CIE believes it might be as well to deprive them of the medical service in the hope that they might die earlier.  The result is that CIE pensioners are deprived of the medical service which they got while they were employees.  While working, they had certain transport facilities and could avail of free or cheap transport in certain circumstances, but the prospect of travelling while one is an employee is obviously substantially reduced.  When they might be able to do a little bit of travelling and visit their children, many of whom may have emigrated, or visit relations in various parts of the country, they are unable to do so because their free or cheap travel facilities are taken from them.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that their troubles are primarily related to the non-availability of free or cheap travel or free medical service because if CIE does not give them a free medical service and they are in dire circumstances, they can possibly get it from the public authority but I mention this as an indication of the shabby way in which our transport industry is treating its former employees.  The only answer the Minister will give is the age-old answer which is put forward, that CIE will have to contribute more to the pension fund if these people are to receive a higher pension.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that as a sufficient reason for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to these men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> CIE is spending a great deal of money on less deserving projects than in providing a proper means of living for their pensioners.  I do not have to recite all the instances of the ridiculous waste of money: destroying destination scrolls which were perfectly adequate in order to change them into a language which is not spoken in this country, which certainly is not Irish or English; removing perfectly satisfactory bus signs in order to change from oblongs to circles; introducing new colour schemes, and a whole lot of other ridiculous things which are serving only to antagonise the people instead of helping to increase the flow of business, both passengers and goods, of the national transport company.</P>
    <P>If CIE can find money for these foolish enterprises of theirs, these things that have been devised by some of the extraordinary intakes that there have been to the company in recent times, then they should certainly allocate some of their apparently superfluous funds for the provision of a decent standard of living for their pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of those things is negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the word &ldquo;nugatory&rdquo; has been put in abeyance; &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; is the word now.  The money spent on these things is very much greater than the cost of providing a double pension for these unfortunate elderly pensioners until the end of their days, because some of them are approaching that.  We are all approaching our end at the same rate but many of these people are nearer that end, having regard to the ordinary span of man's life, than are others in the community. CIE would spend less in doing this humanitarian thing than they have spent in a number of unnecessary activities in recent times.</P>
      <P>We have some questions addressed to the Minister for next week, and I hope, before the close of this debate, to have the answers to them.  However, one of them is to ascertain, as of today, the amount of money in the CIE pensions fund for the wages grade staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> As far as we know, the latest figure produced in relation to this shows that something like £3,900,000 is in the fund; it may perhaps now be nearing the £4 million mark.  The Minister will say this is there to pay pensions in future, but that sum is producing, or ought to be producing, a substantial income by way of dividends if the money is properly invested.  In addition to that, men who are working in CIE at the present time are making their own contributions to the fund.  Contributions are also being made by the Board, and we believe it is very proper that the employer should be making his contribution.  I do not believe any member of the Dáil or Seanad would begrudge giving to CIE any money which it might need to provide proper pensions for its former employees.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said&mdash;if it is not true I should like the Minister, with facts and figures to refute it&mdash;that the income alone from the fund at the present time would be sufficient to pay double pensions to the pensioners on whose behalf we are speaking for the next ten years without making any inroad on the capital reserves of the fund.  We would ask the Minister to give us facts and figures in relation to the fund so that we can accurately assess the present position.  We are prepared to accept it may mean a further burden on CIE to pay increased pensions and that CIE may have to make an increased contribution.  We say this is part and parcel of the obligation which a national company like that has to its employees.  It has an obligation to maintain a standard of living for these men in the autumn of their days somewhat similar to what it was in the past when they were working.</P>
    <P>The wages paid to an active person who is in employment are sufficient not only to maintain himself and his wife but also to rear a family.  In the autumn of their days, it may well be that an elderly couple do not need as high an income as younger people, not having at that stage the family commitments they might have had earlier on.  However, there is certainly an obligation on society and on CIE in this instance&mdash; and on the Government, if CIE cannot <Col N="2069" /> do it on its own&mdash;to maintain the standard of living of its employees, and they certainly are not doing that.  The amount of hunger, impoverishment, pain and suffering in the homes of CIE pensioners is appalling.  We are not saying this simply to be dramatic or hysterical.  This is something which I have seen and which I am sure other Members of this House have also seen.</P>
    <P>The transport employees of this country are amongst the finest people in the community.  They are men who at one time worked in a very thriving industry, in an industry which was giving an excellent service, in an industry which was not only paying but was also extremely profitable.  They had a high standard of living and they were entitled to it.  Indeed, those who are working today, when transport is not so remunerative, are also in a most significant industry and are entitled to a good standard of living.  Just as the working employee is entitled to a standard of living, the retired member is entitled to an equally good standard of living.  They are all part of the same body, of the same industry, and that industry must discharge its obligations to those people.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have tabled this motion because we believe it is necessary to treat these people properly. There are many other industries in the country which are providing a much better pension for their former employees who are of an age similar to that of the transport employees, and if they can do it, then CIE ought to be able to do it.  All too frequently we have arguments advanced against workers that their employers are unable to afford to pay them a decent Christian wage.  I think all decent members of our community feel that such an argument is unacceptable and that there is a clear obligation on an employer so to arrange his business activities that he can pay a Christian wage to his employees.  Likewise, we in the Fine Gael benches say there is a clear obligation on an employer to provide a proper pension for his employees.  That certainly is not being done by CIE at present.</P>
    <P>It is no answer at all to say that the <Col N="2070" /> contributory pension which is available to these people almost doubles the pension which they get from CIE. That was an explanation in the days when there was no contributory old age pension, but now that there is a contributory old age pension CIE has no right whatsoever to take the contributory old age pension into account in determining the level of its pension. It is just as wrong to do that as it would be for the State to say: &ldquo;We are going to reduce your contributory pension because you are in receipt of a pension from CIE.&rdquo;  To do that is to negative the whole object of introducing contributory old age pensions.  We think the State or a State agency should not be a party to any scheme which, in effect, applies a means test to the contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister may also say that he has no power or no function in this matter but we find that the Minister, on his own admission, has a function in relation to CIE pensions. Speaking in the Dáil at column 108 on 27th November, 1963, the Minister said that he may require the Board of CIE to prepare and submit a superannuation scheme to him.  The Minister suggested that he had no power of initiative in relation to such matters but he took the initiative in 1963 when he set up a Commission. He did so because men were on strike, because men were marching.  It is no great harm to listen occasionally to the tramp of marching feet.  They did it in 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister could require the Board of CIE to submit a scheme to him today and if they did no more than to submit the present scheme to him, the Minister may modify it in any way he thinks fit, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The Minister can consult with the Minister for Finance for a few moments any day here in the Dáil.  All he has to do is to require the Board of CIE to submit a scheme to him and we would appeal to him to do so before the sands of time run out altogether for these men who, we believe, are deserving of more from the community and from the transport industry than <Col N="2071" /> they are getting at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a certain figure&mdash; I do not recall what it was&mdash;in reply to a question in relation to what CIE employees would get if we were to divide up the pension now being paid to Dr. C. S. Andrews.  The figure was in the region of a few shillings, 2/6d or 2/7d per week, and the Minister apparently regarded that as nugatory, or negligible, or of no consequence. Might I point out to the Minister that it is a much greater figure than that by which these pensions were increased by CIE three years ago when some men enjoyed a magnificent increase of 2/6d per week on a pension of £1 per week.</P>
    <P>Suppose we did divide up that pitifully small sum among all the pensioners who are on the register, 2,400 or 2,500 of them.  The amount would be substantial as far as they are concerned. If CIE can afford one kind of pension for one particular pensioner, then they should be able to give an equivalent amount to 2,500 pensioners.  I think they would be grateful for that and so I plead to the Minister that he ensure that there is a substantial improvement in these pensions for once &mdash;I will not say for all, because the value of the pound will continue to depreciate and there will be a continuing need to improve these pensions. The cost of living has soared since 1963 and the difficulties of these unfortunate people have multiplied since 1963.</P>
    <P>We do not take 1963 as a base for these pensions.  If we did, it would be grossly inadequate.  A new look, a sympathetic look, should be taken at the plight of these pensioners so that the decent thing may be done by them.  They should be given a pension which would get for them the bread and butter, tea and sugar they would have got 40 years ago.  We ought to multiply the value of 10/-per week at that time by ten, 20 or 30 because of the depreciation in the value of money in the meanwhile.  If we did that, we would get something <Col N="2072" /> in the region of £7 or £8 a week. This would be something that should be given to them without regard to whether they have a contributory pension or whether they are living with relations or friends, or whether they are in hospital or out of it.</P>
    <P>One could talk on this point at very great length but it all comes down to an assessment of the difficulties of these people today and of trying to improve their pensions.  It is a pity that when we are discussing the pensions of other people, we use scales which are admittedly grossly inadequate as a basis to see by what percentage we can increase the miserable pittance we are giving them.  It is like offering sixpence to a beggar and saying that the cost of living has gone up and that we ought to give him sevenpence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to understand the mentality of a Minister or the attitude of Members of this House in their approach to their employees.  I cannot understand the mentality of this Minister that he can remain so indifferent and so utterly callous to the constant pleadings in this House for a better deal for CIE men. We have pointed out time and again the sorry predicament in which these pensioners find themselves and the miserly allowance that is being doled out to them by the Minister after they had given the best years of their lives to this important State Department. The Minister must be a hard-hearted and callous individual if he cannot accede to all our pleas to improve these pensions somewhat so that these pensioners will at least be in a position to spend the declining years of their lives in some frugal comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and CIE should have <Col N="2073" /> appreciated that fringe benefits are an integral part of a worker's perquisites today.  Real emphasis is being placed nowadays on those things which are termed fringe benefits attaching to his employment.  In negotiations in recent times, more and more emphasis has been laid on security in sickness and in retirement.  Unions have been emphasising the importance of such security. Pensions are of vital importance in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>One would expect that a State Department would have regard to these matters and would set a headline for private employers by ensuring that there would be, not merely decent wages and conditions, but that the worker would be safeguarded in sickness and in old age.  It is a serious indictment of the Minister's Department that, despite the exposure in this House of the plight of CIE pensioners time and time again, he has proved so utterly indifferent to the case made for an improvement of their sorry lot.</P>
    <P>The Minister has continuously harped upon the fact that these people are entitled to social welfare benefits. In reckoning their retirement income he has added old age pension.  This is blatantly unfair.  The contributory old age pension which these men enjoy today is something to which they have contributed, as all workingclass people do.  It is something to which they are entitled as of right as contributors under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is not by reason of the generosity of the Minister for Transport and Power that they enjoy these social welfare pensions. It is no thanks to this Minister that they enjoy these pensions.</P>
    <P>We are talking the Minister to task for his maladministration and his disregard for the welfare of CIE workers on retirement.  Many of them were forced to retire owing to redundancy and many more retired at the age of 65 or thereabouts.  We have pointed out down the years that considerable numbers of these pensioners had pensions as low as 7/- per week, that many hundreds more had pensions as low as 12/- per week.  At the present time there are 1,063 of these pensioners whose pensions are as low as £1 a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2074" /> It is obvious that the Minister for Transport and Power has no conception as to how to deal with human beings, no conception of his duty towards his employees.  There seem to exist in CIE two classes of persons, one class neglected, dejected and depressed, who are thrown on the scrapheap in periods of redundancy or retired on puny, miserly pensions ranging from 7/- to £1 a week and the other section within CIE, a very privileged section, a new élite, opulent and privileged, who have status increases conferred upon them of a most substantial amount.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir; I accept your ruling.  I should like to ask the <Col N="2075" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I am not in order in making the comparison between two categories of retired CIE personnel, in one case, a man who has been retired recently on a pension as low as £1 a week and the other, a man, who must be an almighty individual indeed, who could secure a golden handshake of £8,000 a year plus a pension of £3,500 plus a new job at £1,000 a year?  These are the two classes that I am comparing tonight. We know the class who are doled out £1 a week and we know the man who is given £8,000 a year.  By any standard, there is no justification whatsoever for this distinction.  There is no instance where there is such wide disparity between two persons that one is worth £8,000 as a golden handshake, a pension of £3,500 a year plus another job at £1,000 a year and the other is of such little value that he should get a mere £1 per week.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he has any other jobs in Telefís Éireann that he might give to the needy and deserving pensioners of CIE.  This part-time man is being paid £1,000 a year.  How can anybody be expected to work for such a miserable figure other than part-time?  It is something of a national scandal that this matter should have been handled in the way it was.  It is simply more evidence of the other side of the <Col N="2076" /> coin of nepotism to which I was referring earlier when Private Members' Business interrupted the debate on this Estimate.  I do not want to use words which do not exactly describe what has taken place and therefore I will not use the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;. But it is something akin to corruption which has occurred in so far as the appointment of the ex-Chairman of CIE is concerned.  It is all under the Old Pals Act.  Nobody will persuade me that there resides in the person of the former Chairman of CIE such a wealth of ability and knowledge that RTE could not do without his services or that the post could not have been given to somebody more in need of it and who could discharge it equally well, if not better.  This is much in the same way as the appointment of judges is open, naked and unashamed political patronage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to, Sir; I merely mention it in passing.  I want to question the appointment of the ex-Chairman of CIE to this part-time post at £1,000 a year.  Members of this House are paid a salary of 50 per cent more than the Chairman of the Television Authority.  It may very well be that some Deputies find that membership of the House is not a fulltime occupation, but for 99 per cent of the Members of this House, there are not enough hours in the day within which to complete the multifarious duties required of a TD.  None the less we must struggle on and do the best we can, giving all our time.  It may be, of course, that we are not deemed to be deserving of payment on a scale level with that of the person of whom I speak, who has so brilliant talents. But it is certain that a big number of the Members of this House did not hitch their political wagons to the star which was so fortunate in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of the ex-Chairman of CIE, coming at the time it did, justifiably caused considerable public disquiet.  I do not think it is right that it should be let pass or that it <Col N="2077" /> should be deemed in bad taste on my part to mention the fact that people were appalled by this piece of political cynicism which showed such utter disregard, not alone for the economic facts of the society in which we live, but for the feelings of the people. However, cynical disregard for the feelings of the people seems to be the trend now.  Let me say to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is a member of the Government and shares in the responsibility for this trend, that the day of reckoning is going to come.  Those who are now treating lightly certain matters which are disturbing the public mind may very well find themselves at the end of the day not being troubled with such matters at all.</P>
    <P>Before the adjournment, I was referring to the programme on Telefís Éireann called &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;. The Minister thought fit to suggest that if Harold Wilson knew his job as well apparently as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs knows his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would not permit the democratic practice which now prevails in that detested foreign broadcasting and television system they have across the water, the BBC, and that he would not permit and would be well advised to alter the present system whereby each of the Parties is allowed equal representation on any political discussions televised in that country.  It is a pity the Minister's colleagues did not give this advice to the British Prime Minister when they were all palsy-walsy with him some months ago doing such great work for Ireland and the Irish farmer, and indeed when they were securing the future of the Irish farmer.  However, they did not avail of that opportunity. It now appears there is an agonising reappraisal in progress of the position of the Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> John Bull and that we are getting back to where we were more or less.  Indeed, I have heard the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2078" /> and Fisheries describe the British once more as &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it galls you even to think of what is happening in that detested foreign country.  I know the Republican Party feel this very deeply.  This is since last June or whenever it was you made your Trade Agreement.  But there is good even in the worst of us.  The democratic practice, not alone in Britain but wherever social democracy prevails, ordains that if there is a public discussion on any issue of national importance, televised or no, each Party should get an equal length of time to state its point of view for or against, just as we in this House do as we are called in rotation by the Chair.</P>
      <P>This does not apply with the programme called &ldquo;The Politicians.&rdquo;  For some years we did have a programme &ldquo;The Hurlers on the Ditch.&rdquo;  I must say it was infinitely superior, from what I have seen so far of &ldquo;The Politicians,&rdquo; to what &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; as a programme is likely to turn out to be.  &ldquo;The Hurlers&rdquo; consisted of people outside politics who could at least express the public point of view to some extent and who were conversant with what goes on in the corridors where the illusion of power presides.  But we have had &ldquo;The Hurlers&rdquo; replaced by this charade, this masquerade of a programme, the basis of which is determined not by the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority but by the Minister and his colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, it will be remembered that there was a row because it was proposed by the Telefís people to bring on the programme somebody, not a Member of the House, to discuss matters concerning&mdash; I think, agriculture &mdash; at which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be present. This was considered to be <i>lése majesté.</i> It was not considered to be at all <Col N="2079" /> proper that such elevated beings as we are should be forced to sit before television cameras accompanied by the ordinary people of Ireland.  We must be, as it were, in a reserved position and argue only with ourselves.</P>

      <P>Reserved enclosure: how apt the description.  If we were to follow that to its logical conclusion, it would mean that contact with the ordinary people would become a very rare thing.  I have no doubt that there are Members of this House for whom it is a rare thing to have contact with the electorate but that does not apply to the vast majority of us.  We have to go about our affairs through the bustle of humanity&mdash;and very happy we are to have the opportunity of doing so.  I think any of us would be very glad to engage in discussion on the country's problems with any member of the public on any medium, contrary to the impression given by the Government that television should be reserved, in instances such as this, for discussion as between politicians.</P>
      <P>Let me get back to the point I was making.  Here we have a programme for the politicians.  I understand it is to be put on each month.  There will be three representatives of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;three spokesmen; there will be two representatives of Fine Gael; and there will be one representative of Labour who will discuss different matters over&mdash;I understand it is proposed&mdash;a period of an hour. While we may take it, as has happened, that the opening batsmen&mdash;I think that would be the proper word to describe it&mdash;will invariably be a Government Minister or spokesman, he will be followed by his two sons who will fill in on anything he has forgotten about.</P>

      <P>They will take up a fair amount of time, judging by the <Col N="2080" /> recent programmes.  Then the second largest Party will be called on and their men will do the best they can in as long a period of time as they can get away with and as the Chairman will allow, and finally it will come to the lone Labour representative.  I am not arguing the principle that any politician who finds himself on such a programme would, and indeed should, avail of it to the best possible advantage for his Party and to put over his own point of view.  What I am arguing about and what I am objecting to, is the fact that this Government have sought to kill any expression of opposition by insisting upon this proportion of representation; in other words, as far as Fianna Fáil and Labour are concerned, there shall be three Fianna Fáil spokesmen to one Labour spokesman.  I can understand it very well.  From what we have seen on previous programmes, notably &ldquo;Open House,&rdquo; I can understand the anxiety of the Government to have three Fianna Fáil spokesmen for every one Labour spokesman, and, even then, victory will no doubt go to the side in which the greatest political wisdom resides and I do not have to draw pictures for Deputies to indicate to them which side that is.  Invariably, the Labour Party have shown on these media&mdash;as indeed they have in other countries, as people looking at television will verify&mdash;that Labour, in all social matters, go right to the core of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to discuss any programme in which the Minister has a hand and he has very much a hand in this programme.  It is very important.  I am trying to get accepted the democratic principle, which we accept here in Dáil Éireann, that every Party represented in the Dáil has an equal right with every other Party to be heard on any subject: that is all I am asking.  That is denied them.  It is denied the Labour Party and it is denied, indeed, the main Opposition Party, Fine Gael.  However, <Col N="2081" /> it may very well suit Fine Gael to have things as they are.  They may feel that, with two speakers, they can talk effectively enough.  I am not at all making the case that we are not able to cope in our situation but I am talking about the principle of unequal representation and I want to carry it a little further.</P>
      <P>Supposing the day comes which, to my mind, must surely come, when there will be a two-Party system in this House.  It will not come about as a result of any abolition of PR because I think we will cling to that and hold on to it but it must come.  The elements of the Right on both sides of the House will combine against the elements of the Left.  When I say &ldquo;Left&rdquo;, I mean those who are socially conscious of what is needed to uplift the people of the country as against those who could not care less.  When these two divisions fall into their natural place in this House, an event to which I look forward, it is not impossible, if we pursue the present system in political discussions in this programme &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;, that five members of one Party would put a point of view or argue a case against one member of the Opposition.  Indeed, the Labour representative participating in the programme &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; at the present time is very much in that situation. It is a safe assumption that those against whom he is arguing are to the right of his opinions.</P>
      <P>Is this situation just?  I do not think it is.  Of course, it falls into line with what we were discussing earlier, the blatant interference with the Television Authority by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the successful attempt he made to censor a particular newscast.  Here, I want to refer to the Official Report of 31st March, 1960. At column 1578 of Volume 180, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, at the time Deputy Hilliard, had this to say in the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want any doubt to exist in regard to this matter.  When Deputy Dr. Browne asked the question, I assumed he was making reference to a programme that would be regarded by the people as generally objectionable. <Col N="2082" /> I was not dealing with any particular item in a programme, in a different class of programme.  Take a situation in which you would have a general objection expressed, say, at county council meetings or at other meetings at which our people come together, similar to a situation which developed recently as a result of a programme from another broadcasting service.  If such an objectionable programme were put out by our broadcasting service and our people took grave exception to it, and so expressed themselves, I think it would be very hard for a Minister to resist a discussion on the matter in this House, a matter that was of vital interest and which so affected the moral standards of our people.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about the argument between the Minister for Agriculture and the NFA, it is hardly an immoral argument.  The Minister of the day went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is true that the Authority will be an autonomous Authority and the Minister will not have any interference whatsoever with the day-to-day programme of that Authority...</P>
    <P>That was the statement of the Minister who introduced the Bill, which subsequently became an Act, and under which the Television Authority now operates.  In other words, there was no legal warrant whatsoever for the action of the Minister in directing, as he did direct, because even a request from a Minister to a civil servant is a direction, that any news item should be dropped on the RTE transmission. What is being done about that now?  This was, in fact, an infraction of the law.  I could argue, too, that in the programme &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; the Authority are also disregarding the law which charges them with responsibility to present news as objectively and as fairly as possible.  I know that is a difficult thing to do, because Irish people, by their very nature, have political convictions and proclivities and Party affiliations; unconsciously, maybe, those who have to do with the dissemination of news may colour news reports in the way in which their subconscious prompts them.  That is an <Col N="2083" /> urge which must be suppressed and the obligation rests squarely on the shoulders of the RTE Authority to present news, and political programmes particularly, as objectively as possible.  They are not doing that in &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;.  It cannot be said that the Authority are responsible for the shape of &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; or for the representation the programme has or the allocation of representation; they have accepted it.  But they should not have accepted it.  The principle should be that every Party represented here should have an equal voice with every other Party.  That has been disregarded. It is very wrong and it must be exposed.  That is what I am trying to do now.  At the same time, I am quite satisfied that any member of the Labour Party could take on, at his ease, any five members of the Government at any time.</P>
    <P>I want now to compliment Telefís Éireann on the programme broadcast via the BBC on, I think, Sunday night last.  The film was made by our people and it was a prize winner at, I understand, the Monte Carlo Film Festival. It was a perfect example of what Irish people are capable of when they set their minds and hearts to the task. It was a programme dealing with the work of some of our own in Africa, showing the problems that exist in parts of Africa.  I urge the Minister to convey my compliments and, I am certain, the compliments of other Members of this House, to those who made that film.  I urge him also to take steps to ensure that that line of country is further explored.  This film was made by a religious order.  That is not the reason why I praise it.  I praise it for the technique and expertise with which it was put across and the tremendous heart in the film itself.  It was a wonderful experience to see it.  It opens up a very wide prospect.  I have always believed we are capable of producing that which would be the admiration of the whole world.  We have the ability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a very powerful plea this evening for the preservation of the rights of the people in relation <Col N="2084" /> to television.  He made a passing reference to the dismissal of Mr. Tibor Paul, about which I know as little as Deputy Dillon said he did; but I join with him in supporting the sentiments he expressed in regard to the gross manner in which this gentleman was treated.  There may be an explanation for it, but I believe there is never an explanation for bad manners and boorishness.  Bad manners lead to bad manners, it may be said, but, in the heel of the hunt, the really admirable person is the man who can contain himself, in spite of aggravation.  I do not know whether or not there was aggravation, but we certainly showed up pretty badly in the manner in which this gentleman was treated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that it might be that some Members of this House are artistes.  He was referring to the artistic temperament.  It occurred to me that if they are artistes, there is little effort to humour their temperamental outbursts, if they make them, or wherever they make them, or to be seen publicly to be making them.  But Members of this House are subject to one other sanction with which there is very little civility connected, that is, summary dismissal.  Unlike artistes of any kind, Members of this House have to face the most rigorous examination, far more rigorous than the leaving certificate, or even the thesis for an honours degree, at regular intervals, and they may be dismissed from the public service at any time.  There is that essential difference between Members of the Dáil and the artistic fraternity generally.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, too, that while there are admirable aspects of television techniques in other countries which can be studied to good effect, there is other evidence of television techniques which I fear may begin to be copied here which are not so desirable. There is, for instance the position of television interviewing. It has grown up to be very much modish in Britain&mdash;as any of us who look at the BBC know&mdash;for television interviewers to be as insulting as they can to those they are interviewing, <Col N="2085" /> in the interests, it is said, of live and entertaining programmes.  I detect on the part of one or two of our brighter young sparks an inclination to imitate this technique.  There is, of course, an answer to that kind of ill-informed bowsyism.  Unfortunately, one does not have the opportunity to be in the studio to deliver the answer when it occurs.  It never seems to happen to oneself but it is annoying to hear querulous and shrewish interviewing. This does not happen in all cases but it does happen in certain cases, and I am certain that those of whom I am speaking can try on the cap to see if it fits.  Certain of them approach their victims&mdash;or those they conceive to be their victims&mdash;as a kind of lesser specimen of mortal, and this is particularly so when they have achieved election to this House.  This seems to denote a complete inferiority of intellect altogether.</P>

One can laugh at it, but there is a certain element of truth in the moronic aspect, and it is annoying when you see it and it might give the wrong impression abroad.  Some of these people probably got into Telefís Éireann by knowing the right person.  Would the Minister think that is right?  They pontificate and put themselves in the position of public prosecutors when they get the opportunity with people who have had to face election.  I am not objecting to this being done, provided we do not develop a corps of Robin Days, because we will not tolerate that, will not tolerate incivility.  Poor Mr. Tibor Paul may have had to, but we will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach made an extraordinary statement when questioned about this interference with Telefís Éireann.  He seemed to infer in his most ebullient fashion, that the Government had a right to do this, and that he would stand over it.  The Government were going to see that public policy and so on&mdash;you know the way <Col N="2086" /> it goes.  What he was saying in effect was: &ldquo;We are going to insist that the Fianna Fáil policy be put across.&rdquo;  I was addressing my mind earlier to this pernicious evil, the pernicious evil which may develop from this kind of thing, from having so all-embracing a medium of propaganda interfered with and bent to put over the thinking of one political Party.  It is a very grave thought.</P>
    <P>It may have been thought that Deputy Dillon was exaggerating but I do not think he was, because a large amount of television material is to my mind, a kind of subliminal material&mdash;&mdash;if you will forgive the expression.  I understand that it means that you absorb things without really getting much time to see them, or to analyse them, as a picture which passes quickly and registers on the subconscious, and without being completely conscious of it, it helps to form an impression.  A large amount of material is of this nature and it has been proved that propaganda, which is not, although many think it is, a dirty word&mdash;there is even a Department of Propaganda in the Vatican&mdash;is the very method by which political power is achieved.  This was seen in the forces of evil in the 1930s, and I am certain that the communists utilise it to the fullest extent to grip the minds of people.  In the days of Nazism, it was the wireless which achieved this but how much greater as an agent of propaganda can television be when it goes right into the homes of most people in the country?</P>
    <P>This is the reason we have to be careful to ensure that at all times, no abuse, no shadow of a suggestion of abuse, can be made of the medium and there has been positive evidence, which was not alone admitted but practically boasted about, of abuse and interference as if there were a divine right in some people here to use television for his own personal and political advantage&mdash;personal and political meaning one and the same thing in this case as in most cases in the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Taoiseach took it on himself to defend this.  I know that the Taoiseach is a long time in this House and, indeed, a long time <Col N="2087" /> in this business, if one likes to call it a business, trade, profession or occupation, or what-you-will.  I know he is quite capable of making a defence of the indefensible at any time but I thought that, having reached his present elevated position, he could at least afford to defend one of the fundamentals of liberty and that the would in some way have brushed aside the suggestion that any of his Party had the right to interfere to this extent with news transmissions for his own benefit.  He did not do so.  Boldly and as brazen as brass, he supported the Minister for Agriculture who did not back down one step from this censorship in which he indulged.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing we have to face and must attack and the more assured it is, the more we must attack it.  In my view, acceptance of that principle or idea, that a Minister may lift the telephone and alter the arrangements for a news transmission, is irresponsible and undemocratic and something that we should never as a Parliament accept, because if it applies to the present incumbents, it can very well apply to their successors, whoever they may be.  Nobody here is in any position to prophesy that; neither is anybody in the country.  The only certainty we have at the moment is the certainty that the Government are going out at the next election.  We cannot yet say who their successors will be. We have our ideas, our plans and our hopes that whatever follows will be for the good of the country.  Why not, seeing that it could not possibly be for the worse?  Regardless of who may be in power, we must, as a Parliament, for the benefit of those who will come at other times, put on record that we will not tolerate interference of this kind with the national news transmission system.</P>
    <P>I may add that it seems that in some cases Telefís Éireann in its news activities gets an advantage over the commercial newspapers which it should not get.  Certain facilities, I think, are afforded to television in the matter of news, particularly political news, which is not so readily available, or at least so immediately available, to the commercial <Col N="2088" /> newspapers.  This is not as it should be.  Commercial newspapers exist in the cold blast of business competition; television is subsidised to some extent and in any case it was initiated by capital gathered from the taxpayers and it should get no preferential treatment over that given or applied to ordinary newspapers.  If the Minister takes a close look at that.  I am sure the position will be safeguarded and that there will be no preference which might be to the detriment of the newspapers which are, and have been for years, the ordinary means of news dissemination and which employ large numbers of our people.</P>
    <P>What would be wrong in presenting the housing crisis on television, with having, say, a fortnightly programme? I am not going to pin responsibility for the housing position on the Minister, although he comes from the same county as the Minister responsible.</P>

      <P>Is it not time to remove this Victorian bar against these people?  What purpose does it serve? Does it apply to subpostmasters? Subpostmasters, as we know, are usually appointed from the cumainn, at the moment anyway, cumainn chairmen or rúnaither or people of that general class, a diminishing class but nevertheless there.  I do not think they are prevented legally from standing for the highest office in the land. I do seriously urge upon the Minister the need to do something about this. There does not seem to be any justification for it.  I doubt if ever there was any justification for it.  I cannot recall what arguments were used for preventing such men from having full political rights and from exercising them.  I do not think I have ever heard a good case being made for it.  I feel the Minister could avail of this suggestion of mine and that of the Labour Party, and even if he wants to make it his own and claim it as a Fianna Fáil breakthrough, as a lot of his colleagues are doing with Labour Party policies, the best of luck to him, if he does it.</P>

    <P>Balbriggan in my constituency complains that the telephone service there <Col N="2091" /> is in a very bad way.  It is impossible at times to dial and get a response.  It is very often possible to lift the phone and find yourself in on a neighbour's converstion which is the last thing you want to hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with phone-tapping at considerable length a couple of years ago.  I must say the nuisance was abated thereafter, but I am beginning to have doubts again now.  There are all sorts of clickings. In fact, one man swore to me he could hear them breathing.  However, it is not a question of phone-tapping I want to deal with in regard to Balbriggan but a very legitimate complaint by the business people of the town and everybody else who has a phone, that the service there is most unsatisfactory.  I would ask the Minister to have it seen to and to issue directions to the responsible officers in his Department to try to get the faults corrected as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are many thousands of phone applications awaiting attention.  We should like to know when the Minister estimates these people will get service.  This Department has always been, as far as I can recall, a Department which paid and made a profit, and why would it not? The cost of the telephone service and the cost of stamps to the ordinary citizen is very high by any standards. I should like to know, in view of the alleged healthy financial position of the GPO, when these many thousands of applications for telephones will be dealt with.  I would ask the Minister to try to give a comprehensive answer when he is replying on the Estimate, because this is a matter which I am certain affects every Deputy, which more especially affects myself and my fellow Deputies in County Dublin where the demand for telephones continues to grow, due to the continuing addition to the population of Dublin county caused by the flight from the land.  Everybody in Ireland wants to live in County Dublin, and not alone live here but have phones as well, a <Col N="2092" /> very laudable and legitimate ambition. I would urge the Minister to let us know when he considers, in County Dublin at least, the demand for phones will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of making these views known, particularly in relation to what has been happening in Telefís Éireann.  I do not suppose that our efforts here to bring home to the Minister a sense of democratic responsibility will have very much effect, but that he will go on his merry way as he has gone on before.  However, one thing is certain: we have put on the records of the House the way we felt about it, and if this abuse grows, we shall be able to point to the fact that when the abuse of political censorship showed its ugly head at Montrose, we were the first to speak out against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent happening in this House and in the house of the Minister for Agriculture invest this debate on this occasion with an importance far transcending the importance attaching to the debate on the same Estimate for previous years. There has been reference here by Deputy Dunne and other speakers to the alleged interference by the Minister for Agriculture with a programme on September 29th.  I think the Minister has every right to ring Montrose and protest about a programme, provided we in this House, the Minister included, preserve also the right of Telefís Éireann to say: &ldquo;Minister, will you go to hell.&rdquo;  If the Minister, being dissatisfied, rings the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs phones Montrose and says: &ldquo;He does not like the programme&rdquo;, again that is all right, provided we here in this House, the Minister included, uphold the statutory right of Telefís Éireann to say: &ldquo;Will you go to hell, too&rdquo; and &ldquo;You know, Minister, that if you want to make a direction to us, you must put it in writing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dealing chronologically with the events which caused my misgivings. I have started with 29th September in the house of the Minister for Agriculture.  Here in this House a fortnight ago the Leader of the <Col N="2093" /> Government expressed sentiments which impinged on the events which happened in the house of the Minister for Agriculture on September 29th. Does he uphold the legislation of this House which entitles Telefís Éireann to tell any Minister to go where I suggested earlier?  I should like to quote verbatim from the reports of the proceedings in this House.  Talking of Telefís Éireann he says at column 1046, volume 224, of the Dáil Debates of 12th October, 1966:</P>
    <P>The Government have over-all responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Does that mean that Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann are precluded from making any derogatory remarks about any legislation passed in this House?  Does it mean that nobody can call on Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann and say: &ldquo;I think this legislation was a mistake.&rdquo;  Does it mean that nobody can press for the amendment of legislation that would appear to be opposed to the thinking of the Leader of the Government?  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>To this extent the Government rejects the view that Radio Telefís Éireann should be either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision.</P>
    <P>To that, of course, I subscribe, and to the policy set out in the Broadcasting Act of 1960.  I rejoice in it because at least it means we can come in here and tax the Minister with certain happenings with which we would not be able to tax him if the Telefís Éireann Authority were an autonomous body.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>As a public institution, supported by public funds and operating under statute, it has the duty, while maintaining partiality between political Parties, to present programmes which inform the public regarding current affairs, to sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to <Col N="2094" /> assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is a sinister ring about that, &ldquo;to assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Does that mean that only references favourable to the legislation passed by the Oireachtas can be made by Telefís Éireann?  The Taoiseach went on to say that the Government would take such action by way of representation or otherwise as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the true performance of this duty.  If the Taoiseach is not going to come in here and explain what he means by this statement, I would like the Minister to explain it.</P>
    <P>That sentence is followed by a later reference in volume 224, column 1047, where the Taoiseach said the Government have a right to ensure that in its news programmes and current affairs programmes, Radio Telefís Éireann fulfil the purpose for which the institution was set up, and he continued in column 1048 to say that the manner in which the Authority does this now is the concern of the Government and that he was prepared to stand over every act of every Minister in this regard or in any other.  Does this mean that the Taoiseach is prepared to stand over every act of any Minister in matters such as I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>I can understand why the Government had considerable anxiety in entrusting to an independent authority the working of Telefís Éireann instead of giving control to a Minister answerable to this House.  I am glad that the happenings of the past three weeks have brought the functions of Telefís Éireann into public focus.  Up to three weeks ago, I doubt if very many people in this country had heard or understood the provisions of section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.  Section 31 of that Act empowers the Minister to direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and in the following subsection he may direct the Authority to allocate time to announcements by any Minister <Col N="2095" /> of State in connection with that Minister's functions.  It is an excellent thing that these matters should now have been brought into public focus.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is not prepared to come into this House and explain these references, the Minister should at least explain them in order to allay to some degree the anxiety which exists not only in this House but up and down the length and breadth of this country.  If the Taoiseach refuses to meet the representatives of the National Union of Journalists, a body representative of men who have upheld the tradition of freedom of speech and thought in this country, in this matter, at least he can still be made answerable to this House, either in his person or through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is charged with complete control of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister has some important questions to answer in view of the conduct of the Minister for Agriculture some three weeks ago in making demands which were complied with and also in view of the attitude adopted by the Taoiseach here this day fortnight.  It is due to this House and to the country that the Minister should explain his views on the operation of the Broadcasting Authority Act under which he has certain rights. Certainly, in order to comply with the provisions of section 31 the Minister or some of his officials should see beforehand every item which is broadcast so as to make himself aware of their entire content.  How else could he adjudicate on what should or should not be the object of a written direction by him to the Authority? The Minister could say that he wanted to see everything that is going to be broadcast before it is broadcast.  The Minister may smile at that but it is statutorily possible for him to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, but not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only talking about possibilities and the Minister may deem it necessary to do that.  I <Col N="2096" /> can see the danger that lies in this power and I would be interested to hear if the Minister would tell us when that possibility might arise.  In the light of the Taoiseach's challenge to the statutory powers of RTE this day fortnight and in the light of the terms of section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, it is of the greatest importance that every Deputy here should elicit from the Minister his views of the responsibilities which reside in him as a result of section 31. Could the Minister indicate what he conceives to be his duty in this regard?</P>
      <P>It might be difficult to tell the House what sort of matter the Minister might make the subject of a written direction to the Authority but surely he must have in mind some broad principles to guide him as regards matters of any particular class.  The provisions of section 31 are definitely dangerous if misused by the Minister who can look upon almost anything broadcast as a matter of any particular class.  I have the duty to ask here that the Minister should enunciate the principles by which he would be guided in using section 31.  He should tell us what principles have guided him to date in the use of these powers, how often he has involved them and the order in which he has invoked them and each occasion on which he has done so.</P>
      <P>While these things may not have been necessary in the past, the recent events to which I have referred make it necessary for the Minister to give to the House and the country an indication of his future intentions in this matter. Could the Minister indicate to the House the number of times he has issued directions to Radio Telefís Éireann under this section?  In particular, the Minister should be able to tell us if he has set his face against matter of any particular class, which he is able under section 21 to ban simply by writing a letter to the Authority?</P>

If he has set his face against matters of any particular class, I should like him to enumerate the classes because I think the House should be in a position to express its views on the Minister's past actions in this regard.  The Minister should also put the House into the position of being able to discuss and, if necessary, criticise, the Minister's intentions in regard to the future in this connection.</P>
      <P>There is another thing upon which it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should inform the country and the House.  I refer to the opposition which arises between section 31 and section 18.  Section 18, the Minister will recall and I need not remind him, places a statutory duty upon the Authority to secure that when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to a matter of public controversy or is the subject of public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially.</P>

      <P>A very important section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can reply and I will not interfere with his reply. I would ask him to show me the same courtesy.  We have a very interesting situation.  First, under statute, we have a Minister who may direct Radio Telefís Éireann to refrain from broadcasting a certain thing.  That means, of course, that the Minister may in writing direct Radio Telefís Éireann not to publish a comment of, say, a noted economist or chairman of a chamber of commerce or somebody like that upon the broadcast of the Budget proposals of the Minister for Finance. The Minister could do that.  Not only that, but he can direct in writing that Telefís Éireann give special time to the Minister for Finance to explain his Budget proposals to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where the interesting situation arises; what is Telefís Éireann to do in <Col N="2098" /> such circumstances?  I am taking a purely hypothetical case because it might tomorrow morning become a real case.  Telefís Éireann is under statutory duty, by virtue of section 18, to secure that in any discussion of the Minister's Budgetary proposals there shall be an impartial and objective report.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to know how the Minister reconciles these two sections.  If the irresistible force of the Minister's powers under section 31 comes in contact with the immovable object created by section 18 of the Act, what will happen?  Again, the Minister may smile and look upon it as a hypothetical case.  It is no such thing.  It is something which I plainly can see as quite likely to happen, where the Minister uses his power and, where the Authority says: &ldquo;You have no right to do it because we are under a duty&rdquo;.  The Minister should indicate to the House what his view would be should such an occasion arise.  Who does he consider to be the final arbiter under these conflicting sections&mdash;he as Minister under section 31 or the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority under section 18?  It is terribly important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The House and the country should have a plain, unequivocal statement of the Minister's mind on this matter.  Not now&mdash; in case the Minister is going to interrupt me again&mdash;but when the Minister is replying to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that to be one of the most important questions with which the Minister should deal. I doubt if he will.  The Act could have been ideal if we had on one side a Minister using his powers as Minister &mdash;because I agree when the Taoiseach says that Radio Telefís Éireann cannot be completely free of some Government intervention&mdash;and, as the intention of the Act was, that you would <Col N="2099" /> have on the other side an independent Authority saying: &ldquo;These are our rights under the Act and these rights we will insist on having&rdquo;.  The great tragedy and the great danger of our times is that the manner in which the Minister appointed the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority completely robs the Act of any effectiveness it might have from the point of view of safeguarding the rights of public discussion of public affairs, either on television or radio, because, largely speaking, the Authority is the creature of the Minister. If there did arise between the Minister and the Authority the conflict which I have mentioned between the Minister's powers under section 31 and the Authority's powers under section 18, there would be no need for the Minister to be in any difficulty. All he need do is to telephone his creatures, these creatures whom he has created of Telefís Éireann, many of them coming from nowhere and likely to return to the same destination after their period of office, and simply tell them what to do.  That is the danger and the difficulty that agitates my mind and that agitates the mind of anybody who intelligently appraises the situation in Radio Telefís Éireann at the moment.</P>

    <P>I simply want to say that the one thing I rejoice in is that although the Minister may tie the hands of the Authority by putting on to it his own pliant, complacent nominees, the power still to decide what attitude Radio Telefís Éireann should adopt in public affairs resides in the hands of the people of the country.  I do wish that every man and woman who views television or listens to radio would bear constantly in mind their right and, indeed, duty, to make it very plain both to the Authority and to the Minister that they will not brook interference of the nature which the Taoiseach envisaged here on October 12th. Fundamentally, the power to guard the rights of the people in regard to Radio Telefís Éireann resides in the hands of the people.  If the people felt that a recent programme showing the new <Col N="2100" /> face of communism was showing a face which was not true and which was unduly kind to communism, theirs is the right to protest.  No matter how much we may protest here, we might not be heard, but if the men and women of this country make their views known to the Minister and to the Authority in that way they will effect the proper management of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>To mention another programme, if parents of large families felt that a recent programme dealing with keeping families on a small basis was unduly weighted against the keeping of large families, it is not alone the right but the duty of the mother of a family of ten to phone Telefís Éireann and to say: &ldquo;I was not given any opportunity to go on Telefís Éireann and to say that I have a family of ten and bless God every day of my life that I have them.&rdquo;  It is about time the people awakened to their rights and responsibilities in that regard and imposed on those who produce programmes on Radio Telefís Éireann their views because much of what I have seen on Telefís Éireann is, in my view, the sort of stuff which is absolutely contrary to the views and the wishes of the majority of those who listen to the radio or view television.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on this note, a note which I think is the most important in this debate.  I want to remind the people of this country of their power in this regard.  I want to remind the Minister that he has a right and a responsibility, in view of the dangers and indeed of the vicious trends of the past three or four weeks relative to the production of political programmes on Telefís Éireann to explain to the House exactly how he intends to use his powers under section 31.  I want him to explain to the House exactly how he intends to react if by any chance the Broadcasting Authority should challenge the Minister and insist on demanding their rights under section 18, because that is fundamental to any discussion of freedom of thought on Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Without going into the rights and <Col N="2101" /> wrongs of the dismissal of Tibor Paul, I should like to join with those who regret it was done in such an ill-mannered and ugly fashion.  I do not know whether there was reason or otherwise for the dismissal of Tibor Paul.  I do not know there were means other than simply dropping him a letter two minutes before he went on to do the kind of important work he does.  I regret that that happened.  I regret still more that it appears to me the Minister does not consider it was in bad taste and does not consider it is the sort of thing for which he should answer to this House and to the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This debate began at 7.30 yesterday evening when the Minister made his opening statement.  It continued for the rest of yesterday and has been on all day today.  So far, from the Government benches we have had the Minister and the Minister only.  I suppose that is understandable.  The Deputies sitting behind him could hardly have had the hardihood to congratulate the Minister and the Department on a job well done, as far as the telephone service is considered, for example.  Apparently they are going to leave it to the Minister himself to justify the conduct of his colleagues in interfering with the day-to-day working and programming of Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs enjoy a monopoly in providing a telephone system for this country.  I think it will be agreed that any monopoly has a serious obligation to the community to provide a service when that monopoly prevents anybody else from providing it.  I suggest that the monopoly operating the telephone system in this country has a great obligation to the public because the telephone service pays its way.  It is not being subsidised by the taxpayer and is not run as a social service.  The people who use the telephone system are entitled to a service.  Those who have not already got a telephone and who wish to instal one are entitled to have it.  If this service were run by a private public concern and if other public concerns were entitled to go into this <Col N="2102" /> field and complete with one another for the available market, we may take it we would have an efficient and economic telephone system.</P>
    <P>We have heard during this debate from the Minister that there is a waiting list of approximately 13,000 applicants for telephones and that about 2,500 are being installed.  When are these other applicants going to be supplied?  It would appear from letters Deputies receive when they make representations that it will be a very long time, that there is no hope of these people being supplied in the immediate future or indeed in the months ahead.  It is reasonable to interpret from the letters we have received that people away down on the waiting list will not get a telephone for years to come.</P>
    <P>It is depressing to find a business man, who is investing a considerable amount of money in a new business in a town with a population of 4,000 or 5,000, being told he has no hope of getting a telephone in the immediate future.  I know of such a case where the man is investing that amount of money without the aid of one penny by way of Government grant.  He applied for a telephone and the reply was that it was impossible to say when he would get a phone because there was a huge waiting list.  The only meaning that could be put on the letter is that the Department for the want of money&mdash;that is part of it&mdash;or the want of equipment cannot say when that man will get a telephone.</P>
    <P>That is an abuse of an monopoly, I cannot see why such a man, who requires a telephone for his business and who cannot run his business without one, should be told nothing can be done about it, and that he will have to take his place in this queue of 13,000 people.  I repeat that, in my view, this is an abuse of a monopoly. Apparently, the only people who rank for priority are doctors, clergymen, veterinary surgeons and the like.  Business people should get priority also.  I was told as recently as last week that farmers are not on the list at all.  They enjoy some sort of lower rate of rental and do not come into the queue at all. In this day and age, when farming is <Col N="2103" /> being carried on by modern scientific methods, when the cattle breeding station or the vet has to be contacted, farmers should get serious consideration and an effort should be made to provide them with a telephone within a reasonable time when they apply.</P>
    <P>When these same people get a telephone, they are asked to pay five and seven years' rental in advance.  That also is difficult to understand, but it is so.  I say that the Minister should recruit more staff if he has not enough. He should get more money if he has not enough finance to get on with the job, because, according to his statement and according to the accounts, the telephone system is paying its way. Therefore, there is no reason on earth why it should not be brought up to date and why business people should be hindered in their business and why people who already have telephones cannot make full use of them because other essential services are not provided with telephones.  I have stressed one case because I think it is typical of many cases and of the type of abuse that this monopoly is guilty of.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two about post office buildings.  I think post office buildings in general are unsatisfactory. Some of them are very much out of date.  I may be pardoned if I deal with this particular aspect of the matter on a somewhat parochial basis and if I deal with the capital town of my own constituency, the town of Cavan.  It cannot be denied that the post office in Cavan is housed in a building that is entirely unsuitable for the purpose.  The telephone exchange attached to it is completely inadequate for this purpose and a proper automatic telephone exchange cannot be provided until such time as adequate buildings are provided.</P>
    <P>The position there is&mdash;I have raised this matter twice by way of Parliamentary Question and I intend to raise it again&mdash;that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as far back as 1962, acquired the premises known as the Central Markets in the middle of Cavan town at a very reasonable price <Col N="2104" /> from the urban council, on the understanding that they would provide a much-wanted post office and automatic telephone exchange.  From that good day in 1962 until today, as far as the general public know, nothing has been done with these buildings; nothing has been done to provide a post office and nothing has been done with these buildings except to board them up.  This public property now constitutes an eye-sore in the locality while the town is crying out for a new general post office and for an automatic telephone exchange.</P>
    <P>I think that, when considering whether Cavan town is entitled to priority in the building of a post office, the Department should ask itself what money has been spent in that town in the past 20 years, what public money has been spent there on public building. The answer will be that not one penny was spent there because a house has not been built there since 1952. That is something the Department should take into account when arranging priorities in deciding whether the money it has at its disposal should be spent in Cavan town or elsewhere.  I think it should be spent in Cavan town for two reasons: (1)  the site is there, an ideal site, and (2)  no public money has been spent there for very many years.  It is coming to the time when the people are beginning to say that if the Minister is not prepared to get on with the building of the post office, he should agree to transfer this property back to the urban council so that they can make some other use of it.</P>
    <P>A question was asked here during the past couple of weeks as to whether any provision was made for the cleaning of telephone kiosks in the city of Dublin and elsewhere.  The Minister stated in reply that money was provided for the cleansing of these kiosks and apparently the Department accepts responsibility.  I want to say now that these telephone kiosks in the city of Dublin and throughout the country are a public disgrace.  They are filthy: that is the only expression I can think of to describe them.  Seeing that they provide a service which is availed of by <Col N="2105" /> visitors to this country, by tourists, something should be done about them. They should be kept in a condition in which they are fit to be frequented by the general public and by the visitors to this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about our radio and television service.  Again, this is a monopoly and, in regard to this particular monopoly, the Minister owes serious obligations to the country as a whole.  Radio Telefís Éireann should present new items in an unbiased manner.  It should not tolerate censorship of news items.  It should not tolerate the altering of its programmes. It should present all national events in an unbaised and fair manner.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the manner in which Telefís Éireann dealt with the Presidential election, one of the most important events in the life of this country, an event which, in normal circumstances, occur only once every seven years.  There is no doubt that on this occasion in June last Telefís Éireann campaigned for one candidate and blacked out the other.  I say that, after full consideration.  I put it to the House and to the country as an accurate description of what happened.</P>
    <P>I know that Telefís Éireann stated, that the Government stated, that it was not the policy of Telefís Éireann to cover the Presidential election campaign. Well, if Telefís Éireann think or if the controllers of Telefís Éireann think that they did not cover the Presidential election campaign in May of this year, then they are not fit to be in control of Telefís Éireann because they are not fit to form a correct judgment of what is going on.  When dealing with an event, such as a Presidential election, it is the duty of Telefís Éireann to look at the overall picture, see what is happening and see the kind of picture they are, in effect, presenting.  It is not sufficient for them to say, as they said on that occasion, that they were not covering the election, and then proceed to present one candidate to people night after night, or allow that candidate to present himself to the people on the national television network night after night, blacking out the other candidate altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> It is not sufficient for Telefís Éireann to ask: &ldquo;What can we do?  One of the candidates is the President and he is big news, and it is our duty to present him to the people whenever he appears in public.&rdquo;  There can be no argument with me about that because I make you a present of it.  Surely to goodness, that was something Telefís Éireann should have taken into account in summing up the situation and deciding whether or not they would be fair to both candidates in the campaign.  That is something the controllers of Telefís Éireann should have considered and, if they had considered it, they could come to only one conclusion, namely, in order to do justice and to be fair to both candidates, there was only one way in which to deal with the election campaign, and that was to cover it. Failure to cover it meant one thing, and one thing only: that Telefís Éireann campaigned for one candidate and blacked out the other.  I defy contradiction on that.</P>
    <P>There is general dissatisfaction over the interference of the Government and Government Ministers in the day-to-day working of Telefís Éireann.  The excision of the NFA statement in reply to the advice of the Minister for Agriculture to the farmers to hold on to their cattle has been dealt with already. That bit of news, coming from a responsible national organisation, was broadcast in one news bulletin and was blacked out in subsequent bulletins. That was done in response to a telephone call from the Minister for Agriculture, a person directly interested for personal reasons in keeping the item out.</P>
    <P>When the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 was being debated in this House, every effort was made to write into that Act a provision whereby directions given to Telefís Éireann by a Minister would be reduced to writing.  The reason for that provision was obvious.  The House wanted to ensure there would be as little interference as possible with Telefís Éireann and it also wanted to ensure that, if there were interference, there would be a record of it; it would not be done behind backs or by a member of the Government seeing a pal in <Col N="2107" /> Montrose and telling him that he did not want this, that or the other to appear, The Legislature went to great trouble to ensure that directions to Telefís Éireann would be given only by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and in writing, because the Legislature feared that there would be abuses, abuses such as occurred recently when the Minister for Agriculture phoned some subordinate official at Montrose and had criticism of his speech excised from news bulletins. I think I am correct in saying that the Minister for Agriculture stated here that he advised farmers to hold on to their cattle, if possible; the very next day, after making that statement, when he was questioned about it, he said that that was his personal opinion. Apparently he was not speaking with the backing of the Government or even of his Department; he was putting it forward as his personal opinion.</P>
    <P>Why then should be object to the NFA having their statement broadcast on television?  Apparently Telefís Éireann considered that the NFA statement was of sufficient importance and sufficient national interest to warrant its inclusion in the news bulletin. It was wrong of the Minister to telephone Montrose and have this statement excised, blacked out, without any consideration.  That was done merely because a Minister of State rang up. It is just not good enough for the Taoiseach, or anybody else in this House, to argue that any member of the House is at liberty to ring up Telefís Éireann and complain about a programme.  The people who are employed in Montrose hold their positions at the will of the Government. That is the practical way of looking at the situation.  When a Minister of State rings up and tells a subordinate official that a news item is a dreadful item to include in the news, and that he does not think it should be broadcast at all, we know the effect such an intimation will have as compared with a complaint from a private Deputy, from a member of the public, or from the President of the NFA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> That is what this House feared when it put the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, through this House and that is why it wrote into the Act that any interference with Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann should be in writing over the hand of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who could then be questioned in this House about the propriety of his actions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is particularly vulnerable on this question of interfering with Telefís Éireann. The Minister was directly responsible for removing an entire programme, planned 12 months in advance, the programme known as &ldquo;Division&rdquo;.  The Chief Whips of the three Parties met and after long consideration and many meetings, decided that a programme known as &ldquo;Division&rdquo; would be put on once a month, or certainly over a protracted period.  The understanding between the three Whips and Mr. Rugheimer was that the programme would be open to Members of this House and to people who are not Members of the House.  In accordance with that understanding and that agreement, the first presentation of &ldquo;Division&rdquo; was arranged and the Minister for Agriculture was invited to go on it, as were a member of the Fine Gael Party, and I presume a member of the Labour Party, and Mr. Richard Deasy, the President of the NFA.  When this became known, the Minister for Agriculture refused to go on the programme and I say in this House that the Minister for Agriculture spent an entire day trying to make sure that the programme which was to feature himself, Mr. Deasy and other prominent people, would never go on.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It is a fact, and I defy contradiction of it, that the Minister for Agriculture refused to go on &ldquo;Division&rdquo;, refused to participate in this political programme <Col N="2110" /> which had been agreed upon by the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party, and the Chief Whip of the Labour Party, in consultation with the controllers of Telefís Éireann.  The reason he would not go on it was that he refused to meet Mr. Rickard Deasy on the television screen.  Not alone did he refuse to meet him in the flesh in his office in this city but he refused to go on television and debate the rights or wrongs of the farmers' problems with him before the television audience throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>Recently on a television programme on which the Minister was speaking to young people, he stated that this programme would not be continued, that it had been taken off because the Fianna Fáil Party did not agree with the interpretation of the agreement arrived at between the Whips.  Everybody is out of step but the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Labour Party Whip, the Fine Gael Party Whip and Mr. Rugheimer, the controller of Telefís Éireann, agreed on the interpretation of the agreement, which, in their opinion, was that it was open to Members of this House and members of the public, but because it did not suit the Minister for Agriculture and the Fianna Fáil Party, they refused to accept the interpretation put on the agreement by the others and sabotaged the programme.  Those are the facts and they cannot be contradicted.  It is obvious, as I say, that interference with Radio Telefís Éireann by the Government should be a very rare occurrence, should only take place when a matter of grave public policy demands it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In covering national events, we have the Taoiseach and Ministers of State highlighted.  You cannot have an argument with me about that.  I agree that the Taoiseach and members of the Government are entitled to more publicity and that they are better news than private Members of this House, but the members of the Government represent, in votes, about 50 per cent of the people of the country.</P>

Because they are the Government, and for that reason only, they are entitled to more of the limelight and are bigger news than private Members of this House.

    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the two matters I wish to deal with, the complete and absolute failure of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to fulfil the obligation which the monopoly to provide a telephone service imposes on them and the great abuse for political reasons at the behest of the Government <Col N="2112" /> that Telefís Éireann has suffered. For those reasons I think that this House should refer back this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too concerned as to whether Telefís Éireann publishes the nonsense being spoken by Deputy Fitzpatrick or anybody else in this House.  I do not see any reason why any public representative should want to be stuck in it and I can tell the gentlemen opposite that the more they appear on Telefís Éireann, the longer they will be over there.  I object to some of the things I have seen on Telefís Éireann.  If we have take the life history of one who is admitted on all sides to have been a great Irishman, one who was known as the Uncrowned King of Ireland, Charles Stewart Parnell, and if Telefís Éireann wants to throw the image of that great Irishman out to the young people of today, they seem to be able to find nothing else to deal with but a divorce case.  If that is so, I think the sooner Telefís Éireann is taken out of this country the better.  Their job seems to be to take a great national figure, a man who raised up the ordinary peasantry of this country and gave them their freedom, and when they come to show a picture of him to the young people of this country, all they can produce is Parnell and what happened in the Galway election.</P>
      <P>Surely the young people of this country deserve to see something better than that?  This is a scandal.  I nearly took the damn thing and three it out of the window when I saw it.  If Telefís Éireann cannot do anything else than bring out films of American filth to fill their screens practically every night of the week, then the members of this House should not be voting money for them.  It is bad enough to see a flock of I-don't know-what-to-call-thems on the screen.  You would not know whether they are men or women or boys and girls, but before those creatures are allowed on the screen in any public assembly, one should get a sheep shears and shear them and then show them.  Telefís Éireann was not brought into this country for that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to protest against this on <Col N="2113" /> behalf of the ordinary rural population who get a certain amount of relaxation and entertainment from Telefís Éireann.  I want to protest against this kind of stuff being shoved out.  We have films like &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo; that show what can be done in this country and that would give to our young people some image of what was happening when this country was fighting for its freedom.  Surely they could find some other type of film to show than the filth they are putting on?  I object to it, and I object to it here on behalf of my people.  It is time it changed and I appeal to the Minister to exercise his authority in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned whether Deputy O'Higgins or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs appears on the screen. I do not give a hoot either way and I do not think the public gives a hoot either.  What I want to see are programmes presented that will not necessitate the young members of the family being put outside the door for fear they would not see them.  We want programmes that our young people can see and not the filth that is being put out by Telefís Éireann.  I object to it.</P>

      <P>We have before us a sizeable Estimate for some £20 million and one is prompted to ask what is the return for that £20 million.  I have not too much to say to the officials of the Post Office.  They are doing a good job but I would like to know why there is a waiting list of 13,000 applicants for telephones and when that waiting list will be dealt with.  If only 2,000 per year are being dealt with, it will take a long time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for Telefís Éireann being thrown into the debate here, I do not think there would be a lot said on the Minister's Department.  The big topic has been Telefís Éireann.  I do not <Col N="2114" /> want to add to what has been said on certain aspects of it.  On the whole there is a fairly good job being done but we are entitled to make criticisms and that is why I am on my feet now. There are some programmes and if we are to stick by our television sets, we will have American accents before long.  A great deal of tripe is being presented.</P>

      <P>There are some terrible programmes, but if they suit the Deputy, that is his business.  I did not intend to add fuel to the fire in regard to Telefís Éireann, but I must say that 80 per cent of the staff there were put in there, and we know their political colours.  They were put in to do a certain job and they are doing it.  We have them tagged and when the day comes, they will get their cards stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I know they are doing the job they were sent in to do, that is, to cut out the Opposition at every possible opportunity, as the Members tried to do here but failed.  However, I would remind them to be on their toes, for the day will come when they will find the boot will be on the other foot.</P>
      <P>I should like to see television playing a bigger role in advertising tourism. There is a great deal of scenery in this country that even people in Dublin do not know exists.  If I could go back to the postal service, might I suggest a return to the franking of letters with &ldquo;See Ireland first&rdquo;?  The thing nowadays is to go on the Continent. I met some of these people who do not know where certain tourist resorts in this country are and they could tell you about places in Spain, the names of which they could hardly pronounce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> Another thing that has been remarked to me in regard to the news in Irish is the number of Munster dialect speakers who come on.  We have the cradle of the Gaeltacht in the West and I should like to hear more of the real native speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>More Ulster, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have more Irish speakers to spare than you have in Ulster.  On the entertainment side, let us have more of this Tolka Row stuff and cut out the cowboy films.  I saw more shots fired across the screen in my house one evening than were fired in South Vietnam.  I saw them firing all night from one revolver and I never saw them reloading it.  There was a time I could swallow that stuff but time marches on.  It may suit the children but we get an overdose of it. Let us have more of &ldquo;Tolka Row&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;, which are racy of the soil.  We have actors who are able to put this material across.  Mrs. Butler and Mr. Feeney are great characters. I would take this opportunity of congratulating these artists on their performances.</P>
      <P>Another important thing I would like to see on Telefís Éireann is a course on first aid.  With all the accidents on the roads nowadays, this is a very necessary service.  It is not so much a question of what you should do as what you should not do.  These things should be brought home.</P>
      <P>A programme I should like to see continued is &ldquo;Club Céilí&rdquo;.  A very good job has been done there, and it enables the youth to see we have something of cultural value.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to know what kind of programmes people like, he should issue a questionnaire to every licence holder asking him what he wants, and then try to put that across in the programmes.  He will not please all the people all the time but he will go a long way on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Labhair Gaeilge Linn&rdquo; is another programme which is doing a good job.  I congratulate Mr. O'Sullivan, a Galway man, for the capable manner <Col N="2116" /> in which he puts this programme across.  I would also congratulate him on his acting in parts he has played in other programmes.  I must agree with Deputy Corry when he mentions the scruffy type of people who sometimes appear on programmes.  They are disgusting.  It is not a shears one would want for them but a blowlamp. Whether they are singing ballads or anything else makes no difference.  It is what one sees that counts.  They have been the cause of adverse comment and the Minister should see it is cut off.</P>

      <P>The advertising is sometimes most irritating.  We get an overdose of beer drinking&mdash;it would nearly drive one to drink.  There is more drink consumed than would be drunk at the Kerry Festival.  Possibly that is what they are aiming at.  I would also ask the Minister to see that news programmes do not clash on Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.</P>

One can hear both at the same time but if you miss one you should be able to switch off and get it on the other.  On the whole the authority is doing a pretty good job. You cannot please all the people all the time.  I suggest the questionnaire be sent to every licence holder and you might then get some where as regards pleasing  <Col N="2117" /> some of the people some of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak but I was tempted to do so having heard the previous speaker and one or two interruptions.  I listened to the play-actors and the pure-minded putting across their points of view in regard to Post Office and Telefís Éireann affairs.  These people act as playboys in order to impress the Gallery and they make no constructive comments.  Political honesty is necessary if we are to flourish.  It is necessary in our approach to television programmes.  The same applies in this House.  We know, however, that in the past the people who preached that, members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, so long and so loudly and who are preaching now about the &ldquo;terrible situation&rdquo; that developed in Telefís Éireann some days ago when a correction was made in some of the newscasts, themselves made use of the radio and television in a reckless and unscrupulous way.</P>
      <P>We recall that a few years ago on the eve of a general election, we heard the State servants being bribed over the radio by a speaker on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  Quite recently members of the Labour Party had cameras at their beck and call.  This is one thing I have against Telefís Éireann; they had cameras moving around this city in a situation where unfortunate people were being moved from one part of the city to another to end up in a rat-infested area at the behest of people who were trying to attract attention by having Telefís Éireann on the spot. Many of them could not scratch themselves&mdash;including Members of this House&mdash;unless the television cameras were on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>The Deputy is talking about the scandal of Griffith Barracks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Now that it has been mentioned, I should like to deal more fully with it.  In that period we had public representatives, Members of the House, threatening responsible members of Dublin Health Authority, of the corporation and of the House, <Col N="2118" /> that they would have the cameras down if such and such was not done. They had the cameras down day after day and week after week and unfortunate homeless families were brought along to face the cameras, unfortunate expectant mothers included, causing concern to their mothers and fathers and other relatives.  They were led out of Griffith Barracks into a rat-infested area in Mountjoy Square. This was done so that one political Party or its members would get some type of publicity that would portray them as the saviours of a section of the community.  Unfortunately, those who spoke long and loudly to the people in Mountjoy Square and at the corner of Middle Abbey Street had the television cameras.  They had them on the health authorities, on Griffith Barracks and on Mountjoy Square and unfortunate people were paraded before the cameras.  It was unfortunate that those in the Labour Party could induce the people in Telefís Éireann to bring the cameras there and make them available.  Shame on Telefís Éireann for allowing such undiluted nonsense as went over the air then, the grossly inaccurate statements which when they were asked to correct them were corrected in a very half-hearted manner.</P>

      <P>I want to impress them.  There are probably more important matters.  I did not intend to mention this but seeing that I was pressed into action, I thought it would clear the air to deal with it.  We have listened to threats about the purge that is promised if they are returned <Col N="2119" /> to power.  No doubt that purge will come if the Opposition Parties get into office just as it came to Aer Lingus and their workers previously. Fine Gael speakers have said that purge will come if they get into power. I suppose there is always the possibility and the axe is hanging over the heads of people now in important posts but I should not be surprised that, if there is a move for a political change, many of these people would pack up and go before Fine Gael got the chance to implement the purge.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that purge will come.  In the past it did not come alone to Aer Lingus but to a number of other concerns as we are only too well aware.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring the matter of the postal service to the Minister's notice, especially in cases where this service is being changed for reasons of economy or betterment of the service. In some cases I think the preliminary examination carried out is not sufficiently comprehensive.  I would ask the Minister to have such schemes fully investigated where mechanisation is being used or where it is a case of changing a postman.  In newly-built areas, this constitutes a special problem, especially in the case of large new estates of 50 or 200 or more houses where you may have 20 or 30 William Murphys or John Murphys.  If there is a change of postman, the whole scheme is disrupted for many weeks.  I have witnessed this in my own area.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the postman who is familiar with the area is retained on the route until such time as all the roadways are named and identifiable by any other postman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the question of a new design for telephone kiosks was considered at one time and I would ask the Minister to have regard to the fact that the type of kiosk that has been installed at many points in this city is an eyesore.  It is most desirable that telephone kiosks should fit in with the architecture of the surroundings.  The <Col N="2120" /> pillbox type of kiosk now in use does not fit in with the surroundings in many of the developed areas where a very fine job of development has been carried out.  Perhaps a variety of designs could be introduced which would enhance the appearance of the streets. Kiosks as a rule occupy vantage points and it is important that they should be of good appearance.</P>
    <P>The question of design is also very important in connection with stamps. It is a matter which does not receive sufficient attention.  There are in this country artists who could produce stamps that would be pleasing to the eye and attractive to collectors rather than the drab type to which we have become accustomed over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the points I have made.  In conclusion, I should like to say that I wish the Minister and his Department well and trust that he will be able to solve the many problems in relation to the installation of telephones.  I trust that applications for telephones, where a telephone is needed, will receive the sympathetic consideration that they have been receiving over the past number of years.  I am quite sure that, under the very capable leadership of the Minister, many of the problems that have confronted the Department will be eliminated and that we can look forward to a brighter future.  I trust that the necessary finance will be available shortly so that the Minister will be able to put into operation the programme that he would desire.</P>
    <P>I would appeal for political honesty in relation to the very important media of television and radio.  It is absolutely essential that there should be political honesty in our approach to these matters.  Many of the statements that have come from politicians in Fine Gael and Labour can be questioned here day after day.  I would have questioned them here tonight but time does not permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up too much time of the House, particularly as my remarks on this Estimate will be directed along ground already covered but it is necessary that Deputies should speak out clearly regarding some of the matters which have been matters of public news in recent times.</P>
      <P>The particular matter with which I want to deal is the question of&mdash;I do not mind whether you call it interference or intervention&mdash;with the television Authority in their presentation of news and programmes.  I do not know whether the Minister or the Government really appreciate the extent to which public unease and disquiet have been caused in recent weeks at the happenings involving the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the television newscast towards the end of last month.  I do not know whether the Minister or the Government appreciate to the full the extent to which people have been perturbed by the claims made by the Taoiseach in this House on 12th October, in what was, I assume, intended to be an explanatory statement of the Government viewpoint and the views held by the Government as to their rights and duties in relation to the television service.</P>
      <P>It is right, whether it suits us politically or not, no matter from which side of the House we speak, to pay some tribute to the courage of the National Union of Journalists for bringing this matter out into the open. It is because of their courage in doing that that Deputies in the House and the public at large have had their attention directed to a situation which certainly seems to be unhealthy so far as the question of presentation of news in certain circumstances is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking here in reply to a question on 12th October, made a number of claims with regard to the duty and responsibility of the <Col N="2122" /> Government in relation to the television service.  I want quite clearly and bluntly to challenge, not so much the accuracy, as the validity of the claims made by the Taoiseach on that occasion. I am referring, Sir, to the Dáil Debates of 12th October in which the Taoiseach said in relation to Radio Telefís Éireann that the Government have overall responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he is replying to the debate, to quote me any single section from the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 which justifies that assumption on the part of the Taoiseach when he spoke here on 12th October.  If it is the Government's duty to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not in its programmes offend against the public interest, it is necessary that the Minister and the Government should be able to tell us who is to be the judge of public interest, whether the right to arbitrate and to decide on what questions are or are not matters of public interest rests solely with the Government and as to whether or not the Television Authority set up by them and, indeed, Deputies in this House, are not entitled to have some say in that question.  With regard to the Taoiseach's claim that it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that television programmes do not conflict with national policy as defined in legislation, again, I would ask the Minister to let me know any single section or any single line in any section of the Broadcasting Authority Act which justifies that assumption on the part of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Surely national policy is created, and can only be created, by informed public opinion?  If the sole arbiter as to what news is to be given to the public with regard to any particular matter is to be the Government or individual Government Ministers, how can a properly informed public opinion be created? Remember we are only in this House as representatives of the people.  We <Col N="2123" /> are here as servants of the people.  Of all in this House the people who should most fully appreciate their position as servants of the people are Government Ministers.  It is not their job to dictate to them.  It is the right and privilege of the people themselves to decide what is or what is not to be national policy.  If the people decide that national policy should be changed, it is their right to come to that decision. It is no part of the duty of, and certainly, to my mind, no obligation whatever exists on, any member of the Government to try to propound national policy according to their own ideas without consultation with the people.</P>
    <P>I want to put this point of view to the Minister.  I do it not for the purpose of being in any way mischievous and certainly not for the purpose of treating this matter in any lighthearted way.  I want to put to him the point of view that all this situation could have been avoided if the Government had regard to the provisions clearly laid down in the Constitution with regard to the right of the citizens freely to express their convictions and opinions.  That right, according to the words of the Constitution, is guaranteed to the citizens of this country.  The actual wording of the relevant Article of the Constitution is that:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights subject to public order and morality.</P>
    <P>The first of the rights guaranteed by the State, according to the Constitution, is the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. Surely there is no question of any citizen expressing freely his convictions and opinions if the situation is that any Government Minister, or the Government as a whole for that matter, have the right to direct the public television Authority that particular viewpoints are not to be expressed on the news services of the Authority?  I do not want to exaggerate this.  I know a case can reasonably be made by the Government benches that in the particular instance, the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2124" /> and Fisheries did not ask or request the news item to be taken out of the news, that he did not ask or request and that no member of the Government asked or requested that that particular item of news should not be expressed at all, and that he simply exercised his right to protest against a particular presentation.  I know that that case can be made and I do not want to exaggerate this particular incident but to express the point of view that, unless this House views the matter seriously, unless this House looks the matter clearly in the face, there is a likelihood that the thin end of the wedge is getting in.</P>
    <P>I do not make that statement lightly. I do not make it for the sake of political advantage or of political taunting. I make it because of the statement which appears in the public press today from the National Union of Journalists.  I am referring to today's issue of the <i>Irish Times</i> wherein some very disquieting comments were made in this statement issued by a responsible journalists' body in this country. It is bad that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister met this union and discussed the matter with them, as apparently they were asked to do.  Perhaps I had better not say what I was going to say in case I get off on another tack.  It is unfortunate that neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach met them when they were asked to do so.</P>
    <P>It is gravely disturbing to find in this statement issued by the NUJ that apparently what occurred at the end of last month between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the television Authority is not the first incident of that sort.  This statement sets out:</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask how public order or morality or the authority of the State would have been undermined by broadcasting the particular item. It is fair to ask how public order or morality or the authority of the State would have been undermined by broadcasting the text of the letter of resignation of Mr. Patrick Smith, <Col N="2125" /> former Minister for Agriculture, late in 1964.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, an order was issued to the RTE News Division that only official statements from the Government Information Bureau could be broadcast&mdash;an order which was reversed later on the same day when the letter had been published in full by the evening newspapers.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a very unhealthy state of affairs?  When a Government Minister of long standing, a Government Minister who has served as a Deputy for I think more than 40 years in this House, comes to a particular decision that he can no longer remain a member of the Government, when he writes a letter to that effect and gives out that letter for publication, surely it is a very unhealthy situation if the television service in this country is to be precluded from including that as a news item?  Why should they be precluded from including it as a news item in their bulletin?  Is there any reason other than that it is embarrassed the Government at the time?  I do not suggest, because it is not clear from this statement, that the order not to use that item of news, or to make any reference to it unless it came from the Government Information Bureau, came from the Minister or from the Government.  I want to stick to facts within my own knowledge or brought to my knowledge by statements of this kind.  But it is an unhealthy thing that such an order should be given by anyone on a matter which obviously was newsworthy and should have been reported.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the conduct of the television Authority during the course of the Presidential election campaign.  I do not want to labour that except to say that their conduct in that regard did not escape the attention of very many people in this country, particularly when the comment was made that a Presidential election in another country was very fully covered by the television service here.  But later on in this statement&mdash; this emphasises what I have been saying about the unhealthy state of affairs &mdash;we read: <Col N="2126" /> Yet, as the Dublin Radio Branch of the union has already pointed out, news has been suppressed from time to time, not even at the request of a Minister but, presumably, through fear of Ministerial or Governmental displeasure.</P>
    <P>Surely that is the most unhealthy situation that could arise in a national service of this kind&mdash;that, even without a request being made by a Minister, news would be suppressed for fear of Ministerial or Governmental displeasure. Is it any wonder, in face of that kind of public statement appearing in our national newspapers, that some Deputies feel that should there be a change of Government, things should be radically altered?  People are inclined to be provoked into saying that kind of thing but, in view of the comments made by Deputy Dowling, I think it only right to say&mdash;I have no doubt that Deputies of the Labour Party would join me in saying this&mdash; that, so far as we are concerned, anyone in any employment who is doing his job properly would have nothing to fear from a change of Government, either in the television service or anywhere else.  I should like to make that position quite clear in case some of the remarks made might indicate to people that we would approach this matter from the point of view of political bias.</P>

      <P>So far as the Taoiseach's statement is concerned, I believe it has caused considerable disquiet in the country.  Under section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, it is the duty of the Broadcasting Authority to maintain a national service. That is the duty they have to discharge.  A national service is surely a service that will give equal treatment to all sections of the people.  There is danger here&mdash;I am prepared to accept from the Minister that he is not encouraging it but I do not believe he sees the danger&mdash;that the kind of thing that has been happening, the kind of situation that has been referred to in the statement from the National Union of Journalists, is simply one more step on the road to a one-Party State in this country.  No matter how some individuals may feel that that would suit their particular Party, I want to go on record as saying that I believe it would be a damnably bad thing for this country if we ever allowed ourselves to walk blindfold into that kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, an obligation of impartiality is imposed on the television Authority.  Here again, I want to challenge the statement by the Taoiseach when he referred here on 12th October, 1966, to impartiality as between political Parties.  At column 1046 of the Official Report of 12th October, 1966, he used the following words: &ldquo;while maintaining impartiality between political Parties&rdquo;.  That, <Col N="2128" /> to my mind, is a misreading of section 18.  The obligation of impartiality does not exist only as between political Parties.  If there is a matter of public controversy then, whether or not one side is composed of politicians and the other side of people such as the National Farmers Association who are not politicians, the same obligation of impartiality exists and it does not depend on whether or not people are politicians.  There is only one method under this Act whereby the Government have any right to interfere with the presentation of news or any other feature by the television Authority and that is under section 31, to which the Minister referred in a most extraordinary way here already this evening. I do not intend to pursue that.</P>

      <P>I do not know what justification the Minister might have but the Minister certainly gave the impression initially here this evening of saying that all the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had to do, if he wanted to get a particular programme taken out, was to go to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who could operate section 31.  I think possibly the Minister did not mean it in as comprehensive a way as that, but, if that is the Minister's outlook, then I suggest that he should think a lot more seriously of his obligations to this House and to the public in this matter.</P>

      <P>That is a word we do not like to hear in use in this House too often.  One of the points I wish to make concerns the rather poor reception we receive in Connemara.  This matter is becoming a bit of a hardy annual.  Deputy Geoghegan has mentioned it several times.  However, if we do not mention it on the occasion of the annual Estimate, there is the danger that the officials may feel that we are not as keen as ever to have this matter remedied, that the pressure has relaxed and that there is not the same need for it.  The position is very bad in Connemara in the area around Clifden. I would again ask the Minister to see what he can do to remedy the difficulty speedily.  I know that he is making great efforts to improve the situation but winter is now coming upon us and the people in the area would be very grateful if something could be done about it without delay.</P>
