      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to learn whether there is any precedent in our history for six statements of excess having to be presented to the Dáil at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>
      <P>I had better explain. They are not excesses in the normal <Col N="112" /> meaning of the term.  They arose because of the dissolution of the Dáil and in the normal way would have been taken as Supplementary Estimates during the financial year concerned. However, on this occasion the dissolution of the Dáil interrupted that process and there was no alternative machinery available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that explanation should be forthcoming because in my experience as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have no recollection of six statements of excess coming before the Dáil at one time.  It is regarded as exceptional to have a Department bring in a statement of excess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>
      <P>It arises mainly because of the visit of the late President of the United States to this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>I must remonstrate.  I urge on the Minister for Finance a little more circumspection.  It is not enough casually to say that this Vote is due to the visit of the late President of the United States to Ireland when in fact the excess is due to a visit by the President of the Irish Republic to the US and Canada.  This reduces the proceedings of the Dáil to a farce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to do so but this House is entitled to a certain modicum of respect.  One of the modica of respect which this House is entitled to seek is that the Minister for Finance will at least take the trouble that an ordinary backbencher, as I now am, has taken to read the paper circulated, which reads:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Vote 1&mdash;President's Establishment.</P>
      <P>The excess is due to an official visit by the President to the United States of America and Canada, and, also, to increased telephone charges.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is a matter of substance.  The President's expenses have to be met and we accept the necessity for this Estimate, but it is a matter of substance, and I think it is well at the start of the Minister's career on the first occasion he has appeared in this House as Minister for Finance, that the Minister should not ramble in here without having read what his Excess Vote is for.  If the Minister is prudent he will express his regret to the House and his resolve not to offer gross discourtesy to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go and fish. This business must stop: that is all. If the Minister wants prepare for troublesome, he must prepare for trouble. This is not the first time we have had this trouble with the Minister for Finance.  The Minister began his career in this House as Minister for Justice. He inherited a good deal of legislation prepared by the previous administration to reform the law.  He brought a lot of law reform Bills before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>What arises is that we have been informed by the Minister that this Excess Vote relates to the visit of the late President of the United States to this country.  It arises from the visit of the President of the Irish Republic to the United States and Canada.  I want to say that I deplore the practice of the Minister for Finance approaching this House and dealing with such matters in such an irresponsible manner.  I do not believe I trespass on the rules of order when I point out that this is not the first time this has happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that anybody who comes before the House to recommend an Excess Vote, without any consideration at all for what the Excess Vote is for, causes trouble.  This is what caused trouble before on the Succession Bill.  This is what got the Minister into trouble when he took office as Minister for Agriculture and we ended up with the farmers sitting out in front of Government Buildings.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it, and the longer I am in this House, the less reason I have for believing it.  On the contrary, all my experience teaches me to view the Gospel of St. John from the lips of these men with grave suspicion. I check every word and syllable if they recite it.  I believe the Minister made a statement casually without having done his homework and in the belief that nobody would notice what he was saying.  I do not believe that is the proper way to treat the House.  It is a most unfortunate commencement to the Minister's career as Minister for Finance.  He said to me once before, when I had reason to criticise his conduct, that I was trying to destroy him. I am not trying to destroy him; I am trying to reform him.  I warn him now that in the responsible position he now occupies he cannot afford the luxury of not doing the homework which he should do before he comes to this House, before he goes to the Government, or before he makes a decision. Perhaps this incident will be of value to him.  I cannot expect him to be grateful to me for the well-deserved <Col N="117" /> rebuke he has received.  We are not always grateful for benefits conferred but I have very little doubt that I am conferring a benefit upon him.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £539,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully </NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point on this Estimate.  We have a number of servants and officers of this House who for many years were in the employment of the State and who for some obscure reason, are not getting credit, for pension purposes, for the services they have given.  I know the Minister may say that this is something that was handed down to him, something that was handed down over the years, but it is a shocking thing that people who will be retiring in the near future from the service of this House, and who have been in the employment of the State since the early 1920s, will retire with less service than those who came in ten or 20 years later.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this because a special Bill was brought before the House a few years ago to cover one person and a similar type of Bill could be introduced, if it was necessary, to cover the others.  It is not that the country is trying to be mean about this but that nobody was forceful enough about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would get in touch with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>I am perhaps in a position to say things which I could not with freedom have said when I was Leader of the Opposition.  I say this now without any authority from my Leader, Deputy Cosgrave, and without prior consultation.  For good <Col N="118" /> or ill, we operate the Party system in this country: I think it is for the good.  I often think that people do not realise the burden that falls on the Leader of the Opposition, or on the Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;in many respects a heavier burden than falls on the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has at his disposal the very great resources of the Civil Service.  I know I am oversimplyfying the matter when I say that every problem the Taoiseach has to decide is prepared for him and laid before him on a sheet of paper in the last analysis, if his Minister have not made any specific recommendations to him, or the Government, and his final function is to read the summary of the problem and decide yes or no.  Of course, he has many other problems, presiding over the Government, directing the general affairs of the Government, but in the last analysis, it is true of the Leader of the principal Opposition Party that from his own resources, he has to formulate the problems for decision and then bear the ultimate burden of taking the ultimate decision if a consensus has not been arrived at by his Front Bench or his Party as a whole.</P>
      <P>At present the provision made for his secretarial assistance is exiguous. It was fixed a long time ago, and expenses have risen and the standard of wages has risen and the provision now is grossly inadequate.  The plain truth is that both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party are depending upon the help of staff who are accepting a much lower standard of living than their competence would procure for them outside because of a kind of sense of dedication to the political Party they are serving.  The time has come to review that position if the Party system is to function with reasonable efficiency in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to mention, and again I do it without prior consultation with my Leader, Deputy Cosgrave.  I do not in any sense commit him and I am not authorised by him to make this proposal but I make it from my own experience as an ex-Leader of the <Col N="119" /> Opposition.  There is an insufferable burden on the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and of the Labour Party&mdash;who is called to meetings all over the country, to which he ought go to meet the people and let them see him and hear him, if he has to drive himself.  I could give descriptions now of the journeys the present Leader of the Opposition has had to make recently and I could give descriptions of some of the exertions I myself have had to undertake. Unless provision is forthcoming to provide him with the same transport facilities as Ministers enjoy at present, the burden will be almost unendurable. I must confess that when I was retiring from the leadership of the Opposition, one of the things that consoled me was that I had not had a car and driver because I would have missed them terribly.  I do not see how the Leader of the Opposition Party, and the Leader of the Labour Party, can properly carry on their functions when there is not some arrangement made to provide transport for them to enable them to discharge their public duties.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that very often those public duties are of a strictly political character.  They are going down the country as political leaders and I see a difference between a political leader and a member of the elected Government of the country.  I would not want to suggest that the Dáil itself is even more important than the Government but that the Dáil should function satisfactorily is an essential prerequisite to a stable Government.  I do not think the Dáil does function satisfactorily if those on whose shoulders the whole burden of the Opposition rests are to carry unreasonable burdens.</P>
    <P>The last argument which I feel I must face is that I can understand members of the Government Party saying: &ldquo;Why does your own organisation not raise the funds to make available a car and a driver for your leader if you want one?&rdquo;  The answer is that he has not got one.  The work that the Leader of the Opposition or of the Labour Party does, while it <Col N="120" /> is partly political work, has in it another element, that is making the parliamentary system work and maintaining parliamentary institutions.  All practical politicians know the immense difficulty of raising funds and how urgently they are needed for constituency work and the ordinary organisation that goes on from day to day and the natural reluctance of the man who is occupying the position of Leader to indent on Party funds and ask them to bear the cost of a car and driver.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties is that none of us is accustomed to the arrangement whereunder you keep a man servant.  If you keep a chauffeur, what does he do when he is not driving your car?  If he is a member of the central pool of police drivers and if he is not driving your car, he can be doing ordinary police transport work which certainly the Gardaí who drove me when I was Minister habitually did when they were not engaged in actually driving my car.  I need not go into details of the kind of work they did but there is a good deal of Garda driving to be done and the system works out all right in that way. Normally it is a very expensive way of providing transport, but when you examine it, you find it is very hard to discover a more convenient way simply because in the kind of society in which we live the time has passed when we could, with any sense of comfort or normalcy, retain a man in service for no other purpose than to drive the car.</P>
    <P>I do not want to ask for any prompt decision on this.  I put it forward purely in my personal capacity and in the light of my experience when I was Leader of the Opposition.  I would recommend to any Government to consider the desirability of making facilities available approximately equal to those now available to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, to the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the Leaders of the Opposition and the Leader of the other recognised Opposition Party in the House, namely, the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave </NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if any further consideration has been given to certain matters.  Reference has repeatedly been made to the desirability of establishing some procedure analogous to the Public Accounts Committee for investigating the activities of State bodies.  This has been discussed on a number of occasions and many references have been made to it outside the House. At times it has been suggested that because the accounts of most statutory or semi-State bodies are presented to the Dáil under the particular Act by which they are established, or because the procedure is adopted whereby these accounts are laid on the Table of the House either in accordance with the provision of the relevant Acts or possibly on a few occasions for the information of Deputies, Deputies have the right&mdash;as they have on a few occasions when discussions have taken place here&mdash;to discuss the accounts as presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it is generally recognised that that type of procedure is unsatisfactory, that, with the very wide ramifications of the activities of most State bodies, the technical procedure whereby the statutory undertaking concerned is liable under the provisions of the parent statute establishing the body, to present its accounts to the Dáil, while fulfilling and complying with the actual terms of legislation, is one which Deputies and anyone familiar with the problem appreciate would not make it suitable for discussing in detail the matters affected <Col N="123" /> by the activities of the various statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>This question has been the subject of consideration in Britain as well as here.  Certainly when we were in office, this matter was the subject of consideration from time to time.  Possibly one reason for the failure of Governments to take action is based on two considerations.  First, there is the fact that any suggested procedure of a committee comparable with the Committee of Public Accounts would not and could not of its nature deal with all the questions involved in it, and, while there would be a general anxiety to have the accounts of State bodies considered and examined by a special Committee of the Dáil, that because of the particular activities carried on by these various State companies, so far it has not been found possible to devise an entirely satisfactory system of examination.</P>
    <P>The other reason is that because of the size of the Dáil and the various duties which Deputies have to perform, it is not easy readily to find a sufficient number of Deputies available for a number of Committees.  That argument, however, must be considered in the light of the importance of the problem.  In view of the magnitude of these statutory undertakings, the financial commitments involved, the amount of capital expenditure annually incurred by them and the extent to which they affect so many aspects of economic life in the country, the fact that a great deal of the activities carried on by them is not generally available for public review is a question which for long has agitated the minds of Deputies and many others outside who have given some thought and consideration to the matter.  Until recent years the number of statutory bodies was relatively few, but in modern times, the growth of statutory organisations and the extent to which their activities impinge on people's affairs makes the question of much greater importance than it was hitherto.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments often put forward for rejecting any proposal for a Committee is that the day-to-day activities <Col N="124" /> of these bodies should not be the subject of inquiry or examination, or open to the scrutiny of a Parliamentary Committee.  I do not think any reasonable person suggests that or would wish to do that.  In fact, it might well be that certain limitations might be imposed on that type of investigation.  On the other hand, the multiplicity of activities of these bodies and the amount of work which the Dáil has to do&mdash;the ordinary financial business on Estimates of Government Departments and the legislation which is passed each year&mdash; leaves little time for extra activities such as statutory bodies would involve.</P>
    <P>It is notable that the ordinary activities of a Government Department are subject to much closer scrutiny and examination by means of Parliamentary Question, by discussion on Estimates and periodic discussions on legislation, and then finally each year the Committee of Public Accounts examines the expenditure and investigates whether the moneys voted have been spent in the manner authorised by the Dáil.  Since Government Departments are subject to such close scrutiny, it seems to me that the extent of the capital expenditure and the ramifications involved in the activities of these statutory bodies make it imperative that in a modern democracy some system should be evolved.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that we cannot evolve a perfect system or that so far there is no entirely satisfactory system is not a reason why we should not endeavour to evolve a system under which the activities of statutory bodies would be subject to a periodic review by a Select Committee or a Special Committee on somewhat similar lines to the Committee of Public Accounts. It might well be that because of the number of bodies now involved, the Committee could not examine each year each statutory or semi-statutory company.  However, that would be a question of procedure which could be arranged by the Committee when established.</P>
    <P>There is a volume of opinion which expresses concern from time to time both in the Dáil and in certain bodies <Col N="125" /> and gatherings outside that no system of review or check is operated in respect of these organisations.  This matter, as I say, has been the subject of a great deal of consideration in the British Parliament.  After the election of the first Labour Government after the War, when the late Lord Morrison was President of the Council, the matter was discussed on a number of occasions and he had certain responsibilities in connection with it.  Since then a certain procedure has been adopted.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has come when we ought seriously to consider adopting some system whereby a Committee of the Dáil would have powers and responsibilities to investigate the activities of statutory bodies and to present a report somewhat similar to the report presented by the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  I readily accept the view that once a statutory body is established, the duty and responsibility of running that particular undertaking devolves on the board established under the legislation and, because the board comes up for review from time to time, the matter can then be discussed.  However, for many reasons that is unsatisfactory. Many of these boards are established for a particular period.  Once a board is established, short of an actual vote of censure being passed on the board or on the Minister who appoints them, nothing can be done.  I think that is the wrong procedure in any event.  In many cases nobody wants to remove the board, but we are entitled to an explanation and an indication why certain action is taken or why particular decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>There is also the other important consideration of the extent to which so many of these activities nowadays impinge on the interests of private citizens and on the business interests of individuals.  These are all matters that might well be the subject of consideration by a Committee appointed by the House.  I raise this matter now because I believe it is one that requires to be kept under constant review.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether the matter has recently been <Col N="126" /> the subject of any further consideration and, if so, what action is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to refer to is a matter I dealt with last year.  It is the extent to which the Minister's Department keeps under review the creditworthiness of certain financial institutions.  As I understand from his predecessor, this matter was the subject of some concern to the Department and an investigation or a check was kept on the activities of some of these bodies.  I do not know whether any development has taken place in respect of contemplated legislation.  If so, I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether such legislation is intended.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the actual extent of operations of new financial institutions here, some concern was expressed some time ago at the extent to which some of these bodies offered substantially more attractive interest rates than were generally available.  I have the impression that recently these offers are not quite as numerous as they were.  Nevertheless, some people of limited means and people without the resources which are available to others in getting an accurate picture of the activities of these bodies&mdash; indeed, people not in a position to check on the veracity or creditworthiness of these institutions&mdash;were induced to invest in them.  I believe there is an obligation on the Department of Finance and on the State to ensure that if persons hold themselves out as offering excessively attractive terms to small investors, a check should be kept on their activities to ensure that people are not misled by these claims.  Some action should be available to ensure that where such terms are offered, or where suggestions are made that a particular institution can grant more attractive terms or inducements to investors, the creditworthiness of these institutions is assured.</P>
    <P>The matter was, I understand, the subject of some consideration by the Department of Finance.  As far as I am aware, it was intended at some stage, possibly in connection with other aspects of banking matters, to introduce <Col N="127" /> legislation on it.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether any developments have occurred in that regard and if such legislation is proposed.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a question in connection with the Minister's responsibility in respect of employees of his Department and employees of other State Departments. We have a peculiar set of values in this country.  At present when local authorities, even a county council, employ staff, they have an arrangement that after 12 months these people go on the regular roll of employment and can qualify for sick pay and, subject to certain qualifications, for superannuation and retirement allowances in due course.  In general employment, such fringe benefits are also provided by what we term good employers&mdash;those with at least some regard for the people they employ beyond paying them the rates of wages negotiated by their trade unions.  Quite a large number of firms recognise that it is not sufficient to pay wages alone but also make provision for fringe benefits, particularly the benefit of sick pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To follow up what the Leader of the Opposition has to say on the subject of semi-State bodies, I must say that I could never make out what the great difficulty was about this, though I admit, as he says, that it was discussed in the Governments of which he and I were members.  I could never make out why we could not appoint a committee of this House, separate and distinct from the Committee of Public Accounts, to take the place of shareholders at the annual general meeting. I think that what is wrong at present <Col N="130" /> is that, where you have a semi-State corporation, the auditors have no body of shareholders to whom to report.  As I understand company law, the auditors are the servants of the shareholders. The function of the auditors is to inform the shareholders&mdash;not the directors&mdash;of their findings as to the administration and general progress of the concern they are commissioned to audit.  At present, the only person to whom the auditors can address themselves is the Minister for Finance who is usually the principal shareholder. Usually, a representative of the Minister for Finance attends a meeting and speaks on his behalf.  I believe the Oireachtas, particularly the Dáil which votes the money, could appropriately be represented there without any embarrassment to the board of directors.</P>
    <P>Any ordinary company operating in this country has to hold an annual general meeting at which any shareholder may turn up.  It is notorious in the city of London that there are certain public nuisances who go around from meeting to meeting and kick up a row but directors accept that as part of the burden of being a director of a large company.  They frequently make a jovial reference to &ldquo;the lady in the green hat&rdquo; or &ldquo;the man with the red whiskers&rdquo; who is well known to attend every company meeting in London. They may have one share in ICI, one share in Vickers, one share in various companies, but such persons make a business of these attendances.</P>
    <P>The burden involved on the directors of a semi-State company would be that they would meet a presumably responsible body of Deputies who would be there at the annual general meeting in the capacity of representative shareholders. One of the favourite arguments against this procedure is that if you expose directors of semi-State bodies to any degree of inquisition at all, you will not get the best man to take the job.  I am not so sure that the directors of semi-State bodies are such pure patriots that they are all acting on them for the love of Cathleen Ní Houlihán.  I see a good many directors willing to take jobs on semi-State bodies.  I do not think it would be any <Col N="131" /> burden on them to ask them to discharge the same responsibility as the director of any commercial enterprise would be expected to discharge.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister one solution to the problem which affects not only the Government of this country but the Government of Great Britain, and that is to take the bull by the horns and simply to say, in effect: &ldquo;These companies were set up to function more or less on the lines of public companies, free from day-to-day supervision by Dáil Éireann.  However, if they are to have all the prerogatives of an ordinary public company, then they should have the liabilities as well and one of these is an annual general meeting of their shareholders who, in the case of a semi-State corporation, shall be a committee appointed by Dáil Éireann to discharge the function of shareholders.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The all-important thing is that on that decision being taken by Dáil Éireann, the auditors to that company will become the servants of those shareholders. It will be the duty of the auditors as members of their professional organisation to direct the attention of the chairman and shareholders to any matter which requires review or examination at the annual general meeting.  I take it the intentions of the members of the Committee will be to ask the board at the annual general meeting the appropriate questions and in due course furnish a report which will lie on the Table of this House, and indicate whether there is anything untoward to which the attention of the House should be directed or whether they are satisfied with the report of the chairman and directors as submitted at the annual general meeting.  In the ordinary circumstances, that report would simply lie on the Table of the House and there would be no further comment on it.  It would, however, be open to any Deputy to ask that the report be considered or rejected by the House, and if there was any statement in the report of an adverse or critical character, it would be up to the House to discuss it and <Col N="132" /> up to the Minister to explain to the House why he proposed to leave the company as it was then constituted. I suggest to the Minister that that is a matter which he might consider.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has mentioned that previous Ministers for Finance considered adopting some system of protecting people from taking advantage of rates of interest offered by companies of doubtful solvency.  People are entitled to make their own bargains.  Somebody may want to go out and invest money at 15 per cent in a tin mine on Muckish Mountain. We may all rush to save his money for him, only to find out that the whole of Muckish Mountain is solid tin.</P>
    <P>I remember a stockbroker saying to me in connection with a certain enterprise inaugurated in this country that he persuaded some of his clients not to touch it with a 40-foot pole.  He was feeling rather sorry when he told me this because since he gave that advice, the value of the investment had increased twentyfold.  He still thought that the enterprise was fundamentally unsound but that it was very difficult to explain to his clients, who could now sell an investment of £100 for £2,000, that his advice was good. We ought to walk warily in the matter of restricting people in making improper investments.  Some will do it, but some of them will make investments which appear to us to be highly improper but which will turn them into millionaires while we are still ploughing our lonely furrows on a modest income.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that offering the assistance of insurance similar to that which was provided by President Roosevelt through the Federal Reserve System in America in the great crash of 1929 is worth considering. He used the small local banks which were a very prominent feature of American rural life.  A lot of people lost their life savings when these banks closed during the 1929-31 financial crisis of the United States.  The new system of the Federal Reserve insurance system left it open to all financial institutions who wished to do so to insure their deposits with the Federal <Col N="133" /> Reserve, up to a limit of something like £1,000.</P>
    <P>If we are concerned to protect the small investor, the unsophisticated investor, it would not be a bad thing to provide a system of Central Bank insurance which would be available to any financial institution which wanted to set up.  Then you could serve notice on unsophisticated investors: &ldquo;If you want to lend your money at an attractive rate of interest, you could inquire whether your deposit will be insured under the Central Bank insurance scheme.&rdquo;  If it were, well and good, but if it were not, you would have notice that &ldquo;you are putting your money into a place which has attendant on it a risk which would appear to be inappropriate to a person in your financial circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not understand, Sir, and perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to explain, the note on page 12 of the Book of Estimates which sets out that the sum under Subhead J relating to the Economic Research Institute is transferred from Subhead C which is that for travel and incidental expenses. The transfer amounts to no less a sum than £17,500 in last year's account. The corresponding appropriation for this year is £1,500.  Probably this is a purely technical provision which I do not understand.  I should be obliged to the Minister if he can explain it to me.  I cannot find in the note any readily understandable explanation of this account.  I take it the Economic Research Institute referred to is the Institute in Baggot Street, which heretofore has been functioning largely under a grant from the Ford Foundation. Perhaps the Minister will tell us today whether that draft is to be renewed from the Ford Foundation and, if not, what his intentions are in regard to the future administrative expenses of the institute in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments with regard to the question of semi-State bodies.  We have been very lucky in this country in that semi-State bodies have been well run up to a point.  They have been run honestly, at least, but if there were a big scandal at any time in the functioning <Col N="134" /> of a semi-State bady, no doubt we would call for an investigation.  It would be a very sound idea if arrangements could be made to have the activities of the semi-State bodies investigated in the way suggested.  People who run the semi-State bodies would welcome this so that the general public, as well as we, will know that everything is above board.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to challenge your ruling, Sir, with regard to Deputy Larkin's comments.  I should, however, like to make one statement.  Last February 12 months a Department of State agreed with my trade union that the sick pay scheme would be recommended to the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance have not so far made a decision on the application. This proves that to a certain extent the Department of Finance have a responsibility.  In respect of this matter, which should be touched on here, because it cannot be dealt with anywhere else, but, on the Estimate, I was told that nothing could be done about it, that it is purely a matter for Finance.  That being so, the Department of Finance must face up to their responsibility and say why they have not dealt with this matter.  When these people were considering a pension scheme, the same applied.  They told us that Finance are responsible for this matter and that nothing can be done about it unless the Department of Finance agree.  Therefore, the Minister must examine that particular aspect and let us know what exactly it is proposed to do in these cases.</P>
      <P>On last year's Estimate, I raised a question with the Minister's predecessor, with the former Taoiseach and with the Department of Labour, and I am now repeating the question to the Minister.  It is the question of having some type of conciliation machinery for State employees.  This is a matter which is dependent on the goodwill of the Department of Finance. If the Department of Finance are prepared to have it set up then it will be set up but if the Department of Finance are not so prepared then the machinery cannot be established.</P>

    <P>There seems to be something <Col N="135" /> basically wrong with a situation which allows a system of arbitration and conciliation to operate in respect of every State employee except those at the bottom of the ladder.  I would ask the Minister who has just taken over as Minister for Finance to see to it that, without further delay, there will be extended to those at the bottom of the ladder the type of conciliation machinery which is applicable in outside employment and for State employees above the rank of ordinary labourer.  Machinery should be set up for the purpose of allowing State employees some right of appeal against the arbitrary decision of a State officer.</P>
    <P>I referred to another matter in detail last year and do not propose to do so now except to say that a few weeks ago the former Taoiseach agreed with me that we have reached the stage when something would have to be done to remedy the situation wherein, when trade unions go to negotiate with the State, the officer representing the Department, whether it is the Department of Finance or any other Department, may say: &ldquo;This is what we are offering and this is what we have cleared with the Department of Finance.  Take it or leave it.&rdquo;  They did not use those words but that is what they mean.  When we realise that that applies only to those at the bottom of the ladder, it must be appreciated that that attitude should be changed.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to see to it, as his first act in the Department of Finance, that conciliation machinery be set up without further delay for these employees because all sorts of unrest that has occurred in State employment can be dealt with only in this way.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that we are not saying this for the purpose of raising a hare.  We are saying it because we know that it is not just to allow the position to continue as it is.  It is no answer to say that there has not been any big strike because of the lack of this machinery.  The Minister knows why there has not been such a strike.  You can bring the pitcher to the well so often that eventually it gets <Col N="136" /> broken.  Before the pitcher gets broken, perhaps the Minister would take a hand in the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and others raised the question of some form of control over State boards and companies.  I think I will confine myself at this stage to saying that this is a very complex problem and the next motion which is to be taken in Private Members' Time is a motion in the names of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dockrell which is concerned with this very matter.  I hope to avail of that occasion to outline the policy of the Government in regard to this aspect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the supervision or control of financial institutions the position is that legislation to govern the licensing of banking institutions is in contemplation and in preparing that legislation we will certainly consider how wide the licensing net should be spread.  I think I can say no more about the control or supervision of financial institutions other than banking institutions than that we are keeping the situation under review but that it does not at this point of time appear that there is any urgent need for action.  Of course, Deputies will realise that all these institutions are subject to the normal provisions of the Companies Acts with regard to audit and so on.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Tully's point about staff matters, relations and negotiations, I shall consider what he said and see what can be done to improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the Economic and Social Research Institute is dealt with in a Supplementary Estimate.  The explanation is that in the beginning we paid only the rent of the accommodation for this Institute and it was principally financed by a grant from the Ford Foundation.  The situation developed, however, that the Institute began to incur other expenditure <Col N="137" /> and had to rely on bank overdrafts for this.  When we came to clear off these bank overdrafts on behalf of the Institute it was necessary to create a new subhead.  It was in order from the accountancy point of view when there was only about £1,500 involved in respect of rent and accommodation leased to the Institute by the Office of Public Works to include that under the existing subheads.  When the amount became substantial, and was provided for by way of grant-in-aid, it was necessary to create a new subhead for it.  I understand that the position with regard to the grant is that an application is being made by the Institute for renewal.  That application is still under consideration by the Foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by this. It is a most unusual procedure here. We have transferred for the purpose of comparison the figures for 1965-66 from a subhead described as &ldquo;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&rdquo; the sum of £17,500 to match an appropriation this year of £1,500 in a new subhead. J is the new subhead.  Yet, we have transferred to the new subhead this year, from the old subhead C, £17,500 for the purpose of comparison.  I do not understand what that procedure is.</P>
      <P>I think the Economic and Social Research Institute is a most valuable body.  I gather that the Minister is not in a position to say at this stage whether the Ford Foundation grant is to be renewed or not.  May I be reassured that if the Ford Foundation grant is not renewed the money can be found to enable the Institute to carry on its very valuable work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of this Supplementary Estimate of £58,000 is to ensure that it does carry on its work.  The position, as I have said, is that this Institute made an application for renewal of grant from the Ford Foundation.  Pending a decision on that application it was decided that the simplest way of enabling the Institute to carry on its activities was to do so by way of overdraft.  When the decision was still not forthcoming, £17,500 was used to clear an existing overdraft and then <Col N="138" /> the Institute incurred a further overdraft. We have now decided to introduce this Supplementary Estimate to clear away this further overdraft and to provide funds for the Institute to carry on until March, 1967.  One way or another, there is no question whatever that this very valuable body will continue its activities.  In fact, Deputies should know that recently the scope of its activities has been extended and its name changed to cover its new range of activities.  We have changed its name from the Economic Research Institute to the Economic and Social Research Institute and this change of name heralds a considerable extension in the activities of the Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Supplementary Estimate, the Minister has referred to the fact that for the first time the Economic Research Institute appears as the Economic and Social Research Institute.  He has not given us very much particulars about it except to say that its functions will be very widely expanded.  I could understand the functions of an Economic Research Institute.  Doubtless the Minister read its publications with the same interest as I read them.  The majority of them were of intense interest to anybody concerned with public finance but there was a small minority of them which soared into abstract realms of pure mathematics which meant absolutely nothing to me.  In fact, I had occasion to make representations to the Director that some of these publications were reaching such lofty realms of abstraction that I could not conceive whom they were addressed to if they were not <Col N="139" /> addressed to the people in the Institute themselves.</P>
      <P>Are we well advised, I wonder, in expanding the functions of this Economic Research Institute, the scope of whose functions one could define with reasonable precision, into an Economic and Social Research Institute?  I am wholly unable to discern any limit to the scope which one might ascribe to a social research institute.  Is there any limit intended?  Is there any subject which could come from consideration by this House or by any other deliberative assembly in the country which might not be properly ascribed as a matter of social research?  If we turn what has been a highly specialised Institute into a kind of an assembly of inquisition over the whole surface of society in Ireland, are we not going so to dissipate its exertions and its direction as to put it in danger of becoming futile?</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in its last report the Director had it to tell that one of his great difficulties was to get trained staff.  He specially complained of the fact that such trained staff as he had been able to get were almost all from abroad because they could not be found in our schools.  Now, are we going to add to this already overburdened Institute the whole scope of social environment and are we ultimately going to end up with a whole lot of benevolent do-gooders sitting in Baggot Street reviewing problems of the blind, problems of the destitute, problems of the aged and lonely, the 101 social problems that one could enumerate without even a moment's reflection?  If we are, I think we will overburden the Institute and spoil the highly specified job it had undertaken to do and we will so mix up the expert information on which the Institute depends for its conclusions that we will begin to doubt the value or precision of the published reports which heretofore had been such models of expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody need have any fears on this particular matter.  I believe this extension of activity is entirely commendable. I had hoped it was a <Col N="140" /> development which would commend itself to every Deputy in the House. The Government decided in 1965 that there was a necessity for a comprehensive programme of social development in the widest sense, similar or related to the economic development programme.  Accordingly we accepted a recommendation which was made to us by a very distinguished adviser from the United States that the Economic Research Institute should be expanded and become an Economic and Social Research Institute with a surveying research unit attached to it.  I think it is a logical development and extension of economic programming that you have side by side with it a comprehensive programme of social development.  A social research programme was drawn up and the Institute then changed its title and amended its Articles of Association.  It is not envisaged that there will be any significant increase in the Institute's volume of economic research at present, at any rate, or in the foreseeable future but we hope that the Institute will, side by side with its existing economic activities which will certainly not be contracted, bring into operation five or six substantial social research projects.  These have been sketched in outline and it is hoped that we will have two of them under way early in 1967.</P>
      <P>I know there is difficulty today in getting competent research workers in practically every field.  I know the difficulties which the Institute have experienced in this regard on the economic side but we hope that because of the development of the social science faculty at University College, Dublin, there would be a supply of suitable workers forthcoming in the future for this new aspect of the Institute's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to deprecate the practice, which is only too common in this country as in many other countries, of visiting all our indignation on the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners carry out the law.  We make the law; the Revenue Commissioners implement it.  Often, when I hear of the intolerable oppressions of the Revenue Commissioners, I am concerned to point out that the Revenue Commissioners are the most reasonable of all people provided you can persuade them you are not trying to put your finger in their eye.  I always remember a distinguished old friend of mine coming into my office when I was Minister for Agriculture and saying: &ldquo;Now, Mr. Dillon, I am quite prepared to deal with you on the basis of catch-as-catch-can or on the basis of cards on the table&rdquo; and, knowing the reputation of the man, I said: &ldquo;Cards on the table, if you please,&rdquo; and we never had a cross word afterwards.  If you deal with the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of cards on the table, they are glad and willing not only to concede all that you are entitled to but to exert themselves to ensure that an ordinary citizen will get his full rights.  But, if you start on the basis of trying to put your finger in their eyes, they take very good care that you will not get your finger into their eyes and you will probably hurt your finger in the attempt to insert it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one fault I have <Col N="142" /> to find with the Revenue Commissioners. It is a fault that calls for correction. The first person a tourist meets coming into this country is the preventive officer of the Revenue Commissioners at the point of entry.  I have come in through Dún Laoghaire and through Dublin Airport and I have a pretty wide experience of preventive officers.  Most of them, when they know you, naturally exert themselves to ease your entry but I met one, God bless him, who did not know me and the chief preventive officer seemed to find fault with him for not recognising me. I said: &ldquo;Stand back and let me thank God that at least we have one man in the country who does not know me.&rdquo; It is a most refreshing thing to meet a fellow who did not know who I was and let him open my bags and dance a can-can if he liked.  It is a joy to find he does not know me.</P>
    <P>Here is the problem.  Watching preventive officers operating, I know that 99 per cent of them can do their job and at the same time, maintain an air of geniality, but the ladies, whether it is they think we think them too feminine or that we would attempt our masculine wiles upon them, advance upon you with the visage of a Gorgon. When I was a young man, more years ago than I care to remember, I went to study business in London and I remember being instructed before going behind the counter in the retail distributive business, and that instruction was largely devoted to training one to be agreeable to the customers. You were told you would meet some very cantankerous, difficult customers, and you were exhorted to remember: &ldquo;We depend for our living on these people and, even though they are cantankerous and cross and difficult, and even if they are dishonest, we will watch them, and we will see they do not get away with anything, but their cash is as good as anybody else's and we live by bringing them back.&rdquo;  We live here on the business of bringing tourists back.</P>
    <P>I must admit I am a pretty formidable tourist myself when I arrive, but some of the Gorgons I meet are infinitely more formidable.  So far as I <Col N="143" /> know, these girls are nice, friendly girls, if only one got to know them, but they would frighten the life out of you and, if you bid them the time of day, they nearly hit you.  I have no specific complaint to make.  I have never seen them exceed their duty. But there are two ways of doing one's duty, a pleasant way and a disagreeable way.  I am not asking these ladies, who have a very difficult job to do, to mitigate the rigour of their inspection, but one can search a man's or a woman's baggage as exhaustively as one thinks it one's duty to do agreeably as well as disagreeably.  One can bid a person &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; or say it is a wet day, or a cold day, or a hot day, and put the person at his ease. I have seen unfortunate women and unfortunate men, arriving at Dublin Airport, thrown into a state of confusion and alarm and it is the lady members of the preventive staff who are the worst offenders in this respect.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that these ladies, whom I have no doubt are a most excellent body of public servants, should be given a period of training similar to that which I had when I was starting my career in the retail distributive trade, training in being agreeable, no matter what problem the tourist presents.  I am fully aware of the fact that some of the travellers try to deceive the preventive officers.  It is the job of the preventive officers to detect that and control it, within reason. Above all, they should present an exterior which will make people visiting the country feel welcome and not have them arriving at their hotels all hot and bothered and distressed.  It is important to remember that 99 per cent of the people coming in pass through the customs without a ripple but if one person feels he has been unnecessarily and unjustly affronted that story will be told and retold wherever that person goes.  But the people who are accommodated and assisted will never bother to mention the fact that they were agreeably received.  I mention this in the House simply because I feel it is a matter which requires serious attention&mdash;and that attention is overdue. <Col N="144" /> Has the Minister ever heard of this complaint before?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in relation to the Local Appointments Commission, is he satisfied with the method of dealing with vacancies in the authority service?  Is he satisfied that the Local Appointments Commission act sufficiently expeditiously? There are occasions when vacancies in the local authority service are notified and there appears to be an extraordinary delay before the Commission arrange for going through the procedure of advertising the vacancies, <Col N="145" /> interviewing the candidates and making recommendations.  I wonder would the Minister have this matter examined in respect of circumstances where the continuing vacancy in a position can create a certain amount of dissatisfaction and delay in local authorities having their various schemes handled properly?</P>
      <P>For instance, there was an appointment notified some time ago by Dublin Corporation to the position of Deputy City Architect.  It was a considerable time ago and I do not know, as yet&mdash; we have not been notified&mdash;what is the position.  Certainly there appears to have been some delay in dealing with the matter and, at this stage, we have not yet been advised as to whether the interview has been held or any recommendation made.  I do not know whether this arises because the machinery itself is slow, too deliberate, whether there are some shortages of staff or something else, or whether it arises as a result of a deliberate policy. Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not myself, nor am I aware that my predecessor in office received any particular or general complaint about this matter; but I am aware, from the point of view of members of local authorities, that from time to time there would seem to be considerable delays in the filling of appointments.  I am quite certain part of that delay is probably unavoidable for a variety of reasons, but this is something to which I think we might turn our attention and see whether it would be possible to expedite the filling of vacancies by local authorities, as it is a source of worry, I am sure, to members of local authorities when posts are left vacant for fairly long periods of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, in this connection, we should keep in mind the necessity for economy.  I could well understand the proper administration of either of the two Commissions would dictate that they should arrange, as it were, a composite competition and not just advertise for every single vacancy that arises.  It might be a matter of good administration to wait, perhaps, until five, six or seven appointments had <Col N="146" /> accumulated before proceeding to fill them.  However, I think it is something which might be looked into.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,980,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, and sundry other Statutes; Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors; Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries; etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise certain matters which were raised on this Estimate previously.  The question of superannuation and retired allowances has recently been considered here in connection with a motion.  The Minister for Finance has special responsibility in regard to this, and generally the question of pensions and retired allowances is dealt with at Budget time by means of a Pensions (Increase) Bill or an award in respect of certain social welfare recipients, where increases are granted.  Invariably, these increases are on a percentage basis and, while that particular method of dealing with the matter may seem as fair and reasonable as any other, there is a special case for consideration in respect of retired State personnel who have retired for some years and who find that their pensions fall substantially behind the <Col N="147" /> pensions payable to their successors&mdash; who have filled the same positions but merely retired at a later date&mdash;and, consequently upon wage and salary adjustments, find that although they filled exactly the same position as a person who retired some months or, the case may be, years earlier&mdash;because of their later date of retirement&mdash;the pension is much higher.  That particular type of case has resulted in respect of those who retired earlier.  Retired State pensioners, who have retired for some time from the Army, the Garda or the Civil Service, find that their position is substantially worse than that of their successors who retired at a later date.</P>
      <P>In common with other Deputies I have repeatedly expressed the view that the old method of awarding pensions based on the salary or wage on retirement may have been satisfactory enough when the value of money was relatively constant and fluctuations in the cost of living were infrequent.  That situation no longer obtains.  The position for many pensioners now is that the longer a person is retired the worse his or her position is compared with that of their successors who retired at a later date.  While the method of granting pension increases on a percentage basis may appear to be reasonable enough, in fact some graded system and some more equitable system should be considered.</P>
      <P>This question was considered some time ago by the inter-departmental Committee and a recommendation was made in that report, that pension increases should operate on some form of automatic adjustment procedure, comparable with that which operates in respect of serving personnel in regard to wage and salary matters.  This question has been considered in other countries, of course, and varying methods and different approaches have been operated in respect to it.  However, I think there is a tendency in a number of countries in recent times to deal with the circumstances of State pensioners in what can be regarded only as a more reasonable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hardship involved for many of those people is quite considerable. <Col N="148" /> Some of them may be fortunate enough to have relatives on whom they can depend for some assistance.  That imposes a burden on the relatives but, over and above that, many of them have no sons or daughters or other persons on whom they can depend because they have commitments of their own which make it quite impossible for them, and far beyond their resources, to make any contribution towards their retired parent or parents.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the very serious problem which the rise in the cost of living has created for many categories of pensioners.  The Minister should examine this question as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which applies in a few cases.  Despite the terms of the legislation which was passed, it is a fact that certain State pensioners still find that their pensions are abated.  It was understood here when that amending legislation was brought in, that it would cover State pensioners who were so affected.  Either because of a deliberate decision&mdash;and the numbers involved would hardly make it worthwhile&mdash;or because the pension schemes were so framed that certain people were still caught, some pension schemes were not amended to comply with the terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>This question affects certain individual Ministers, and particularly categories of pensioners under their responsibility.  In the main, the reason put forward by these Ministers and Departments is that any amendment of the scheme which would relieve the abatement provision would have to have the assent of the Minister for Finance.  This applies in the main to ex-Army personnel.  There may be certain ex-Garda and other people who are affected also, but the cases which were brought to my attention apply to ex-Army personnel.  I should like the Minister to examine these cases to see if the schemes can be altered.  It does not seem that a great deal is involved, but to the individuals concerned, it is a matter of some significance.</P>

      <P>In this Vote, there is a heading: &ldquo;E.&mdash;Gratuities in respect <Col N="149" /> of Unestablished Officers and other Non-Pensionable Persons.&rdquo;  There are two aspects of this matter.  From time to time there appears to be some delay in granting to people their entitlement under this system of gratuities.  There have been cases where weeks have elapsed before these people receive the payment of this gratuity which is based on a week's wages for one year's service. This has led to hardship for these people.  You may find a person in this category who has given 15 or 20 years service.  After this long time, he is retired because of old age or illness and his entitlement in present circumstances is only a lump sum or gratuity.  A person with 25 years service gets 25 weeks wages, less than a half year's pay. Apart from the inadequacy of such provision, further payments are delayed for a period.  I am taking advantage of this Estimate to draw the Minister's attention to the inequalities here.</P>
      <P>There are hundreds of people who have given conscientious service to the State.  Many of them have not only given the State conscientious service but gave service in other fields as well, yet they are treated by the Oireachtas as second-class citizens.  It is a poor reflection on Dáil Éireann that a man or woman who has given excellent service for years should in illness or old age be compelled to accept a payment based on his or her years of service.  Far from getting a golden handshake, such people get only what might more aptly be described as a copper handshake.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the point made by Deputy Cosgrave in relation to pensioners who, after years of service, are drawing pensions the value of which from the point of view of their maintenance has been depreciated rapidly by the steady growth in the cost of living.  Very little effort has been made to keep the cost of living down and consequently even those in receipt of pensions which might not be considered unreal or unreasonable find after a short term of years that the value of their pensions has depreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same conditions may not apply <Col N="150" /> to those in employment because they at least have an opportunity through collective effort, whether in industry or through conciliation and arbitration machinery in the public service, to restore the balance and to repair the damage caused by the increasing cost of living.  Pensioners, on the other hand, have to rely on decisions of the House to adjust their pensions from time to time.  In this context I shall mention 1964 when negotiations took place on a broad basis for wage and salary adjustments.  One aspect of the negotiations typifies the type of problem pensioners may suffer from today. At that time a considerable number of workers throughout the country were being paid less than £10 a week and agreement was sought and secured to the effect that the minimum increase to be given would be £1 a week. Consequently, the problem of workers with less than £10 a week was better than a 10 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In relation to pensions, we should consider applying a similar system of adjustments.  Straight percentages work unfairly in relation to those with lower pensions.  I again urge on the Minister to give further consideration to the thousands of people who have given excellent service in public employment and who receive only a gratuity in respect of services given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have had this matter before the House quite recently in Private Members' Time, I do not think the House would expect me to say a great deal about it at this stage. However, I would just like to say that I do not agree that it would be either possible or desirable to have any pension increase on any other basis than one that would apply equally to all pensions.  I do not think it would be possible at all to make special provision for separate classes of pensioners. I suppose every Deputy and every Minister for Finance, with possibly one or two exceptions, would have a very genuine sympathy for pensioners, as indeed also every Deputy would have for all the poorer and weaker sections of the community generally.  It is simply a question of what we can afford and the priorities we decide on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the war, pensions here have <Col N="151" /> been increased on eight occasions and that compares very favourably with most other countries.  The situation now is that anybody who retired after the eighth round, that was in November, gets a pension determined on the basis of the 1961 level, plus nine per cent.  Anybody who retired before the eighth round gets a pension determined on the basis of the 1959 level plus 14½ per cent.  In a small number of cases, those who retired between 1959 and 1961 get whichever is the more favourable of 14½ per cent on equivalent 1959 pension or nine per cent on actual pension on retirement.  It is calculated that this compensates in full for any increases which have taken place in the cost of living up to around 1964.  I do not want to suggest to the House that that is generous or munificent but it represents a reasonable attempt to do justice to these pensioners. I can only come back again to what I said at the beginning, that it is purely a question of resources, what we can afford and how we distribute the resources available to us amongst the sections of the community that deserve them most.</P>

The last comprehensive index of the Dáil Reports covers the period up to 1948. Since then, so far as I know, no comprehensive index has been prepared. This matter has been raised on several occasions.  It has been said before that the reason why the index has not been brought up to date is shortage of staff.

      <P>The Minister will appreciate the last index covered a period of ten years.  At this stage we are not far short of 20 years and, therefore, it will become necessary to publish two volumes.  Would the Minister consider whether it would be possible to have one made available for ten years up to 1958 and that the second one covering the period from 1958 to 1968 should be postponed until 1968?  This is a matter for consideration.  I would suggest to the Minister if it goes on indefinitely, this valuable record will become virtually impossible of compilation.  I know references to such records are not very frequent but they constitute an important part of the institutions of the country.  This is the kind of thing which if it is not kept reasonably up to date becomes almost impossible of compilation.  I would suggest that the Minister consider one for ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I can indict the Minister for Finance in this matter.  We are conducting an ordnance survey on a peripatetic basis exclusively.  I believe we are the only country in the world outside the underdeveloped countries in which that is being done.  I believe that even in many of the undeveloped countries an aerial survey has been initiated by the various powers which used to administer these areas.  I have noticed in the discussions of Estimates and Bills by a variety of Ministers, declarations of intent by several Ministers to conduct limited aerial surveys for the specific purpose in which their Departments are primarily interested.  If the Ordnance Survey would co-ordinate all these individual ministerial interests and determine to conduct a comprehensive aerial survey themselves, money could be saved.  What is infinitely more <Col N="155" /> important, however, is that the aerial survey could be conducted in the appropriate season and carried out at the appropriate angle for the purpose for which it is required and in the weather conditions which would make the survey most valuable.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily it might appear that the appropriate time to make an aerial survey would be in the summer or spring but oddly enough, apparently the very reverse is true.  The appropriate time to make an aerial survey is when trees are substantially defoliated which means it has to be done in the late autumn, the winter or early spring. Secondly, an aerial survey done without the presence of sunlight loses a great part of its value on account of the absence of adequate shadow. Thirdly, an aerial survey done from straight down from the observing aircraft loses a great part of its value because it does not reveal the impact of shadow.  It must be done at a proper angle.  Deputies will have seen recently the lunar photographs brought back from the television apparatus on the lunar probes made by the United States of America and the discovery of shadows cast by some of the protuberance observed on the moon has resulted in very interesting speculation as to the nature of the objects observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am primarily interested in this from the point of view of its archaeological implications.  I am sorry to say that in this House I have been a voice crying in the wilderness.  We are sitting in Ireland on the greatest archaeological treasure house in the world.  That seems to be an anachronistic thing to say when we think of Egypt, Greece and Asia Minor and the traditional locations which are thought to have been the greatest mines of archaeological remains.  This island, however, had the unique experience of never having been reached by the Romans and the result is that we have historical remains scattered all over the country unaffected by the impact of 400 years of Roman civilisation, such as the impact on Great Britain and the rest of Europe, most of Asia Minor and a considerable part of Africa as well.  The tragic fact <Col N="156" /> is that while I have been speaking on this subject today, some of these inestimable treasures have probably disappeared.  There is not a single year that passes that the normal agricultural operations in the preparation of the soil do not obliterate certain archaeological remains which we ought to be concerned to preserve and the tragedy is that it could all be preserved for posterity by an aerial survey.</P>
    <P>I should say that over 80 per cent of the archaeological monuments which an aerial survey would reveal would be fully identified and described by their appearance in the survey.  We do not need to excavate every ring fort in Ireland.  We do not need to excavate every archaeological trace that appears on the aerial survey map but there would be about 20 per cent which could be promptly marked and protected. The owner of the land could be notified: &ldquo;If your ordinary husbandry requirements interfere with this, will you notify the Museum so that the appropriate investigation can be made before you disturb this particular find? Just tell us and we will do all that is necessary&rdquo;.  Deputies will have read in the newspapers within the past month of some public-spirited farmer who was in the process of eliminating from his land one of the most important burial sites in the country but simply because he was a sophisticated person when he came upon what appeared to him to be an unnatural assembly, he called up the Garda who notified the Museum and the Museum sent along archaeologists and the necessary records were made and photographs taken.  However, five out of ten people encountering that obstruction would simply have swept it away and we would never have heard anything more about it.</P>
    <P>The tragic fact about all this business is that a great many people do not attach the slightest importance to it. There are very few Deputies from rural Ireland who have not themselves seen archaeological monuments actually disappearing in their lifetime.  I have seen a considerable part of the mediaeval finds at Lough Gara, where the Annals of the Four Masters were written, disappearing in my lifetime.  It is <Col N="157" /> now under the care of the Board of Works.  That did not take place until a good deal of it was gone.  The Board of Works have now taken over the Ormonde Castle in Carrick-on-Suir. People now realise what a precious mediaeval remains that is.  When I first saw that, it was in the process of being carted away, and if the Board of Works had not taken it in charge and restored it, it would now be gone.</P>
    <P>There are, however, thousands of prehistoric monuments which are there for everyone to see and which are being daily destroyed, and nobody is even aware of it.  I again draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the fact that there is evidence of this in the Department of Agriculture which came to us fortuitously.  I was trying to get an aerial survey as far back as 1950 and I was being blocked by the Department of Defence.  I was trying to demonstrate that the peripatetic survey, no matter how diligently carried out, was not adequate for the purpose of identifying archaeological remains.  I managed to get a limited aerial survey of Croghan in County Roscommon, the home of Ailill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All to one side, like the town of Croghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the town of Croghan.  It is the town of Kings where Ailill and Maeve lived.  It is the place whereon the Táin Bó Cuailgne started.  On the peripatetic survey, there were six or seven sites recognised; on the aerial survey, there were close to 50, the existence of which was then unknown.  That could be reproduced in nearly every archaeological area in Ireland and the astonishing thing is that there are archaeological remains in places that nobody has any notion of.  I remember in the course of my operations in relation to some drainage work down around Lough Gara the discovery of the crannogs in which Lough Gara happened to be peculiarly rich.  That was not directly related to the aerial survey but I could draw an analogy: an aerial survey would do for the whole country what that drainage <Col N="158" /> scheme did for Lough Gara.  It would throw up the archaeological remains which at this time are wholly unknown.  May I draw an analogy again in order to illustrate the catastrophies that can happen?  Before we could get there&mdash;and we lost no time &mdash;to have the crannogs of Lough Gara surveyed correctly, two youngsters went out in a boat to one of them and spent the day throwing every loose stone they could find into the lake. Practically everything they threw into the lake was a human artefact.  It was an evening's amusement for them to go out and make these things skim across the lake.  These human monuments are being destroyed every day and we have no record of them.</P>
      <P>If it is true, as I believe it to be, that restricted aerial surveys for a variety of purposes associated with the Department of Lands, the Forestry Division, and the Department of Local Government are at present being undertaken, could the Minister for Finance not undertake to co-ordinate them and add whatever sum is necessary to get the thing done completely?  Once done it need never be done again.  It is there for all time.</P>
      <P>I believe the Department of Defence will inform the Minister that for the ordinary purposes of training, pilots must be put in the air from time to time.  Surely right reason demands that, if they must be put in the air and must be kept flying to keep them efficient, to keep them accustomed to air operations, a scheme be devised whereby at least part of their work would involve flying in connection with these aerial surveys.  The Minister for Finance should insist on the Ordnance Survey retaining expert advice in the matter of archaeological surveys bearing in mind the question of season, weather and angle to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This thing once done would be a monument and a treasure forever.  It could have its repercussions.  There are a vast number of learned foundations in the United States of America some of which have already come here.  They are located all over Europe and Asia.  They engage in excavations <Col N="159" /> of a wide variety under benefactions provided by the universities, not only for the purpose of increasing the sum of human knowledge but for the purpose of giving their faculty and students an opportunity of carrying out archaeological work in the field.  I do not doubt that if such a survey as I have suggested were undertaken and could be made available to the learned institutes of the world, we would rapidly get applications from many universities for permission to conduct investigations for the purpose of recording these ancient monuments adequately and recovering from them whatever treasures they may contain.  From every point of view, this is an eminently desirable thing.  It puzzles me sometimes how it is that 20 years has elapsed since I first became Minister without my having succeeded in achieving this purpose.  I never give up hope, however.  It took me 20 years to shift the home for children on remand from Marlborough Street to more suitable premises.</P>

The President was one-time Minister for Education on an interim basis and I sent him on a pilgrimage down to Marlborough Street; he came back and told me that if he had been committed there himself, he would not have considered it such a bad place.  We fell out over it but ultimately my view prevailed. The Minister for Finance now claims credit for that.  He seems to think I have an edge on him.  I have no such thing.  My sole concern is to reform him.  The thing I have been urging for so long he glories in having done&mdash;more power to his elbow.  Here is something else to which he might turn his hand, but this time, I hope, with diligence and care.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>After the last war the Government determined to overtake the arrears of primary school building that had accumulated over half a century.  They set a target of 100 new schools a year as well as 20 to 40 major improvement schemes.  These numbers were not easily attainable.  An increasingly large number of new schools was erected each succeeding year until last year when the targets were well exceeded.  In that year 130 new schools were completed and major schemes of improvement were carried out at 66 schools. That gave a total of 196 modern buildings for the year.  To illustrate the significance of this achievement I may mention that taking some previous <Col N="162" /> years at random the number of new schools finished in 1956-57 was 64, in 1961-62 it was 81 and in 1964-65 it was 96.  Since 1st April, 1950 over 1,100 new schools were built.  That is nearly a quarter of the total number of primary schools in the State.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that the Government intends to replace a number of one- and two-room schools with larger central schools.  Apart from obvious educational advantages these central schools will have amenities which could not be provided in small schools.  A fitted kitchen will enable light meals to be prepared for the pupils.  A larger general purpose room will serve as a luncheon room.  It will be equipped for use also as a library, assembly hall and for general recreation purposes.  This will be a big improvement on existing conditions. Most of the old schools were draughty and badly lighted.  Many were inadequately heated, had no proper play space and only poor sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>Our primary schools provide for almost half a million pupils.  Last year 20,000 permanent pupil places were provided.  I have not the figures for earlier years, but in the five year period since the 1st April, 1961, 77,000 places have been provided. This means that nearly one sixth of the pupils were catered for in new buildings in the five year period.  I hope to have this satisfactory progress maintained.  There will naturally be a reduction in the number of new schools but not in the total accommodation we will provide.</P>
    <P>Urgent needs for schools have sometimes been met by pre-fabricated timber classrooms.  They can be delivered, assembled and erected in a few days and they give satisfactory accommodation. They are durable and can be transferred elsewhere when no longer needed.  Last year they were used to provide accommodation for 5,000 pupils in addition to the 20,000 permanent pupil places which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We spent from State funds £3,123,000 on primary school building last year.  The year before we <Col N="163" /> spent £2,929,000 and in 1963-64 £2,326,000.  The £2 million mark was never reached before 1963-64.  As Deputies will see from item No. 27 of the List of Works included in Subhead E, I am asking for £2,760,000 for schools for the current year.  This, despite the financial difficulties, is the third largest sum ever to be voted for the service in any year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to our other architectural activities.  Besides the sum of £2,760,000 for national schools, Subhead E provides for the erection and improvement of buildings for the Oireachtas and Government Departments and for development work at a number of harbours.  I shall refer specifically only to the more important of these works or to others in which Deputies may have a special interest.</P>
    <P>Last year a number of works of major importance was completed.  In Wexford we have new Government offices which provide accommodation for the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners as well as an automatic telephone exchange.  The Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square was officially opened on Easter Monday. The sculptural feature has still to be added.  This will not be completed for another three years or so.  A new Post Office and telephone exchange were erected at Youghal; four new customs posts were provided at Culloville and Inishammon, County Monaghan, Kilslean, County Donegal and Aghalane Bridge, County Cavan.  New buildings at Athenry and Clonakilty agricultural colleges and a veterinary field station at Abbotstown Farm were completed. The temporary car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire was ready in good time for the opening of the ferry service in July, 1965; this was an engineering work provided for under Subhead E.</P>
    <P>Work is going on well on the reconstruction of the drawingroom block at Dublin Castle.  Progress with the extension of the National Gallery is also satisfactory and the job should be finished by the summer of 1968.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> The work of extending and improving the accommodation at Leinster House is now in its final stages.  The five office floors in the new extension have been completed and occupied since June.  The new corridor linking the first floor of the extension with the landing outside the Dáil Chamber has now been completed.  Work on the new kitchens and restaurants is also nearing completion and arrangements are in hands for the supply of the necessary furniture and equipment.  We should be able to put the new restaurants into use after Christmas.</P>
    <P>A total of £215,000 is being provided for new Garda stations and houses for married members of the Force and for improvements at existing stations throughout the country. Information about new stations is given in the Appendix to the List of Works.</P>
    <P>I am asking for £313,500 for works for the Department of Agriculture.  A new radiography unit, an improved operating theatre and an extension of the main buildings to give additional teaching facilities are to be provided at the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge; various improvements are being carried out at Abbotstown Farm and at the three agricultural colleges, Athenry, Ballyhaise and Clonakilty.  The pig progeny testing station at the Munster Institute is now completed.  Provision is included for regional veterinary and dairy produce laboratories.  The veterinary laboratories will be at Cork, Limerick, Athlone and Sligo and the dairy produce laboratories at Cork and Limerick.  Work on the laboratory at Sligo is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The major fishery harbour schemes at Dunmore East, Killybegs and Castletownbere are developing more slowly than I would have wished.  As I mentioned last year, difficulties about the acquisition of sites at Dunmore East and Killybegs are delaying these schemes.  We have to ask for additional powers to enable us to deal with the difficulties.  Whilst the temporary car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire has worked well so far it is apparent that the increase in traffic will call for greater facilities than can be provided <Col N="165" /> at that site.  Work on a larger terminal has begun.  The major portion of the job is a new pier which is being built by contract.  We hope the entire work will be finished in 1968.</P>
    <P>A sum of £280,000 is provided for the works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs: £173,000 is needed for the new Central Sorting Office at Sheriff Street, Dublin and £70,000 for a new warehouse and other accommodation for the Post Office Stores at St. John's Road, Dublin.  The sorting office ought to be in operation early in 1967, and the St. John's Road premises soon afterwards.  The erection of a new post office and offices for other Government staffs in Carlow has begun.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage moneys are provided in the G group of subheads.  G.2, the cost of construction works, and G.4, the cost of maintaining completed schemes, are by far the most substantial of the group.</P>
    <P>The provision for G.2&mdash;Construction Works&mdash;is smaller than last year's but it will enable progress to be maintained on the three major schemes, the Inny, the Moy and the Deel, and on the one minor scheme, the Killimor, already in progress.  I hope to start before the end of the year on the scheme which has been designed for the Corrib-Headford portion of the Corrib.  This scheme will cost nearly a million pounds.  It will benefit about 14,000 acres of agricultural land and more than 5,000 acres of bog.</P>
    <P>Operations are continuing on the Shannon embankments and in the Swilly estuary.</P>
    <P>The intermediate river works already in hands will be completed, but I do not intend to divert funds and resources from works on catchments included in the published priority lists for the purpose of starting new schemes on embankments or intermediate rivers.  I know the need for drainage in the areas affected by the smaller rivers, but we can make the best use of the available funds, staff and machinery and more quickly resolve the national drainage problem by giving all our attention at present to the listed catchments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo;, for the completion of which provision is made, are the Brickey in County Waterford and the Abbey in County Donegal.  There will also be contract payments on schemes which were completed last year on the Duff in Counties Sligo and Leitrim and the Matt in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The maintenance provision under Subhead G.4 amounts to £150,000.  It will continue to increase each year as drainage schemes are completed and more and more of them come to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Eight major catchments are being surveyed or designed.  They are the Maigue, Boyne, Corrib-Mask, Erne, Suir, Mulkear, Boyle and Owenmore. Two minor catchments, the Bonet and Dunkellin, are at the same stage.</P>
    <P>I hope, within months, to have the design for the Maigue and the Boyne ready.  The design for the Erne will follow soon after.  If these schemes are found to be economic, the usual requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act, which include local exhibition and consideration of the observations of parties concerned, will have to be complied with before the schemes can be confirmed and works commenced. I expect work on the Maigue and the Boyne to start in 1968.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure, before the House in the autumn, 1965, indicated that adjustments in the capital programme would be necessary so that priority can be given to projects immediately productive. One project which has had to be postponed is the further investigation of the Shannon catchment and the preparation of an arterial drainage scheme.  When I referred to the Shannon survey programme last year, I intended that it should commence then.  Some staff was diverted to the Shannon from other projects, but change in financial circumstances made it impossible to continue.  The Shannon investigations will proceed as soon as funds are available.</P>
    <P>In October, 1965, I visited Belfast and had discussions with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of <Col N="167" /> Agriculture at Stormont about matters of mutual concern, mainly cross-Border drainage.  The meeting was followed by further discussions between civil servants.  As a result of these discussions, investigations of two joint projects have been commenced this year, namely, the drainage of the Kilcoo in Counties Leitrim and Fermanagh and of the Finn in Monaghan and Fermanagh.  A scheme for the catchment of the Burnfoot and Skeoge rivers, County Donegal, is in contemplation. It would have the incidental result of relieving conditions on the other side of the Border, around Derry city.</P>
    <P>The F Subheads provide for the cost of the upkeep of State premises and property.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.1 includes the maintenance of parks.  I should like to say a few words about the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, at Killarney.  I think much more can be done to develop further this national park and major tourist attraction.  The work of opening up views, providing car parks, replanting, and improving the rock gardens and pleasure grounds is going ahead, but there is need for better planning for development.  Some time ago I set up a committee representative of the various bodies interested in the park for the purpose of co-ordinating activities and helping in the formulation of a long-term development plan.  I have also arranged with An Foras Forbartha for the employment of a consultant to carry out a survey of the scenic, historic, scientific and tourist values of the Killarney Valley and particularly of the national park.  An interim report by the consultant has just been received and is being considered.  In this way, I hope to ensure that improvements within the park will be carried out in harmony with the general development of the Killarney area.</P>
    <P>A flock of black-faced mountain sheep has been kept in the park for many years and in 1954 facilities were given to An Foras Talúntais to carry <Col N="168" /> out research into the improvement of mountain sheep and hill grazing.  The programme turned out to be more extensive than had been expected originally.  On reviewing the detailed proposals, I decided that a national park was not an appropriate place for carrying through an agricultural research programme on the scale suggested. Also, it is highly desirable that the Commissioners of Public Works should have sole responsibility for agricultural activity in the park.  In addition, tourism is of prime importance in the Killarney area and wrong policy decisions in the national park could do much harm to the tourist industry.  I have, therefore, asked An Foras Talúntais to taper off their programme and they have agreed.</P>
    <P>Two species of deer live in the park, native red deer and Japanese sika.  The red deer are unique in the sense that they are generally recognised as being the only herd of this species in the country which is descended from indigenous wild stock.  Particular attention is being paid to the welfare of both species of deer in the park.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division of the Department of Lands are using portions of the park for afforestation purposes.  They have constructed a number of roads to give access to the forest areas.  These roads could not be used generally in the earlier stages of forest work, but the time has come to throw most of them open and give the public the opportunity of visiting the more remote parts of the Park.  The clearing and opening up of areas and the signposting of roads, walks, viewpoints, climbing routes, etc., will be continued.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the Phoenix Park here in Dublin.  The number of motorists going there on Sundays and during holidays is increasing year by year and something of a problem is arising.  Hundreds are parking and picknicking on the grass, despite warning notices.  At some places considerable damage has been done to the sward.  The Commissioners will try to meet requirements by providing car parks at suitable centres.</P>
    <P>The provision under subhead F.3 for <Col N="169" /> rents, rates, etc., on State occupied premises is £425,000, which is £85,000 greater than last year's figure.  The increase results from the need to lease accommodation in Dublin for the staffs of various Government Departments. Since 1922, many new services have been established by the Government and others have been greatly extended. Accommodation for these services has been inadequate.  Only a small number of purpose planned buildings has been provided.  The Office of Public Works has had to rent or buy old buildings, few of which were designed to be used as offices.  The supply of old buildings is, of course, limited and many of those which were acquired decades ago are no longer usable.  They do not conform to the statutory standards of office requirements and overcrowding of staffs is too common.</P>
    <P>Another undesirable feature is the dispersal of the staffs of single departments over several different buildings. Virtually every Department suffers from this handicap.  The staffs of two of the most important Departments, Finance and Agriculture, are scattered over no fewer than 16 different buildings throughout Dublin.  Anyone giving the matter a serious thought will realise that such a situation is bad from every point of view and that the sooner it is remedied the better.  Proper accommodation is an essential prerequisite of efficient administration.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two the Office of Public Works has rented space in a number of the modern office blocks recently erected in Dublin. They include the Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann building in Earlsfort Terrace, O'Connell Bridge House, the Rank Building in Hawkins Street, Liberty Hall and Ansley House in Mespil Road.  The average annual rent we have to pay for this space is about 17/4d per square foot.  In relation to current costs, this is at least as favourable as the rate paid by many business concerns in the city for similar facilities.</P>
    <P>The alternative to the renting of space in new buildings would be that the State would design and erect its own buildings.  While that would undoubtedly <Col N="170" /> be the ideal solution of our accommodation problem the amount of capital required to carry through such a programme would be enormous. In recent and present circumstances it could be made available only at the expense of vital services.  Clearly, then, the only practical solution to the problem, though not, as I have indicated, the ideal one, lies in the renting of space in modern office blocks constructed by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The provision of £5,000 in Subhead I is to meet the cost of maintenance of the coast protection works completed last year at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.  The Coast Protection Act, 1963, provides that maintenance will be carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works and the cost recovered from the county council.  We have received proposals for works under that Act for some forty areas. Preliminary examinations have been made in six cases and reports have been furnished to the county councils concerned.  In present financial circumstances it has been found necessary to defer further consideration of coast protection proposals in favour of more productive works.</P>
    <P>The provision for the National Monuments Service is the same as last year.  I should have liked this figure to be increased, but that cannot be done at present.  A good deal of useful work will be done for £60,000.</P>
    <P>The example given by the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and by Father Egan of Ballintubber has excited increasing interest in our monuments. One of the consequences of this is increasing pressure on the Commissioners to take further monuments into their charge.  There is little if any advantage in the acceptance of responsibility for any monument until maintenance and preservation works can be guaranteed.  Work on monuments calls for a high degree of skill and care and workmen and supervisors must be specially trained.  The number of these skilled and trained men available at present is very small.  Deputies know that a co-ordinating committee now exists on which the Departments and other bodies concerned with national <Col N="171" /> monuments are represented.  Urgent works to prevent deterioration will continue to be carried out by the Commissioners on their own initiative. I need hardly say that the Commissioners cannot spend money on any monument unless it is owned by the State or is in its guardianship.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been carried out in the precincts of the Pearse Cottage, Rosmuc, and the cottage has been refurnished as closely as possible to what it was in Pearse's day.  A scheme to improve the amenities is being worked out by An Bord Fáilte.  The restoration of Rothe House, undertaken by the National Monuments Branch for the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and Bord Fáilte has been completed: I must pay a tribute to the members of that Society not only for their initiative about Rothe House but also for their keen interest in monuments generally and their energy and devotion in carrying on the best traditions of the oldest archaeological society in the country.</P>
    <P>I must also pay a tribute to Father Egan, whose abilities have already been publicly acclaimed, and compliment him on his good taste and wonderful perseverance in seeing that the church at Ballintubber Abbey was restored.  The work was carried out by the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works on behalf of Father Egan, and at his expense.  The 750th anniversary of the foundation of the Abbey in 1216 was celebrated and 8th September, 1966.  The interior of the church was planned to conform with the new Liturgy and Mass was celebrated for the first time at the new High Altar in the presence of An tUachtarán and high dignitaries of Church and State.</P>
    <P>The ruins of the cloister and monastic buildings are in the guardianship of the Commissioners since 1962.  Repair and preservation works to these have been virtually completed.  Conservation work at Derrynane Abbey is progressing satisfactorily.  Conservation of a number of other monuments such as Kilcooly Abbey near Urlingford; Cahir Castle, County Tipperary; <Col N="172" /> Kells Priory, County Kilkenny; and Liscarroll Castle, County Cork is going ahead.</P>
    <P>Work has also begun in County Louth on the field stage of the archaeological survey of the country.  It is planned to make a detailed, systematic, county-by-county survey.  Aerial photography will play an important part in locating and identifying remains and the Air Corps is co-operating fully in this very important enterprise.</P>

      <P>In addition to the main Estimate for Employment and Emergency Schemes&mdash;Vote 9&mdash; amounting to £465,000 net, a Supplementary Estimate of £50,000 is being introduced to bring the net total of the Vote to £515,000.  Appropriations-in-aid, estimated at £42,000, will permit a gross expenditure of £557,000, a reduction of about £362,000 compared with the amount expended in 1965-66.</P>
      <P>The reduced provision was an unavoidable consequence of the financial stringency in the current year, and the necessity for making increased provision for services more essential to the development of the economy, including agriculture, education, health and social welfare.</P>
      <P>In deciding the amount of each Estimate for the current year, the Government were guided by three main principles: the limitation of the provision to the minimum amount required to cover the cost of committed expenditure; the reduction of expenditure where the consequences on economic development would be minimal; and the avoidance of commitments on new services involving substantial cost.  The reduced provision for Employment and Emergency Schemes reflects the application of these principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the gross sum of £557,000, the administrative subheads require £100,000.  A provision of £181,000, which includes the Supplementary Estimate of £50,000, is proposed for urban employment schemes; £250,000 for the rural improvements scheme; and <Col N="173" /> £15,000 for miscellaneous schemes, mainly minor marine works.  The provisions for rural employment schemes in the non-urbanised towns (Subhead E), for minor employment schemes (Subhead F), and for bog development schemes (Subhead G) have been limited to the amounts required to pay outstanding grants on works sanctioned in previous years, and no new grants are being allocated under these Subheads this year.</P>
    <P>The cost of salaries and wages, travelling expenses, and other administrative charges, if based on last year's establishment, would have exceeded £150,000.  The provision was reduced to £100,000 to accord with the reduced scale of operations in the current year. This entailed a reorganisation of the Office, in the course of which a total of 30 permanent staff, including nine engineers and two supervisors, have been transferred to other Departments.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £160,000 has been made for employment schemes grants in the urban areas, comprising the four County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and 55 other urban districts.  The local authorities concerned are contributing a further £31,870 towards the cost of these schemes, making a total of £191,870.</P>
    <P>Some 731 schemes amounting to £233,117 have been approved to date this year under the rural improvements scheme subhead, of which 554, amounting to £190,587, or 82 per cent are for road works and 177 amounting to £42,530 or 18 per cent are for drainage works.  As there is still a backlog of applications under this scheme, it has not yet been possible to resume the acceptance of new applications.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware that because of the reduced provision this year it was decided to make no new grants under the minor employment schemes or bog development schemes subheads, but instead to merge these schemes in the contributory rural improvements scheme.  The three schemes have always been complementary in the sense that they catered for the same types of work&mdash;accommodation and <Col N="174" /> bog roads and minor drainage.  The change was necessary to ensure that the available funds would be used to the best advantage, for the most needed works, and to reduce administrative costs.  To facilitate the transition to the combined scheme, applicants for grants in former minor employment and bog development schemes areas have been given the opportunity of making immediate applications under the rural improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the future arrangements for the administration of the various schemes financed from the employment and emergency schemes Vote have been under review for some time.  I regret that I am yet unable to announce the decision of the Government on this matter, but I can assure the House that it will not be long delayed.</P>
    <P>I now submit these two Estimates for the consideration of the House.  If any Deputy requires further information on any matter, I will do my best to satisfy him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The reduction which has been announced by the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of employment and emergency schemes, which are contained in the Estimates this year, is quite considerable.  In fact, that was the reason the motion to refer back the Vote, in the name of Deputy Harte, was put down; it was put down because of the concern we felt at the reduction in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The House is aware of the increase in the numbers of unemployed and of the need to provide schemes of value as well as schemes which will provide employment in rural and in urban areas.  The recent change in the manner of compiling persons on the unemployment register and the alteration in the method of calculating the numbers of unemployed, camouflages to some extent the real facts.  But, even allowing for the changes, it is obvious that there has this year been quite a noticeable increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary about the method it is proposed to adopt to initiate and undertake new schemes. As the situation has developed, a great many applicants have found, on making application to the Office of Public Works, that their applications could not be considered because of inability to provide sufficient funds to undertake this scheme.  One problem which has presented itself for many of these applicants is whether it will be necessary for them to re-apply or make fresh applications, or, alternatively, whether the mere fact that an application has been lodged will mean that when the employment and emergency schemes office is in a position to undertake fresh work, the Office of Public Works will reactivate these applications.  That is a matter which should be clarified in respect of the applicants concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a great many schemes, individual schemes and schemes carried out in respect of groups, have proved of considerable benefit to the persons concerned. There is no alternative system readily available whereby certain work of this character can be undertaken.  One defect in the present system is that only limited provision is available for individual applicants where other beneficiaries would not benefit by them.</P>
    <P>In this case I feel that some special consideration should be given to the position of individual applications. So far as the schemes generally are concerned, I gather from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that it is proposed to amalgamate and alter some of these schemes generally, so as to cover the different types.  In that connection, the extent to which work can be carried on in urban areas greatly depends on the contributions made available by local authorities. One of the problems that affect urban areas, particularly where large-scale building development has taken place, is the recurrent problem of flooding.  This applies in particular to <Col N="176" /> certain areas with which I am personally familiar.  The recurrent difficulties which have been created for residents in these areas, if not primarily caused by development, have certainly been aggravated by it.</P>
    <P>In the South County Dublin area, including portion of the Dún Laoghaire &mdash; Rathdown district, very considerable housing development has taken place.  Because of the nature of the terrain and the fact that the area is at a level considerably lower than the adjacent mountain area, the flow of water, particularly after heavy rainfall, becomes channelled into it.  Prior to this building development and the large-scale road construction which has been undertaken, the problem was rarely of consequence or affected only isolated houses or, possibly, groups of houses.  With the housing and new road development that has taken place, the roads in many cases have acted as channels through which the surface water is carried.  To the residents and to a non-technical person visiting the area on the occasion of flooding and heavy rainfall, it would appear that the constructional work undertaken by developers and builders, and in some cases by the local authorities, did not adequately take into account the extent to which the development work might contribute, and in some cases did contribute, to flooding.</P>
    <P>While, initially, the authorities concerned might be pardoned for the situation, there is no doubt that a remedy is necessary now in a number of areas.  Certain work has been carried out.  A large-scale drainage scheme was undertaken by Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council which has provided a remedy to a certain extent for some of the problems, in addition to providing sewerage facilities for further building development.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are still places where on the occasion of heavy rainfall great problems arise.  I have in mind particularly the situation at Stradbrook in Blackrock, which is on the border of the Dún Laoghaire <Col N="177" /> Corporation and the county council area and, to that extent, there is possibly joint responsibility.  There is also a certain amount of flooding in Stillorgan. I mention these places because I feel that the Office of Public Works and the local authorities concerned should discuss the matter jointly so as to ensure that whatever schemes are undertaken will provide for a solution of the difficulties which in the case of some residents have been repetitive.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred in his introductory statement to the school building programme and to the fact that substantial sums were spent in the last financial year and he made certain comparisons.  While the figures are impressive, in presenting figures of this character it is not sufficiently realised the extent to which building costs have risen in recent years.  Even this year, the figure has been given, and I do not think it has been challenged, of the effect of the wholesale tax.  That tax applies only to certain components used in building.  A number of items used in building are excluded from the turnover tax and from the wholesale tax.  It has been estimated that the wholesale tax and the alterations that have taken place in wage and salary levels have increased building costs this year by anything between seven and eight per cent.  The fact is that in recent years building costs have risen very considerably. Although more money was spent last year and, as compared with other years, the expenditure has shown an upward trend, the fact is that costs also have increased substantially.</P>
    <P>However, the particular problem to which I want to direct attention is one that is largely peculiar, certainly in extent, to urban and semi-urban areas.  I often think that the school building problem as it affects Dún Laoghaire and other urban areas, but particularly as it affects the Dublin area, is so great that a different system of financing school building there might be considered from that which operates in other parts of the country. The growth of population in Dublin and the Dublin area is primarily a problem for the urban environs rather <Col N="178" /> than the city areas mentioned here yesterday.  There are certain parts of the central Dublin city area where the school-going population has declined because of the movement of population to other areas.  It may be that in time, with rebuilding, that trend will be reversed or that the former population will be restored.  But, in my constituency, the rapid growth of housing schemes over a number of years under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act procedures and the development of new areas has meant very acute problems of school accommodation and the delays involved in getting new schools erected and under way have created, and are in many cases creating, very acute difficulties for pupils, parents and teachers as well as for the authorities responsible for the running and directing of schools.</P>
    <P>I have long felt that the method of financing school building, as well as the technical procedures adopted to deal with this situation, while they may be adequate or reasonable in the less congested areas, that in certain parts of the Dublin area&mdash;taking that as a general description covering the whole city and particularly the suburbs and Dún Laoghaire and such places&mdash; this is a problem which might well merit investigation to see if it is possible to evolve a different type of scheme from that which is applied elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the erection of prefab schools.  Many school authorities have found that system quite satisfactory. In fact without it, in a number of cases, it would have been impossible with the time factor involved and the very acute problems created by an increase in the numbers of school-going children, to deal with the situation. But while this may alleviate the problem for a time and provide some form of accommodation to deal with it in places like the Dublin city area, Dún Laoghaire and adjoining areas where the size of classes in many schools is far too large, it is obvious that in many cases the need for permanent accommodation will continue.  While I understand that the responsibility of the <Col N="179" /> Office of Public Works extends only to the provision of schools, the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works should direct their combined efforts towards reaching a speedy and satisfactory conclusion to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the development at Dún Laoghaire Pier and the ferry service.  That particular development has proceeded quite satisfactorily and the extent to which it has made a contribution to the tourist trade, both for the area immediately concerned and for the country generally, is recognised by those interested and concerned with it.  There are, however, certain aspects of the work which have not yet been completed and which have caused and are causing consequential problems for Dún Laoghaire residents.</P>
    <P>One of these is in connection with the bus services.  It is understood that a permanent terminal will be provided, if certain works are carried out by the Office of Public Works in consultation and collaboration with Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I should be glad if that work could be expedited because the provision of certain facilities would ensure that it would be possible to provide a service for people who wish to avail of what was the recognised stopping place on the Marine Road and would not merely facilitate users but would also facilitate business in the area.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the work on historic monuments. I should like to express appreciation of a great deal of work which has been done by the Office of Public Works in this regard.  I believe that the monuments which have been repaired, renovated and, in some cases, very nearly discovered as a result of the work of the Office of Public Works have great value from an historical point of view as well as from the point of view of tourists.  I have in mind particular places which I had the opportunity of visiting such as Clonmacnoise and two places in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency, Jerpoint Abbey and Rothe House, to <Col N="180" /> which he referred.  One advantage of a place like Jerpoint Abbey is that it is easily accessible from the road and certainly the renovation and restoration work carried out by the officers and officials of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department is of the very highest standard.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impressed by the work carried out at Ballintubber Abbey. Needless to say, a great deal of the credit, and in fact, most of it, must go to Father Egan and the other helpers he had there.  There was one aspect of that work which I thought was a bit out of tune with the rest of the work carried out there.  That was the idea to snowcem or whitewash the inside of the Abbey.  It seemed to me, and I heard other people express the same view, that if the stonework were left untouched, it would have been much easier for people to appreciate and understand it.  For some reason, the inside was treated with some substance&mdash;snowcem, or indeed it might even be regarded as whitewash&mdash;and it certainly seemed to me not to be in keeping with the rest of the work carried out.</P>
    <P>There are two matters that I want to refer to in this connection.  The first is that there is a difference&mdash;and I think very often people do not appreciate this&mdash;between preserving and maintaining historical monuments and the attempts on occasion to renovate, restore or maintain old buildings.  I believe this is a case in which the Office of Public Works should investigate most carefully whether it will be possible, by a reasonable amount of expenditure, to maintain or restore an old building.</P>
    <P>I have in mind two cases.  One case which certainly caused the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture a great deal of trouble was Johnstown Castle because of a proviso in the deed of trust handing that particular property over to the State that there was an obligation on the State to maintain it.  Undoubtedly the expenditure subsequently involved exceeded its value.</P>
    <P>The other case I have in mind is the old Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  In <Col N="181" /> that connection I commend most strongly the idea of establishing a folklore museum.  One of the criticisms that may be levelled against the State here is that we have not shown sufficient initiative or enthusiasm in matters of this sort.  There is no doubt that there is a wealth of historical material of great value preserved in the Folklore Commission in most unsuitable surroundings and, it is well known, in great danger from a physical point of view in the sense that these buildings are not suitable and hazards, such as fire, would leave the documents and material in question in very considerable danger.  The idea, therefore, of establishing a folklore museum at the Old Royal Hospital is one that merits general approval.</P>
    <P>There is a case, it seems to me, for examining into whether it would be better to build <i>de novo</i> in a case of this kind, constructing a suitable modern building, or buildings, rather than try to rehabilitate or restore and maintain buildings that have outlived their usefulness.  The situation that was disclosed as a result of the recent examination by the Committee of Public Accounts of certain expenditure would call for very great care in undertaking expenditure of that nature and I believe the House would be glad to be assured, before expenditure of that character is undertaken, that competent technical investigation is made of the physical problems involved and the financial commitments necessary to restore and maintain the building.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I had the opportunity of visiting the King's Inns and seeing there the work done by the Benchers. The House is aware that a Vote was passed here for reimbursement, arising mainly because of funds available in the Funds of Suitors account.  The King's Inns building is one of very considerable value, historically and otherwise.  A great improvement is being carried out there and I believe that there is now a deficit in respect of additional work which had to be done.  The Benchers of the King's Inns have undertaken work of great national value.  Not merely is this building of tremendous use to law <Col N="182" /> students and lawyers but it houses the best legal library in the country.  I understand the Benchers made certain proposals to the Government and are prepared to discuss the position and make reasonable suggestions in order to enable the total expenditure to be reduced.  One suggestion is the sale or transference to other libraries in the country, at a valuation, of certain books not necessarily essential for lawyers or students.  This is a matter upon which I am not qualified to express an opinion because some may well take the view that the library is of such value it would be to the national advantage to retain it as a single entity.  That is a matter for discussion between the Benchers and the appropriate Department, but I believe the expenditure incurred on the work done merits reimbursement.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I want to refer is the position in relation to a decision in respect of the Kennedy Memorial Concert Hall.  As the Parliamentary Secretary and the House are aware, this matter was the subject of consideration by a Dáil Committee which held a great many meetings.  A plan was eventually prepared. The matter was discussed on many occasions and a great deal of work was done.  Subsequently, because of what is described as financial stringency, the matter was postponed, deferred, not proceeded with.  I do not know in which way to describe it.  I think the time has now arrived when a definite announcement should be made as to what it is intended to do.  As a member of the Committee, it has struck me that the Committee has become dormant for quite some time now and I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if a definite decision has been taken and, if so, the nature of that decision; if it is proposed to proceed with the hall, I should like to know when it is proposed to start work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more I am constrained to mention the unsatisfactory position of many sections of workers under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works employed both in Dublin <Col N="183" /> and in various parts of the country.  In this particular sphere of Government activity, we have a peculiar set of circumstances, circumstances common in no other employment.  In normal employment, representatives of the workers can have claims discussed, can have conferences with employers or their representatives and can cement claims.  Even though they may not sit down with their employers, they will at least be able to confer with authorised spokesmen of those employers and engage with them in effective negotiations. It is true that claims are not always settled by negotiation and sometimes workers are constrained to resort to their right to withdraw their labour in support of a claim.</P>
      <P>In the Office of Public Works, we have an almost unique situation.  Competent officials of the Office of Public Works are prepared to receive an application and to meet representatives of the workers concerned to discuss problems.  At times it is even possible to go over the establishment officer and meet the Commissioners themselves. Cases have been known where the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works made representations. I say this much for them; they were usually courteous gentlemen.  But mostly what happens is&mdash;at that particular stage&mdash;having indicated they have great sympathy with the cases submitted on behalf of the workers, or even gone to the point as the present incumbent's predecessor did, of indicating that he was submitting to the Minister for Finance a long and detailed recommendation, the decision on these matters has to await the pleasure and convenience of the Minister for Finance.  As a matter of fact, I recollect that in the case of a former Minister for Finance, the present Senator Ryan, with regard to a matter of wage rates which had been the subject of negotiation for a long period, he gave a decision on the matter a few days before surrendering the office completely.  His action in that regard was appreciated because it is possible, had he not given a decision at that stage, the workers might still be awaiting a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> We have had the peculiar circumstances of employees of this House&mdash; you might say those involved in servicing the House and servicing various parts of Governmental installations&mdash; who had occasion this time last year, because of neglect or unwillingness on the part of their employer to concede what was a reasonable claim, to take the action of withdrawing their labour. Members of the House will have distinct recollections of that occasion, because they were put to some inconvenience; for some time, they were almost as cold as the men who were outside the building, up the South Circular Road and elsewhere, exposed to the bitter weather of the particular time.  It was found possible at that stage to get the help, even indirectly, of conciliation officers of the Labour Court, but the fact that that situation developed 12 months ago showed&mdash; and not for the first time&mdash;that the old adage is as true in 1966 as it ever was, that absolute power corrupts absolutely, because the treatment still meted out, and the lack of consideration shown to employees coming within the scope and covered by these various Votes leaves much to be desired in this year of 1966.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled me out of order.  I hope, in discussing this matter, and referring to the matter under Subhead A&mdash;Office of Public Works, Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;it will be in order for me to refer to the injustice being perpetrated on large numbers of people who carry out their duties conscientiously and diligently under the direction and control of the Commissioners of Public Works, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance.  I had occasion to ask some questions recently and I was given details of the very large number of people employed in this authority who, if they fell ill, were left dependent upon social welfare benefits.  I had occasion then&mdash;and I have occasion again&mdash;to refer to the difference in the treatment of those workers by this House, because it is carried out in the name of this House, as compared with the treatment of similar classes of workers employed in State-sponsored bodies, such as the Electricity Supply Board, local authorities, <Col N="185" /> the various corporations and, even, health authorities.  In these organisations, and in the employment of private employers&mdash;who claim to be progressive&mdash;one would not find a situation existing where a man, after 20 years service, if he fell ill, would have to rely solely upon social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may well start talking about what happens in the building trade and that he hopes, as I was told not too long ago in this House, that if and when agreement is reached between the building trade employers and the trade unions for a sick pay scheme, it will be extended to workers in the employment of the Commissioners of Public Works. It is no satisfaction to men who may fall ill today or tomorrow to be given that type of cold comfort.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that a number of the men with long service employed in the Board of Works came there originally because they had earlier given service in the efforts to achieve freedom in this country.  Many of them went there as the nominees of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries of Fianna Fáil Governments.  But it is no satisfaction to them to know that for years these men have been suffering this form of injustice; it is no satisfaction to know that while senior civil servants, establishment officers, clerical officers, the technical grades and clerical grades, if they fall ill, are covered by sick pay benefits, these manual grades, who are not established servants, are not established officers, get, up to the present time, no such benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that there is still belief in certain quarters that the electricity supply failure during the recent strike was deliberately brought about by the Board <Col N="186" /> of the Electricity Supply Board; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that when electricity power supplies were disrupted on the morning of Monday, 9th May, 1966, attempts were made to throw the responsibility on the Electricity Supply Board.  A further attempt was made in the House on the 2nd November, 1966, to mislead the public into believing that the power restrictions imposed on 9th May were unnecessarily severe and that the Board could, somehow or other, have kept supplies going to a greater extent. Such statements would not be made by any responsible person who had any conception of the highly complex operation involved in maintaining supply in the national electricity network, even in normal circumstances, while ensuring absolute safety of personnel and plant.</P>
      <P>There was a poor response to the Board's appeal to consumers to reduce load on 9th May, 1966.  Extensive announcements had been made by the Board in the Press, radio and television, yet the load at 8 a.m. that morning was only about 8 per cent below normal.</P>
      <P>The staff report for duty at 8 a.m. and there was full scale and simultaneous picketing of all generating stations; operating staffs in all cases refused to pass the pickets; manual staff on duty demanded, as a condition of their remaining on to make the plant safe, that all generating plant should be shut down by midday.</P>
      <P>Under these extreme conditions there was no possibility of maintaining a normal or near normal supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board's overall plan in this situation was to establish and secure an emergency network within the capacity of the hydro-electric stations. The over-riding factor was that if loading at any moment exceeded capacity, cascading would have occurred, that is complete black out conditions such as occurred in New York in November, 1965.  Had this happened, restoration of supply <Col N="187" /> would have been a very protracted process.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the criticism of the Board in this matter is entirely uninformed.  No reductions in power supplies were made before pickets were placed and the reductions then made were essential from the technical viewpoint.  The gravity of the situation which emerged was without parallel in the Board's history and all its resources had to be directed to maintaining essential services and at the same time avoiding a complete shut down if demand at any moment exceeded supply capacity.</P>
    <P>The position in the 1961 strike to which reference has been made has little relevance in the circumstances of the 1966 strike.  In 1961 all the unions not directly involved then instructed their members to pass the pickets and the partial observance of these instructions in the first week of that strike afforded a respite.</P>
    <P>Finally I would refer to the statements by some Deputies that several competent electrical engineers and other experts in this field are satisfied that the ESB acted hastily and unjustifiably in this matter.  It is clear in view of the information I have given and the safety aspects of the matter that this was not so.  If, despite this, the Deputies who raised the question are still not satisfied, I would ask them to let me have the names of their advisers in this matter and I will arrange to have them furnished by the ESB with full detailed technical information of the situation on the morning of 9th May, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to answer a particular question with regard to a particular area but I regard these allegations as extremely serious.  In view of the fine reputation the ESB has as one of our State companies through the years.  I felt it incumbent on me and my officers <Col N="188" /> during the whole course of the strike negotiations to keep myself in constant touch with the ESB.  I talked on numerous occasions with the Chairman. From the very beginning, it was absolutely evident that the entire board of the ESB were filled with a desire at all costs to maintain power. The one thing they wanted to preserve was their magnificent and unsullied reputation down through the years during which no load-shedding had taken place.  Moreover, members of the Board had no idea in their minds that by causing a crisis and deliberately cutting off power, they would be right in so doing from the standpoint of the industrial relations then involved Whatever reputation I have in one way or another as Minister for Transport and Power, when I state facts, they are generally accepted in this House.  I ask Deputies to accept my statement that the Chairman and members of the Board had no such concept in their minds at any time.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to accept a statement made by the Minister on his own actions, but I am not prepared to accept a statement made by the Minister about things that someone else has told him. I want to make it clear that our information is&mdash;and I want to ask the Minister does he not agree&mdash;that in fact on the morning of the closedown many people felt there was a deliberate attempt to create a crisis for the purpose of forcing the hands of the trade unionists who were on strike.  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the ESB deliberately prevented one hospital from switching to their own power by refusing to remove a fuse, in order to carry out the wishes of the Board of the ESB to make things as difficult as possible?</P>

I do not think it even necessary to read a definition of &ldquo;cascading&rdquo; during an electricity crisis, but if the Deputy has any technical advisers, as I said, I would be glad to have their views and I will submit them to the Board of the ESB because it is absolutely clear that they <Col N="189" /> did everything they possibly could at that time to maintain power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before questions, I was dealing with a sore and serious problem to which I brought the Minister's attention recently by way of Parliamentary Question when I sought information as to the average service necessary in the Board of Works to qualify employees for superannuation or sick pay.  I was told it was 13 years.  This indicates a serious situation and again illustrates the callousness with which these workers are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This treatment is not confined to Board of Works employees in Dublin. It extends to the Board's employees <Col N="194" /> in various parts of the country.  Employees of local authorities in Dublin qualify after 12 months to accumulate service for superannuation and sick pay purposes.  Similar condition apply in the ESB and in many private undertakings.  Deputies, including the Parliamentary Secretary, will be aware that many relatively small undertakings are endeavouring to heed the exhortations of the Taoiseach and members of the Government to bring their plant up to date to become more efficient in the teeth of competition on our possible entry to the Common Market.  Despite that, there are still workers in public undertakings being treated in the way I have described.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary on this occasion will not give me the same reply as he did when I asked the question previously.  The employees of the Board of Works are under the direct control of this House.  We are not talking about people employed by undertakings whose main interest is the accumulation of profits.</P>
    <P>When he introduced the Estimate, the Parliamentary Secretary to some extent patted himself and the Department on the back in relation to the provision of school buildings last year. It is good to see that there was more school building but it must be said we are not satisfied that enough attention is being given to this important matter.  Our aim is to provide a sufficient number of school buildings to ensure that our children will not have to travel long distance from their homes.  The sum allocated for school building this year is £2,760,000 and the Parliamentary Secretary seemed to imply it was something to be proud of in the financial circumstances prevailing.  We must remember that in 1963-64 the figure was £3.2 million.  There has been an increase in costs since 1963-64.  I should like to pose a question as to whether the amount shown in the Estimate is sufficient to provide the increase in the actual provision of schools for the current year.  I referred elsewhere to the fact that there continues to be problems in the city of Dublin in this <Col N="195" /> regard.  It may well be that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are not responsible for the delays which continue to take place.  I should like an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary, given the attention by other authorities concerned, that his Department will be able to provide the schools at a more rapid pace than previously.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the provision of central sorting offices.  A central sorting office was provided in Dublin at Sheriff Street.  I do not know whether the placing of the sorting office in Sheriff Street is a good thing, having regard to the growing traffic conditions.  There is another sorting office being completed in Artane, an area which the Minister for Finance and I represent as Deputies.  That is a residential area which was fairly well planned to cater for both private and local authority dwellings.  There is a nine acre space in the centre of the area which is gradually being developed as a park with a school bordering one side of it and a new church now being built.  If anybody has a look at the design of the sorting office he will form a very poor opinion of whoever is responsible for the exact choice of site and the appearance of the sorting office itself.  Whatever about the provisions inside from the point of view of dealing with the services certainly the exterior of the building and the siting of it is no credit to anybody.  Possibly nothing can be done about it now but if this is to be the pattern of work carried out in this regard we might well examine our approach to it.</P>
    <P>We are told that there are delays in the fisheries scheme at Dunmore East and Castletownbere.  I do not see anything in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement regarding the development of Howth Harbour.  At what particular stage are the plans in relation to Howth Harbour?  It was selected some time ago as one of the areas which could be developed as a fishing centre.  Reference was made to the question of extending a third pier out into the middle of the harbour.  While we are dealing with the <Col N="196" /> present year there is no reference to what the future will be.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary brushes off fairly glibly and fairly readily in his Estimate the very considerable reduction that has taken place in the employment and emergency schemes.  The gross total for 1964 was £922,600.  The net total of £465,000 for the Supplementary Estimate in respect of 1966-67 has to be added to this.  The reduction in the various Votes under the employment and emergency schemes appears to have fallen mainly in urban employment, which has been reduced from £200,000 to £131,000 and rural employment schemes which have had over £40,000 deducted.</P>
    <P>Employment and emergency schemes were originally introduced for the purpose of dealing with a situation in which unemployment existed and where it was necessary to provide some specific relief under this particular heading.  It cannot be held that the unemployment position today is satisfactory or that the need for the employment and emergency schemes has declined.  It might well be the case, if we were to get our priorities right, that we might even sacrifice a little of the facilities we have in this House if it meant that the level of assistance by way of those schemes was to be maintained or increased and the people for whom those schemes were designed to assist would get the assistance through maintaining those schemes.</P>
    <P>This Estimate deals with coast erosion.  Under this particular heading one might not only introduce the question of coast erosion but the general necessity for either the Office of Public Works or some of the local authorities to again look at the situation developing around our coastline. Much has been said about the right of the people of Ireland to own the soil of Ireland.  Much has been said about the beautiful coastline of our country. There are very few countries which have such an attractive coastline but what is being done to preserve the amenities and the beauty of our coastline for the enjoyment and recreation of the ordinary citizens of our country?</P>
    <P>Is the position not continuing to be <Col N="197" /> that private individuals, private groups and private enterprise, with no regard for the Irish people as such, are increasingly obtaining strips of our coastline and increasingly depriving the ordinary people of their use and enjoyment?  This is being done on a very large scale and there is little evidence of any intention on the Government's part to protect the public against this exploitation, or of any attempt to prevent the situation from developing as it has developed in a number of Continental countries.  In a number of Continental countries, the ordinary citizen can only visit the seashore if he pays either a local authority or, worse still, an individual or a private group for the privilege of enjoying bathing, etc., on the strand in summertime.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for the Ordnance Survey, Deputy Dillon made an eloquent appeal for the preservation of important architectural sites and so on. Whatever the situation is in the country, and I bow to his knowledge in this matter, the cities also possess buildings and remains of historical interest.  What is being done about them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being pulled down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only are the buildings being pulled down&mdash;and I am not talking about Georgian buildings now &mdash;but in the process, the bulldozers go into the basement areas, into the low ground levels, and anything of an architectural or historical value is just shoved to one side.  Possibly Government Departments, insurance companies, banks and so on, are guilty of this.  They do not have any prior consultations with an archaeological or architectural society, or with the Board of Works.  It is time that these matters were given some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to drainage when introducing his Estimate.  There is one general comment which I should like to make on this matter.  As far as coastal cities are concerned the problems associated <Col N="198" /> with flooding after heavy rains are left mainly in the hands of the local authorities.  I wonder if it is sufficient to deal with the matter on this basis because flooding can arise in many cases from causes far removed from the cities themselves.  We know that due to the extension of building schemes, the extension of cement and tarmacadam roads and pavements, the danger of temporary flooding has increased because there is no way for the surplus water to drain slowly through the ground and now it is carried on the surface or through water sewers.  We are also aware of the fact that where an area has been denuded of trees the possibility of flooding is much greater.</P>
    <P>Greater co-ordination is called for on this question of drainage generally. Technical officers in the local authorities will do their best to deal with the situation as they see it but their immediate responsibility is related only to their particular area.  It is, therefore, necessary to take a broader view of the situation.  If that was necessary from our own experience it has surely been shown to be necessary in regard to the catastrophe that has overtaken Italy in the last couple of months.  We might well learn a lesson from the tragedy which has affected that very ancient land and which has caused such untold suffering and damage to Italy and its people.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate for employment and emergency schemes is down.  Most of these relate to rural areas and I am sure that Deputies representing these areas will deal with this matter in detail.  However, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if serious consideration is being given to the fact that if remedial action is not taken very few people will be able to obtain free access to our strands in a few years time because of the continued encroachment on the strands by private individuals.  I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate the reasons for the reduction in the provision for development works in bogs used by landowners and private producers.  In 1965-66 the figure was £155,000 and for 1966-67 the <Col N="199" /> estimate is for £5,000.  Surely from the point of view of the development of bogs, etc., the weather in this part of the year has been more suitable for this type of work and advantage could well have been taken of it to carry out the work at an accelerated speed?</P>
    <P>It is good to see that in the schools referred to which are under construction there is provision to give the pupils light meals and facilities for dining in the schools.  Dining facilities in schools where children cannot readily get home are long overdue.  Credit must be given for the fact that expenditure under this head is included in this Estimate.  I take it that this refers mainly to the smaller schools in rural areas but may I use the occasion to mention that such facilities are also needed in many schools in city areas?  There are thousands of children going to schools in Dublin who get an inadequate meal, the milk and bun.  This is not the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility and therefore I shall not dilate on it. There is no provision in these schools in Dublin for any other type of meal, if provided.  This is a situation of which we cannot be proud.  The Office of Public Works has the task of providing school buildings, and in considering plans for school buildings, should have regard to the fact that sooner or later we shall recognise the need not only for the facilities outlined in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech&mdash;these are very welcome&mdash;in respect of smaller schools but also the necessity for similar facilities in larger urban schools.</P>
    <P>While it may be true that the pupils of such schools do not have long distances to travel, many thousands of them, because of traffic conditions or lack of inadequate public services, are constrained to have the miserable school meal, either in the classroom or even out in the playground.  That is not good.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate his interest in these matters and his intention to do whatever is possible to improve the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate <Col N="200" /> the Parliamentary Secretary on that part of his speech in which he referred to the ever-increasing number of new schools being provided and the major improvement of existing schools. Deputy Larkin seemed to think that because the cost of building has gone up, the Parliamentary Secretary was giving himself a pat on the back that he did not deserve, but according to my reading of the speech, he said that last year 130 new schools were completed and major improvements were carried out to 66, which would give a total of 196 modern buildings for that year.  Further, he tells us that 20,000 permanent pupil-places were provided. I think he does deserve congratulation on that aspect of the work of the Office of Public Works.  He also states that £3,123,000 from State funds was spent on primary school building last year and that he is asking for £2,760,000 for schools for the current year.  He said that despite financial difficulties, this is the third largest sum ever to be voted for the service in one year.</P>
      <P>He mentions the central schools that are to be built to replace a number of one-and-two-teacher schools.  Anybody who has any experience of teaching will agree that it is a good idea to abolish one-teacher schools.  I never had the experience of teaching in a one-teacher school but one can imagine the task it must be for a teacher to go through every class from infants up to sixth or seventh class and teach different programmes, still maintaining discipline among the different sections.  It has been done for years, but it must be a very trying experience for the teachers mostly women, I understand.  It is a move in the right direction to replace these by central schools but there must be many two-teacher schools throughout the country&mdash;I know several of them that were built within the last decade&mdash; provided with hot and cold water and toilet facilities and everything necessary, except, perhaps, the additional rooms Deputy Larkin mentioned.  It would be a waste of public money if such schools were to be demolished.</P>

      <P>I understand that, but the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned one- and two-teacher schools and I want to suggest that instead of building a central school, he should put before the Minister for Finance, who will have to provide the money, the idea that use could be made of these small schools, particularly two-teacher schools that are quite modern and up-to-date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the same problem when speaking on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Education and said how difficult it will be to bring children four or five years old away in a bus and keep them at a school all day, while at the same time there is a new building within one hundred or two hundred yards of their own home.  Perhaps you could bring the bigger pupils in the bus and use the two-teacher schools for the infants up to second or third class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>He might be able to inform the Minister of the use that could be made of these schools and this might save money and avoid building too many of the other type of school if the small schools were used for junior pupils where they are in good condition.</P>
      <P>In deference to the wishes of the Chair, I shall leave that subject and go on to something affecting my own constituency which I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, that is, arterial drainage.  He said that the minor scheme on Killimor which is already in progress will have further money spent on it this year and that he hopes to start the scheme on the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Corrib-Headford portion of the Corrib before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that because I have been on several deputations regarding the Corrib-Headford river, and I have asked questions about it. It was part of the Corrib drainage scheme that had been omitted when the original scheme was introduced some years ago.  As a result of its being included now and if as he hopes he can start work on it before the end of the year, we shall have 14,000 acres of agricultural land benefiting and 5,000 acres of bog.  That will be a big benefit to that end of my constituency. If I had the same benefit at the other end which is bordered by the Suck, I would be doubly pleased.  However, I do not see any mention whatever made of the Suck.</P>

      <P>I make no apology for saying that, because on 10th June last, I received a letter from the secretary of <Col N="203" /> the Defence of the West Committee telling me that Dr. Hugh Gibbons, the Deputy representing Roscommon-Leitrim, had obtained for the Deputies from the west of Ireland, a meeting with the Parliamentary Secretary in his office on Wednesday, June 15th.  The Deputies from all Parties met the Parliamentary Secretary and he received us very kindly indeed.  We put all aspects of this matter to him but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We still could not get any increase in the Vote, and I believe this money spent on employment and emergency schemes is one of the main things that was benefiting people in my constituency in the west of Ireland.  The Parliamentary Secretary merged all the money into the rural improvements scheme.  When there was only a certain amount of money available, I will have to admit that it was the right thing to do.  Anybody who comes from rural Ireland who has seen the operation of the rural improvements scheme knows that invariably it was a much better scheme than the others, the minor employment or the bog development scheme, because under the rural improvement scheme the beneficiaries themselves contributed.  They were small farmers or small farmers' sons. They did the work themselves, perhaps an accommodation road to their own house, and this ensured that the work was done well, and it was under the supervision of gangers and officers of the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>In 1962, when the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, was Parliamentary Secretary in the Board of Works, he sent down a circular to all the county councils to the effect that we could take over these roads and maintain them without further ado. That procedure was adopted by Galway County Council.  Since 1962, where any group of people in my constituency constructed an accommodation road, a road linking an existing main road or a cul-de-sac, if it served two or more houses&mdash;it had to serve two before the grant was given&mdash;it has been taken over by Galway County</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Council and the people are never asked to contribute to it again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon knows what I thought about the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  He complimented me here once, when Deputy Burke and I came back from an Árd Fheis, on having asked the Árd Fheis to ask the Government to re-introduce that Act.  If a good piece of legislation is brought into this House, I am one of those who will give credit to whoever introduced it. The Local Authorities (Works) Act was brought in by the late Deputy Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government.  That Act worked well in my county.  We are parliamentarians here and no matter what side of the House we are on, we participate in framing legislation.  We put down amendments, and so on, and all Deputies have a part in that legislation in one way or another.</P>
    <P>The only fault I saw in the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;and other people saw it as well&mdash;was that there was no provision for future maintenance. A drain was done and after a while the drain became clogged up but the council was not given power to take it over and maintain it.  Under the rural improvements scheme, we have power to maintain roads and drains.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Finance and other Government Ministers involved, and I am asking them once again, that instead of the Board of Works carrying out these schemes as they are doing now, and as they will try to do from now on with reduced money, they do the same as was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that is, make an allocation to each county council and let the council in the respective areas, with their own engineers, carry out these schemes.  The defect in the Local Authorities (Works) Act could be overcome by giving them powers of maintenance.  As far as roads are concerned they would be maintained from then on.  The drainage could be carried out by the local Land Project office which, to my mind, would be the most suitable body in a county to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever set it up, I give him credit.  I am asking that the moneys be spent by that office or some similar office in each county instead of its being spent by the Board of Works.  I can see problems where four or five farmers want to improve their land but there is a main outfall flowing along by their land which is nobody's baby. There could be one or two farmers in between who have no intention of improving their land.  Heretofore, the Board of Works came along and the work was done under the rural improvements scheme or under a bog development scheme.  There should be some special body in each county; I take it that in regard to roads, it would be the county council, and with regard to drains, the Land Project office or the Department of Agriculture.  Instead of the Board of Works operating these schemes themselves, they should hand these moneys over to the councils concerned. Their engineers, together with the local councillors, should draw up a list of all the roads and drains in their areas.  In that way the money would be better spent and you would have provision for maintenance which there was not in the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  As I said, it was a good Act but it would have been much better if that had been provided.</P>
      <P>That is my contribution.  I have had a bee in my bonnet for many years about the Local Authorities (Works) Act and how to improve the rural improvement, minor employment and bog development schemes.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will put my views before the Minister for Finance and the Government and ask that they carry on with arterial drainage and all the other schemes under this Vote, but increase the subsidy and hand over the moneys to each county council and let the county council and the Department of Agriculture do the works in their own areas and maintain them after carrying them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Kitt <Col N="206" /> will agree with me that there is more in this than meets the eye.  This discreet transfer of bog development schemes, employment schemes and rural improvement schemes introduces a new principle.  Up to now, the bog development schemes and the rural employment schemes involved no local contribution.  They now all carry a local contribution. I wonder if Deputy Kitt had been on this side of the House and we had abolished the free schemes and announced that hereafter all such schemes would involve a local contribution, what would his reaction have been?  I think he would have been very eloquent.  He would have spoken about our savage, cruel indifference to the unemployed of rural Ireland.  He would have wept copious tears about the hungry poor whom we were concerned to trample underfoot.  I have not heard him say anything about that today.</P>
      <P>I would have much more respect for the Parliamentary Secretary if he came out plain and blunt and said: &ldquo;We are bust.  We have no money. We cannot give any money for employment schemes and bog development schemes any more.&rdquo;  That is part of the process of going bust.  The poor people suffer.  When a Government run a country into acute financial crisis, to which reference was repeatedly made in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, what happens is that the people who get hurt by the financial stringency are the defenceless poor.  That is why I have been trying to tell this House for a long time what it means to go bust.  The country does not stop; it does not sink under the sea.  Nobody living in relatively affluent circumstances, like ourselves here in this House, are greatly inconvenienced. On the contrary, we have moved into magnificent new buildings, with every modern convenience.  But the person who depends for a few shillings at Christmas from a bog development scheme or a rural employment scheme is informed there are not any more of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt knows as well as I know that on bog development schemes and employment schemes a <Col N="207" /> great many gangers are employed in all the rural areas, particularly the congested areas.  These are mostly small farmers with uneconomic holdings, who got invaluable supplementary income from being gangers on these schemes.  They have all been sacked.  Nobody in Dublin gives a fiddle-de-dee about it.  I doubt if the Parliamentary Secretary is even conscious of their existence.  Most of these bog schemes and rural employment schemes were located in the congested areas.  I think Deputy Kitt will agree with me that a great many of these people who were gangers, who eked out a modest living on their small holdings by ganging for the Special Employment Schemes Office, have gone to England to earn there by temporary agricultural work or something of that kind, the surplus income really necessary to maintain any rational standard of living at all.</P>
    <P>That is what going bust means.  It is the kind of thing that troubles me continually and about which I try to stir Deputies' consciences.  There is no use talking to people who reside in Tipperary or Waterford or Kildare or Meath or Westmeath about these problems. They have not the faintest notion what they mean.  I think it behoves Deputy Kitt and myself, who represent Monaghan and other congested areas in the country, to keep reminding the Government and the Dáil that if you blandly announce that you are going to wipe out these schemes, a great many small, defenceless people are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>These schemes were not started for fun.  They were started by administrations which were conscious of the need. Some of them were probably started at the instance of the old Congested Districts Board.  who really knew what was going on in rural Ireland.  Mind you, there is a good deal of adverse criticism of the Board of Works, but it is astonishing the store of social information accumulated in the Board of Works.  You meet in the Board of Works men who have an understanding of the conditions of our people in rural Ireland which is comparable with that of the old staff of the Congested Districts Board, and I could not <Col N="208" /> pay them a higher compliment than to say that.</P>
    <P>These schemes were started by men who had an understanding of the conditions obtaining in rural Ireland, particularly the congested areas.  The closing down of these schemes is part of the economy drive to relieve what the Parliamentary Secretary calls the &ldquo;financial stringency&rdquo;, but which I call the process of going bust.  This means we are meeting financial stringency, not at our own expense either in the way of accommodation or remuneration, but at the expense of the most defenceless elements in the community.</P>
    <P>I think that is wrong.  It is something of which I would be ashamed if I were the Parliamentary Secretary called upon to justify it to the House.  However, I give him this credit: he does not attempt to justify it.  He simply reports he was told to do it and has done it.  Do not let us forget the fact that, over and above the schemes that are not being done, a lot of partially employed people in the congested areas have been sacked; and, certainly in the areas I know of, a relatively high proportion of them have gone to England to get in Birmingham and London the work that has been withdrawn from them in Ireland as a result of this Government going bust.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to sound as if I am being ungenerous to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to compliment him on the last paragraph of page 13, the last paragraph of the brief in regard to Votes 8 and 9.  He says:</P>
    <P>Work has begun in County Louth on the field stage of the archaeological survey of the country.  It is planned to make a detailed, systematic, county-by-county survey. Aerial photography will play an important part in locating and identifying remains and the Air Corps is co-operating fully in this very important enterprise.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on that.  It would have been generous of him to recognise the source of his inspiration but I suppose that would be expecting too much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I forbear to dwell on the fact that it is a matter to which I have been directing the attention of successive Governments for close on 25 years.  It is quite sufficient reward to see one's dream realised without having one's name associated with it.</P>
      <P>I see the Parliamentary Secretary speaks of discussions with the Northern Ireland Government in regard to Border drainage problems.  He says that, as a result, partly, of these discussions, it is proposed to engage on the drainage of the Kilcoo river in Counties Leitrim and Fermanagh, and of the Finn in Monaghan and Fermanagh, at which I greatly rejoice. What about the fane and the Dromore?  I know the Finn is urgent and has long been the preoccupation of every Deputy who has represented County Monaghan here.  I have always been told that if the Erne catchment area is dealt with, then the Dromore river would come within that catchment. I should be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is now proposed to deal with the Dromore.  I see no mention of the Fane river but if the Finn and Dromore are done, then that would be a good beginning. My information is that the Northern Ireland authorities have done their part down as far as the Border on the Fane. I should be glad to know if and when we may expect our Government to do their part of the river which lies within our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>There is a reference to Phoenix Park in Dublin.  I do not want to disguise that I have already mentioned this matter personally to the Parliamentary Secretary but I do it now again in public.  There are certain public buildings and parks in his keeping, as Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works, and I want to suggest to him&mdash;I should like to hear him agree with me&mdash;that there is a very special responsibility upon us, if we have parkland in our possession, to ensure that, if it is used for grazing, it will present a model aspect.  There is nothing more disedifying than to enter</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Government property which holds itself out as being grazing land and to see evident upon it every example of bad husbandry which the Department of Agriculture is continually inveighing against.  I yield to nobody in my admiration of the versatility of the Office of Public Works but it is not unnatural for the Office of Public Works to say: &ldquo;We are not agronomists, nor, indeed, agriculturists in the Office of Public Works and we do not want to encroach on anybody else's prerogative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say to An Foras Talúntais and the Department of Agriculture itself, in effect: &ldquo;We are willing to pay for what is requisite to be done in order to make these parks and grasslands in our possession examples of what they ought to be but it is up to you to give us your advice as to how to go about it.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, with his background, particularly, that this matter ought to be very close to his heart.  I shall not particularise further in regard to the parkland I have in mind but the Parliamentary Secretary already has some idea, I think, of the context in which I am speaking.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary not on his decision but on his Parliamentary skill in tossing off his announcement that the Civil Service is expanding so rapidly.  The House will remember, I think, that seven years ago we were told it would drastically be reduced.  I think a commission was set up for the purpose of reducing it, but the net result is that it has so dramatically increased that they are bursting out of the buildings in which they already are, and we are moving into the Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann building in Earlsfort Terrace, O'Connell Bridge House, the Rank building in Hawkins House, Liberty Hall and Ansley House in Mespil Road.  I seem to remember a Parliamentary Question in which the Parliamentary Secretary was asked what happens to all the evacuated buildings and he replied, with bland frankness, that further armies of civil servants move into them.  As fast as we move out one group, another body moves <Col N="211" /> in.  In any case, we are now in these five buildings I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>On page 11 of his brief, the Parliamentary Secretary says:</P>
    <P>The alternative to the renting of space in new buildings would be that the State would design and erect its own buildings.  While that would undoubtedly be the ideal solution of our accommodation problem the amount of capital required to carry through such a programme would be enormous.  In recent and present circumstances it could be made available only at the expense of vital services.  Clearly, then, the only practical solution to the problem, though not, as I have indicated, the ideal one, lies in the renting of space in modern office blocks constructed by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is true.  I do not believe that the proposition here put forward can carry with it the informed approval of the specialist technicians of the Office of Public Works because there is an inherent contradiction.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that his advice is that the ideal solution would be to build his own building&mdash;is that not so?  &mdash;and not to rent.  He says that capital stringency forces him to accept the second best, that is, the renting of accommodation in buildings erected by private capital.  This all gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of cute boys coming in here at present from all over the world erecting buildings, many of which are horrible eyesores.  I discover to my amazement that two or three floors of these buildings are taken over subsequently by our Government. Why do the Government not build their own building, do the ideal thing and sell it to an insurance company, taking from the insurance company a lease of 99 years or 999 years at a rental which would give them a return sufficient to meet their actuarial valuation?  Every insurance company in England is doing it.  Half of the big office buildings in London have been built by companies such as the Shell Oil Company, Imperial Chemical Industries or companies whose total resources are as great <Col N="212" /> as ours.  The insurance companies who are finding a growing difficulty in investing their funds in the equity markets of the world on the Stock Exchange jump at the opportunity of a solvent tenant being prepared to sell them a building which they have erected to suit their own requirements. The insurance company then rents it back to them on a long-term lease which will give them the appropriate return on their money.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary finds that it would be a much better thing to build his own building, why did he not do it?  It need not have involved him in any capital expenditure at all and I very much doubt if such an arrangement would have involved him in an average cost of 17/4d per annum per square foot.  I do not know whether that includes the covenant to spend up to £60,000 on adapting the accommodation to our particular requirements where we take over one or two floors of one of these buildings.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have taken over one or two floors in most of the buildings and have spent £60,000 adapting them to our requirements and then paid in some cases up to £1 per square foot.  But, the Parliamentary Secretary said, taking one building with another, the cost was an average of 17/4d per square foot per annum&mdash;in O'Connell Bridge House, the Rank building, Liberty Hall and Ansley House in Mespil Road.  That would seem to be a strange way of going about your business. I wonder with regard to all these buildings, if ever they established their right, who would undertake to occupy them.  As the Parliamentary Secretary says, it is not the ideal course but only a second best.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a matter which causes me concern and on which I have sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know what the answer is, to tell the truth.  Everybody was wildly enthusiastic when the arterial drainage scheme started.  They begin to root out gravel and mud and everything goes like wedding bells. Then they come to a rock barring the way.  They blast the rock and <Col N="213" /> proceed to take out the rock and spoil and put it somewhere.  If you are to move heavy machinery down the bank of a river so as to remove the rock, you have to leave an area wide enough for that machinery to manoeuvre between the spoil you take out of the bottom of the river and the river itself.  You end up with some unfortunate farmer faced with a pile of spoil 15 feet high consisting of rocks and mud.  What are you to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Put it back in the river and start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Put it back in the river and start again, as Deputy de Valera says.  That is like the suggestion of Deputy Booth that when light was found too expensive, you put out the lights.  Both proposals are too expensive for those grappling with the realities of the situation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps you have a man with a relatively small holding in Mayo, along the river Moy.  I know a deputation from County Sligo has been asking for an interview with the Parliamentary Secretary about drainage on the Moy in the vicinity of a townland near where there is a substantial pile of rock.  There is a substantial pile between that point and the Inny.  This is one of the problems facing the Parliamentary Secretary.  In the old days, it was commonly possible to get the county engineer to take back spoil and use it, but with modern methods, you are likely to be told that roads for tractors must have a certain specification of stone and the particular stone taken out of a river is not suitable.  It is not roadstone, we are told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the solution of the problem is but it is a great hardship on the people on the land.  The Board of Works have done excellent work and it is exasperating for them to find that the only reaction they get is a lot of protest over the countryside.  I do not see what else the Board of Works could do than put the spoil out on the land.  I cannot imagine though that they do not sympathise with the distress of the smallholder who is jealous of every square yard of his land because his holding is so small.  I <Col N="214" /> wonder how many Deputies know one of the principal reasons why the West of Ireland has become denuded of trees&mdash;because most of the small farmers cannot afford to keep trees. The shade of trees renders land on small holdings infertile, and for the same reason they cannot afford to keep the spoil from the drainage on their land.  There is a kind of strip on the riverside which they feel has been effectively cut off their farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has had any opportunity of giving this matter consideration and if any solution for it has occurred to him.</P>
      <P>There is very modest provision here for national monuments.  Perhaps at the risk of going bust, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot provide as liberally for things as he would wish.  All the Parliamentary Secretary has been allowed on the subhead is £60,000. There is, however, something he can do.  I emphatically approve of the work of the Board of Works in the maintenance and restoration of the ancient monuments which they have taken in charge.  They have worked with the best and made great improvements, and have resisted imprudent exhortations to put roofs on ancient buildings where roofs would turn some of these ancient monuments into fakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect, however, where the Board of Works are making a mistake. You very often find, when passing these ancient buildings, that there is no clear indication available to the passerby that all the information he seeks is available.  When I pass one of these monuments and see the little black and white card that goes with it, I know the Board of Works has this but if I see any other plaque, I get out of my car to read it.  It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to design some chaste, aesthetic, artistic sign which would indicate that this monument is in charge of the Board of Works and at the same time, would communicate to the passerby that in the vicinity of this sign he will find an informative tablet or inscription which <Col N="215" /> will give him the fundamental facts about the object which he has under contemplation.</P>
    <P>I give that as a suggestion to the Board of Works.  Their work deserves to be appreciated by the average passerby, by the tourist and by those of us who pay for it.  I often complain, and I now complain, that bodies like the Board of Works hear all the criticism that people feel it their obligation to make on the occasion of the annual Estimate but few bother to pay tributes which hard work deserves.  I think those who have charge of our monuments and the Board of Works generally have us all in their debt for the work they do in this regard.  The only fault I have to find with them is that they blow their own bugle with a somewhat uncertain note and I would urge upon them to draw a little more public attention to the excellence of their performance in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to deal with is this.  This Vote speaks of public works and buildings but the Parliamentary Secretary is charged with the preservation of our ancient monuments. Deputy Larkin speaking on this aspect of the matter in its application to the city of Dublin and to other cities spoke of the clearance of sites without adequate archeological survey of the site before a new building is set upon it.  I want to speak of the devastation that is being wrought in the architecture of the city of Dublin. I see that a school&mdash;is it the Royal Hibernian School?  &mdash;is to move out to some location bought for it outside the city.  That appears to me to be a very fine early Georgian building. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what is going to happen to it?</P>

That is what I am saying to them: take it over before some warrior arrives from Soho with an upstanding crane to take the roof off and pull it down and erect some pillbox.  That is what they may plan to do.  You will have a supermarket on it before you know where you are.  I wanted to take over the whole of Mountjoy Square when I was Minister for Agriculture and was quite prepared to move the entire Department of Agriculture up there.  I think it would have been a very good thing to do.  I think <Col N="217" /> it would have been a damn sight better thing to move the Department of Agriculture to Mountjoy Square and restore all these Georgian buildings and accommodate the Department there than to park them in Ansley House.</P>

If I had been given anything like 17/4d a square foot, I could have actuated the Board of Works to take over the whole of Mountjoy Square and we would have one of the loveliest Georgian Squares in Europe intact and protected for evermore.  Now Stephen's Green is disappearing under our eyes.  I am in fear and terror that I will wake up some morning to be told that the Board of Works have sold out.  They have started on the corner from Hume Street to the Board of Works.  The Board of Works at the moment is itself staying the flood but the Church Representative Body building is gone.</P>

Otherwise, Stephen's Green is virtually gone and gone in my lifetime, gone since the end of the war.  I am waiting for the vandals to start on Merrion Square.</P>

      <P>This is what drives me frantic.  The poor old Turks at least were coming in with fire and sword to establish the Mahomedan religion and believed that they had a great cause and for this cause they should burn down cities and massacre populations. We are allowing fellows with chequebooks to come in and do it.  The people of Europe 500 years ago defended these things with their lives against the Turks.  Don John of Austria was on one side and the Spaniards on the other holding them at bay.  But, I declare to God, if the vandal comes in here, not armed with fire or sword, but with a blooming chequebook, he can wreak more havoc upon our native city than the Turkish army was allowed to do in Europe 500 years ago. Does that not humiliate every one of us, whether we were born in Dublin or not?</P>
      <P>I was born and reared in one of these Georgian houses in North Great George's Street.  It is still there, thanks be to God.  I know what treasures they were.  I lived in a house in London and every door in it came from Frederick Street, and two of the mantelpieces. I do not think they are bothering to preserve the doors or the mantelpieces. They all go out in the junk heap.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera probably sympathises with my view and I am sure Deputy Larkin sympathises with my view.  I shrewdly suspect that the Parliamentary Secretary sympathises with my view.  How is it that we cannot do anything about it?</P>

      <P>Surely the preservation of ancient monuments comes under the Office of Public Works?  However, it does not matter; I have said what I want to say.  I have spoken of archaeological treasures but we have other treasures than archaeological treasures. We have architectural treasures in this country.  They need protection, too. They have no protection by the same procedure as the archaeological remains.  There is no town planning that can say: &ldquo;You must not knock down that building&rdquo;.  What it can say is: &ldquo;If you knock down that building, you must satisfy the town planner that you will substitute for it something that is suitable and acceptable to the town planner&rdquo;.  That is not what I want.  I want the sovereign Government of this country to say: &ldquo;There are certain buildings that we will not let anybody knock down&rdquo;.  Unless we hurry up and do it, irreparable damage will be done.  I want to give the Parliamentary Secretary two cases in point.</P>

      <P>He can take over any building he likes that is deemed to be an ancient building.  For instance, suppose the Royal Hospital is standing vacant tomorrow, can he not take it over as an ancient monument? He took over Carrick-on-Suir Castle where <Col N="220" /> Anne Boleyn was born.  I suppose if he took that over, he can take over a more respectable building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  If he can take it over at all, it can be done.  He can go and negotiate with the Royal Hospital.  I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee how he takes it over, so long as the havoc that may be caused is avoided.</P>
      <P>Cement Limited bought a site at the bottom of Fitzwilliam Square.  They got an architect who managed to wreck the building which preserved the facade of that unique Georgian square. Right opposite it, the ESB tore down Fitzwilliam Street.  I am told now&mdash;I did not know this then&mdash;that the ESB were offered the full economic value of those houses by a body that was prepared to exploit them as residential flats.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;protect not only our archaeological treasures but our architectural treasures as well?  I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary, in spite of some difficulty for himself, has succeeded in making some beginning on the archaeological side.  I agree with him that it is not the length of the road that matters; it is taking the first step upon the journey that is significant.  I do not believe that he or any of his successors will arrest the progress of the work he has initiated. Therefore, for me his name will be always associated with it.  I would like to be able to make the same association in defence of the architectural heritage which is ours.</P>

    <Col N="221" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should begin where Deputy Dillon left off.  He referred specifically to St. Stephen's Green, which brings up a general question with which the Office of Public Works has no direct dealing, the general question of the preservation of Georgian Dublin and, arising from that, the determination of precisely how we as a nation ought to proceed in the preservation of Georgian Dublin as we know it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is any Deputy who goes out through those doors and looks out from the landing across Merrion Square or takes the trouble to go down Merrion Square and look at Fitzwilliam Street and Fitzwilliam Square and other areas of Dublin like that but would agree with Deputy Dillon that we have here in Dublin architectural treasures which definitely ought to be preserved.  It is a far cry from agreeing with those sentiments to posturing, as Deputy Dillon does, as the Last Knight of Europe taking weapons from the war or possibly even like the Pope, casting his arms abroad for agony and loss and calling the Kings of Christendom for Swords about the Cross.  It is easy to talk about Lepanto and become very dramatic. Deputy Dillon is not alone in this failing. I would call it a human failing. It is a tendency among a great many people&mdash;some of them mere pedants, ignorant pedants, who jump on this bandwagon, attach themselves to a cause that is in itself worthy and damage it and destroy it by their protestations of a superior appreciation of things such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or by their mob activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, occasionally. I came across a reference recently in a journal that circulates in this city.  I forget the name of it, but it has something vaguely to do with the building trade.  It was asserting that I and other officers of the Office of Public Works were taking a fiendish delight in the destruction of Georgian Dublin for some pecuniary reason, for the reason, it was suggested in this article, that I and others were making <Col N="222" /> a good thing out of it, and this was a source of greenbacks, as the article said, for myself and for other people in the Office of Public Works.  This is the type of thing I am talking about, of either the half-crazy fanatic or the ignorant pedant attaching himself to a cause that is in itself a worthy cause.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is the very Deputy I heard in this House wringing his hands in horror about a tragedy which occurred some years ago in this city of Dublin when a Georgian type building fell down and caused a fatal accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Georgian-type&rdquo; is a good word.  It was built about 1872 by a scratch builder&mdash;I forget his name.  It was beside Archer's Garage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that when a building becomes unsafe, whether it is a Georgian building or any other kind of building, it can very well fall down.  This is the one that Deputy Dillon wrung his hands about. He had a phrase about it, a catchcry or cant that he used: &ldquo;The houses are falling down on the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the houses about which the most recent furore has arisen, No. 1 Hume Street, is in bad structural condition and is potentially dangerous.  I think, therefore, that the best thing that can be done with a house such as that, before it causes a fatal accident, is to have it taken down.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to this. Deputy Dillon has suggested more than once, including today in this House, that the Office of Public Works itself will soon come under the attentions of the Turks, the destroyers, the boyos from Soho.  That is not so.  There is no question of the boyos from Soho interfering with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to make a Lepanto of the gable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who brought Lepanto into the discussion. <Col N="223" /> Why, I cannot imagine.  Between No. 46 St. Stephen's Green and the Office of Public Works, there was a group of, I think, three Georgian houses called Dominican Hall.  These have been taken down&mdash;I do not, like other people, put myself forward as an expert in these matters or as one with a particularly refined perception&mdash;but I appreciate what people mean when they speak of &ldquo;Georgian Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my view, that side of St. Stephen's Green from the end of Merrion Row down to St. Vincent's Hospital will have been irreparably damaged or, at least, changed by the removal of Dominican Hall.  It has been removed and I think it is a very debatable point now whether the retention of No. 46 and the decrepit and potentially dangerous No. 1 Hume Street would, even if they were preserved, add anything to the Georgian character of St. Stephen's Green or to its architectural harmony on that side.  I do not think there is any certainty that the person who will develop the area must of necessity build a glass and concrete monstrosity such as those which have been built in other parts of the city.  I do not know why Dublin Corporation cannot regulate the building of new structures in areas such as St. Stephen's Green or why their architects cannot achieve an effect such as that to which Deputy Dillon referred in relation to Irish Cement Limited.</P>
      <P>This matter of the preservation of Georgian Dublin does not really arise on this Vote at all, but, since the Office of Public Works has been accused of being philistine in this matter and accused of being mercenary, it is necessary that we should at least face up to the facts.  I think Dublin Corporation should immediately prepare a plan for the preservation of large areas of Georgian Dublin.  In this connection, I should like to refer to a visit I paid to an exhibition run by An Taisce.  It is still running in Dawson Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The exhibition deals with this very subject.  With that as a starting point, there is a type of defined plan for the preservation of Georgian Dublin and steps should <Col N="224" /> now be taken towards preservation rather than leave the whole thing in the hands of pedants and cranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And vandals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>And ignorant people who, as I have said a couple of times already, besmirch this very worthy cause by their unwarranted support.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the tribute paid by Deputy Cosgrave and others to the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works and to say that I, like them, recognise the fact that provision in the Estimate for the preservation of our national monuments is lamentably small and that, if it were not for the work of unselfish, utterly patriotic, people like Father Egan of Ballintubber and, on a more parochial level, of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, the matter of preservation might be more unsatisfactory still. These two have, each in his own way, done something for Ireland which is of real value.  They have preserved something very worthy of preservation for us and for those who will come after us and the appreciation and thanks of the House and of the Irish nation are due to them.</P>
      <P>I should hope that, in the context of an annual Vote which, however it may be improved, will always be proportionately somewhat less than sufficient, other groups will take example from people like Father Egan and the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and take on, in their own respective localities, the job of preserving some national monument.  There is scarcely an area in which there is not some notable monument of national importance which ought to be preserved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Royal Hospital and the publicity it got in recent times.  He also referred to the necessity that there is, and it is recognised, of a very careful estimate being made before jobs of this kind are embarked on.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 13th December, 1966.</P>
