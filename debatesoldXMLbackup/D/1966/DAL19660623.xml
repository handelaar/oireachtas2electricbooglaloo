    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last night, I was dealing with what could be described as a transition period and discussing the disadvantages the Taoiseach has as against the advantages the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party had. I pointed out that one of the ways the Taoiseach had of overcoming these disadvantages was by increasing taxation in the belief that the Government who spent most remained popular longest and that, thereby, he could establish himself safely in the saddle as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present financial position of the country cannot be ignored.  It is completely unfair for Deputies in Government benches to take exception to references by Opposition Deputies to this position, when these Deputies continually in defence of the Government refer to the financial circumstances prevailing in the 1956-57 period.  I was not a Member of this House at that time but I was a businessman, and I have made it my business to assess the financial situation which then existed in order that <Col N="1173" /> I might arrive at some rational conclusion as to the cause of that situation.</P>
    <P>There were many reasons for the financial circumstances which confronted the inter-Party Government in 1956-57.  The inter-Party Government were not in complete control of some of the circumstances then obtaining and, therefore, were not in a position to resolve the difficulties arising from them.  That cannot be said of the present situation.  In respect of most of the ills which have caused the credit squeeze now obtaining and the apparent bankruptcy of the Government, the Government themselves are the architects of their own downfall.</P>
    <P>I strengthen my argument by saying that in 1956-57 the inter-Party Government built houses, spent money on social services, invested money in agriculture, laid the foundations for the industrialisation of the nation, spurred the people out of the stagnation that affected them after a period during which Fianna Fáil controlled public opinion.  They were, as it were, prepared to tolerate that particular situation and live with it. These are some of the domestic matters which one could say caused industrial unrest and economic difficulties in the 1956-57 period.  As I said, I was not a Member of this House in 1956-57 but we all have recourse to Dáil debates.  We can read the speeches made by Government Ministers. We can read the speeches made by members of the Government who were then in Opposition and we can draw our own conclusions.</P>
    <P>While I was not a Member of this House, I feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that the Fine Gael Party as a member of the inter-Party Government found themselves in difficulties because they built more houses, because they spent more money on afforestation, because they spent money on major drainage, because they ploughed money into agriculture and because they tried to get this country on its feet.  Admittedly, international crises interrupted the programme of that Government, but we cannot ignore, when reading Dáil debates of that period, those Members who now claim that it is a foul to criticise the present Government, that we should <Col N="1174" /> not rock the boat when they themselves caused havoc then.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Taoiseach's speech of last week was tantamount to saying to us: &ldquo;Don't hit me now with the child in my arms&rdquo;.  He reminded us there was a fight on.  Might I remind the Taoiseach that if there is a fight on in this House, it should not be between the Government Party and the main Opposition Parties?  The fight should be against social injustices.  What the Taoiseach should concern himself with is the fight to rid this nation of poverty, the fight to provide more houses, the fight to provide more employment.  We shall not hold the Taoiseach to his promise of 100,000 new jobs.  If he does his best and if he can, in fact, keep employment at the level now existing for the next two or three years, I personally will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government are telling the truth.  I believe the Government at the moment are in dire straits, that the attitude of the Taoiseach from reading his speech and the speeches of all Government Deputies and Minister, and referring particularly to the very rude interruptions of some of the back bench Deputies now and again, lead us to believe that the Government are bluffing, blundering&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They are no ruder than any of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and bullying.  This is nothing new to a Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;to bluff, bully and blunder.  The financial position of the country at the moment is, in my opinion, due to inflation as has been mentioned by many speakers over the past 12 months or so, and indeed particularly by Deputy Dillon two or three years ago, when he warned the Taoiseach then of the pending financial and political developments in countries like Great Britain and the United States.  When the Taoiseach was riding his high horse in this Parliament immediately after the 12 per cent increase and the status increases to higher civil servants, when he was leading his merry band of men and being admired in public houses and at street corners as being the wonder worker, Members on this side of the House warned him that circumstances <Col N="1175" /> in America and in Great Britain were somewhat different from those prevailing in this country, both politically and economically.</P>
      <P>At that time the British Government &mdash;the Conservative Party, rather&mdash; were trying to win back the confidence of the British people and were throwing money into the British economy in the hope that they would make their Party more popular and President Johnson in the United States was also expecting, and knew that he would have to fight, a Presidential election.  Apart from these two matters, the economies of both of these countries could afford to do a bit of gambling.  I doubt that this Government, and indeed this country, could afford to be careless for one week, but during that period it was evident, when people looking at the economic structure of both Great Britain and America were inclined to believe and accept that a boom period existed in these two great countries and it has always been the case that when such a boom period did exist, we had pretty good times and that when either of those countries got a cold, we got pneumonia.</P>
      <P>I remember Deputy Dillon warning the Taoiseach that the circumstances prevailing in those two countries should not be used as an argument for proving prosperity in this country and that as soon as the Presidential election in America was over and as soon as the Conservative Party who were then doomed to defeat became the Opposition in Westminster, the economic brake would be put on in these two countries, and that we were heading for depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Deputies on the opposite side of the House accusing Deputy Dillon, as indeed they still do, of being a pessimist, of being a prophet of doom but Deputy Dillon could foresee the future.  He was speaking three years ago in this House and he described three years ago what would happen, and what, in fact, has happened.  But, because it was unpopular for Deputy Dillon to say so and because the Taoiseach realised that there could be something in <Col N="1176" /> Deputy Dillon's argument, he elected to go to the country a few months earlier than he might have gone because he knew if he delayed too long, he might be too late.</P>
    <P>My whole argument is this: if the present Administration proposes to do anything, if by collective responsibility they decide on a particular course, it is done more for political purposes than in the national interest.  Most of the major decisions taken by the Government since I became a Member of the House five years ago were taken because it was politically wise, irrespective of whether or not it was in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Today the Government find themselves hawking their credit through Western Europe, Great Britain and the North American continent.  They remind me of a person going to the local bank manager when times are hard and convincing him that because of certain circumstances, he is financially embarrassed.  The bank manager falling for the story increases his overdraft by another £100 or £200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many bank managers might think like that 12 months ago but even if they thought that way now, they would not have the money because the Government have raided their banks also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Fianna Fáil Deputy from Dublin, if he has not already spoken, will make a better case for the Government than previous speakers have made.  The Government remind me of a hard-pressed man in a small town who persuades his bank manager that he needs a higher overdraft and the bank manager increases it by £100.  The man comes out and demonstrates to his neighbours that <Col N="1177" /> prosperity is again with him and spends his overdraft.  Then he goes back to the bank manager or goes to another bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin):</i> They would not be long in business if they worked in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as long as the Government will be in business if they continue on their present course because that is exactly what the Government are doing, living from day to day on increased overdraft accommodation. This person goes to another bank manager and again succeeds and proceeds to demonstrate that his household is in order and prosperity is there again.  &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  That is the fundamental policy of the Government: live happily and let tomorrow take care of itself.  They have short-term economic policies.</P>
      <P>On 31st March we had a national debt of £714 million and, according to a reply by the Minister for Finance to a Parliamentary Question yesterday, it has increased by another £7.7 million inside ten weeks, since the previous Budget.  Deputy Fitzpatrick may say that bank managers do not lend money to customers such as I described. Neither do good banking companies lend money to Governments whose book-keeping is not as good as they would have us believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About nine months ago the Minister for Finance left the country in mysterious circumstances and the next thing we heard was that he was in New York.  He arrived back to tell us that he had negotiated a $20 million loan, approximately £7 million.  They proceeded to spend that money before they got it.  At that time the Agricultural Credit Corporation found itself in a very difficult situation, having pledged millions of pounds to farmers who had applied for loans for short or lengthy periods.  Their files were full of applications by farmers for amounts ranging from £100 to £20,000, all sanctioned but with no money to pay them.  The Government told the Agricultural Credit Corporation to go ahead and lend this money, that they had negotiated a £7 million loan on the New York Stock Exchange.  But <Col N="1178" /> something went wrong.  According to the Minister for Finance when he was queried by Deputy Sweetman last week, they were told that unless they put their books, as it were, in order, things could become slippy.  Things did become slippy, with the result that the loan was not forthcoming.  I am told that pandemonium existed in Government circles, one Minister blaming the other for the faults then existing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance took himself off to West Germany and there negotiated a loan of £5 million.  In the meantime, of course, he had raided practically every semi-Government fund in the country.  They had slowed up payments to local authorities and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes we wonder. We find that the Government, having raided every fund in the country where there was money, having delayed payments to local authorities, have now landed in Canada and negotiated another loan of £5 million from what Deputy L'Estrange described as the Eskimos in Nova Scotia. Maybe there is some significance in this, in that, if the Minister for Local Government does not build his houses, he might provide us with igloos.  At least, some of the people in the city of Dublin and in my constituency would be better <Col N="1179" /> living in an igloo than in some of the houses they must live in at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday, we had the Minister for Transport and Power making pronouncements in this House. He spoke on practically every subject except CIE and the ESB.  When the Minister for Transport and Power is asked a question in the House, he usually says he has no function in relation to CIE or to the ESB.  Reading his speeches would convince one that not alone has he no function but that he has not a clue as to what is happening in the ESB or in CIE.  However, he went ahead to describe the Government of which he is a member as being the most imaginative and inventive Government this country has ever had. The Taoiseach says that it is the best and most stable body in the world, a great body of men.  That is how these two gentlemen describe the Government Ministers.</P>
      <P>I could imagine the Taoiseach sitting down to a discussion with his Cabinet Ministers and believing that all the Ministers are of the quality he thinks they are, that they are the best Government in Europe, that they are, as it were, the Real Madrid of Western Europe with the Taoiseach playing the supreme role of Di Stefano.  Real Madrid was, in my opinion, one of the greatest football teams Western Europe got to know but they are at the bottom of the ladder now.  Even if we were to accept the Taoiseach's claim that his Government were the Real Madrid in political circles of Western Europe I think, like Real Madrid, they have now hit a very low level and it is time the Taoiseach was making room for new men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have taken many chances.  It is a gambler's Government. I suppose it could be described as an adventurer's Government.  I expect that the life of an adventurer is an exciting one.  I expect that many <Col N="1180" /> people, when talking about the present Taoiseach, speak with a certain amount of excitement of some of the adventures he embarked upon.  I am left with the thought that an adventurer's life is a gambler's life.  Political punters would admire a gambler but the only people who are happy, in the final analysis, are the political bookmakers, the Dr. Singers, the Potez people and a list of other broken-down gentlemen who came to this country talking fast talk to a Government more concerned about mushroom industries than the first and best industry the country has got, namely, agriculture. I am convinced, as are a lot of other people, that, if the amount of money spent on these mushroom industries had been ploughed into agriculture, not now but many years ago, this country would have one of the soundest economies in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>This second Budget is only to pay for the debt that the Government have created.  There is very little money in the Budget to provide better services for our people.  As far as I know, there is no money in the Budget that will speed up the provision of housing, particularly in my constituency of North-East Donegal, which, I might add, also sends the Minister for Local Government to this House, the man who is directly responsible for providing the money for new houses.</P>
    <P>Donegal County Council propose to build 18 new houses during this current year.  After they pay their debt for last year, they have approximately £36,000 left to build houses.  That £36,000, no matter how it is spent, will provide no more than 18 county council cottages.  Every Deputy is aware that £2,000 does not provide a mansion of a dwelling nowadays.  It is a very humble home but, humble as it may be, many people would be glad to use it.</P>
    <P>There are many rumours in circulation in Donegal.  We had great excitement there in the past week or so. Many rumours are circulating the hills and dales there as to why Deputy Cunningham resigned as Chairman of the county council.  I am sorry he is not in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out to the House that in this Budget, no money is provided for extra housing. I was coming to the point that Deputy Cunningham, according to himself, feels that many people believe he resigned as chairman of the Donegal County Council because the county manager and his staff were not providing sufficient houses.  I was mentioning this just in passing.  Deputy Cunningham like many other Government Deputies, thinks that county managers should work the miracle of the loaves and fishes in providing more houses than they have money to build.  The Deputy is also aware that not one house is being provided this year on the Inishowen Peninsula, an area in which there are 32,000 people. The local authority are not providing one house other than what will be provided by private builders.  People who normally would be the responsibility of the local authority to rehouse, are, because of frustration and the need to be re-housed, mortgaging everything they possess and persuading relatives to go bail for them, and they are making a genuine effort to provide houses for themselves and their families.  In other words, they are assuming the responsibility which is actually the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be all right if the local authority could provide finance by way of loan from the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts but we find that the Donegal County Council have only £8,000 to lend potential builders of <Col N="1182" /> private houses this year.  The sum of £60,000 has been pledged&mdash;it has not yet been paid&mdash;to the Donegal County Council and of this £52,000 has been pledged by the county manager to applicants up to 31st March of this year, leaving the local authority with £8,000 to lend to people who have applied since 31st March.  Unofficially I am told that almost £20,000 has been applied for since 31st March.</P>
    <P>What efforts are the Government making to help people who have the courage to assume the responsibility which the local authority refuses to accept?  The Government have not provided one service to help people over this difficulty but they are very willing to hand out money to the Potez people, to the Dr. Singers and to every brokendown&mdash;there are many words we could use to describe these gentlemen but we will just call them gentlemen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a nice word to use.  I believe this Government have lost all sense of responsibility, have forgotten all the principles of social justice.  I am left with the thought that the Government have been so long in power that they now treat their responsibility and the electorate with the utmost contempt.  They believe they can kick the people around and still be returned to this House. Gone are the days when it was said in rural Ireland that if Fianna Fáil burnt down their cottages, they would creep out of the ashes and shout &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo;.  Going, and going fast, are the days when people voted for a political Party because their fathers and grandfathers voted for it.  That is a good thing.  Even if it meant the dissolution of the Fine Gael Party, even if it meant the disappearance of the Fine Gael Party because of this evolution in political thought, I believe it is right that people should I think for themselves. The results of the Presidential election showed clearly that the Government had lost the confidence of their people.  This is bad but it is really worse than it appears because if a Government have not the confidence <Col N="1183" /> of their people, then they cannot expect to have the confidence of foreigners and cannot expect to have the respect of people who would like to invest money in this country.  Unless there is confidence in a Government, there will be no confidence in the economy or in the economic policies of a country.</P>
      <P>This to me is the worst factor of this economic situation.  Irrespective of what the Taoiseach may say about going it alone, irrespective of the rosy pictures he paints, the naked truth is that we must depend on foreign investment and on other countries to protect our economy.  If we cannot get the confidence of foreign countries in our economy, then a very gloomy situation must result.  As Deputy Dillon said last week, inflation, when it is first noticed, appeals to the imagination of everyone.  When a worker receives an increase in his pay packet, he is not too concerned about where that increase came from.  He is happy that he has received it and he is going to spend it.  The salary earner is a bit more informed and understands the financial situation somewhat better, but he is caught in the same dilemma and is more concerned about receiving the increase than where it came from. During that period of inflation, everything in the garden is rosy but when the moment of truth arrives, when we are all called to heel, then the lowerpaid worker, the person on the bottom rung, feels the full brunt of the economic trouble.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon went on to explain that one of the things that might help the Taoiseach in the particular situation in which he finds himself would be if Harold Wilson devalued the £.  I believe that to be the naked truth. Those in well informed circles, the rich who make it their business to understand finance, protect themselves against the results of devaluation but the person on the bottom rung of the ladder does not know what is happening until it has happened and he is then in no position to protect himself.</P>

      <P>That has been the result of the Taoiseach's policy since he took office in 1959.  If any Government Deputy can put forward an argument to defend that policy, I shall listen very attentively to it, but I am convinced that the reason the Taoiseach embarked on this economic policy is that he lacks the imagination of his former leader and fails to project himself to the Irish people in the way his former leader did.  The Taoiseach does not have the same appeal, that appeal which induced the Irish people to vote for his former leader irrespective of what he did.  That was amply demonstrated in the recent Presidential election.</P>
      <P>I believe it was this lack on the part of the Taoiseach which compelled him to embark on this policy of steadily increasing taxation, believing that, if the Government spent more, they would be popular.  That policy may be all right in a country with increasing production and increasing exports, but one cannot increase taxation on a nation which is fast disappearing.  No sooner is taxation increased than more people are out of employment and more people leave the country.  The boats carry the thousands of our people to Britain and America and that, in turn, means a loss to our economy.  The argument has been put forward by Government speakers that taxation is increasing in other countries. But so are the populations of these countries.  That cannot be said of our country.  Irrespective of what constituency a Deputy represents or to which Party he belongs, he could not make this claim.</P>
      <P>The Minister described the taxation imposed in this Budget as a selective tax.  I should like to know what articles will carry this extra five per cent.</P>

      <P>We have not yet been told, though that question has been <Col N="1185" /> posed by different speakers on this side of the House to the few Ministers who have so far spoken in this debate. That question has been asked by senior members of this Party and of the Labour Party.  So far, it has remained unanswered.  Perhaps the Minister would, when he is replying, tell us what the articles will be.  Perhaps he might tell his backbenchers or some of his colleagues in the Cabinet specifically what will be taxed under this five per cent selective tax, as he calls it.</P>
      <P>He has also stated that this five per cent will operate at wholesale level.  By the time the commodity reaches the hands of the consumer, it will be carrying a tax of 7½ per cent.  When the turnover tax was introduced, this side of the House argued that that tax should apply at source and not at retail level.  Apparently now the Minister has accepted that that argument was right.  He will, of course, now have it both ways.  He is, as it were, riding two horses at the one time.  He has the five per cent selective tax at source and the 2½ per cent turnover tax at retail level.  I should like the Minister to deal in particular with that when he comes to reply because most Deputies cannot understand it and, if Deputies, who are in an informed position, cannot understand it, what hope of understanding it have the ordinary people?  There is confusion as to what is being taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all the boasting of the present Administration, when the Taoiseach attends functions outside this House and when the Ministers of his Cabinet attend similar functions, they mostly use the occasion to state Government policy and to further their Party's interests with more propaganda.  The acid test of prosperity is not the rosy speeches made by Government Ministers or by the Taoiseach; the acid test of prosperity is the population of the country.  If the population of the country dwindles, as it has since the Taoiseach took office seven years ago, it is not a good sign.  Since he replaced the former Leader, one-third of a million people, 330,000, have emigrated from this small State.  These are the <Col N="1186" /> figures presented by the Taoiseach's office.</P>
    <P>If we had prosperity, those 330,000 people would not have emigrated. They did not emigrate for the sake of emigration.  They did not elect to live in the cities of Great Britain or the United States in order to see the bright lights and to experience a new way of living.  They emigrated because it was necessary for them to emigrate in order to provide a better standard of living for themselves.  To me, the reason they have emigrated spotlights the standard of prosperity here.  I am satisfied that the arguments I put forward to the House are shared by many members in the Government benches.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture in 1964, and in dramatic and exciting circumstances resigned his post as Minister for Agriculture, he did not resign as Minister for Agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet to hit the headlines or for the fun of it.  Despite the disagreements we may have had with Deputy Smith in his agricultural policies, we must ask ourselves, with a certain amount of suspicion, did Deputy Smith foresee in 1964 the circumstances now prevailing in the country?  I do not think it unfair of us on this side of the House to answer that question by saying that Deputy Smith did see those circumstances.  A Deputy who is Minister of State, having served the nation and this House for so long, is in contact with public opinion.  He is alive to and aware of the circumstances prevailing in the country, and he is intelligent enough to read the political and economic indicators that present themselves. We are left&mdash;and personally I am left&mdash;with the conclusion that Deputy Smith resigned because he knew the captain of the ship of State was heading for the rocks.  Very soon, if he does not resign from the Government, he will be a captain without a vessel.</P>
    <P>Likewise when the former Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, indicated that he wished no longer to serve as a Minister in the Lemass administration, was he beginning to have his doubts about the economic policies of the Government? <Col N="1187" /> Did he resign because he wanted to hit the headlines?  Did he resign because of petty misunderstandings with colleagues in the Government?  Or did he resign because he was sick of the whole affair and was now past the point of no return.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think it unfair of us on this side of the House to answer that question by saying that Deputy MacEntee was convinced that the Taoiseach's economic policies were wrong.  Deputy MacEntee more or less proved to us that that is the way he was thinking, because we remember that less than three months ago, when the Minister for Finance introduced the first Budget of this year into the House, Deputy MacEntee wrote a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> in which he proceeded to tell the Minister for Finance what went wrong with that first Budget of 1966.  If Deputy MacEntee had the audacity to take one of his former colleagues in the Cabinet to task in a public fashion, as he did, he must have had the same arguments within Cabinet circles when he was Tánaiste and a senior member of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not wishful thinking on our part to think in this direction.  This is pure commonsense.  Deputy MacEntee, remember, was Tánaiste and if the Taoiseach, for some reason or another, resigned or found it impossible to continue as Taoiseach, Deputy MacEntee would have been Taoiseach.  Then what would have been the position? Would Deputy MacEntee have sacked all the soothsayers he talked about in his letter to the <i>Irish Times</i>?  Would he have sacked all the Government Ministers, or would he have refused to lead the country?  Again, would there have been economic revolution in the country and political revolution within the Fianna Fáil Administration? These are questions that, perhaps, will never be answered, but I emphasise that I do not think it unfair of any speaker on this side of the House to pose such questions and to come to the same conclusions to which I have come.</P>
    <P>Not alone did Deputy MacEntee resign, but the former Minister for <Col N="1188" /> Finance, who held the most important office in the Government, the former Deputy Ryan, who is now a member of Seanad Éireann, indicated to the Taoiseach that he wished no longer to serve as Minister for Finance, or indeed as a member of this House. Again, was it because the former Minister for Finance wished to hit the headlines? Was it because he had doubts about who was right&mdash;the Taoiseach or Deputy Smith, 18 months prior to that time?  In any case Deputy Ryan refused to serve further in administration. The same arguments can be put forward by Members speaking from Opposition benches as to why Deputy Ryan refused to serve any longer. This may not have the same pronounced effect or be exactly the same reason why Deputy Smith resigned and why Deputy MacEntee refused to continue as Tánaiste, because, as it were, the former Minister for Finance was at the helm with &ldquo;Lemass leading on&rdquo; and he had to share more responsibility than the other two former Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are left with this: when the Taoiseach, prior to the last general election stated publicly that the 1965 general election would be the last in which he would lead his Party, did he foresee the circumstances now prevailing in the country?  Was he now in despair, having listened to the arguments of the different Ministers who resigned, torn asunder between those Ministers and certain other Ministers whose integrity may not be as high as that of the Ministers who had the courage of their convictions, late as it may have been, and who resigned? Prior to the 1965 general election, was he of such a state of mind that he questioned the loyalty of his own back bench when he could not command the lovalty of his own Cabinet Ministers?  These are all very pertinent questions, quite separate but very much relevant to the present financial circumstances in the country because, if the Taoiseach cannot command the respect and loyalty of his own Cabinet if he cannot command the loyalty of his own back bench, he should not expect any loyalty from the people who are not members of his Party but <Col N="1189" /> who have voted for him in recent general elections and by-elections because of certain promises made by him.</P>
    <P>The high taxation in this country is spotlighted and brought very forcibly to mind, particularly to the minds of Deputies representing constituencies in this House which border on the six north-eastern counties of Ireland.  Petrol in the Six Counties is from 10d to 1/-a gallon cheaper than it is in the Twenty-Six Counties, the Republic of Ireland.  This, in effect, means that any person motoring an average of 600 miles per week&mdash;which is approximately the average motoring of any commercial traveller or, indeed, of any person who does any standard of motoring whatsoever&mdash;will pay £1 per week more for his petrol, in taxation, in this country than he would if he lived and bought his petrol in the Six Counties.  The Government have increased motor taxation by 25 per cent in the first Budget of this year.  The road taxation on a motor vehicle in the Six Counties is £17 per annum. The road tax at the moment on a 12 horse power car here is £31 per annum, and the average car being driven on the roads is a 12 horse power car.  How can the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister in Government, have the audacity to visit the city of Belfast, sit down and discuss trade agreements with their opposite numbers in Stormont and expect the workers in this country to compete with the workers in the Six Counties if they are to pay such penal taxes?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, might I say very little money is provided in these two recent Budgets for expansion?  Practically no money has been provided for new housing and little or no money has been provided for the social welfare classes.  Indeed all sorts of false economies are being aimed at, and particularly, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I should like to refer to one particular complaint in my constituency&mdash;which I suppose you are more alive to and aware of than I am &mdash;in relation to the Department of <Col N="1190" /> Education.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried in my own way to present to the House a picture of what I see wrong in this country. It is the responsibility of every elected representative in this House to state bluntly and clearly the feelings he <Col N="1192" /> has within him, the way he sees the situation, particularly in his own constituency, and in the nation.  I have tried to do that.  If my argument is accepted as being correct, I am left in this position, that if I were the Taoiseach of a Government who had tried every trick of the trade, played every card in the pack, and arrived at the position in which the Taoiseach now finds himself, I would feel that the honest thing would be to resign. It may be the hardest thing for the Taoiseach to do now but history will be more severe on the Taoiseach for adhering to his idle gospels, his false policies, at the expense of the economy which is staggering under the burden of taxation, trying to keep its head above water while the Government are strangling it to death.</P>
    <P>The honest thing for the Taoiseach in these circumstances is to do what Deputy John A. Costello did as Taoiseach of an inter-Party Government, when he found that he no longer had the confidence of the Irish people, let alone the confidence of some of the elected representatives of the House. The honourable thing, the honest thing and the decent thing for the Taoiseach to do is to resign and prove himself a man, late as it may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For me or for any other Deputy to state that the Irish people have been asked to undergo a great deal of hardship over the past 12 months would be a gross understatement. Over the past 12 months most sections of the Irish community have been called upon to bear hardships of a nature such as they could never have anticipated prior to the general election early in 1965.  Indeed, the people were encouraged to believe that the absolute reverse would be the case.  Added to all these hardships in which at least some sections of the community have been involved over the past 12 months, we had a first instalment of this year's Budget in March with its attendant heavy imposition of taxation.  Now before the House there is the second instalment of that Budget, with taxation, as Deputy Harte has just recounted, of such a nature that even those of us <Col N="1193" /> who are Members of the House are not absolutely sure of the impact. The time has come when all the Irish people, by which I mean those who support the Government Party just as those who support our Party or the Fine Gael Party, or any other people, are beginning to ask themselves and each other and, in particular, their public representatives, at least three questions.  The people I meet in mid-Cork are certainly asking me, among others, these three questions.</P>
      <P>These three questions are: What has caused all this, this financial crisis through which the country is now travelling?  Is there any sphere of our agricultural or social life which has not been affected by the shortage of finance?</P>
      <P>When will it all end, when can we hope that funds will again be available for the particular project or projects we have in mind and for which we have waited so long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first question we readily admit that there are some considerations outside the control of the Government of the day which have been a cause of the financial crisis. There have been contributing factors, possibly, such as the British import levy over which the Government have no control, but we in the Labour Party and those in the other Opposition Party, I know from their speeches, believe that there are other fundamental causes which are well within the ambit of the Government's power to control.  At the risk of repeating what many Deputies have said in the course of this debate, I must again go back to the imposition of the turnover tax in 1963.  I was not a Member of this House at this time but I know that at that time the Labour Party fought here against the imposition of that tax.  They warned the Government against the inadvisability, quite apart from the injustice, of that tax, applying as it does to all the necessaries of life.  They were told at the time that its imposition would have very little effect on prices beyond the 2½ per cent which was imposed.  In fact, we now know that the increase was from seven per cent to 11 per cent.  Following <Col N="1194" /> that turnover tax, we had the ninth round of wage increases, the deserved ninth round.  However badly timed, it was deserved early in the spring of 1964 and only a few nights ago, reading the speech of the Minister for Finance of that time, Deputy Ryan, on his Budget following the award of this ninth round of wage increases in 1964, I found in the Official Report of 14th April, 1964, at column 1537:</P>
    <P>Some of the initial strain on costs should be taken on profits, in consideration of the future easement when productivity has advanced. And workers should be encouraged to increase their individual savings.</P>
    <P>He went on to admonish the House and to state that if these steps were not taken, difficulties would arise which would require corrective action.  We all know that step No. 1&mdash;restraint on profits&mdash;was not taken, nor was there any encouragement or insistence by the Government that this should be done. Prices were allowed to soar and price control, our predecessors were told, would not work until the situation had got out of hand and we now find the Government are in the position where they say to themselves: &ldquo;It must work; it is essential.&rdquo;  We know that workers instead of being encouraged to save have, in fact, found that any increased benefits they got from the ninth round have been absorbed in increased prices.  They found the wage increases adequate to meet rising costs.  Again, we have these two Budgets, or two instalments of the one Budget, timed again to absorb any benefits the Irish workers might get from what is now termed the tenth round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>We suggest that in a short time they again will be back where they started. I would say it is unfair of the Government to place, as they have the tendency to do right now, all the blame for the state of the economy on the shoulders of that section of the workers who must organise and fight for their relatively small increase.  I say &ldquo;relatively small&rdquo; because I want to compare them with those in the upper income bracket who, apparently at any rate, can secure increases from £400 to <Col N="1195" /> £500 and up to £1,000 with little effort to all intents and purposes.  I am not saying there is no difficulty but there is never any open controversy about it. It would seem to the other sections of the community that these people get increases handed to them on a plate.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that when large increases are given, these workers are few in number in comparison with the section who must organise and fight. It might also be argued that their work is of a nature where parity cannot be established between them and other workers, where a precedent might not be established.  I contend this is not justice.  Naturally, it breeds unrest among the less wealthy section of the community who are fighting constantly to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech on the second instalment of this Budget, the Minister for Finance talked a good deal about redistribution.  He said&mdash; I have not got the exact quotation&mdash; that he was, in fact, concerned that the redistribution of the wealth that was there was among those sections of the community who needed it most.  I come back to this question of large wage increases to those in the upper income brackets, to show that those people who already have large increases are getting increases more than equal to the weekly wage of other members of the community, and to compare them with people such as old age pensioners, and widows and orphans who are still expected to live on £2-£3 a week in some cases. Realising that that situation is still allowed to continue, I think we cannot take much notice of anything the Minister says about a redistribution of the nation's wealth.</P>
    <P>Only a little while ago we had the Estimate for Lands and Forestry, to give just an example.  There we found that workers employed on estates taken over by the Land Commission were given a settling-in allowance of £225, as against the settling-in allowances for other officers employed in other spheres of activity of something like £2,000 to £3,000.  This is something I cannot understand.  I realise that a worker on a holding taken over by the Land <Col N="1196" /> Commission might possibly find it difficult to settle in.  He might be a man with a young family.  He might not find it possible to settle in as easily as he did in his own sphere before that land was taken over.  He is awarded something like £200 to settle himself and his family in life, while others who already had high pensions and allowances are allowed very large settling-in allowances.  I am not disputing the fact that settling-in allowances are necessary but I think the disparity is far too great.</P>
    <P>I come back to the second question I raised: is there any sphere of life which is not hit by this present crisis? Our answer must be there is not.  Rising prices and taxation on petrol and tobacco and a selective purchase tax will certainly affect all our people.  I was interested to hear Deputy Harte state that he was not sure what exactly will be taxed and what exactly will not be taxed under this new selective purchase tax.  Nobody knows as yet, but we can take it at this stage that the prices of all household commodities and utensils will rise considerably on and from next October.  We all have to live in houses and furnish them and replace utensils.  Possibly I know better than even my male colleagues the proportion of the family Budget it takes to keep a house stocked, refurnished and equipped.  Train fares, bus fares and even school fares have soared within the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Speaking of school fares, I have been very reliably informed that these fares have in many instances doubled since the recent increases by CIE.  We had hoped that this would not apply to school fares but, in fact, we are told that the school fares are the most badly hit by these new increases and that where fares were equal to 1/4 per day, they are now increased to 2/8.  We all know this is a very heavy imposition on the families and parents of those children who are attending school.</P>
    <P>There is one other question which I should like to ask, a question which has been troubling me since I heard of this new purchase tax.  Will it apply to school books?  I have not seen school books quoted as being exempt from <Col N="1197" /> this tax.  I hope they are not included because I do not think any Minister could argue that school books are not essential for any family with children.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing has been badly hit in the past 12 months.  In Cork County Council, we find ourselves £24,000 short of what we need to meet our present commitments.  That means that many people living in very bad conditions&mdash;and there are many such&mdash;must be told that they have no hope of having anything done for them regarding housing this year.  Because people could not anticipate this crisis we have a very serious situation for those building their own homes.  In the case of our housing loans, back since last April or May in County Cork, people were allocated loans provisionally when money became available. Some of them went ahead and built their homes, hoping the money would be available at the beginning of this financial year.  We find our allocation for the financial year is £590,000 and out of that, we are actually committed to a total of £585,000 which leaves at most £5,000 to cover all these people who built their homes on the strength of the provisional allocation by Cork County Council.  The others will have to wait 12 months and have no guarantee that the money will be available then.</P>
    <P>Roads cannot be brought up to standard.  That might not seem very important but it means a great deal to people in rural areas who need access roads to their farms.  Roads cannot be brought up to the standard required to have them taken over by the county council because for a long time no grants have been available under the Special Employment Schemes.  This was one of the first things that came to notice.  Special employment schemes were suspended because it was said the list of applications was so long but we know that the problem was financial. The money for county roads has been cut down and water and sewerage schemes are in practically the same position as housing.  The money was allocated at a very late stage this year and is not sufficient to meet what the county council have already committed themselves to.  We can assume that <Col N="1198" /> little or no work will be put in hands this year.</P>
    <P>School buildings are not being replaced. Without going into details, there are many badly serviced and unfit school buildings throughout the country, many insanitary hovels.  I think that with the priority list set up this year for the first time in the Department of Education, their hopes of replacement are very slim.  Most of those in which I am interested have been told they have no hope this year.  People have begun to despair.  They ask: when will all this end?  I wish, as I suppose every Deputy wishes, that we could tell them but we cannot.  I sincerely hope that when the Minister is replying he will give some hope that they can look forward to better things in the very near future.  If he cannot do that, cannot give a positive assurance to the Irish people that this situation will ease and that there is a brigher future for them, he and the Government should realise they no longer enjoy the mandate of the people to govern this country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin):</i> Listening to Deputy Desmond, I was impressed and I have no doubt she is sincerely concerned about her constituents. I did not intend to intervene, but listening to Deputy Harte led me to the conclusion that he completely lacks the business approach.  For half an hour last night and again today for an hour, we heard him going back over the past seven years and at no time did he put forward a constructive suggestion.  It is very easy to pick the bad points in the past seven years.  It does not take much imagination or research to select the failings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has never denied that we are in a difficult situation.  These phases arise occasionally in life and anybody with experience of running a business&mdash;and running the country is a business&mdash;knows that business never runs smoothly.  The important thing is to know exactly what is wrong and how to rectify it.  When we have a leader with that knowledge at the helm, there is no need for the panic preached by the Opposition for the past few days.  None of them has put forward <Col N="1199" /> any constructive solution or alternative. I enjoy constructive arguments when people put forward alternatives to something we propose and I believe that if you criticise, you must be in a position to suggest alternatives.  There is no point in criticising just for the sake of criticism.  That will not help our economy in any way.  If the Opposition have reasons for criticism, let them put forward alternative solutions.  That is how an Opposition should work.</P>
    <P>We are going through a difficult period but that is not the fault of the Government.  The main reason for it lies in international factors and industrial unrest.  This grave economic situation has undoubtedly developed but anybody observing the balance of payments position recently must be gratified to find the gap closed completely. We are getting out of the difficulties experienced in the past 12 months.  We hope that industrial relations difficulties will be resolved in the near future, and after that I believe we shall go ahead again to attain the targets set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>Listening to some Opposition speakers, one would imagine that some firms in this city were going bankrupt but one has only to read the Stock Exchange reports or the financial reports in any paper to find these firms as buoyant and solvent as they were at any time in the past six or seven years.  In view of that, how can the pessimism we have been subjected to in the past few days be justified?  We have also heard a great deal of criticism of our foreign borrowing.  It is said this is dangerous, that we are paying high interest and so on.  The important thing about borrowing is to ensure that you invest the proceeds wisely.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with borrowing. Everyone in this country has to live on credit.  But for credit, we could not keep our economies or businesses going.  To be able to borrow means that the people who lend have confidence in you.  Criticism of borrowing from the banks in Germany or Nova Scotia is unfounded.  It is much better to borrow now, even at an increased rate, and to push ahead with <Col N="1200" /> capital development than to wait until ten or 12 years hence when production costs will have increased.  I cannot see why any criticism should be levelled against the present method of borrowing.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this country should concern himself with the task of resolving our labour troubles.  It is about time we took a Christian outlook on labour relations.  This is something that is lacking.  Not alone is a Christian outlook desirable but it is necessary, if we are to emerge from the difficulties industry is experiencing today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte, speaking here this morning, seemed to be under the impression that we were selling out this country, getting loans <i>ad lib</i>, and so on.  He went to the extent of saying that we were going from bank to bank and selling the country's credit.  We all know perfectly well that bank managers or financial advisers give money only when the client is solvent.  There is no question of going from one country to another and selling the credit of this country.</P>

      <P>This pessimistic outlook being fostered by the Opposition Parties will do untold damage to our economy.  If any businessman came into this House last week and listened to the debate, I am sure he would take the first plane out of the country. Pessimism is a dangerous philosophy to spread.

He went on to say that the Government were thought so highly of that they could get loans wherever they sought them.

      <P>We did not get them.  However, we can borrow £5 million from the Bank of Nova Scotia. I am very suspicious of this Bank of Nova Scotia.  Is this the bank that has been canvassing business in this country for the past six or eight months, writing to various organisations seeking the investment of funds from these various organisations in their bank?  Is this the price they paid for their chance to come in here and compete against the commercial banks of this country?  Have they paid this £5 million for that?  I am personally aware that this particular bank have been seeking recognition from various organisations in this State and encouraging various organisations to invest moneys with them. Have they paid this £5 million for that privilege?  It is something that should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only last March that we had a Budget and never, in such a short time, in my opinion, has so much money been extracted from so many and distributed among so few as has been done by the Minister for Finance. Let us have a look at the situation. We had a Budget somewhere in the first week of March last.  We had a mini-Budget last week for which there was no publicity whatsoever. All legal fees were increased by practically <Col N="1204" /> 100 per cent in some cases and 600 per cent in other cases.  For instance, the stamp on a High Court summons which was £1 was increased to £6.  Land Registry fees were increased; Land Commission fees were increased.  All fees payable by the legal profession were increased, some by as much as 600 per cent.  Bus fares were increased and we have had the price of butter and the price of beer and stout increased.  Then we had the Canadian loan.  We have this mini-Budget now but we have never been told the fees which were to be collected, and possibly will be collected, under the Fisheries Bill which was conveniently shelved during the Presidential election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not collect them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>An effort will be made.  In my part of the country, as in Deputy Tully's, we have a drift-net salmon licence which now costs £3 and it is proposed to increase it to £15.  We have in rural Ireland what are referred to by the salmon rod fishermen as the peasants who fish for brown trout and they are to be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that what Deputy Coughlan says is correct.  The only way to get justice in this country is to break the law and you know where that will lead you.  We are to have another local budget because the rates were struck during March and under this mini-Budget, the cost of living has gone up. The cost of petrol has gone up and the cost of foodstuffs has gone up and the local authorities have not taken these increases into account.  They will have to work on an overdraft between now and March when they will have to strike a rate to pay off the overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the faults I find with the Minister and the Government&mdash; their shortsightedness.  I remember that as I came in to speak on the Budget in March, I bought a copy of the <i>Evening Herald</i> and I saw a banner headline which read &ldquo;British Government to restrict flow of capital to many countries, including Ireland&rdquo;.  In my opening <Col N="1205" /> remarks that evening, I referred to that and later in reply the Minister for Finance said it would have no effect whatsoever on this country.  He said that it was a voluntary restriction of capital by the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>If the Minister was aware of that, why did he not take steps at the time to counteract it?  I should like to quote from the Official Report of 14th June, at column 381, volume 223 No. 3 where the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Events since the Budget have reinforced the need to reserve for capital purposes all the money it may be possible to raise by borrowing. One adverse development has been the British restriction on the outflow of capital to this country.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was aware of this voluntary restriction, why did he not take steps at that time?  Why did he wait until after the Presidential election to come in with this mini-Budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect.  While we are collecting all this money, what do we find?  There is no money for housing.  Each Deputy speaking on this Budget gave the position in his own county and may I give the position in mine, a Cheann Comhairle?  In 1955, when we had an inter-Party Government in office, Donegal County Council built 217 houses; in 1956, they <Col N="1206" /> build 161 houses; and in 1957, 139 houses.  Then in 1958, in the first year of the Fianna Fáil resurrection, they had exactly half the output of the inter-Party Government; they built 81 houses.  In 1959, it fell to 57 and in 1960, it came down to 31.  In 1961, they built 49 houses; in 1962, 36; in 1963, 39; in 1964, 38; and in 1965 they built 53 houses.  This year we are to build 23 houses, despite the fact that we have collected all that money.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;When you people were in office, you ran into difficulties such as we are experiencing today.  In 1957, you had difficulties. You had a credit squeeze and you found yourselves in exactly the same position.&rdquo;  Up to a point that is true, but at that time we were building 139 houses, 161 houses and 217 houses. I would remind the Minister that at that time we had the Korean War and the Suez crisis and we took immediate steps to rectify the balance of payments. We all remember the levies which were put on by the inter-Party Government.  We remember the slight restriction on credit.  We took remedies which, in our opinion, would get the State ship back on to an even keel again.</P>
      <P>We were not six months out of office until the position was restored and let me quote proof of that by referring to something which the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, said at column 249, volume 171 of the Official Report for 30th October, 1958.  He was referring to what he called the state in which the inter-Party Government left the country when Fianna Fáil took over and he said:</P>
      <P>We find that six months following the disappearance of the Coalition Government, and on the assuming of office by Fianna Fáil, the new Minister for Local Government had to sanction a backlog of schemes that had been lying there all during the latter months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>the latter months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the Coalition's term of office, schemes to the total of almost <Col N="1207" /> £900,000 which had accumulated in the Custom House and could not be allowed see the light of day because there was no money to pay for those already in progress.</P>
    <P>Within eight months of leaving office, as a result of the steps we had taken, the new Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government was not only able to pay for all current work but was also able to sanction £900,000 worth of other schemes.  That money did not come out of a crock of gold or from any other imaginary source.  It came as a result of the steps we took to ensure that the position in which we found ourselves would be properly remedied and rectified.</P>
    <P>There is no money today for housing. What is worse, there is no money for house repair.  We have cottages in my constituency which we are unable to repair because we cannot get any money from the Department of Local Government.  There is no money for social welfare.  True, the Minister may turn round and tell me: &ldquo;Ah, yes.  We hit the people hard in the Budgets but we have to look after the old, the recipients of unemployment assistance, and so on&rdquo;.  The Minister will give them a meagre 5/- per week, but only if they have no means, and then not until 1st November.  There is no money for minor relief schemes. They played a very important part in the economy of rural Ireland.  They have been abolished.  There is no money for the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That was introduced by the late lamented Deputy Tim Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government in the inter-Party Government.  That Act conferred considerable benefit on rural Ireland. Though still on the Statute Book, no money has ever been provided under it.  There is no money for private enterprise.  It is a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Have we ever considered the effect of these March and June Budgets on the individuals?  I will take only one individual, the man who has to use a motor car and who does an average 30,000 miles a year&mdash;that is not a lot &mdash;getting 30 miles to the gallon, and <Col N="1208" /> that is a conservative estimate.  That man will use 1,000 gallons of petrol. A tax of 4d. per gallon on petrol gives a figure of £16 13s 4d.  That is what it will cost extra for petrol.  On top of that, if the car is 12 or 13 H.P., that man will pay an additional £6 in tax. That brings the sum to £22 13s 4d. Allowing an average of £200 per year for depreciation and paying a turnover tax or a selective wholesale tax of five per cent, that brings the sum up by another £10.  In other words, these Budgets mean an extra £32 13s 4d on the average motorist.  That is a very severe blow.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the merits or demerits of this selective wholesale tax but I should like to give a quotation with regard to the merits of this tax. It is not a quotation of my own.  I am not in a position either to agree or disagree with it, but I should like to tell the present Minister for Finance what his predecessor thought about a wholesale tax.  I am quoting from volume 204 of the Official Report of 10th July, 1963, column 701:</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins made a long speech against this tax generally but he did not like to end his speech without throwing a sop to RGDATA... Everybody knows enough about trade to realise that if the tax were put on at the manufacturer level, it would have to be made very much higher to get the same yield.  If the manufacturer's price is so much, there is a margin added on by the wholesaler and a margin added on again by the retailer.  It is obvious there must be a higher tax at the manufacturer level than at the retail level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, when he was Minister for Finance, supporting the turnover tax he introduced, and giving the reasons why it should not be a selective wholesale tax.  His argument was that in the long run the consumer would pay very much more than the five per cent, or whatever the figure was.  There was a Minister for Finance giving reasons why it should be a turnover tax and not a selective wholesale tax.  On to the latter, in his <Col N="1209" /> opinion, would be added a percentage for the wholesaler's profit and on to that an additional percentage for the retailer's profit; he said further that if one put on a five per cent tax, it would eventually end up at nine per cent and that was his reason for not introducing a wholesale tax.  That was the reason he introduced the cruel turnover tax of 1963.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Tully is not here. He interrupted Deputy Harte this morning when Deputy Harte referred to the resignation of Deputy Cunningham from the chairmanship of Donegal County Council.  This may be a little parochial but I am sure it will interest the House: Deputy Cunningham resigned from the chairmanship of Donegal County Council last week.  I understand he will be a candidate all over again next week for the same chairmanship.</P>

      <P>We had a very interesting speech from Deputy Lenihan yesterday.  I have a great respect for him.  He is a very clever man and I always believed he would be an acquisition to this House.  However, his speech yesterday was most peculiar.  It amounted to: What would you do if you were in office? We have not the opportunity of knowing the facts and knowing what is in the kitty and, therefore, I could not tell the Deputy what we would do, but I can tell him a few things we would not have done.  One thing we would not have done is to hold the local elections and the Presidential election on two different dates.  We would have held them on the one day and saved the country a quarter of a million pounds.  We would never have given a job at £1,000 a year to a pensioner who was receiving £3,000 a year.</P>

      <P>And in this time of credit squeeze and financial crisis, we would never have spent £500,000 on Leinster House.  It is very significant that in relation to this expenditure, we seem to have given up hope of ever ending Partition.  We have now built permanent premises here.  We have made provision for the Government, for the Opposition, for the various <Col N="1211" /> Parties and for the Independents.  Not a spare room has been built for the representatives of the north-east of this country, in the event of the end of Partition.  Not one room has been allocated in the building and not one spare seat in this Chamber has been left for them.  Have we given up all hope of solving Partition in our time?</P>
      <P>Again, let me tell Deputy Lenihan that, if we had bought the British and Irish Steampacket Company which was making £87,000 a year profit, we would never in our first year of ownership have allowed it to lose £57,000.  What is wrong there?  Is it not bad management of some description?  Again, we would have ensured that we would have got from the United Nations the £1 million due to us for our troops in Cyprus, and we would not have been too proud to take it simply because Russia had not contributed towards it.</P>

      <P>I hope it is better than most things on the menu in Leinster House.  Another thing we would not have done in this time of crisis, when local authorities are screaming for money for housing, for roads, hospitalisation and everything else, is to hold a seminar in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.  A seminar on what?  On planning, no less.  Every county councillor in Ireland has received from his county secretary a letter which I should like to read.  Ours <Col N="1212" /> is dated 15th June, addressed from the County Secretary's Office, County House, Lifford, to each member of the county council:</P>
      <P>With reference to previous correspondence concerning a planning seminar to be held in Dublin at the end of June, the Department of Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>They never say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has informed me that it may be regarded as a local authority conference, which means that travelling expenses may be paid to members who attend.</P>
      <P>I should be grateful if you would let me know by return, if possible, if you propose attending, as it will be necessary to send particulars to An Foras Forbartha and to have you nominated by the council.</P>
      <P>I am telling Deputy Lenihan now, since he asked me yesterday what we would have done, that is one of the things we would never have permitted, to allow each member of a local authority in Ireland to come to the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin in the month of June, at the expense of the taxpayer, for a seminar on planning, at a time when there is a credit squeeze and when the country is in financial straits.  I have given Deputy Lenihan ten things we would not have done, and if we had an opportunity of looking at the figures, there might be a good few other things I could tell him we would not have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to the Taoiseach's speech here the other day and he was very cross.  He reminded me very much of a man walking along a road at night, a man who is lonely, who fears something and who keeps whistling to himself, sometimes shouting and sometimes passing rude remarks, simply because he is afraid, a man, to use the words of a popular song, who keeps looking over his shoulder because he knows there is somebody walking behind.  There is no justification whatever for this Budget, but the Taoiseach told us he was full of fight.  Fight for what?  I presume he meant political fight.  I wish he would be more aggressive in tackling the economic problems which are pressing on this country.  If <Col N="1213" /> he were more active and showed more fight on that, we would be much better off.  Last year and the year before in introducing the Budget, there was a lot of talk about the European Economic Community.  We did not hear it mentioned very much this year.  Many hours were spent over the last nine years in this House discussing the Common Market.  On one occasion I remember interrupting to ask <i>&ldquo;Quo Vadis?&rdquo;</i>&mdash;where are you going?  I never got a reply to that.  If the Minister had told us something in his Budget speech about where we were going, then we would have had an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke has been absent from this discussion.  The last time he suggested a subscription of 6d, but I did not hear him try to raise the &ldquo;ante&rdquo; to 1/- this time.  He kept very much in the background.  It is a pity, because Deputy Burke's contributions to these debates are always interesting.  Possibly he is more preoccupied at the moment with an announcement which was made recently of one of the ecclesiastical colleges being thrown open to the layman than with taking up collections. However, as I say, he is always original, and he offered a solution to the tragedy of the 1965 Budget and to the problem of our financial position which was certainly not a sound economic one but which was a practical suggestion and more than we have had from most other Fianna Fáil speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael speakers have followed generally the line adopted by the last speaker.  It was a very typical Fine Gael speech: what they would not do; but no word at all about what they would do, or the remedies they would adopt for the situation in which the country and the Government find themselves at the moment.  It is not the first time we had a credit squeeze; it is not the first time we had a situation like this in the country, but Deputy P. O'Donnell's speech is typical of Fine Gael policy and Fine Gael attitudes.  Yet, if they were in office today with a credit squeeze and other economic difficulties on their shoulders, they would stop planning.  Yes, they would; Deputy <Col N="1214" /> P. O'Donnell said it is one of the things they would not do: they would not plan; they would not hold a planning conference.  We know they would not, because they are not a Party who can ride the storms.  They are OK when things are running smoothly; they certainly would drop planning and drop everything.  As a matter of fact, if they were in office, they would run out as they did before.  They would drop everything: they would not put on taxation, but would run away instead of having two Budgets.  They would not have any Budget; they would run away from the Budget, as they did before, and they would stop planning.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy P. O'Donnell. He has made the most typical and true Fine Gael speech ever made in this House because there would be no planning, no Budget and they would have a general election and do the same as they did before, not face up to the difficulties of the situation which would exist in the country, no matter what Government were in office.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Fine Gael policy adopted in exactly similar circumstances before: no planning and no provision for the future. Fine Gael are talking for the past three weeks as if this country will never have a future again.  Stop planning, stop taxation, do not find any money&mdash;that is, always was, and forever will be the Fine Gael policy. They will not change their spots; they may change their name&mdash;as they have done, Cumann na nGaedheal to Fine Gael&mdash;but deep down, there is this attitude to difficulties.  They are not prepared to face them.  They are not prepared, in a difficult period, to make any plans but rather they drop everything.  We know; Deputy P. O'Donnell did not have to get up and tell us what Fine Gael would have done.  We have the picture before us of what they did in exactly similar circumstances in 1957.  There was a <Col N="1215" /> credit squeeze then, though they did not even admit there was.  They stopped planning, when it was necessary to keep planning for the future; they did not think then this country had a bright future and they do not think that now from their speeches.  Their speeches are doing more damage to the future than many of the economic difficulties which this country is facing. Yes, we know what they would do. It is ridiculous for a man who has been a Minister and is a shadow Minister to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell has told us what a Fine Gael Government would not have done.  They would not do any planning for the future; they would not have a planning conference in Dublin this week; they would not put on extra taxation.  We know that: he did not have to tell us.  We know they did not plan before in 1957 in a similar difficult economic and financial situation. Fine Gael think there is no future to plan for; they say it is not necessary to have a Budget, not necessary to have a mini-Budget.  In other words, they say there is no need for taxation.  We know they would not have a Budget.  When they were faced with similar difficulties before, they did not have one; they had a general election instead, and we know what happened.  But I will tell Deputy Donegan, and he can tell Deputy P. O'Donnell, what they would have done now.  They would begin selling out, as they did before.  There are Constellations again which could be sold; there are the Inchicore works which could be closed down.</P>

The country does not want a Government such as that.  The workers of this <Col N="1216" /> country do not want that Fine Gael policy: do nothing and start selling out.  That is the only policy those people across the House are able to put before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very unpleasant experience this year of two Budgets within a period of 90 days. If one looks back over the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government, it is not really surprising, and it would not be particularly surprising if we were to have a third Budget in view of the way the Government are carrying on the affairs of this country.  We have seen what has happened over the past few years.  It started off with the turnover tax.  When the Fianna Fáil Government found they needed more money, they introduced the turnover tax.  That was the most vicious&mdash;it is the only way it can be described&mdash;form of taxation ever put on the people of this country.  It made no distinction whatsoever between people who could afford to pay tax and people who were trying to exist on social welfare benefits. The man with £5,000 a year was asked to pay the same tax, under this turnover tax system, as an old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>After that, we had the 12 per cent increase negotiated by the trade union movement and we had the Government standing back and watching prices soaring and every would-be bandit in the country making sure he could have his share of the loot.  No attempt whatsoever was made by the Fianna Fáil Government to introduce effective price control, although they were asked repeatedly to do so.  Time and again they were told what the consequences would be if price control was not introduced. However, after the damage had been well and truly done, they were converted to the Labour Party's policy of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an election in this country approximately 18 months ago.  During the course of the campaign, the Taoiseach, his Ministers and Fianna Fáil spokesmen went the length and breadth of this country telling the people: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach invited the people to come in and paddle in the pool of Fianna <Col N="1217" /> Fáil prosperity.  They have seen the pool now.  I am afraid the Taoiseach and this Government have led the people into very deep water and they have no idea in the world how to get them out.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party realise that many of the things we desire for the people we represent can be realised only if the necessary money is raised by way of taxation but the mini-Budget is not a Budget to achieve this end.  It is a Budget to try to pay for the mistakes of the Government.  This Budget has one purpose, and one only, that is, to pay for the mismanagement of the country by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We have seen since the general election what the true story is.  We have seen that instead of this prosperity that Lemass was leading us all into, we have a situation in which there are no houses for very many of our people.  No money is being provided or no money can be provided by Fianna Fáil because we have not got it.  We find that, shortly after they took up office after the last election, there was a complete switch.  There was a cut-back on housing.  There was no money for health.  There was no money for anything.</P>
    <P>We have the unfortunate Minister for Health rushing around issuing White Papers.  It is about all he can issue because there is no money to implement anything he may have had in mind when he took up that office. We find the same thing with regard to the Minister for Local Government. Even on today's Order Paper, we find a very considerable number of questions put down by Deputies who want to know when the local authorities will get money and when people who have all the necessary qualifications for grants can hope to get them.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there is no money.  Not only are the Government not able to provide these things for the people but they had the audacity to come in here three months after the Budget and introduce this mini-Budget. As I have said before, this mini-Budget is not to provide anything or implement anything, but to pay for the mismanagement <Col N="1218" /> and mistakes of this Government. It is very clear to everyone that the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party have completely lost the confidence of the people and they are very conscious of the fact that they have lost that confidence.</P>
    <P>The local elections have been postponed on a flimsy excuse because the Government knew in their heart that if the people had an opportunity, either at local or national level, they would give the only effective answer they could for the complete mess the Government have made of the country in a short space of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been described as a mini-Budget.  When you look through it, it is not so &ldquo;mini&rdquo; a Budget.  It was very cleverly produced by the Minister for Finance.  In fact the major portion of the charges to be raised have yet to be the subject of a separate Bill in this House before the impost arises on 1st October next.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the Minister's main Budget of this year, one realises the wide range of articles on which indirect taxation has been placed.  The range is so wide that while it has not been possible for anybody to point the finger of scorn at the Minister and say: &ldquo;You put 6d on cigarettes or you put 6d on the pint&rdquo;, nevertheless when one looks at the complete range, one discovers the amount of taxation that is being levied as an extra impost on the ordinary fellow who smokes cigarettes, fills a seat in a car, drives his own car or drinks the odd pint is very cruel indeed.  It is far more cruel than was apparent at the time.  It is also true of the mini-Budget because we do not know yet what the full range of articles to be covered by the five per cent wholesale tax will be. Deputy O'Donnell pointed out that the Minister's predecessor was entirely opposed to this tax.  Doctors differ and patients die.  One in this case was a doctor and the other a barrister and many of the patients, the consuming public, are in a bad way, while others have to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearing the end of this debate when so much has been said, it might be <Col N="1219" /> better to take a different line, and while the subject under discussion means we can discuss the same thing, I feel one of the things I should address myself to is the Taoiseach's speech. Before I proceed to do so, I should like to say that the Taoiseach, as Prime Minister of this country, found himself in the position of having to introduce a second Budget ten weeks after an extremely harsh one.  One would have expected from him in such circumstances a certain degree of responsibility, a clear exposition not only of the reasons why this became necessary but also of his views on future policy.  One would have thought he would have treated this in a serious way and that his speech would have been statesmanlike.</P>
    <P>Instead, he made vulgar references to newspaper reporters who normally do their work in that posture anyway. He made fighting references to Fine Gael and asked the age-old question which Deputy Burke asks every year on every Budget: &ldquo;When you walk up those stairs, will you vote against the halfcrown for the old age pensioners?&rdquo;  That was the Taoiseach's main theme.  If we were to vote against this not so mini-Budget, we would be voting against 2d a gallon for milk, and he mentioned other things in which there was a shortfall and for which money was required. This is the most simple political trick which one would expect from a new county councillor on his first visit to the council chamber.  It is not a valid attitude having regard to the position in which we find ourselves&mdash;the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, returning for a second Budget ten weeks after a really harsh Budget.  This sort of thing will not do.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the Taoiseach's speech, reported at column 571, volume 223 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 15th June.  He said:</P>
    <P>To fulfil these purposes, the Government require more money and that money can be secured only by an adjustment in taxation rates. Those who voted yesterday against these new taxes must be assumed <Col N="1220" /> to be against these proposals, against the provision of these additional farm price supports, this additional income for farmers, and the payment of these additional amounts to the employees in the public services to whom they relate.</P>
    <P>Further on the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>That is a simple proposition.  No Deputy need be confused in his mind about it.  It is a proposition upon which it is possible for any Deputy to say: &ldquo;I am for it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am against it&rdquo;.  The Government's proposition is that these additional payments should be made; these higher farm price supports should be given; these increases should be awarded in the Public Services as they have been awarded outside...</P>
    <P>Our line is that it is the Government's mistakes during the past few years that have caused the necessity for this not so mini-Budget.  The Government led the people astray before the general election last year and before the Presidential election this year.  They did it deliberately to time the unpleasant things for the day after the people had voted and to time the hopeful statements and wonderful arguments for ante-election speeches.</P>
    <P>It is logical for us to criticise the fact that the Government's priorities have gone wrong.  It is necessary for any Cabinet, sitting with Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, to decide on priorities.  On this occasion the Taoiseach refused to talk about priorities. Before the general election, he said there was plenty of money for everything. As Deputy Cluskey has said, the others shouted: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;. Let us take a few instances close to our minds.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke of the spending of £500,000 on the extension to Leinster House.  We built that and continued to build it but we could have done without it for a while.  There are 50 families in Griffith Barracks whose husbands can visit them for half an hour a day because there are no houses for them.  We have begun a major scheme of system building in Ballymun. System building is not cheaper.  It is only quicker.  Yet that scheme is running <Col N="1221" /> far behind schedule and the general opinion is that it will work out considerably dearer.  A major factor in the delay is that the Government had not the money to pay the builder and, so that he will not go bankrupt, he is doing the only thing he can do, slowing down.</P>
    <P>We are occupying the £500,000 extension to Leinster House.  Arguments of whether we wanted it are not relevant. The point is that our priorities have gone wrong.  Let us now consider the just case of the farmers for 2d a gallon for their milk.  We do not know yet whether they will have to go to jail if they do not pay their fines.  We know that the Minister for Agriculture indicated that he would not give them anything but we also know that inside six weeks he had to provide a large sum to give them a just increase.  It was beaten from him, literally in the political sense.  It was beaten from the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Does this also not mean that we have fallen down on our priorities?  Other building has gone on in Dublin with the permission of the Government while the Government of Britain stopped all non-essential building in favour of housing by putting a tax on it.  If I were to suggest that the Government built the Irish Sugar Company building, I would be correct because the Government own the majority of the shares and the shareholders can dictate policy.  That building was done at a time when the people of Dublin had not houses to live in. Is it not true also that at the same time the insurance companies built sumptuous new offices?  It is agreed that a certain amount of insurance company funds can be put into fixed assets, into national loans.  I suggest that in relation to this building and indeed in relation to the building of Liberty Hall, if the Government were to get their priorities right, they could have made it more attractive for the agencies who built these edifices to put their money into national loans which would have given us money to build the houses for our people.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difference between Fianna Fáil and this Party, and the <Col N="1222" /> Labour Party when they were members of the inter-Party Government, is that we produced houses as a priority and that Fianna Fáil have relegated housing, for their own convenience, to a secondclass position.  The reason is that when a Government are running into four or five elections&mdash;two by-elections, a general election and a Presidential election and one local election which, as Deputy Cluskey pointed out, has been postponed on a pretext&mdash;and they are running short of money, one of the easiest things to do is to cut down on housing.  All the Government have to do in that case is to have a malleable political Minister for Local Government who will make sure sanction does not go out.  That is the easy way; it is the way to get in in elections and to come back afterwards to correct the deliberate misdoings while at the same time leaving 50 families in Griffith Barracks and permitting the building of sumptuous offices.</P>
    <P>Let us take another example of ante-election and post-election policy.  Let us look at the situation whereby the Minister for Finance 11 weeks ago, one week before the mini-Budget and ten weeks after the major Budget, produced the amount of the increase in remuneration we could expect this year, a figure of three per cent.  His reason was that this was the estimated increase in the gross national product. I know he is not a mathematician and therefore I do not want to go into the details of that.  I am not one either but I think I know a little more about it than he does.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at the mathematics of that suggestion will not be looking at it for more than 30 seconds before he realises that an increase of three per cent in the gross national product does not mean we can have three per cent.  It could mean we could be entitled to 30 per cent or perhaps to nothing at all.  It is merely a convenient method for somebody who looks at these things rather lightly and has his speeches written for him by his officials on all occasions.  The Labour Court corrected the Minister for Finance inside six weeks.  Where has responsibility gone if we have a situation whereby the Labour Court, sitting to <Col N="1223" /> decide a dispute before it, decides that the sum of the increase we can afford is of the order of nine per cent when the Minister for Finance says six weeks before that that the increase is of the order of three per cent?  That is where the Government also made an error. They refused to budget in their major Budget before the Presidential election for the increase they knew was probable and produced instead this three per cent as something completely dishonest and having no mathematical relation to the formula they produced to support it.</P>
    <P>There has been discussion about our borrowings.  Over the past five or six years, the Government have been riding on the crest of a wave provided by the influx of capital here.  This was making it easy for them until about the time of the Cork and Kildare by-elections. They were in a position whereby much of our capital works was being financed by this influx, which was also carrying our balance of payments. But when we have to resort to short-term borrowing in Germany and from the Bank of Nova Scotia, having failed to get it in America, the results of such short-term borrowings are pretty evident.  When you borrow by means of a national loan here over a long term of years, the amount you have to take from the capital side of the Budget and bring up into the current Budget is minimised; but when you borrow for ten years you have to bring up a far greater amount.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, short-term borrowing means higher current taxation. That means that the trade union organisations will naturally seek to recoup the loss to their members because of higher current taxation and you are therefore increasing the costs of production. One of the things about short-term borrowing is that it increases the costs of your export production. We have had resort now to short-term borrowing in two instances and we still have to borrow £5 million. All the indications are that the Government will go to the Bank of Guatemala, if they can get the money there, and borrow on short term there.  When you borrow for ten years, four or five <Col N="1224" /> times as much has to come into current taxation.  That is one of the reasons why we will have a higher tax situation here and a higher costs situation.  This will mean grave danger to our export trade.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Taoiseach instead of referring to newspaper commentators in a most improper way, instead of telling us in Fine Gael that we had a fight on our hands&mdash;we always knew that because we always knew Fianna Fáil would die hard&mdash;would have indicated his future plans for the provision of the capital so necessary in our underdeveloped country.  He could have indicated how much he thought he would be able to secure in national loans next year.  We have been accused of making no suggestions in this debate.  The Taoiseach could have created a situation taxwise that would pay insurance companies and large corporations not to build sumptuous blocks of offices but to put their money into national loans that would build houses for our people.  Instead, he indulged in the abuse for which he is famous when in a corner.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that there is no plan for State borrowing and capital investment.  Deputy Cunningham objects and suggests if Fine Gael were in office at present, they could have every county councillor in Ireland in the Shelbourne Hotel next week. They are the people who are guilty of not planning.  They are the people prepared to ride it out from one election to another on the basis of keeping their jobs.  I think I have indicated that the Government have failed in their priorities.  It is no alibi for them to suggest that we should get them out of the soup, although we are prepared to make constructive suggestions.  I think we have made one in relation to priority in housing.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the Taoiseach's speech again and to the fact that he chose to be derogatory of the Fine Gael Front Bench.  For the purpose of making my further remarks relevant and in order, I quote the Taoiseach at column 578 of the Official Report. He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> What an alternative Government, these shadow Ministers named the other day as the Government.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say he was the head of the best Cabinet in Europe. I should like to discuss that.  Since the Taoiseach has raised it and since it is the activities of this Cabinet that have put us in our present position, I think it is in order to do so.  We are at our wits end to provide capital for necessary works.  Yet we have had a series of spectacular failures in industries in which Cabinet Ministers have been almost always implicated, in which Cabinet Ministers have been seen around this town wining and dining with principals in certain industries in which there were spectacular failures.  I want to suggest before I discuss these failures that when someone invests his own money, it is most unusual to have a spectacular failure within a year or even two or three years, and in some cases before the project is opened at all. When you are putting your own money down on the table, you tend to be far more careful.</P>
    <P>I want to point to a few of these failures.  We know what the situation is in Potez.  We can all say now&mdash; and most people outside the House would agree&mdash;that the idea of employing 1,700 people in the construction of executive aircraft in a small country like this would seem to have been ill advised, to say the least of it. We are well aware that the Minister for Transport and Power told every Deputy in Monaghan, including his own Deputies, not to come near him as he had made arrangements for a new factory in Clones.  We are now aware that the unfortunate French manufacturer who produced the machinery and brought it in in packing cases sees that the factory is now empty, with the machinery sitting in it and the factory in liquidation.  The most he may get is 1/- or 2/&mdash;or let us be hopeful, 20/&mdash; in the £.  We are aware that the best supporter of the Minister for Transport and Power built the factory at a cost of £40,000 and his money is also in the liquidator's net.  We are aware that the factory never opened.  We are aware that <Col N="1226" /> there is a factory connected with the Irish steel industry which was never opened in Cabra in Dublin.  This was also the subject of very heavy grants and loans.  We are aware that a factory for the production of food has closed in Laois-Offaly.  There was a grant of £120,000 and a Taiscí Stáit loan of £90,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave it so.  I want to point out the fact that at least £3 million has been lost in these projects, and I want to judge them by this sliderule.  If I went into a bank to borrow money and knew I had to repay it even to the extent of selling my house if that project went wrong, it would be one chance in a thousand that the project would go wrong before it opened, or within the first or second year.  People are not as foolish as that and the people at the heads of international industries are not as foolish as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the best Cabinet in Europe is guilty of having influenced the grants board in relation to the issue of these moneys.  You can get as awkward as you like about it.  We claim that it was because of mistakes by the Government that these projects went badly immediately on opening, or even before opening.  We believe this is evidence that things are very wrong. <Col N="1227" /> The best Cabinet in Europe has also been guilty of nepotism and patronage. A fortnight ago the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries chose to interrupt me here and suggest something in relation to my private business.  I do not think it was in any way vicious, or intended to do harm, but the difference is that my personal business has absolutely no relation to Government funds, absolutely no relation to semi-State companies, and absolutely no relation to appointments made at the behest of Ministers.  I want to say here and now that it is a public scandal that the audits of Bord na gCon, Irish Shipping and various semi-State organisations should be directed in a certain way.</P>
    <P>I will not go any further on this question of patronage except to say&mdash; and I intend to use no names for obvious reasons&mdash;in relation to the appointments to the Board of Telefís Éireann that the Government deserve to lose the next election for that reason alone.  To my knowledge, every member of that Board, except perhaps three, is a Government supporter.  This is not the board of a company or a semi-State organisation like Bord na gCon.  This is the Board that is charged with responsibility for the dissemination of news on television and radio. The first responsibility of the Government is towards freedom, and a responsibility devolves upon them to see that in the production of the news, in the dissemination of views upon the news, and in the general handling of our television and radio programmes which enter the houses of all of us. there should be fair play.</P>
    <P>Not only should there be fair play, but justice should be seen to be done. That is quite impossible so long as we have a list of people appointed to the Board who are all Fianna Fáil supporters. I can point to three whose politics I do not know.  I am deliberately not being personal in this matter, but I am saying that Fianna Fáil deserve defeat for that reason alone. Is that what we fought for in 1916? Is that what the people who went before us fought for in 1916?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>If I had anything to do with this <Col N="1228" /> problem in the future, if I were a member of a Fine Gael Cabinet&mdash;if Fine Gael succeeded in the next general election&mdash;my proposal would be&mdash;and I want to be quite blunt about it&mdash;to ask every member of that Board for his resignation so that there would be a free appointment of the same people again, or of other people, to indicate to the nation as a whole that there is no undue interference with the affairs of Telefís Éireann.  Let us remember that during the entire Presidential campaign not one meeting addressed by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins appeared on the television screens.  Let us remember that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very enlightening, all right.  In support of the suggestion that the Government were in a good position over the last number of years, I should like to give one figure&mdash;the December, 1965, figure for import and export prices, base 1953 equals 100.  The import prices stood <Col N="1230" /> at 114.2 and the export prices at 112.2.  Notwithstanding everything that has been said, the position is that the Government were only two per cent worse off than they were in 1953 as far as the terms of trade were concerned.  If they had done their job right, things could have been much better for the country but the Government chose to produce the 12 per cent wage increase at the time of the two by-elections and to boast about it.  They had the information as to whether or not this could be paid.  It was proved afterwards, of course, that it could not be paid.</P>
      <P>I should like to point now to the number of industrial disputes that took place in the various years.  In 1962, there were 60 such disputes; in 1963, 70; in 1964, 87; in 1965, 89. The number of work people involved in disputes in progress is also very relevant: In 1962, only 9,197; 1963, 16,067; 1964, 25,245; 1965, 39,745. Let us consider the number of man days lost.</P>

      <P>I was put off in my discussion of this question of the best Cabinet in Europe by the fact that it was ruled irrelevant.  I should like to mention one thing that happened to me yesterday, for the second time.  A Fianna Fáil Senator came up to me in the passage and said: &ldquo;What you said three months ago was right.  It is the young fellows in the Cabinet who will bring us down.  You would want a 50 guinea suit if you were to go near them.&rdquo;  These are interesting little points.  That was said to me by a Fianna Fáil Senator, who was elected by the Fianna Fáil Party and nominated by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I had better not give his name or he will be thrown out.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the number of houses being built and the slowing down in housing.  I quote from the Economic Series 1964-66, No. 56&mdash;Housing. State-aided schemes, number of new houses built by private persons and public utility societies.  Whereas, in January, 1966, there were 584 houses built as against 545, in February, the figure had worsened and there were only 574 houses built as against 658 built in February, 1965.  In March, again the slowing down was evident. There were 606 houses built in 1965 and only 467 in 1966.  In April, when building should be coming up, there were 838 built in 1965 and 756 built in 1966.  For May the figures were 635 in 1965 and 511 in 1966.</P>
      <P>Let us take the total number of new houses built: January, 1965, 708; January, 1966, 802&mdash;going well&mdash; February, 1965, 920; February, 1966, 652.  March&mdash;the last month for which figures are available and a month in which one would think the figures would be increasing&mdash;1965, 1,106; 1966, 774.</P>

    <P>In my constituency there are young married couples with four and five children living in one room.  There are boys and girls who have been married six and seven years and are living apart.  Admittedly, there are not more than ten or 20 such cases. Cases run from that terrible catastrophe <Col N="1232" /> from the family point of view to cases of married couples with two children living in one room.  That is a national tragedy which can be laid at the door of the Government because, as I have explained, they got their priorities wrong.</P>
    <P>The live register total at the end of the various months should be examined. Before examining it, we must take into account the change in the production of these statistics that was so kindly arranged by the Government for their own purposes a few months ago.  It is very difficult to know how you compare like with unlike.  I have a rule of thumb method and it is that at the week of change there was a change of 16,000 persons.  I take it then that from the week of change or the week before change there would have been no change at all.  Then you have to add 16,000 people to the number at present on the live register to get the comparison with last year.  In January 1965, there were 61,100 people.  This year there were 59,200 people but when you add 16,000 to it, you get 75,000 people.  In effect, there were 58,700 people in February last year. This year there were 56,600 people but if you add on the 16,000 Fianna Fáil subtracted, you get 72,000 people. In March last year, you get the figure 57,200 and this year it is 54,400.  Add on 16,000, and you get 70,000 people. In April, mind you, even subtracting 16,000, they are worse off.  In April, there were 52,100 people and this year there are 52,300 and adding 16,000, you get 68,000 people.  That is the position in relation to the live register of unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is another sliderule.  The unemployment benefit expended weekly amounts in January, 1965, to £104,630, and in January, 1966, it was £141,390. In February, 1965, it was £97.040 and in January, 1966, it was £135,030. This is explained by the 16,000 people Fianna Fáil crossed off the register but it also shows the increase I have indicated.  In March, unemployment benefit cost us £92,888 and in 1966, it was £127,730.  In April, it was £82,080.  This year it was £115,370. The numbers in receipt of home <Col N="1233" /> assistance remained constant.  They remained constant of course because the amount voted for home assistance remained constant as well.  The situation in the sales of insurance stamps is that the average for 1964 was 6,760 per month.  In 1965, we had 6,739.  For the three months, January, February and March, because of the fact that you brought more types of employment into the insurance, there were 7,764 in 1964, and only 7,421 per month in 1966.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate a fall in housing, a fall in employment and a lessening in economic activity.  The signs were there.  In 1965, and I quote from the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, Progress Report, 1965:</P>
    <P>Agricultural output fell by about one per cent below the level of 1964.</P>
    <P>Farm income was meant to be up by one per cent as compared with six per cent in the rest of the country and total employment was down by 7,000 people.  From 1965 to 1964, 14,000 people left the land and we could only, notwithstanding the extraordinary amount of money we spent on the propagation of industry, replace them by 7,000 people in industry. We had 7,000 fewer people working in 1965.  We have sold less insurance stamps, for January, February and March, the three months for which figures are available in 1966 than the average which is available for 1965.  That picture tells its own story.  Agricultural exports for 1965 were down by £7 million.</P>
    <P>There are times when you can be a politician and play politics.  There are times when it is possible to exercise patronage.  There are times when it is possible to buy votes.  It just so happens that the times when these things were possible dated from the Cork and Kildare by-elections, through the general election in which we were invited to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On,&rdquo; right to the Presidential election in which it was obvious that Fianna Fáil by virtue of their heritage could not let down their candidate, and right through to the mini-Budget last week.  Fianna Fáil admitted to <Col N="1234" /> buying the votes; Fianna Fáil admitted to playing politics.  It was the time when there was required a statesman.  It was not a statesman last week who came in here, and attacked us and attacked the newspaper correspondents who are only telling the story they see, who gave us no indication of the future and no indication of the remedy for his ills of the past and telling us we had a fight on our hands.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hold, as others have held, that there is no position more indicative of a time when this Government should go to the country than the position I have just outlined. If this Government had any skin on their neck, they would go to the country.  But apparently their choice is&mdash;and they glory in their choice because they tell us that when there were similar difficulties we went to the country and to the people and that this was wrong&mdash;to stay in their hole like a badger and wait to be dug out.  God forbid anybody in this House should die.  We have heard here for a number of years that in the normal course of events by-elections occur.  If you put the 143 people of middle age together, then those by-elections will inevitably occur.  I do not believe there is a constituency, with perhaps two or three exceptions, where the Government gained a majority last April 12 months that the Government could hope to win today.  Let them dwell on that sobering thought.  The gamble is the gamble of a gambler's government, that in fact things will get better before they have to go to the country. It would be extremely sad if deaths should bring this about and if they had to go to the country at an earlier stage.  I think inevitably if things run as they always do here, there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt the Government will have to face the country in the next six to 12 months. When they do, they will be defeated because they have placed themselves by their own actions in an untenable position.  They are like the man on the desert island with the tide coming in which covers it at high tide.</P>
    <P>You cannot tell people who have <Col N="1235" /> no houses, people who cannot live in the present economic situation, people who have not got jobs, that you have done everything right for them under the terms of trade over the years.  I prophesy that before 12 months have passed, the Government will have changed and this will be a good thing for the country.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Donegan ag caint, rinne sé tagairt do na monarchain a dúnadh ar fud na tíre agus an méid a cailleadh orthu.  Rinne sé dearmad ámh gur dúnadh monarchain in gContae an Chláir agus gur díoladh eitealláin nuair a bhí an Comh-Rialtas ann. Rinne sé dearmad gur caitheadh roinnt mhaith daoine as obair an tráth úd agus fós go ndearna Teachta ón dtaobh thall tairngreacht go mbeadh na coiníní ag poc-léimrigh cois Sionna.  Buíochas le Dia, tá slua daoine ag obair san áit anois.  Deineadh tairngeacht eile an tráth ud&mdash;go raghadh cruithneacht agus biatas suas tríd an simléar in éineacht leis an móin agus níor comhlíonadh an tairngeacht sin ach an oiread.  Dá gcomhlíontaí í, do bheadh deire le Bord na Móna agus do bheadh cuid mhor daoine gan obair.</P>
      <P>Deineadh tagairt freisin don mhéid daoine a d'fhag na feirmeacha ar fud na tíre.  Tuigeann cách go raibh fá áirithe leis sin, eadhon, gur cheannaigh na feirmeoirí tarracóirí agus na hinnill a gabhann leo.  Gach aon uair a cheannaítear inneall dá leithéid, cuirtear deire le hobair nó saothar láimhe ar an bhfeirm agus marach na monarcain a chuir Fianna Fáil ar bun sa tir, do bheadh na daoine sin uilig as obair inniu.  Má tá innill agus caráistí ag na feirmeoirí inniu, bíodh a bhuíochas sin ag an Rialtas mar is iad a thug airgead dóibh chun feabhas a chur ar a mbeatha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach Teachta gur tógadh níos mó tithe ar fud na tíre anuraidh ná mar a tógadh nuair a bhí an Comh-Rialtas ann.  Tógadh na céadta tigh in Innis agus ar fud an Chláir anuraidh de bhreis ar a tógadh in aon bhliain roimhe sin.  Im thuairimse, ba líonmaire na tithe a tógadh i gContae an Cláir anuraidh ná <Col N="1236" /> an méid a luadhadh ins na figiúirí a thug an Teachta Donegan le haghaidh mí ar bith.  Táimid sa Chláir fíorbhuíoch den Rialtas a chuir airgead ar fáil le haghaidh na tógraí sin. Ní fheadar an bhféadfadh na Teachtaí thall inseacht dúinn, má tá an bochtanas agus an ceal airgid chomh forleathan agus a dubhradh, conas ar éirigh le daoine nua-phósta tithe nua do thógáil.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Donegan tagairt do thogachán an Uachtaráin.  Dúbhairt sé nach bhfuair an Teachta O'Higgins cothram na Féinne ón radio nó ón telefís toisc go raibh daoine áirithe ar Bhord Stiurtha na Teilifíse.  Chomh fada agus is cuimhin liom, bhí pictiúr an Teachta O'Higgins maraon le pictiúirí a mhná agus a chlainne ar Thelefís Éireann i bhfad sul ar thosnaigh Fianna Fáil leis an dtoghachán úd.  Fuair sé oiread poiblíochta agus a fuair Éamon de Valéra agus ar ndóigh ba cheart é a thabhairt dó.  An gceapann an Teachta nár cheart go luafaí ainm Éamon de Valéra ar Thelefís Éireann?  Tá a fhios agam nach ndeachaidh sé ar fud na tíre ag caint ins na bailte móra nó in aon áit eile ach, mar sin féin, bhí an bua aige.</P>
    <P>An gceapann an Teachta nár cheart go bhfaigheadh duine ar bith go bhfuil baint aige le Fianna Fáil post ar bith ar bhord poiblí nó in áit ar bith sa tír toisc go bhfuil Rialtas Fianna Fáil ann?  An gceapann sé go mba cheart go bhfaigheadh daoine go bhfuil baint acu le Fine Gael na postanna go léir? Do bhí sin amhlaidh tráth ach ón uair a cuireadh deire lena gcumhacht sé an rud a bhí ag teastáil ón Rialtas ná go mbeadh sain-eolas ag na daoine a tógtar ar na boird phoiblí ar na gnóthaí atá le déanamh acu is cuma cad iad a dtuairimí polaitíochta.  De réir mar a thuigeas an Teachta níor cheart post ar bith a bheith ag duine dár muintir. An dóigh leis an Teachta gur macánta an rud é fogha nimhneach a thabhairt fé dhaoine i nDáil Éireann nach bhfuil caoi nó seans ar bith acu freagra a thabhairt air?  Ba maith linn cur i gcuimhne dhó go bhfuil daoine i Fianna Fáil chomh h-ionnraic, chomh macánta le duine ar bith sa bhFreasúra.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> Rinne an Teachta Donegan tagairt do 1916 agus na searmanais a bhain leis an gceiliúradh.  &ldquo;Cad cuige a rabhamar ag troid?&rdquo;  d'fhiafraigh sé.  An é a thuairim gurab í brí na troda ár muintir a dhíbirt is gan post ar bith a tabhairt dóibh sa tír?</P>

      <P>Coming so late in this debate, I am sure I cannot contribute anything that has not been said and said better already by members of my own Party or other members of the Opposition.  I have to repeat in my own words what has been said by the Leader of my Party about the significance of the fact that we have the annual Budget within three months of the present Budget, the mini-Budget as it is called, about the fact that provision was not made in the main Budget for the additional taxation that has been found necessary.  I am quite convinced it is necessary because I do not think any Government would impose taxation for its own sake but only because they find themselves in a desperate position and are compelled to impose additional taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the Government of that time were not in a position to judge more than three months in advance is beyond me.  The Leader of my Party, Deputy Corish, made that point and I do not want to repeat things like that.  After the last general election in April a year ago, I was told by somebody that if I wanted to change my car then was the time to do it because a direction was going out from the Central Bank to restrict credit for non-productive purposes.  Not wishing to change my car and having no particular interest in business or money <Col N="1238" /> to finance it, I did not need to go to the bank but I waited to see when a Government move would be made. Mark you, it was three or four months after that and I had been re-elected, and we had resumed here before I saw any signs of what I had been told was coming, credit restriction.</P>
    <P>Was it not strange that the Government at the time&mdash;again I have to quote somebody on this side of the House, Fine Gael&mdash;were saying &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;?  Lead on to what? Prosperity or something?  It must be assumed that the Fianna Fáil motto, catchcry or electioneering idea was to lead on to more and better things than we had at the time.  &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  They must have known the position at that time because minor people in the country knew.  If they had known this credit restriction was coming, then surely, before the election, the Minister for Finance and his Government who are in touch with the banking people, who are in touch with affairs in this country, must have known that the country was running into a position where our incomes were not able to stand up to our outgoings?  But, as it happened, they waited practically until, I think, the month of June.  I am sure the Minister will be able to give me the exact date as to when the warning note was sounded.</P>
    <P>We can go back even further than that, to the Cork-Kildare by-elections and then to the Presidential election. I am afraid the Government must accept the accusation that they bought victory at the cost of the nation.  The present position in my county&mdash;and I am quite sure in every other county&mdash; is that we have applications for roughly 120 cottages, all approved, all waiting, all anxious to get in&mdash;and the money? The money we have for this year will be used to finish 64 we started last year and, as from April onwards, the very utmost we can build will be 16 for 120 applicants and, at the end of the year, that figure of 120 will be vastly increased.</P>
    <P>On the question of sewerage schemes and water schemes, we just do not know what is happening.  We got an indication on roads.  It is not a cut on last year.  I shall be perfectly fair with <Col N="1239" /> the Government as I want to be critical if I feel they are wrong.  On roads, there has not been any change of any significance.  But, on sewerage and water, we just do not know the position. Is there any money coming at all? They are crying out over the past two years under pressure from the Minister for Local Government to formulate schemes, to get the schemes going, and to blame your county council if they are not done.  We have 21 schemes of major importance, not regional schemes but minor schemes of major importance, and we must surely have from 40 to 60 schemes of lesser importance. There is not a hope, as far as I know, because I checked up to last Monday, of a single one of these schemes going on.  I suggest that whatever sorry position we are in, and I am afraid we are in a sorry position, has been allowed to develop by either the ignorance of the Government or the dishonesty of the Government.  I would charge them with being ignorant of the position&mdash;and they should not be ignorant of it&mdash;or else they have been dishonest during the last election, during the Presidential election, during all the period since the Dáil was convened after the last general election.  I think I can say that in all honesty.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that no Government want to impose extra taxation, that no Government want to come along and impose an extra 2d on the packet of 20 cigarettes, an extra 2d on the gallon of petrol and a five per cent increase on the non-essentials, maybe, of life. But they are essentials, you know. When a man marries, he must at least have a house and if he gets a house he must have furniture, a bed, table, chairs.  All of these things will carry five per cent plus the 2½ per cent turnover tax, amounting in all to 7½ per cent.  To say that it will not increase the cost of living is laughable.  It has increased the cost of marriage.  It increases the cost of living after marrying because, after the honeymoon, there is a period when you have to face up to things and to provide the essentials. Bread, butter, medicines and various things are excluded which is a good thing and I am all in favour of the Minister's exempting them but there is <Col N="1240" /> the fact that this five per cent will increase the cost of living.  There is the fact that organised trade unionists will realise that and will demand a further effort to compensate for it which will lead again to a spiral of wage demands and possible repressive measures.  None of us in the trade union movement believes that that is the answer.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago, when I was being educated in the trade union movement. I remember an organiser saying to me: &ldquo;A wage increase is not the answer&rdquo;. It would be better if we kept wages pegged and prices pegged than to have the present situation of one trying to catch up on the other.  I have always found that before the Labour Court, before conciliation, before even employers at local level, you had to justify your case for a wage increase on the cost of living having gone up&mdash;not that it was likely to go up but that it actually had gone up and, very often, for maybe a year or two years before. Any trade unionist who has been before the Labour Court, who has been before conciliation or even who has entered into direct negotiations with employers has found that he has to prove not only that the cost of living is likely to go up but that it actually has gone up and he must produce facts and figures.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Government have lost a lot of wisdom in their prestige hunt&mdash;the question of whether we have troops in Cyprus, the Congo or anywhere else; the question of whether we have embassies or consulates in countries which I cannot see will ever be of any use to us or give us any trade or be of benefit from the point of view of emigration, and so on.  There is one important country in our life here, Great Britain, our nearest neighbour, who buys most from us and from whom we buy most.  I would not worry about what money was spent on establishing offices in Great Britain to deal with conditions because practically as many Irishmen are employed in Great Britain today as are employed in Ireland.  It is reasonable to spend money there but it is crazy to send ambassadors to Kenya, Ghana and other African countries at the moment. If there is a trade potential there, maybe we could send out a trade delegation&mdash;not <Col N="1241" /> an ambassador&mdash;as the French and other people do.  We could send out somebody who will sell Irish goods anywhere they can without all the trappings, dinners and all the messing that I can read about but without seeing any results.</P>
    <P>I want to talk just a little bit about CIE.  I shall not try to introduce into this general debate a detailed statement in connection with any suggested closures, lest anybody should think I might.  Some of the CIE losses must be the result of no forward planning.  On the line where I live, which is about to be closed, there was a replacement of the line right through my town, at what cost I do not know, within the past five years.  New signal boxes were built; new sheds were built.  Now, suddenly, within five or ten years, it has been found that the line is uneconomic, that it is on the lowest scale &mdash;to quote the Minister's words to the deputation&mdash;in Europe with eight passengers per day per station and so much per traffic load.  He had all the details and naturally the ordinary Deputy would not have this facility and I accept what he says, but if it is so, this position did not arise last year.  It did not arise the year before. It must have been happening over a long period of perhaps ten to 20 years. Surely CIE must be indicted for the fact that they were not aware that the money they were spending five to ten years ago was money down the drain? As a Deputy for that constituency, I believe there is a solution other than the closing down of the railway.  It is crazy to set up an industrial estate in Waterford city and to tell the people how wonderful it is going to be from Waterford's point of view when you are cutting off the whole western portion of Munster.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that some thousands of people who availed of repair and reconstruction grants had, after the expiration of the seven year waiting period, their properties revalued and the valuation increased out of all proportion?  Is he not aware that many business people who improved their premises had their valuation increased out of all proportion also and in strict justice, does he not feel that some assurance should be given that such increases will not continue and also will he consider bringing in some relief?</P>

      <P>The Deputy in his question used the phrase &ldquo;excessive increases&rdquo; and in his supplementary questions, he used the phrase &ldquo;out of all proportion&rdquo;.  He must know that valuation is related by and large, and indeed in the main, to letting value. Every effort is made by the Valuation Commissioner to assess the valuation of premises on their letting values. There is a well-known statutory procedure <Col N="1244" /> whereby any person who regards the valuation placed on his reconstructed premises as too high can appeal, first of all, to the Commissioner, and then to the Circuit Court.  I have not heard of any cases in which such increases were so high as to be reduced to amounts that would suggest that the original figures were excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the persons to whom the Deputy refers are in the employment of the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>Forestry workers are remunerated by the Department of Lands; and tax is deductible from their emoluments in accordance with the normal system of tax deduction in operation for those paid by Government Departments.  Deductions in the case of forestry workers are at present based on a sliding scale agreed between the Inspector of Public Departments and the accounts branch of the Forestry Division.  Under the sliding scale arrangements, deductions are made over a period commencing on the first pay day after 5th April and finishing by February of the following year.  In special cases, arrangements are made to extend the deductions up to the end of March and later.  Unusually large deductions at infrequent intervals should not, therefore, normally arise.</P>
      <P>The scheme, which is optional, ensures that provisional deductions are made from the beginning of the income tax year.  If, however, a worker opts out of the scheme, deductions cannot be commenced until late in the year and in consequence, there could be heavier deductions spread over a short number of weeks.</P>
      <P>On the general question of bringing State employees under the PAYE system, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Norton on 17th February last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government (a) the number and size of houses and flats planned for the Ballymun building site, Dublin, (b) the names of the firms participating in the building consortium there and their functions, (c) the date upon which tenders for works were placed with these firms, (d) the date upon which it was originally estimated that houses would become available there for occupation, (e) the number of houses occupied to date, (f) the reason for the long delay in provision of urgently needed houses there, (g) the total number of dwellings which will be provided there during the present year, if any, and (h) whether he is satisfied with progress in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract provides for the erection of 3,021 dwellings, comprising 2,569 in blocks from four to 15 storeys and 452 in two-storey housing. In the light of the Corporation's schedule of requirements, the dwellings range in size from one-bedroom flats to houses of three bedrooms with two living rooms and kitchen.  The contractors are the Cubitt Haden Sisk consortium, a partnership with joint and several liability.  The contract period is four years from February, 1965.  The first prototype houses were erected in the summer of 1965 and the contractors <Col N="1248" /> then hoped to provide two-storey houses for occupation later in that year while the general site development and the construction and equipping of the large concrete factory was proceeding. I gave the House and the Corporation the reasons why the projected target of construction and occupation could not be maintained during the winter and spring months.  The revised programme of construction, which does not alter the period of contract, provides for the erection of about 850 dwellings this year.  I said before that I am never satisfied with the rate of housing progress where it can be increased, but it would be unfair to suggest that there is absence of progress on this scheme.  Up to last month, 8.95 miles of storm and foul sewers and 4.1 miles of roadways had been constructed.  Two hundred houses are under construction of which 65 are virtually ready for occupation. Erection of the first blocks of flats has commenced and the construction of further slab-foundations is proceeding. This rate of development and construction is considerably in advance of the normal pace of housing operations on any unplanned virgin site of a scale approximate to that at Ballymun.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest this is satisfactory development when we have not yet got&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean Dublin Corporation &mdash; any handover of houses at Ballymun, 18 months after the start of the scheme, despite the fact that an assurance was given in the early part of last year that houses would be available there for occupation by last August?  Does the Minister maintain, in face of that, that there has been progress?  Does he not, on the contrary, agree there has been a scandalous delay &mdash; no other words will describe the situation&mdash;in the provision of houses there and that a totally false impression has been created in the minds of many thousands of Dublin families in urgent need of housing accommodation, who have been disappointed with the assurance given regarding the provision of houses at Ballymun?  They have now been waiting for the past 18 months to see any positive signs of results.  I should like further, with your indulgence, <Col N="1249" /> a Cheann Comhairle; to ask will the Minister take steps to get these people out in Ballymun to get a move on and will he take cognisance of the fact that it is just not good enough to try to cover up for them here because of their neglect of this very essential work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the Deputy up on his last point first in relation to my covering up for these people.  I do not want Deputy Dunne or any other Deputy to push me into a position in which I might appear to be condoning any delays that might have taken place, whatever may have been the cause.  The causes of the delays in the winter and spring have already been thoroughly ventilated here.  While I would wish that they had not occurred, they were delays over which neither I nor the contractors had any control.  The delays occurred because of the very adverse weather.  I should like to see much greater progress, but the progress that has taken place is to be commended, remembering the unsuitable weather.</P>

      <P>Unless our tradesmen and other people employed in the factories and on the sites do not live up to what is being done elsewhere by similar people, I see no reason, from what I have seen of these buildings in other countries where they have been erected and occupied, why they should not be as good here.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is strong architectural opinion pretty freely expressed that, in fact, experience in Great Britain does suggest that the end product is not as cheap, bearing quality in mind, and not as expeditiously produced as organised conventional building would allow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that, from the architectural point of view and the opinions expressed by a number of members of that profession, they do not view this sort of development with any great enthusiasm.  I would also say, from my knowledge of the experience they have had in Britain in regard to this matter of industrialised building, in their first large venture there, which has only been going on for the past couple of years, they made an error of judgment in that they attempted to plan their houses and to get the system to suit it.  This, of course, reduces the benefits of a fully systemised operation.  You cannot preplan and then suit the system to the plan because you lose the benefits as to expedition and cost.</P>

The result is that today there are no houses under the scheme in this area well known to the Minister for Finance.

      <P>Since 1st January, 1966, the Corporation have been engaged in the acquisition and clearance of properties included in nine separate areas in respect of which compulsory purchase orders are operative.  Due to the nature of the properties involved, including owner-occupied for residential purposes, part business/part residential and multiple dwellings of the tenement type, it is not feasible to refer to the acquired properties as containing a specific number of separate dwellings.  For the same reasons, plus the fact that a settlement with any one individual owner may relate to a number of properties in the same CPO area, the compensation cannot be apportioned as between dwellings and other property. The total compensation paid in respect of all properties in the nine areas since the beginning of this year was £62,391.</P>
      <P>In addition the Corporation have been completing in the same period the acquisition of miscellaneous outstanding interests in properties in older compulsory purchase order areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

Periods from 12 months to 15 months may, of course, occur, in the normal course of events, between the date of application for a loan and date on which it is properly due for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital allocation of £100,000 made to Drogheda Corporation for the payment of house purchase loans <Col N="1258" /> in 1966-67 should be more than adequate to meet all payments on foot of their total outstanding firm commitments. It is open to the corporation to make forward allocations of additional loans, bearing in mind the assurace given to them of an equivalent capital allocation for 1967-68.  In any event, I am keeping their request for additional moneys under review in conjunction with similar requests from other housing authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

If I assure him that in fact an applicant is generally expected to wait for the period mentioned by me before he will be paid and has been told so by the genuine decent officials of Drogheda Corporation, would the Minister not consider that this is a special case and do something about it?</P>

      <P>I have been considering this case, as the Deputy is fully aware, and I think he is also aware of my view and indeed the official view in my Department of the measure of satisfaction at the allocation of £100,000, which approximates to what I say in the reply; that this total sum can and does meet the payments on foot of their total outstanding firm commitments as of this date.  This, as I say, is what we have&mdash;and I think we rightly have it&mdash; that the local view probably has been rather astringently taken and that there is this matter of regarding allocations, even provisional allocations, adding them up with actual firm commitments and saying: &ldquo;Now, we are committed to all this&rdquo;, whereas in fact all of this would not be paid during the present year, even where commitments are firmly met.  As I have said to the Deputy, and his colleagues who were talking to me, this is a matter which could and should be rectified to the satisfaction of both my Department and his corporation as soon as they wish to get together on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as local authority housing schemes are concerned, the council have been allocated sufficient capital to meet commitments arising in the current financial year on works in progress and to proceed with the erection of 14 additional cottages.  They have been informed that approval to the acceptance of further tenders must be deferred pending the current general review of the capital position.  Tenders for only three of their cottages are awaiting sanction in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>Regarding public water supply and sewerage schemes, capital allocations for the current financial year in respect of sanitary and other services were notified recently to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation of £14,000 for 1966-67 for house-purchase loans is in excess of the council's firm commitments and should be sufficient, in conjunction with the small credit balance which they had on hands at 31st March last, to enable them meet requirements in respect of payments in the current financial year and in the light of the assurance already given to them of an equivalent allocation for 1967-68 to meet reasonable forward commitments.</P>

      <P>I feel sure the Minister is aware that South Tipperary County Council had won for itself the name of being a progressive, if not the most progressive council in all Ireland in respect of the extension of <Col N="1261" /> piped water and that by reason of the lack of financial accommodation at the present time, their proposals for new regional schemes have been completely disrupted; further, that there are, in fact, three regional schemes, namely Ardfinnan, Dundrum and Emly, which are ready to go to the contractor, if money can be made available.  Is the Minister further aware that the direct labour gangs in respect of repairs to cottages have been abandoned and is he not aware that the money for SDA loans for new houses is, to my knowledge, exhausted at the present time and that no further loans can be made available?  In these circumstances, will he come to the rescue of the council and make available a sufficiency of money to assist the council to honour its obligations to its people in respect of these essential services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I repeat for the Deputy what I have said.  My understanding of the situation in regard to the loan position for house purchase is that the allocation for the year is in excess of the council's firm commitments and more than sufficient, in conjunction with the credit balance which they had at 31st March last, to enable them to meet requirements in respect of payments in the current financial year.  I cannot add further to that.  If it can be shown that this is not so, this is something which will have to be taken into consideration in any further reviews which may take place.</P>
      <P>In so far as the overall request for money for all the various programmes which the county council has on hand is concerned, I can only say that, as far as the allocation notified to them is concerned, to whatever degree it was utilised for the present, that is the furthest I can go at the moment and that my own wish naturally would be that the progressiveness of the South Tipperary County Council's record should not be marred in any way, and will not be in so far as I can help them in the future.</P>

      <P>A proposal by the Waterford County Council to construct <Col N="1263" /> a new road across the Comeragh Mountains with the aid of a contribution under the Amenity Grants Scheme was rejected in March 1966 on the ground that the proposed works did not come within the ambit of the scheme.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year or so a number of steps have been taken by me to improve the standard of bacon.  Last year I made new statutory regulations governing the hygienic and other aspects of bacon production.  I have had discussions with representatives of the Pigs and Bacon Commission and these have led to improved co-ordination of the work <Col N="1273" /> of my Department and the Commission in supervising and improving standards in the bacon curing industry.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with the Commission courses of instruction in bacon selection, butchering and hygiene have been introduced for the Department's and the Commission's staffs at the factories.  Also, a group consisting of representatives of my Department, the Commission, An Foras Talúntais and the bacon curers has been set up to investigate the question of chemical and bacteriological standards for brine with the object of achieving greater uniformity of cure.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions also with my Department's supervisory personnel at all bacon factories and have impressed on them the importance of maintaining the highest possible standards.  Two veterinary officers of my Department have been specially assigned as hygiene officers to exercise continuous supervision over the maintenance of proper hygienic conditions at the factories.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the great bulk of Irish bacon is of first class quality and I shall ensure that the measures which are already being taken to raise and maintain standards in the industry will be continued and intensified, where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

They have a lot of leeway to make up but they are making strenuous efforts to improve marketing <Col N="1274" /> and quality.  They have been successful in achieving a considerable increase in our prices relative to other prices and I am satisfied their efforts will continue in this direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is completely and utterly untrue.  It is a complete falsehood.  I, personally, have followed up reports from the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Furthermore, I availed of a recent occasion to call in our inspectors from all the factories and had a full, frank discussion about the situation and impressed on them the necessity to keep up standards of quality and hygiene.  This is all part of a vested interest campaign to try to denigrate my officials and inspectors and I am surprised the Deputy is lending his name to it.</P>

However, as the Deputy knows, I have a Fisheries Bill coming up and it is my intention to deal with the whole matter in that legislation, to give myself powers to control fishing by skin diving and possibly to license fishing by skin diving in certain circumstances. But I could not do it at the moment.  All I can do is to impose this blanket control.  I have met the association representing sub-aqua clubs and I have discussed the matter fully with them.  Indeed, they offered me their fullest co-operation for research and other purposes.  I wish to <Col N="1280" /> pay tribute to them for that.

To our knowledge, great sacrifices have been made by these voluntary workers who give their time, their work, their leisure, their sleep, their meals, and are obliged to find the equipment by way of boats and other equipment, especially where drowning is concerned.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the setting up of a new Department of Government, to be known as the Ministry of <Col N="1289" /> Labour.  The idea of setting up a separate Ministry of Labour has been the subject of some public debate in recent years and was mentioned in some reports and documents which have been published to the Dáil.  It was put forward formally in April, 1964, by the Irish National Productivity committee, in the context of a document dealing with the development of an active manpower policy. The Government decided that it necessitated very careful consideration and, as part of the process of giving it this consideration, the inter-departmental committee which had been set up by the Government to consider the administrative arrangements for implementing manpower policy was asked to consider and to report on the proposal.</P>
    <P>This committee recommended against its adoption.  The committee was, of course, concerned mainly with the development and administration of manpower policy and had not, therefore, considered very fully the need for a separate Department of Labour in connection with other aspects of the labour situation which would be primarily a policy decision rather than an administrative one.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council commented on this report from the interdepartmental committee and, while recognising the arguments to the contrary, expressed their belief that there were considerable psychological and other advantages in having all major matters relating to manpower under one Ministry, preferably a new Ministry of Labour.  They proposed that if a new Ministry was not set up, these responsibilities should be concentrated in the Department of Industry and commerce, including the administration of the employment exchange service.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that in the earlier stages of development of manpower policy the manpower authority should be located in the Department of Industry and Commerce to which a Parliamentary Secretary was assigned with special responsibility in this regard and that the problem of future responsibility for the administration of the <Col N="1290" /> employment exchanges should be further considered when the problems involved had been more fully studied.</P>
    <P>The probability is that the Government would have eventually decided on a separate Department of Labour in conjunction with the development of manpower policy even if more recent events in the labour sphere had not focussed public attention on other aspects of the labour situation.  These other aspects seem, in our view, to support the case for a new Department of State which would be exclusively concerned with labour matters and in which would be concentrated all the functions of government in regard to the protection of the interests of workers and where the more fundamental aspects of policy in this regard could be studied by a Minister with no other Departmental responsibilities, assisted by specialist staffs.</P>
    <P>The aspects of labour affairs which have been most prominently in the public notice recently relate mainly to industrial relations and these have occupied an increasing proportion of the time of the Government as well as of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in recent months.  The deterioration of industrial relations, particularly following on the failure of the negotiations early in this year between the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on another national agreement, required the Government to give a great deal of consideration to general policy in this regard and led to a decision that, to secure a more comprehensive approach to the problems presenting themselves in this area and in the interests of industrial peace, to protect the welfare of workers and to develop a modern approach to industrial relations generally, changes in the organisation of government were required and specifically, that a new Department of Labour should be set up.</P>
    <P>The history of Government attitudes to industrial relations may be briefly summarised.  Prior to the enactment, in 1946, of the Industrial Relations Act, responsibility for industrial relamenta <Col N="1291" /> tions in the broadest sense, including the administration of a conciliation service&mdash;a very limited conciliation service at that time&mdash;rested with the Department of Industry and Commerce. When important industrial disputes arose which were not resolved by direct negotiation between the parties or which erupted into strikes, the parties were normally invited into the Department and generally negotiated settlements eventually, under the auspices of the Department.  This practice not infrequently involved the personal participation of the Minister in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The circumstances prevailing in these pre-war years were, however, very different from those of today.  That was a period of protracted difficulties, due to the world economic slump and to the special problems caused for Ireland by what is now known as the Economic War.  Industrial development was only beginning.  Disputes at that time were not very numerous by present day standards and disputes could generally be dealt with in isolation. It was rarely a problem that a settlement of a dispute in one occupation involved problems in others as it does today.  The comparison factor was less potent then than it is now. Organisation on the trade union side was much less extensive than it is today and on the employers' side was non-existent, except for specialist groups like the Federation of Building Employers.</P>
    <P>At a subsequent stage, there arose the complication of the split in the trade union movement and the emergence of two trade union congresses which for quite a long time had no relations with each other and even declined to meet together.  This tended not only to increase the number of disputes but made their settlement by negotiation a more difficult operation.</P>
    <P>The decision to try a new institutional system in the post-war Ireland, involving the setting up of the Labour Court, arose out of consideration which was given to this problem during the war years and followed on the situation which developed during the war, <Col N="1292" /> including the wage control system operated during the latter part of that period which involved periodic flat-rate increases of wages on a national and uniform basis which it seems reasonable to assume was the initiating cause of the wage rounds which have been characteristic of our post-war situation.</P>
    <P>The desire of the Government of that day to get rid of wartime controls as quickly as possible, the recognition that the experience under the wartime system of uniform increases on a national basis was likely to influence the future course of wage negotiations and the general need that was expressed by trade unions and employers alike for an institutional system outside the Government that would facilitate collective bargaining and, in theory at least, reduce the prospects of disputes leading to strikes were the basis of this decision.</P>
    <P>At various times since 1946 the operation of the Industrial Relations Act was reviewed in discussions with organisations representative of employers and trade unions, and while no desire for any fundamental change manifested itself, some changes in methods of operation were made which tended in the main to put increasing emphasis on the conciliation service operated under the Court.  The idea of trying to negotiate periodic wage adjustments by national agreements began to emerge.  In 1948, in 1952 and again in 1957 agreements of this kind were made in a fairly straightforward and uncomplicated way and worked fairly well, in my judgment.  This process stopped, however, and was given up altogether until the National Wage Agreement of 1963 which was more complicated and not so successful; recent experiences have led to the conclusion, which is, I believe, shared by both the trade union and employers' organisations, as well as by the Government, that more fundamental changes may now be needed both in respect of the functions and organisation of the Labour Court and in the operation and extent of the conciliation service, and discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions and the <Col N="1293" /> Federated Union of Employers in this respect are taking place at this time.</P>
    <P>There is also a need in our view for the initiation of some system, however informal, if one could be devised, which would enable the possibility of trouble to be detected before it develops and action taken in time to deal with it as well as for positive Government participation in the development of a more modern and sensible system for dealing with industrial relations which I think everybody recognises to be desirable.</P>
    <P>The Government have been hoping that many of the problems arising in industrial relations could be reduced, if not removed, by agreement between the central bodies representing unions and employers and without Government participation.  We actively encouraged the initiation of joint discussions with this end in view and for a time the work of the Employer/ Labour Conference held out this prospect. Without going into details as to the reasons for the decline of this hope, the Government have now had to decide that if the system of free collective bargaining in labour matters is to function properly, it requires not only the extension and the improvement of the institutional facilities now available but also some more active Government encouragement of discussions aiming at the development of a better situation and indeed with Government participation in discussions, and this will be the function of the new Ministry.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a new Ministry of Labour is not to be taken as implying any fundamental change in regard to Government policy in respect of industrial relations which is firmly based upon the principle of free collective bargaining to which we are committed by our ratification of an International Labour Organisation Convention.  We conceive of the duty of Government as limiting its role to facilitating this system in whatever way may be agreed to be desirable. Neither does it mean we have some cut and dried ideas as to how matters should develop in industrial relations for which we intend to press, although <Col N="1294" /> it does mean recognition of the need for more active Government leadership in this regard.  It implies, however, acceptance of the now generally recognised fact that better industrial relations are an important aspect of national development policy which is likely to become of even greater importance as our industrial progress proceeds and that some new thinking is required in all quarters regarding this situation.</P>
    <P>Over the whole field of relations between workers and their employers, it has become increasingly evident that as the prosperity of the country grows, new forces and pressures are being released and new concepts and new problems are emerging.  Like all other democratic nations, we are being faced with rapid changes in our economic life, not all the consequences of which have been or indeed can be foreseen. Perception of what these changes may involve in industrial relations is growing but growing fairly slowly.  There seems to be in this area, as indeed might have been expected, greater reluctance to abandon old attitudes and old procedures, and particularly reluctance to consider new approaches to the new problems which are emerging.</P>
    <P>Among the workers the forces of change can be seen to be at work, although it is still largely uncontrolled and unco-ordinated.  Among employers, new ideas seem at times to lead to bewilderment and even to resentment. If the whole effort for a steady attainable pace of economic development in which all sections of the community must share is not to be brought to nothing, we must give much more attention to managing the human side of economic life as well as the material side.  This is the basic reason for the Government's decision to propose the setting up of a new Ministry of Labour. There is a real job of work to be done by the new Minister.  New thinking will be required and to the extent that the Government have a part to play in it&mdash; this in itself is one of the matters that has to be worked out&mdash;the time has certainly come to create a new Department of State which will have the duty of devoting the whole of its attention <Col N="1295" /> to this important job and, with a specialist staff, to undertake it.</P>
    <P>Whatever is to be the role of the Government, it must certainly be a central one and the Government must be properly equipped for the task.  The creation of this new Department should achieve this.  One of the main tasks of the new Department will be to establish a research section where fundamental studies can begin and which can acquire and distribute reliable information as to what is happening in this respect in other countries and to which leading employers and trade union representatives can contribute their ideas for improving the situation.  While it seems likely that for a long time to come industrial relations will be a large part of the work of the new Department, it will not of course be concerned exclusively with them.  Its primary duty will be to protect the interests of the workers in matters which are properly the concern of the Government.  It may not be fully appreciated, even by workers, the extent to which by various legislative enactments the Government have moved to protect their interests.</P>

It will take over the functions of the Minister for Industry <Col N="1296" /> and Commerce in regard to these matters and including all the other labour aspects of the work of that Department, including the development of the Manpower Authority, the administration of the laws passed to protect workers' health and safety, that is to say, the Factories Acts, the Conditions of Employment Acts, including the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, the Office Premises Acts, the Truck Acts, the Trade Union Acts, the Holidays Acts, the Mines and Quarries Act, and it will also have responsibility for international relations in labour matters which are in large degree channel-led through the International Labour Organisation.</P>

      <P>I shall mention that later.  One of the matters to which very careful consideration has been given is responsibility for the administration of the employment exchanges.  The National Industrial Economic Council recommended that the administration of the social welfare services should be separated from the employment exchanges.  They advanced some cogent reasons for this view.  This would probably be regarded as the preferable arrangement in circumstances where, by reason of rising employment and the increased use of employment exchange service by private employers, the operation of the employment exchanges required extension. The Government consider, however, that this would be an unjustifiable addition to administrative costs at this time and probably for the foreseeable future.  By far the larger part of the work of the exchanges now is the distribution of unemployment benefits and the placement service, that is to say, the service which put unemployed workers in touch with reported vacancies, is not yet utilised very extensively by private employers, although this situation may change, and we hope it will change, with the extension of industrial training facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the aims of Government policy is to build up the importance and the reputation of the employment <Col N="1297" /> placement service and to extend its utility both to workers and employers and to minimise its association with unemployment benefit and particularly the tendency to regard the work of the employment service as mainly providing a test of eligibility for unemployment benefit.  We recognise that this will take a great deal of time and a further improvement in our over-all employment situation before this new image of the employment placement service can be fully realised. The question for decision by the Government, therefore, was whether administration of these employment exchanges operating both as a placement service and as an organisation for the payment of unemployment benefits should continue to be left with the Department of Social Welfare, which would carry on the placement service as agent for the new Ministry or the reverse arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Administration whose Report I have already mentioned, recommended leaving the administration of the exchanges with the Department of Social welfare.  We have decided, however, that it is better to transfer their administration to the Minister of Labour who will carry on in the exchanges on an agency basis the functions of the Minister for Social Welfare regarding the payment of benefits.  The Minister for Social Welfare will, of course, continue to be responsible for the operation and development of these social services and for Government policy in regard to them.  Particularly under the present Minister for Social Welfare, there has been very great progress, not only in extending the scope of these services but especially in removing many of the anomalies and inequities which previously marred their operation.  It is accepted that for some time to come &mdash;perhaps a long time to come&mdash;the major part of the work done in the employment exchanges will be the payment of these benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The employment exchanges will continue to <Col N="1298" /> function as they are, operating both services, but administration will be under the control of the Minister for Labour who will carry out the work of the Minister for Social Welfare as his agent.</P>
      <P>There is also this question of responsibility for administration of the legislation in regard to agricultural wages.  This largely relates to minimum agricultural wages and the operation of the Agricultural Wages Boards places responsibility on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  We have decided that for the time being, as a matter of administrative convenience, this situation should not be changed, although this decision will be reconsidered at a later stage.  The Minister for Labour will deal directly with the State boards in relation to labour matters of general concern but this does not imply any lessening of the autonomy conferred on these boards by the legislation we passed when we set them up.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government will be the same.  However, the Minister for Labour will keep in close touch with developments which can affect the general labour situation.  It will be necessary, of course, for the Minister for Labour to keep the Ministers who are concerned with the supervision of any of these boards constantly informed regarding developments arising in respect of labour matters which may affect their operations in any way or have a bearing on Government policy in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NIEC recommended that inquiries into the circumstances of important strikes should be undertaken after their conclusion&mdash;it probably having in mind in this regard situations such as arose in connection with the Dublin dock strike of last January. The Government have accepted the desirability of arranging for these inquiries. The NIEC has recently submitted an interim memorandum of their ideas as to how and when these inquiries should be arranged.  The consideration <Col N="1299" /> of this memorandum will be a function of the new Minister.  He will also have the duty of endeavouring to have carried into effect the recommendations of the NIEC in their report which was published this morning upon development planning at plant level, which is in full accord with Government policy.  His primary duty will be to develop a consistent policy covering all aspects of employment; to protect workers against developments detrimental to their welfare; to protect their rights under legislation; to prepare new legislation, as needed, for the extension of this protection and to work to promote a climate of goodwill in respect of labour matters which will contribute to industrial peace and to national economic progress.</P>

      <P>That is true.  The first amendment, in the name of Deputy Cosgrave, is typical of the Fine Gael negative approach to national problems and of their constant desire to face two ways at once.  To those who approve of the setting-up of this new Ministry, they will be able to say in the future: &ldquo;We would have agreed to it if only the Government had done such and such&rdquo;.  To those who, for some benighted reason, do not approve of the setting-up of this new Ministry, they will be able to say that they voted against it, anyway.  They are becoming past masters of the techniques of evasion and double talk.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment appears to be inspired by even meaner motives.  Their aim seems to be to avail of the opportunity of the introduction of this Bill to launch a personal attack on an individual Minister. The Minister for Transport and Power requires no defence from me.  He is, indeed, one of the most conscientious, hard-working and dedicated Ministers of the Government.  His only fault, if it is a fault, is that, in dealing with the stupid comments and tendentious questions that come to him from the other side of the House, he is far too reasonable, polite and gentlemanly&mdash;and that is what the Deputies of the Labour Party do not understand.  May I give a word of advice?  If a smear campaign is to be launched against Deputy Erskine Childers, then leave it to Fine Gael: they have a tradition of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of Government has been tending constantly to increase and it is unlikely that this trend will ever be reversed. When I first became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1932, I took over a Department that administered not merely the work now done by the Department of Industry and Commerce but also the work done by the Department of Transport and Power, the work that will be done by the Department of Labour and the work now done by the Department of Social Welfare. All these activities were, at that time, concentrated in the one Department. It would be foolish in the extreme to sacrifice the effective performance of the work of government for the sake of fitting it into a rigid structure of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that, from time to time, it will be deemed desirable to redistribute departmental responsibilities amongst the Members of the Government but, under our system, that is the duty of the Taoiseach and not of the Dáil.  Except to the extent that I have indicated, I can see only disadvantages in attempting further changes at this time.  To reduce the number of Ministers would be to reduce the effectiveness of Government.  Economy in this matter, requires constant attention to how to get the business of Government done effectively as well as how to get it done cheaply.  Most Ministers are, in my judgment&mdash;and I can speak with some experience, if not wisdom, in this regard&mdash;unduly occupied with administrative matters and have too little time for the fundamental <Col N="1303" /> and far more important work of studying in depth the problems of national, economic and social development policies.  They have to rely, to what is perhaps an undue extent, upon the researches carried out by Government commissions and committees and on the advice of top civil servants.</P>
    <P>It is a very shortsighted attitude which holds that Ministers are not fully occupied unless they are spending all their time in their offices signing documents and behaving like senior civil servants instead of as policy makers.  Most of the newspaper comments on the work and on the number of Ministers come from people who just do not know very much about what they are talking but there are a number of experienced people in both Opposition Parties who have had experience of work in a Government, of a sort, and they must understand that in the case of an active and energetic Government, striving to bring the country's policy and the country's organisation into line with modern requirements, the work of Ministers should extend far outside the routine of their Departments.  It should cover major policy studies.  It includes their functions as Members of the Cabinet as well as the duties of informing public opinion by attending and speaking at functions of one kind or another around the country.</P>
    <P>Indeed, keeping contact with and informing public opinion in this way is one of the main tasks of Ministers, and I am constantly stressing on my colleagues the importance of this task. Indeed, it is a source of regret to them all, as it is to me, that because of the limited number of hours in the day, or days in the week, it is not possible for us to do more.  I am asking the Dáil to reject these ill-considered amendments moved by the Parties opposite and to decide instead that a Minister of Labour is required who will be able to devote his undivided attention to what most people, outside the ranks of the Fine Gael Party, recognise as the most important social problem of our day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses <Col N="1304" /> to give a Second Reading to the Bill until the Government provide for the amalgamation of at least two existing Departments, so that by the appointment of a Minister for Labour an extra Minister will not be required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed that a large part of the Taoiseach's speech was devoted to an historical account of certain labour matters.  Most of it was irrevelant to the problems at present before the House.  Most of it was concerned with an account of what had happened in certain respects before the war and there was some reference to events since the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act in 1946.  However, Deputies will have noticed that there was virtually no reference to the Labour Court, no indication of any practical steps which the Government propose to take to deal with the present widespread industrial unrest, except the decision to establish a separate Department, which, of course, is a change from the view expressed by the Government last year.  This decision which was recommended by the NIEC was avoided to some extent in the interdepartmental report and was shelved by the Government until industrial strife became so widespread that an announcement was made for the purpost of diverting attention from the economic factors which affect the country, and the serious consequences of mistaken Government policy, resulting in widespread disaffection and disillusionment.</P>
    <P>Then we had a reference to the number of Ministers in certain European countries.  There was the suggestion that because a whole lot of different countries had larger Cabinets than we have, there was a justification for an increase here.  The Taoiseach forgot to mention that in all these countries the population is going up and that in virtually every country in Europe, they have such a problem.  In Britain, the population has increased also and indeed there they have only something like 50 Ministers for a population of 50 million people.  Here the population is going down and the numbers employed at present are the lowest ever in our history.  The Department of <Col N="1305" /> Social Welfare, which is now apparently to be continued in some filleted form, has no effective function and plays no part, according to the Taoiseach, in finding employment or new jobs for people in search of work.  The new distribution of social welfare benefits will now become the only remaining function which the Department of Social Welfare will carry out and even that function will be carried out on an agency basis by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>It cannot be suggested, as was implied in the Taoiseach's remarks, that certain Ministers have a whole range of administrative responsibilities which occupy their time.  The rate of benefit to be paid to an old age pensioner, a person on unemployment assistance, or to a widow or orphan, or to any other recipient, is laid down specifically in the legislation and the Minister for Social Welfare has no function in deciding whether applicants are paid at a higher or a lower rate.  In a few instances, such matters may come to him on appeal, but the rate of benefit is strictly laid down in legislation and must be implemented according to the terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the Minister has any particular function is contrary to the facts, contrary to the terms of the legislation, and contrary to the knowledge which every Member of this House, including the Taoiseach, has. So far as the Minister for Transport and Power is concerned, the responsibility for policy decisions in respect of Government and State bodies is laid down in the terms of the legislation when it is enacted.  Whether CIE has a particular sum is decided in the legislation. The capital requirements of all State bodies, whether CIE, the ESB or one of these other bodies, are decided on and enshrined in the terms of the legislation which is enacted when the capital is decided on for a particular period ahead.  That is a Government decision, and one in which the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms expressed here &mdash;it is one which appears to annoy the Taoiseach, though I do not think it really annoys him; I think he feigns <Col N="1306" /> annoyance &mdash; is that the Minister for Transport and Power, or any other Minister with overall responsibility for a State body, or bodies, under his control, says that he has, or they have, no responsibility whatever for any decisions taken, that the decisions are matters for the boards of the particular State companies or bodies, and the Minister has no function and no responsibility.  That applies, in particular, to the Department of Transport and Power and to the State bodies under the control of that Department. In so far as certain other Departments are concerned, the same argument applies but it applies in particular to the Department of Transport and Power and its Minister.</P>
    <P>We have long accepted the view that the time has come when there should be a separate Department of Labour.  With a falling population, with fewer people in employment, coupled with the fact that the estimated. target envisaged in the Second Programme not merely has not been attained in respect of employment but the actual numbers in employment are substantially less today than they were ten years ago and show no sign of any worthwhile expansion, except in a very limited sphere and that is offset by a substantially greater reduction in employment in other spheres, there is no justification for a separate Department of Social Welfare, a separate Department of Transport and Power, a separate Department of Posts and Telegraphs and a separate Department of Industry and Commerce, and now a new Department of Labour.  There are certain functions in Transport and Power and in Posts and Telegraphs in respect of communications which could conveniently be amalgamated.  The few remaining functions now left in the Department of Social Welfare could easily be transferred to the Minister for Health.  In so far as certain remaining functions as between Industry and Commerce and the new Department of Labour are concerned, they could be divided or allocated on whatever basis may be decided.</P>
    <P>The position is that the Department of Industry and Commerce has, in the main, been responsible for industrial <Col N="1307" /> relations and labour matters generally, with the exception of certain functions which are the particular responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  If this decision to establish a new Department of Labour means that a new approach will be adopted to industrial relations, then I believe it could prove of benefit.  However, judging by the remarks made by the Taoiseach, no particular change is envisaged in either policy or attitude.  It merely means, therefore, more civil servants, more people to deal with fewer people in employment.  That is bad national policy and bad economics.  If labour relations have so deteriorated that it is now necessary to establish a separate Department of Labour, then it is time we recruited specialist advisers with specialist knowledge in the field of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is no reflection on the section of the Department of Industry and Commerce concerned, which has dealt with this problem up to the present, and no reflection on the personnel of the Labour Court; in fact, tribute should be paid to the energy, initiative and devotion to work on the part of people who were entering into a new sphere of activity.  But, if this problem is to be tackled on a realistic basis now, with advertence to the peculiar economic and social implications involved in industrial relations, then it is essential that the staff dealing with it should be recruited from specialist advisers in this field, not exclusively, but for the particular specialised work associated with the question of industrial relations generally.</P>
    <P>The administrative work will, undoubtedly, have to be carried on by the ordinary administrative personnel. A question to which the Taoiseach might have given some attention&mdash;for some reason or another, there was no indication of a new approach or a new attitude&mdash;is that of recruitment in future of specialist staff for particular Departments.  It is no solution to the problem to increase the number of Ministers.  That, in fact, reflects a weakness not only in the Government but in the whole administrative machine, with a smaller population, <Col N="1308" /> with fewer people at work, and with very little prospect of increased employment over a wide range of industrial areas, not to mention agriculture.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the present Minister for Health&mdash;he was then on this side of the House&mdash;argued that it would be possible to amalgamate the Departments of Justice and Defence.  I do not think anyone would take that particular suggestion very seriously. There was strong criticism at that time because we decided to establish a separate Ministry of the Gaeltacht to try to save, economically and culturally, the population of the Gaeltacht.  Now a situation has developed in which not alone are there more Ministers but we have the largest number of Parliamentary Secretaries ever attached to a Government in this country.  I believe no real thought has been given to the structure of Government Departments and to the allocation of responsibilities between Departments.  I believe the present decision has been taken merely to avoid the consequences of thinking clearly and constructively about those problems which affect industrial relations and trade union and employer organisations.</P>
    <P>In the past the function of Ministers was limited to a considerable extent to administrative duties.  Nowadays, with Governments interfering to a greater extent and playing a more positive role in economic and social matters, the functions and responsibilities and the range of work which Ministers have to do involve not merely administration but something else as well.  There is need for technical experts.  In the past, the work of Government Departments was merely administrative, in the sense that Governments laid down general economic and other policies and these were administered by staff recruited through the normal channels to the Civil Service.  In modern times that system can no longer be regarded as adequate, and I believe this debate offers an opportunity of considering what steps should be taken to provide the technical and specialist personnel necessary for the work of specialised Departments or specialised sections of Departments.  It is impossible to expect <Col N="1309" /> that any Minister, however experienced or however qualified, can have the technical or specialist knowledge necessary for the detailed economic and social questions raised in problems of this sort.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases, as was adverted to in some of the remarks of the Taoiseach, Ministers have to rely on reports of either interdepartmental committees, <i>ad hoc</i> committees or commissions appointed for the purpose of examining and recommending particular policies or particular lines of action in respect of the problem or question assigned to them.  This certainly raises the question whether&mdash;certainly in so far as this Department is concerned in connection with the specialist staff necessary for the industrial relations section&mdash;the method of recruitment to the Civil Service and the normal Civil Service standards applicable to recruitment can, in relation to our present needs and future requirements, be regarded as adequate.</P>
    <P>One of the old-time criticisms which were constantly used against the Civil Service machinery is that it tends to delay decisions and to postpone action. I do not think that criticism is entirely fair, because the machinery under which the Civil Service operates is designed and was framed to meet entirely different circumstances.  The need for care and the desire to avoid taking action, if taking action meant the possibility of trouble or meant taking a decision, the consequences of which might not be readily foreseen, involved a natural attitude in the Civil Service as a whole that postponing decisions or, certainly, prolonging consideration, avoided the consequences which a quick decision might involve for it. For that reason some of the delays inherent in decisions and inherent in the system were unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In modern conditions, with the pace of modern life, with the growth of problems inherent in the rapid developments which have occurred in so many spheres or the growth of problems associated with rapid communications, that system has altered radically.  In a number of other countries, including Britain, recruitment to specialised sections of individual Departments has <Col N="1310" /> taken place from persons qualified because of their studies, because of their strata, in sociology, industrial relations, universities or technical and vocational colleges.  Staff have been recruited from these strata for specialised work.</P>
    <P>The time has arrived when, if this new Department is to be effective, it ought not to be a light decision taken on the basis that, because there is a difficulty, the easiest way to distract attention from the problems inherent in that difficulty is to recommend a new Department.  Merely calling a Minister by a different name will not solve industrial problems; merely transferring certain functions from one Minister to another and relieving him of responsibility for certain other duties will not solve the basic problems inherent in the present climate which has had such serious consequences for the national economy.</P>
    <P>The approach to this matter must be much more fundamental, must be based on the realisation that not only will research be necessary for the Department and the Minister concerned but also for the Labour Court and those responsible for administering the machinery of the Industrial Relations Act.  By and large, the structure of the Labour Court and the system under which it has operated have remained virtually the same since the original Act was passed.  If the machinery then laid down was adequate for the relatively leisurely times which existed up to then, surely the time has now arrived for a radical examination and overhaul of the machinery at present in operation?</P>
    <P>It must be realised&mdash;and this certainly differs from the view which the Taoiseach expressed when he said this decision did not operate to indicate any definite change of attitude&mdash; that, whatever else may be said about the operation of the Industrial Relations Act and the system which has operated in recent times, it has been defective.  It has been defective in securing settlements, defective in anticipating or detecting in advance what might occur, and defective in assessing in retrospect what were the circumstances and conditions which <Col N="1311" /> contributed to the industrial disputes. In a few cases, specialised or limited study has been undertaken of the causes of an individual dispute or the causes of industrial unrest which may have followed, but with these exceptions, no worthwhile research or examination has been undertaken of the circumstances and causes of a cessation of work and the consequent dislocation which affected the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>If the decision to establish a research sections means that some action is proposed <Col N="1312" /> in that regard, then it can offer some prospect of an improvement, but research of this sort can be undertaken effectively and properly only by qualified persons capable of assessing the various factors involved in the industry concerned and trained from their experience in the particular problems which affect the industry and the workers as well as the social aspects of it.</P>
