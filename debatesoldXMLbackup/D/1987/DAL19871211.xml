    <P>As I have mentioned, a bonus payment in regard to certain benefits and allowances administered by the Department of Health was paid this month.  The relevant allowances include the disabled person's maintenance and rehabilitation allowances, the infectious disease maintenance allowances, the blind welfare allowances, and the constant care allowances in respect of disabled children who are maintained at home.  An estimated 33,000 recipients have benefited from these bonus payments.</P>
    <P>The extra provision sought for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board is £3,001,000.  This will bring the total provision for the board to £110,801,000 which represents an increase of about 2.8 per cent on the original provision made.</P>
    <P>The extra provision sought is required to meet the cash needs of the payments board.  It will be appreciated that the general medical services are demand-led services catering for the lower income group in the population.  It is impossible, <Col N="1848" /> under such a system, to be completely accurate in predicting the final cash requirements of the services.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my speech to this House on 22 October last in regard to the 1988 Estimates for the health services, the trend of increasing costs in the general medical services must be addressed.  I am convinced that these trends can be arrested and a new, more rational and controllable system put in its place.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are continuing with the Irish Medical Organisation on new methods of administering the services, including changes in the method of payment for general practitioners, in an attempt to bring this about.  I am particularly anxious that these negotiations proceed as quickly as possible so that any new agreement on restructuring the general medical services is put in place in 1988.</P>
    <P>The result of the negotiations which I asked to be activated earlier this year between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries will provide for a price freeze on pharmaceuticals up to the end of October 1988 and will also assist in controlling costs in that year.</P>
    <P>An increase in appropriations-in-aid of £3,800,000 is anticipated.  This increase results from two sources.  First, there is an irregular pattern of income from health contributions.  The rate increased from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent with effect from 6 April 1987.  The additional receipts of £1,900,000 arise from increased buoyancy in the level of collections.  Secondly, certain health services, in accordance with EC regulations, are provided to employed persons, self-employed persons, pensioners and dependants of such persons from other member states while they are visiting or staying in this country. The costs of providing those services are recoupable from the other member states of the European Community.  The increased yield under this heading is £1,900,000 brought about largely by exchange rate fluctuations which have been favourable to us and which, of course, are very difficult to predict in advance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> I would now like to say a few words about health expenditure generally in 1987.  As I have earlier indicated, the additional appropriations-in-aid now available are being used to give a Christmas bonus for recipients of health allowances and to meet the unforeseeable requirements of the demand led general medical services.  Excluding these two areas, and in contrast to the experience during the previous Government's term of office, overall health expenditure this year has been kept strictly within the limitations approved in the original Estimates.</P>
    <P>Despite this control essential services have been maintained at an adequate level and the health agencies have responded to the needs of the community, in particular, to those of the less well off sections of society.  My Department have worked very closely with the health agencies in monitoring the situation, both in relation to services and spending as the year progressed and I would like to express my appreciation of the constructive way these agencies have tackled the significant problems which they faced.  Everybody involved in the provision of health care has had to adjust their expectations in this period of necessary financial restraint and has had to maximise the return from the resources which are available.</P>
    <P>The work done by the health agencies in controlling their expenditure in 1987 augurs well for a similar responsible attitude and performance in 1988.  It has to be accepted that better management of financial and personnel resources is imperative if the country is to solve its serious debt problems.  With PAYE revenue going largely to meet the national debt there is no alternative but to reduce overall spending.  In doing so, we must ensure also that we maximise the benefits from this reduced spending and ensure that essential services are available for those who need them.  I am confident that this can be done within the resources which are available for 1988.</P>
    <P>A major event at the end of this year was the opening of Beaumont Hospital which, as well as being a significant <Col N="1850" /> addition to the general hospital service in north Dublin, represents a major milestone in the long term plan for the rationalisation of hospital services in Dublin. In south Dublin 1987 saw the transfer of services from Dr. Steevens' Hospital and Baggot Street Hospital to St. James's Hospital and the Meath-Adelaide group. These moves also represent significant steps in the rationalisation process as the specialities to be located in the new St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals are now located on a single site in the case of St. James's and on two sites in the case of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Similar rationalisation of services have taken place in Cork with the amalgamation of the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospitals and the transfer of inpatient services from the North Infirmary to the Mercy Hospital.  The fact that these transfers were agreed and implemented in such a constructive way is a remarkable tribute to the spirit of co-operation which exists in the health services and which often tends to be overlooked.  I would like to stress that this rationalisation is not being carried out for narrow fiscal reasons.  Rather it is intended to maximise the quality and efficiency of our acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that the Government have recently decided that funding of £6 million will be made available for health projects from the proceeds of the national lottery.  The projects to benefit will be largely in the community area.  I intend to apply this additional funding to the following areas: £2.25 million will be used to encourage the provision of community-based services for the physically and mentally handicapped with a particular emphasis on the transfer of patients from institutions to community care.  The elderly will also benefit to the extent of about £900,000 again with a strong emphasis on encouraging the care of the elderly at local community level. Community based psychiatric services will benefit to the extent of about £700,000.  About £1 million will be provided to enhance within a broader framework community information and development services.  AIDS prevention <Col N="1851" /> will benefit to the extent of about £450,000.  Children's services, including services for child abuse which is a growing problem, will receive about £700,000.</P>
    <P>In seeking better use of public money to provide an effective and cost conscious service I must, as Minister for Health, be conscious of the necessity to indicate priorities for agencies when they are deciding on how their total allocations should be divided between the different service programmes.  Both this year and for 1988 I have made it clear to health boards that particularly disadvantaged groups like the elderly, children at risk, and the handicapped are to be seen as needing priority attention while key services of importance to those groups such as home helps, meals on wheels etc. are to be protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that I was able to give the agencies their 1988 allocations in October this year should result in their being able to plan their management of resources over a much longer period than was possible this year.  When I met, last October, the chairmen and chief executive officers of health boards and the chairman and secretary-managers of voluntary hospitals, I stressed to them that they should use the opportunity of early notification of the allocations to start planning for next year.</P>
    <P>I and the Department of Health officials will be available, as we were this year, to discuss with agencies how they propose to manage their resources for 1988.  I am satisfied that our common goal in maximising the use of the resources available will ensure that there will be a continuation of the co-operation already demonstrated this year and that essential services will be maintained.</P>

If it is turned around it is, in a way, a vote for non-health.  At a time of stringency and rationalisation, all of us should turn our minds to that.  The focus <Col N="1852" /> should be on the preventive area of health, thus making sure that the huge cost of health can be reduced in the most caring and compassionate way so that we will remove the areas of disease and lack of care that lead to institutionalised health services.  Sometimes it takes a crisis such as we are experiencing now in our economy and with our national debt to make us realise how distorted the budget can become.  Before I say anything further on that I would like to refer to the Minister's speech on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The huge cost of general medical services must be a matter of concern to the Minister and to the doctors.  I am glad negotiations are continuing with the Irish Medical Organisation on the huge cost of general medical services.  Much of that cost must be incurred as a result of the continual return visits patients make to their doctors.  There has to be a rationalisation of that.  It has been said &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will understand &mdash; that we should encourage patients not to visit their doctors rather than to visit them.  If the Health area were turned into a preventive one it would not alone cut back on the economic costs involved but in a more serious way it would lead to a healthier society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of drugs has not been controlled or rationalised to the extent that it should be.  Large multinational drug companies have incredible influence and seductive powers and the general medical services use their drugs even though they may be much more expensive than other suitable drugs.  The Minister and his Department should investigate that.  For quite some time there has been an overemphasis on the use of drugs as being the only means by which to treat people.  It is only now that we realise that the use of drugs may not be the healthiest way to treat people.  The use of drugs can lead to a dependency and a build up of resistance by some patients that have long term implications.  I would like the Minister for Health and everybody involved in the health area to concentrate much more on the use of holistic medicine.  Herbal and non-chemical drugs should be used by <Col N="1853" /> the health service.  Alternative forms of medicine have been treated with scepticism and downright suspicion by the professional medical service for a long time but now in these more enlightened times we realise that they contribute far more to the development and long term health of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is to be a rationalisation of hospital services, especially of those in Dublin.  I and many other women believed when Beaumont Hospital was at the planning stage that créche and child care facilities would be part of that hospital plan, particularly because it was hailed as one of the great hospitals of the future.  To my disappointment I have learned that such a facility has not been included.  If we are talking about health care and health services which provide the facilities that they should, that facility is an integral part of any large hospital.  In future the planning of hospitals or medical facilities where people have to wait for any length of time, and in particular women with children, should have that facility as an integral part of the planning.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has given an injection into the health area which was desperately needed.  I note that the Minister intends to give £1 million of the Department's share of the profits of the national lottery towards improving community information services.  I appeal to the Minister to use the framework of the National Social Service Board which has shown its capacity, for that work.  I welcome the decision to allocate £700,000 for children's services, including services for child abuse, but I appeal to the Minister to bring forward as a matter of priority for the next session of the Dáil the Children (Care and Protection) Bill. We will not know the extent of the problem in that area until the legislation is introduced.  It is a matter of great disappointment that it was not dealt with in this session.</P>
    <P>It is important that voluntary organisations, particularly the women's groups, continue to receive the necessary funding to help them prevent children, <Col N="1854" /> the handicapped and the elderly, being institutionalised at huge cost to the State. The Department, in their rationalisation programme, should put greater emphasis on community health care to balance the cut-backs in institutions.  For every hospital that is closed down, for every community facility that suffers, there must be another form of help provided within the community to ensure that those affected by the cut backs are cared for.  I accept that that will cost money and that the Minister must work within budgetary constraints but I suggest that he could save in the area of administration, visits to doctors and on drugs. Savings there should be redirected to community care.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to health care workers.  It is unfortunate that many people involved in the health services have been made redundant or forced to accept early retirement arising out of the rationalisation programme.  As a result of the cutbacks health care staff must work longer hours with less support.  When we are talking about the retention of essential services we must always bear in mind the importance of nurses and the need to care for patients.  It is unfortunate that there has not been rationalisation in other wasteful areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Supplementary Estimate which is for a nominal sum and which is covered by the increased amount collected.  I am glad to see that the extra expenditure is covered in this way.  On the question of GMS cost increases, which account for much of this Supplementary Estimate, I note that the Minister said that he is in discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation, and has been for some time.  I urge him to endeavour to bring those discussions to a conclusion soon and to introduce a system of payment by capitation fee rather than fee per item of service. We have had 15 years of experience of the fee per item of service, a system which was introduced by the late Erskine Childers in the seventies in all good faith, but it has not worked out.  I am sure that if he was here today he would be among <Col N="1855" /> those who would acknowledge that fact. We should change without any further delay to a capitation system of payment which is used in most countries and found to be most satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the discussions he is having with drug companies and I am glad that they are taking place because that is the key to the saving of a very substantial amount of money each year without any drawback or difficulty created for patients.  The failure to prescribe generic drugs, as opposed to brand named drugs, is costing the taxpayer a huge amount of money without any corresponding additional benefit to the patients concerned.  That is a matter on which agreement does not have to be reached; it can be done by the diktat of the Minister or the Department of Health.  He should do that without any further delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House how the £6 million from the profits of the national lottery will be allocated.  They are all worthy objectives but they seem to be all part of the normal activity of the Department of Health.  The idea of the lottery funds was that they should be spent on areas outside the normal remit or activity of the Department.  For example, £450,000 is allocated for AIDS prevention but surely it is the duty of the Department of Health to try to prevent the spread of AIDS.  That should be looked on as part of their normal activity. The same applies to other services such as community based services, services for the physically and mentally handicapped, the elderly and the community based psychiatric services.  They have been part of the work of the Department for a long time.  It is a pity that that £6 million is, in effect, substituted for what would be paid for out of tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt briefly with the question of hospitals.  When replying to this short debate the Minister should give the House some indication of his thinking, and that of his Department, in relation to the various proposals for the building or the establishment of private <Col N="1856" /> hospitals.  There are several such proposals and there are several such hospitals operating with many more proposed. I know the Minister has had discussions with some of the promoters, or potential promoters, of private hospitals. This is a difficult matter on which one has to bear in mind the balance that has to be achieved between public and private medicine.  One has to be careful, for example, not to allow this to become totally polarised as between public and private medicine.  There has been a relatively successful interaction between the two over the years.  They tended to be delivered in the same places and each of them benefited perhaps from that.  If we are to get away from that we will have to think very deeply about it.  It is important that the Minister give an indication of his view in regard to this.  If the present rate of provision of private hospitals is to continue in the next number of years we will have a quite different institutional medical scene in a short time.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospitals the Minister mentioned the changes that have taken place in Dublin and that have taken place or are taking place in Cork.  I stand up here today with some sadness to talk, however briefly I am allowed, about an unfortunate change that is about to take place apparently in Limerick.  The Minister announced last night in a letter to Barrington's Hospital that they are to close down.  After over 160 years of outstanding service to the people of Limerick it seems inexplicable that a proposal of this kind would be referred to by the Minister in his speech as follows:</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that this rationalisation is not being carried out for narrow fiscal reasons.  Rather it is intended to maximise the quality and efficiency of our accute hospital services.</P>
    <P>That may be the intention, but how in God's name are you improving the quality or efficiency of our hospital services by closing down Barrington's Hospital in Limerick which treats more than 50,000 outpatients a year, more than any other hospital in Ireland apart from one or two <Col N="1857" /> of the very big hospitals in Dublin? Where are they to go?  St. John's Hospital provides no accident services and apparently refuses to provide them.  The regional hospital in Limerick is already unable to cope either with inpatient or outpatient demands.  People have to wait for as long as five and six hours there for outpatient service.  Where are the extra 50,000 who are now going to be displaced from Barrington's to go?  They are told they can go to the regional hospital.  If people have to queue for five or six hours at the moment is it envisaged that they will queue for 11, 12 or 14 hours?  Is that possible?  The thinking of the Department for years has been that the two older hospitals in central Limerick, Barrington's and St. John's, would, in the fullness of time, be closed on the building and opening of a new hospital on the north eastern side of the city.  That thinking was right.  It made sense to me but obviously, that hospital cannot be built now or in the foreseeable future because of the financial constraints, and everyone assumes, particularly as fairly significant sums of money were spent in both Barrington's and St. John's in the last number of years, that these two hospitals would be retained until a new hospital was built, perhaps at the begining of the next century. It is a bolt from the blue to be told that Barrington's is to close.  I will finish on this point.  The situation in the midwest region &mdash; in some ways I suppose not dissimilar to some of the others &mdash; is extremely serious at the moment.  The Mid-Western Health Board are debating whether to close either Ennis General Hospital or Nenagh General Hospital.  If one or other of those closes, as appears to be the provision, the regional hospital in Limerick has to carry all of the inpatients and outpatients from there. It will have to carry all of Barrington's inpatients and outpatients.  It is impossible. I ask the Minister before this gets out of hand and goes too far to sit back and think about it because what he has done simply does not make sense.  If as he said in October, he gave an allocation <Col N="1858" /> for next year of £1.6 million to Barrington's &mdash; they were working on operating within that and could continue to give most, though not all, of the services they have given over the years.  They are still prepared to do that.  I ask the Minister to indicate in his reply that he is prepared to look again at something that is going to cause serious hardship, not just in Limerick but in the adjoining counties also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate in many ways masks the fact that there has been a fundamental change in the past 12 months.  The Government are not yet in office for 12 months and it will be interesting to see whether they will stay in office for 12 months.  It masks the fact that we are developing rapidly a two tier hospital and health care system in which those who can afford to pay, and pay there and then, will get the best treatment as quickly as they need it and at the point at which they need it.  Those who cannot pay there and then must join the queue in conditions that are every day becoming more and more a national scandal.  It is argued quite often that the addition of private beds to the system takes the strain off the public beds.  This argument does not stand up for two simple reasons. Every private bed opened places another strain on the limited pool of medical consultant expertise that is available and involves more and more public subsidy by way of tax relief into that system and cross subsidy from the public hospitals into the private sector.  For example, we have the spectacle of people going from private hospitals to public hospitals where they can have CAT scans done for nothing and then going back to the private hospitals.  In other words they are having the service free of charge while it is being charged for by the public hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth floor in St. Vincent's hospital is going private.  There are to be extensions to Mount Carmel, to the Blackrock Clinic, to the Bon Secours hospital in Cork &mdash; a massive extension &mdash; to Brookfield, Lyndhurst and St. Monica's all in Cork and to Waterford County <Col N="1859" /> and City Infirmary.  The latter, I am glad to say, has been turned down by the VHI. VHI charges are going through the roof. There is an increase of 8.5 per cent on plan B this year, that is three times the rate of inflation.  Forget about tax relief. Your voluntary health insurance system is going out the door gradually and we have turned the country into a two tier system because there is no conscious political planning.  There is departmental planning.</P>

      <P>As I put on the record before, I was urged around the Cabinet table and in public to have plans B and C increased by 26 per cent but that I refused.  That was the sort of increase that was being sought.  People could have their own VHI D and E plans but we were not going to have cross-subsidisation for persons in Cork, Kerry and Killarney for people who wanted to go to the Blackrock Clinic.  That was the way we stopped it.</P>

      <P>The Minister's own party political people brought pressure on me to change that.  I will leave it at that.  Once you go into any of those private hospitals you meet consultants, people who are getting up to £44,000 from the State, who do a bit of work on Monday and Tuesday mornings in public hospitals and then go helter skelter to one of the private hospitals, where they get another £60,000 or £70,000 a year, and nobody is stopping it, least of all the Minister for Health.  It is difficult to meet a consultant in a private hospital today who is not also a public contractor under a common contract prepared by Deputy Haughey who, in great haste and when he wanted to become Taoiseach, gave <Col N="1860" /> those contracts as a gift to 1,000 consultants. Now we are landed with the system and it would require dramatic change to turn it around.</P>
      <P>The system has gone completely skewways.  It is a national scandal and it will require a huge effort, politically and departmentally, if we are to avoid having a complete two-tier system where some patients have to wait for treatment.</P>
      <P>I spent yesterday trying desperately to get a constituent of my colleague, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, into hospital.  His constituent had two slipped discs, was lying on the floor in his home but could not get into a hospital.  Nobody wanted him, and least of all coming up to Christmas.  I think he is still in Wicklow.  If he was a private patient he would be in hospital overnight.  If he had the money, he could be in a hospital within ten minutes.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a different style from mine.  He is closing the hospitals by gentle starvation.  I came into the House and said I would close St. John's Hospital, but the Minister said he will let it die quietly.  I think it should be closed.  I was in favour of that, and I have no hesitation in going on the record as saying it.</P>

      <P>I am gravely concerned about the institutional assistance regulations being brought in by the Minister on 1 January.  Is it true that 1,000 elderly people in long stay institutional care will be charged an extra £2.5 million?  The Minister says that after 30 days there will be an amendment, from 1 January 1988, to enable charges to be made on persons in long stay institutional facilities.  I gather 8,000 people will be affected and they will have to contribute an extra £2.5 million.  That is a scandal.  Here we go again, cut, cut, cut.</P>
      <P>I am also very concerned that there has been very little progress on the psychiatric hospital side.  I would close down four or five of these hospitals before I would close any more public hospitals. We could start with a few of these hospitals in the western area, and perhaps even the south-eastern area.  The Minister should do this quickly.  It would save more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's allegation that I had permitted excessive overruns.  This year the overdraft level he approved for the health boards was £23 million and so far they have taken up £15.5 million of that amount.  There are <Col N="1862" /> overruns and there are overruns.  I permitted overdrafts in the health board areas but the Minister should stop that nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad Beaumont has been opened and I am particularly pleased that no private hospital has been established on the campus of that hospital.  It is open as a public facility. Where there is a private bed, that money will go directly into the budget of that hospital.  It has taken five years to do this. I was glad to see the Taoiseach, with the Minister, going around this public hospital which could have been opened three years ago.  There was great political pressure and political obstruction, particularly from the Fianna Fáil Party in that area, and from certain hospitals.  At long last they saw the light of day and permitted the hospital to be opened.</P>
      <P>I am appalled that this year in all our public hospitals there are only about 300 trainee nurses and the budget next year provides for 350 student nurses.  We train about 1,500 nurses each year and within two or three years there will be a grave national shortage of nursing staff.  People with leaving certificates cannot get nursing training and will have to emigrate to get it.  This is a national scandal.  Our hospitals should be used to provide nursing training for young people &mdash; they are not even getting paid now.  At least we should train them so they can have a career at international level where there is a grave shortage of nurses.</P>

This is stifling the rights of democratically elected public representatives to agitate on behalf of their constituents, and it is giving a sarcastic rebuke to representatives of voluntary bodies who are nominated to these committees.  The Minister said that the elderly would benefit to the extent of about £900,000 with a strong emphasis on encouraging the care of the elderly at local community level.  I fail to comprehend how that can have any effect when there is a very long list of elderly patients waiting for the replacement of artificial hips.  The health boards have stated they cannot carry out even one such operation until 1988.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this very limited debate.  Deputy Barnes raised the question which is fundamental to the delivery of health services in the future, that is, placing more emphasis on health rather than illness.  This is an area <Col N="1864" /> where we have taken positive action by setting up the Health Promotion Unit which incorporates the functions of the Health Education Bureau.  We will have an advisory council chaired by the President of the Royal College of Physicians and a committee of Ministers chaired by myself to ensure that policies will be implemented.</P>
      <P>On the GMS negotiations, I am glad to say they are progressing satisfactorily. Hopefully we will get a solution that will ensure an adequate and efficient level of service for the patients and job satisfaction for those working in the service, we will be able to control the cost to the State, and we will not have to come back with a Supplementary Estimate, as we did today.</P>
      <P>On the question of the private hospitals, I support the integrated approach because if we polarise hospital services into public and private, the specialists in disciplines in scarce supply will go to the private sector and will not be available to the public.  It is no harm to stress that in Deputy Desmonds time the Mater Hospital and Beaumont &mdash; the two most exclusive private hospitals in the country &mdash; were built and came onstream.

    <Title>Supplementary and Additional Estimates, 1987. - Vote 51: Public Service Early Retirement Payments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the payment of lump sum and related payments resulting from early retirement in the public service.</P>
      <P>During last summer, the Government, recognising the need to make savings in all areas of public expenditure, undertook a rigorous examination of all public spending programmes.  The decisions we made during the examination were reflected in the 1988 Abridged Estimates Volume which was published in October and which involved reductions of £485 million below the amounts which would have been required to maintain services at their existing levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Government can tackle the problem of the public finances without looking critically at the full range of services hitherto provided to the public and at the size of the public service workforce which has been built up to provide those services. The problems inherited by this Government compelled them to decide upon significant changes in certain public services and on the consequential changes that <Col N="1866" /> should take place in public service numbers.</P>
    <P>It was clear from an early stage in the life of this Government that reductions on the scale required in the numbers employed in the public service could not be fully effected by reliance on natural wastage and partial bans on recruitment. It was necessary for us to go further &mdash; in a direction normally adopted by private employers when their needs and resources are curtailed.  Experience in the private sector had demonstrated that many workers, because of their personal circumstances or the suitability of their skills to new career paths, welcomed the option of early retirement.  We believe that in a workforce as large as the public service there are many people who wished to quit that employment but who, because of superannuation practices, would be left for varying periods without income.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, decided to facilitate the early departure of such people from the public service by providing in the form of new voluntary early retirement arrangements attractive and immediate inducements to such people to go.</P>
    <P>Initially we confined the terms of those offers to people working in areas where developments had made particular groups of staff surplus to the needs of the public service.  More recently the scheme has been extended to the over 50s in most areas of the public service.  The vacancies which will arise in the case of posts which are not surplus to need will be filled by redeployment.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated between the Government and the social partners, the Government emphasised their belief that the necessary reductions in public service numbers could be brought about on a voluntary basis.  The scheme we have introduced is on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The terms of the offer have already been explained to this House.  In brief, they offer to public servants outside the scope of the social insurance scheme a bonus of up to seven additional years service for superannuation purposes or a severance payment of up to 18 weeks <Col N="1867" /> pay in addition to immediate pension and lump sum to which their actual service entitles them.  In the case of public sector staff on full PRSI, their superannuation benefits are integrated with existing entitlements under the social insurance and redundancy schemes.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question earlier this week, the early retirement package has been offered to about 13,500 public servants of whom about 900 have accepted and will be leaving during 1987.  The lump sums and related payments due to them, and payable in 1987, will amount to £10 million.  It is only the frontend costs, that is to say, retirement lump sums, short service gratuities, employers' liability under the Redundancy Payments Acts, and additional severence gratuities, that will be met from this Vote.  The cost of pensions will be met, in the usual way, from the appropriate Votes.</P>
    <P>Of the 13,500 public servants who have been offered the early retirement package, many have indicated that they will accept and will leave in 1988.  It is, however, not possible at this stage to estimate the total number of people who will take early retirement during 1988. As I have previously explained to the House, some public service employers such as health agencies and local authorities have not yet decided on the appropriate level of staffing in 1988, in the light of their 1988 allocations so it is not known how many redundancies they will be seeking.  In the education area, it is envisaged that offers of the early retirement terms will be made before the end of the 1987-1988 school year.  The precise numbers involved are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>As I also indicated in reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Board of the Central Bank have approved of arrangements under which the bank will make advance payments of surplus income to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme. These arrangements are in accordance with section 63(7) of the Currency Act, 1927, which provides that the <Col N="1868" /> Central Bank may at any time pay into the Exchequer such sums on account of surplus income as may be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Each year, the Central Bank pays over to the Exchequer the surplus income it has earned in the previous year, after having made certain appropriations to reserves.  The surplus income is taken into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue and is shown separately in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published at the start of each year.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangement I have just outlined, the Central Bank will advance to the Exchequer not later than 31 December 1987 an amount equal to the issue from this Vote to cover lump sum payments made this year.  As I have already indicated, this represents an advance payment to the Exchequer of surplus income by the bank in addition to the amount which would otherwise have been paid.</P>
    <P>The result is that the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme will be financed by the additional surplus income from the Central Bank and will not add to either the current budget deficit or the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>The advance by the Central Bank will be repaid over a period of four years, after a moratorium of one year.  The repayment will take the form of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the scheme will lead to Exchequer savings.  As Deputies will appreciate, the precise gains and costs to the Exchequer depend on the age, salary and length of service of those who leave within the scheme.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the lump sum payments will fall to be paid in 1988 and will also be financed by an advance of surplus income from the Central Bank.  Since this is a voluntary package, we cannot be sure of the numbers and grades of staff who will opt for it, and since the lump sum due to each individual depends not only on his or her salary level but also on length of service, it is impossible to give a firm <Col N="1869" /> estimate of the lump sum costs for next year.  It is tentatively estimated that the amount required in 1988 will be in the region of £80 to £100 million.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this arrangement with the Central Bank represents &ldquo;off-balance sheet financing&rdquo;.  It is nothing of the kind.  The payment from the Central Bank will be brought in to the Exchequer as non-tax revenue and will be shown as such in the Exchequer accounts.  Payment of lump sums to public servants on departure will be from this special Vote which must be approved this year and next by the Dáil and which will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I commend the additional Estimate to the House.</P>

Before I come to that I should like to briefly mention the other subheads.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will confine myself to the main area of debate. I am glad that at long last the Minister has come into the House and told us how the public service redundancy scheme is to be financed.  The Central Bank funding mechanism is now very clear.  Obviously the Central Bank, like other banks, make profits from their banking activities.  It has been the custom in the past to keep some of that profit in reserve and to hand over excess profits, profits not required, to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister provided us with the information that the hand over is almost £100 million a year, that he intends to take £10 million extra this year and anything up to £100 million extra next year.  I have argued that this is off balance sheet funding, and I still argue that it is.  I accept that the Minister has said it will eventually appear in the Government accounts, but the whole nature of the debate on the national debt and the problems of our public finances has hinged around the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP and the current budget deficit as a percentage of GNP. In this instance the moneys will neither appear in current expenditure nor in capital expenditure by the Government. Consequently there is a gloss being put on the finances which will give a distorted impression and will lead to a less than careful examination of the details and cost of the redundancy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, even though many people would treat money from the Central <Col N="1871" /> Bank as the equivalent of winning money in the national lottery or inheriting money in a will, it is not like that, as the Minister has explained, because after a year's moratorium this money will have to be repaid, not repaid in the sense that one repays a loan on which one is paying interest, because there is no interest involved here.  There is a mechanism in the arrangement whereby the Central Bank will be repaid in future years after a moratorium of one year.  I am not sure if that is after 1988, but from what the Minister has said I presume repayments will start in 1990 and continue in 1991, 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <P>According to what the Minister said there will be a sum of £120 million involved at the outer limit, so we are talking about approximately £35 million to £40 million a year which would normally be coming into the Exchequer in the lifetime of the next Government.  This money will not be coming in and will have to be raised by taxes or by some other method.  The savings would be accounted for before we reach that point so we would not want to double count the savings.  Therefore, if I may say so, it is a classic Fianna Fáil ploy of bringing money forward from future years into the present and, by doing that, giving the impression that it is a free lunch and we do not actually have to pay for it.  It will have to be paid for in future years by a future Government.</P>
    <P>I believe that because of the mechanism used the cost has not been evaluated as it might have been.  Two issues arise immediately.  It is very easy to see what the thinking is.  It is private sector thinking and there is nothing wrong with that; if you are not controlling pay, you control payroll costs &mdash; numbers are reduced and as long as you keep your overall figure stable or down, that is grand.  In private industry, especially in manufacturing industry, the shortfall is made up by extra productivity but, as far as I can see, there is no extra productivity in the public service.  We are trading worse services against fewer numbers. For example, if nurses in hospitals are <Col N="1872" /> paid slightly more, their colleagues have to become redundant, hospitals will close and there is a worse service for the taxpayer. The same applies in teaching. Teachers get slightly more pay but the Minister is keeping the payroll cost stable and there will be 1,300 redundant teachers. The redundancies will be paid for by dropping the numbers.  That results in larger classes and a worse service for the pupil and their parents.</P>
    <P>By having the facility from the Central Bank to pay the redundancy lump sums, the Minister is in danger of paying too much for his scheme.  Once the Minister decides to extend the scheme to the over-fifties and that it has to be a voluntary scheme, it is quite clear that people who are near retirement will be more likely to opt for it.  This year the figure for lump sum redundancy payment will be £11,000 per person.  I am sure the figures will be much higher next year because the Minister has extended the scheme to over-fifties.  If a person of 52 or 53 years of age is given seven years extra, under the Minister's scheme he will be entitled to a full pension.  Therefore, somebody with £20,000 a year will get a pension of £10,000 in addition to a lump sum of £30,000 in round figures.  The Minister's outgoing for every redundancy next year will be approximately £40,000 at the top end of the scale.</P>
    <P>I know the average will be pulled down slightly with people leaving early, but once the scheme operates on a voluntary basis and is available to everybody over 50 years the pull is towards older people going out on full pension with full lump sum payments.  The Minister will have a lot of ground to make up.  If these people remained working in the hospitals, schools, An Foras Forbartha, or wherever, it would cost £20,000 &mdash; and I am working on gross figures.  The Minister's redundancy scheme will cost him £40,000 per head of staff and he will have a lot of ground to make up.  If he does the net sum, the margins of savings are so low as to almost disappear.  A pension of £10,000 with a lum sum of £30,000 invested at 9 per cent or 10 per cent and earning £3,000 a year is the equivalent <Col N="1873" /> of a salary of about £13,000.  Obviously somebody on £13,000 as against £20,000 will drop to a lower level of taxation.</P>
    <P>When you allow for the reduction in revenue flow to the Exchequer accruing from a lower marginal rate of tax, the dramatic savings which the Minister is presenting are not there.  I maintain that if the lump sum payment had to come out of current expenditure it would be examined far more rigidly by the Department of Finance.  Because of the Central Bank facility there appears to be a softness in the Minister's approach to the redundancy package, and what appears to be a financial saving of a large nature is very small indeed.  When you add to that the fact that there is a worsening of the service, that you are taking many public servants out of it and that the extra productivity argument as in the private sector does not apply, the Minister will be paying pretty much the same money for a worse service and fewer people working.  Even with all of that the Minister will be forced to move away from a voluntary redundancy scheme at a very early stage in 1988 if he is to achieve his figures.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to have more time but I am sure we will come back to it again.  I understand the Minister has review clauses in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Rather than wait to be dragged in under the review clauses by the social partners, or by the Minister, to debate whether the scheme should be voluntary or compulsory &mdash; because I am sure it will be compulsory before next year is out &mdash; the Minister should invoke the review clause and see if he and the social partners can achieve a better balance between the services provided to the taxpayer, the number of people at work in the public service and the levels of pay which are being provided to those who are still being maintained at work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to welcome the move by this Government to reduce numbers in the public service. I am sure this House is aware that since the Progressive Democrats were formed <Col N="1874" /> we have spoken very strongly in favour of reduced numbers in the public service as a means of reducing public spending, thus leading to a reduction in the appalling burden of tax on PAYE workers which has such a disincentive effect in regard to work itself.  We believe there is a real link between high numbers of staff in the public service as a whole and high levels of public spending.  The Minister referred in the House this week to the public sector pay bill which will be £2.813 billion this year and this is an enormous amount of money for any small economy to bear.  There is an apparent saving of £20 million on the budget estimate for this pay bill as yet not totally explained. For instance an apparently large sum of £12 million has been saved on the educational pay bill but I am sure the Minister will enlighten us in the future about that.</P>
      <P>The public service numbers that we have to support in this country, excluding the commercial State-sponsored bodies, are approximately 220,000.  A reduction in those numbers of even 5 per cent would save the State about £140 million in its yearly pay bill on the levels as they stand. It would thus allow for a reduction in the budget deficit and if continued could lead to a substantial reduction in the borrowing requirement and overall borrowing. Therefore, we support the implementation of a positive early retirement plan but only in conjunction with a properly thought-out and executed redeployment programme.  I feel that the second part of that has been ignored by this Government.  If one embarks on an early retirement plan, which is supposed to reduce numbers substantially, the only effect that that can have in the long term is that services will be reduced unless a redeployment programme is properly executed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the abolition of the Department of the Public Service we have little or no co-ordination of redeployment in the public service.  I have some knowledge of that as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and also from replies to questions in this House.  I believe we will simply have a reduction in services and a <Col N="1875" /> maintenance of those who are now employed to implement those services if we do not address this problem immediately. If this early retirement or redundancy package is carried out in isolation, it will reduce the services to such a level that the question must be posed: why are we maintaining the staff to administer these programmes which are, perhaps, no longer in existence or are so run down that they might as well not be there?</P>
    <P>In this connection I believe that Government Departments will have to change their attitudes.  There is a distinct atmosphere in Government Departments of empire building and when they are asked to reduce numbers or to rationalise in any way there is an attitude of: there will be no change here, what we have we hold.  If I have heard that once I have heard it many times about the Departments.  They are inclined to hold on to what they have.  It needs very strong direction in order to break through that, but I think it is absolutely necessary.  The early retirement and redundancy package will fall if that is not tackled.</P>
    <P>The State now represents one-third of all employment in Ireland.  This is surely an appallingly unhealthy burden for a weak economy, such as ours, unestablished in the industrial sense, to bear. Taken together with the 240,000 people who are unemployed, it represents well over 500,000 people who are dependent on the State out of a total workforce of 1.3 million.  It is obviously unsustainable in the long term as we have discovered. This Government have at least shown that they wish to move in the right direction by reducing the numbers in the public service and by the curtailment of other expenditure, even though they have used such curtailment to undermine many of the independent bodies, costing small amounts of money which might be a threat to their policies in the future.  I believe this is very misguided.  It will have repercussions in the future which they will regret and which certainly the people of this country will regret.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to the drastic curtailment in the Office of the Ombudsman <Col N="1876" /> and the appallingly shortsighted decision concerning the National Social Service Board and I might also add An Foras Forbartha.  When it was first announced that An Foras Forbartha would be abolished my party welcomed the thrust of such a move which would bring into line satellite agencies so long as the independent work which was carried out by that body would be continued.  We now have a total capitulation to the local authorities on the part of the Minister for the Environment.  They are among the worst offenders against the environment and they are now being given responsibility for the monitoring of environmental pollution. Surely that is absurd.</P>
    <P>This curtailment of independent agencies, costing very small amounts of money, is a major flaw in the Government's policies.  It shows how unthought out it was from the beginning.  I also question the Government's will to implement this retirement and redundancy package or else I question their awareness of their own priorities in implementing it.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance for written answer on 5 November this year concerning the numbers who had, among other things, applied and been accepted for early retirement.  The problem was that the Minister for Finance would answer questions only on behalf of the Department of Finance and not for the public service as a whole.  Therefore, individual questions had to go to each separate Department.  The disparate approach to co-ordination of information on this most important subject did not augur well for the proper implementation of the package.</P>
    <P>However, in answer to a supplementary question which I asked of the Minister yesterday in this House he indicated that he is assuming an actively co-ordinating role in implementing the package.  I look forward to a more coordinated role being evident on the floor of the House and also in dealing with the separate Departments.  The answers which I got from each Department give cause for concern.  There was almost no movement to speak out, up to that date <Col N="1877" /> in the Government Departments on early retirement, career breaks and on redeployment.  For example, a total of 12 staff in all Government Departments had been redeployed up to 4 November.  This clearly shows that the Departments' attitude of &ldquo;what we have we hold&rdquo; is being maintained.</P>
    <P>Since then the Government decision to extend the early retirement scheme to the over-fifties has been announced.  The Minister said that 900 people out of the 13,500 who were offered this package have accepted it and have been accepted. I should like to ask the Minister how many of these are civil servants proper. Is acceptance of this package confined almost entirely to outside agencies and services who are being pressed to provide retirement numbers?  I know that that is the case.  People from these agencies have come to me and said that they were keen to take retirement or redundancy but were pushed from behind to take it from 31 December.  There is no movement within the Departments to actually take this on board.  The Minister referred to the education area and the retirement and redundancy package and said that it would be offered or implemented by the end of the 1987-88 year &mdash; if I am not misquoting him.  We have been promised that package.  I have been to ten or 11 public meetings in the education area during the last few weeks.  Each time I have gone the Fianna Fáil representative said that the package would be coming out in two or three days or in one week or whatever.  I do not think it is good enough to say it will come out by the end of this education year.</P>

      <P>I will conclude with a few words on the financing of the package. The Minister said it is not off balance sheet financing, I contend that it most <Col N="1878" /> certainly is.  It is not being shown on the current side.  It is not being shown on the capital side.  If it were as it should be the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement would undoubtedly increase and this would represent the reality of what has happened.  In contrast what will happen is that for a number of years from next year, because there is a moratorium of one year, the Exchequer will not receive the sums of surplus income which it might expect to receive from the Central Bank.  It is depriving itself of income at some point.  This should appear on the books and should be done openly.  I am not saying that the retirement package should not be implemented.  It should be implemented, but it should be above board and we should be able to scrutinise it.  I raised this matter on 17 July or 18 July after the first announcement on it.  I would like to know how it will be financed and from where.  It has been introduced very late in the day to say what is actually happening. I do not like the way it is being brought about and neither do the Progressive Democrats.</P>

I told them that the next time there was an accident at the bottom of Foster Avenue the ambulance would probably arrive another 15 minutes late because the people would not be available.  Voluntary redundancy is now being offered to 16 people in the Dublin Fire Brigade.  That is what a reduction in public service numbers means.  I have no doubt that some of the ambulance drivers themselves voted for the Progressive Democrats in order to get tax reductions.  We cannot have it both ways.  Deputy Colley has attended most meetings in my constituency and she has expressed herself as being aghast at the pupil teacher ratio change.  That is what a reduction in public service means.

      <P>The local authority personnel throughout south Dublin will kick up hell when pipes freeze and there will be nobody to dig up the roads and to repair them.  That is what public service reduction means.  We in this House cannot have it both ways.  The Minister in some respects has endeavoured to have it both ways in a somewhat macho public service way.  I have no objection to the operation of the embargo.  It was a reasonably good decision which has operated since 1981.  I have no objection to rigid control of new recruitment in all areas and rigorous examination on a cost benefit analysis basis for every new recruitment.  I have no objection to redeployment of public service staff.  I assure Deputy Colley that hundreds of staff in the public service have been redeployed since 1980-81.  When I was Minister for Social Welfare about 200 people were redeployed to that Department from other Departments and it was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to career breaks, to flexi-time or to a whole series of mechanisms in the operation of the public service but this year there has been an aberration.  The Department of Health <Col N="1880" /> sent to the Minister for the Public Service a proposal for redundancy for about 4,000 health employees and the Minister thought it was such a good idea that he decided to extend it to the whole public service.  That was a bad piece of aberration of a macho nature because at that stage a minority Government were flexing their muscles and saying: &ldquo;We will take on the PDs.  We will clasp them to our breast in public service policy.  We will outdo Fine Gael, get rid of about 8,000 public servants and everything will be well in 1988-89.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister did.  Somebody asked him where he would get the money.  He said they would get £80 million to £100 million from the Central Bank and would have to pay it back by 1993.  That kind of lunatic fringe financial operation not by Departments but by Ministers, does not work.  That was the situation for four years when we were in Government and we buried it quietly, gave some people cups of coffee and sent them away to cool off, but when they came back they did not have that kind of proposal.</P>
    <P>About two months ago the Minister came up with a brainwave that he would offer a retirement package to people over 50 years of age.  That is public service employment lunacy.  It does not operate in any other public service in any State in Europe.  It will cost us £10 million this year plus the pensions.  We will have to add further increments for 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 and all the money will have to be paid back by 1993.  The books will be fiddled and cooked on a non-tax revenue side.  They are already cooking and by the time Christmas comes they will be so cooked that they will stink.  A bottle of poteen could be added but it still will not help.  There is plenty of it to be got around Sligo.  The Army, I gather, have found about ten or 12 stills in their recent search of the area.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government with profound respect that this policy had no coherent development and now it is being filtered through the Book of Estimates in a last desperate effort to put matters right.  The Minister should very quietly drop this policy.  Enough damage has <Col N="1881" /> been done and there is no need whatever to offer premature retirement to public servants.  We want those people working in the environment.  There are many men aged 50 to 55 years of great competence who are going to leave the public service. We cannot afford to lose those people because, contrary to the view of the Progressive Democrats, this country is not over-populated with public servants. There are 238,000 public servants in this country, not 220,000, but they are also working in the State-sponsored bodies and in the Army.</P>
    <P>Are we going to reduce the numbers in the Army tomorrow morning?  We have already saved £6 million on the Vote for Defence this year.  Do we want to take another 3,000 or 4,000 people from the Army?  There is no recruitment to the Army at present.  Are we going to take another 500 or 600 people from the Garda Síochána?  The first people who will come into this House and kick up hell about security will be the Progressive Democrats if we do not keep up the numbers in the Army and the Garda.  Are we going to suggest that we should take from the 38,000 people in the local authorities another 5,000 or 6,000 people?  There will not be a blade of grass cut in County Dublin this year.  Representations will be made to Deputy Colley from Marley Park to Goatstown and she will be on her high horse about it but yet she proposes that cutbacks be made.</P>
    <P>The contradictions are coming home to roost in a huge way as we close down hospitals, fire brigades, ambulances, provisions in local authorities for parks and housing maintenance.  Potholes will be dug and as the yuppies' axles break as they drive over the potholes on the Stillorgan Road there will still be talk about public expenditure and our public service numbers.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil, not to mention the country as a whole there is profound ignorance about public employment and public expenditure. <Col N="1882" /> Contrary to the current mythology, this country is not over-taxed or over-populated with public servants.  If we continue along this road we will reach a point where a woman wanting to go to a maternity hospital and needing an ambulance because her husband has not got a car because he is unemployed will not be able to get an ambulance or where a person who needs a hip replacement will have to lie on the flat of his back for about two years before he can get into a public hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the civil servants, what do we do?  We tell them to take their lump sum and their early pension and give them 18 weeks to get out, and then we will say to the teachers &ldquo;you go, too&rdquo;. My answer is to encourage these people to stay, to do their day's work, to pay them well and to give the public service a pay increase of 2½ per cent for the next three years.  We should tell these public servants that we want them to be employed and that we are not giving soft options to anyone.  We should cop ourselves on and the Minister should withdraw some of the nonsense that has come up in terms of voluntary redundancy, which is not really voluntary at all.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats favoured the abolition of An Foras Forbartha and then changed their minds when Deputy O'Malley got a kick in the groin from some public servants about it.  People cannot have it both ways.  I am in favour of keeping An Foras Forbartha.  Some of the mad decisions that were made by the Government in the first flush of Estimate debates, when the Minister ran riot abolishing every quango that surfaced here, are coming home to roost and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government should stop this nonsense and let us save £80 million to £100 million of non-tax revenue in the Central Bank.  We will take the surplus from the Central Bank but we will not give it to the civil servants who do not need retirement, who do not need the money and who should do a day's work and will later get honourable and respectable retirement.</P>

      <P>This so-called voluntary redundancy scheme is not voluntary at all.  It is clearly stated in the agreement signed by the Government, the unions and the IFA that if they do not get the voluntary redundancies they are seeking they will return to see what other way the redundancies can be achieved.</P>
      <P>To take close to 10,000 public servants out of service will do serious damage to all of the services provided by that sector. Many of those services have been adverted to by Deputy Desmond who clearly pointed to the effect which these cuts in the public service will have.  The Deputy could have gone on to say in relation to hip replacements that while one would have to wait perhaps up to two years for major surgery if one was a public patient, if a patient happened to have access to £1,000 or £2,000 he could within a week or two get the surgery carried out. Not only are the cutbacks affecting the public service and services which were generally provided on an equitable basis but they are creating a two-tier health care system.  A two-tier education system is on the way now as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the Government are acting in panic, that their plans are ill-conceived.  I disagree with that.  The Government have made a conscious decision to adopt the policies which have been ably enunciated by the Progressive Democrats since their inception, cutting back the role of the State, the reduction of the public service.  This idea that we reduce the overall level of taxation on income and give people more money in their pocket so that they can decide how to spend their money is wrong.  In this <Col N="1884" /> State such a policy leaves practically one million people, who are on the verge of poverty with very little disposable income, even worse off.  At the same time as cutting back the role of the State and declaring for a reduction in income tax the Government are effectively dismantling the services available to those who are not capable of paying for them from their own resources.</P>
    <P>There is a very clear Thatcherite policy at work here.  Perhaps the backbench Deputies of Fianna Fáil are not well tuned in to Thatcherism and they may have decided to leave the politics and the decision-making to the Government and their advisers, but they have to acknowledge that what is going on is dismantling the education system, is creating huge classes at primary level as well as exceptionally large classes at vocational level, that it will deprive many working class children of access to third level education and is creating a situation where health services for a public patient means standing in queues for long periods.</P>
    <P>This approach of cutting back the role of State and reducing the public service in the hope that this will set our economy right is nonsense.  It has not worked where it has been tried in the US and in the UK.  It is the height of folly for a Government and particularly for a Fianna Fáil Government who were saying the precise opposite at the time of the general election only ten months ago and who cannot seriously claim they did not know the state of the economy or that they had no experience of Government and were not aware of the problems.</P>

      <P>My point is relevant and it may relate in some indirect way to what the Minister is looking for. In reply to a question which I put down in October, I was informed that the various Ministers and Ministers of State had something like 120 or more civil servants operating in their consitituency offices at a cost of approximately £1.2 million.  The Government might consider where those civil servants could be redeployed to maintain services which are due to the public in the areas of health, education and social welfare.  If the Government applied themselves to that kind of redeployment and rationalisation we might have a different situation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I cannot say I welcome fully all the statements made but some of them were very constructive.  I must repeat what I have said a number of times since last July when we announced this early retirementvoluntary redundancy scheme, that what we are doing is totally transparent in relation to the operation of the scheme and the way it is being financed.  We are not putting any gloss on the finances.  What we are doing will be seen in time as good business.  We are accused of extending the repayment date into the future when some other Government will have to raise the funds.  That suggestion totally ignores the fact that these savings are ongoing and permanent.  Before we will have to begin making repayments to the Central Bank we will have the money in the bag, as the countryman would say. All the Central Bank is doing is paying the Exchequer earlier than they would normally do, the surplus income they have.</P>

    <P>There has been much talk about changes in the pupil-teacher ratio and a reduced number of teachers.  People must not have been listening to the statistics and looking at the reports which are freely available for all to see.  The numbers entering the educational system are dropping.  There was a big hullabaloo here last Wednesday with statements pouring out from FAX machines about a <Col N="1887" /> saving of £12 million in wages under the Education Vote.  All Hell was breaking loose.  It was tragic.  It was all because there was an over-estimation, mainly due to the downturn in the economy, emigration and the reduced birth rate.  There are reduced numbers coming into the system.  Are Deputies suggesting that we should sit idly by and allow a situation where people will be sitting in classrooms with no pupils in front of them?  That is what would happen eventually.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing that there has been a delay in making the scheme available to teachers.  The furore in that area has been caused because identified teachers have been told they will have to go.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This token Estimate is required in order to make technical adjustments in the allocations for certain subheads in my Department's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main item being provided is £16.6 million extra under subhead M.4 to meet expenditure in the current financial year on the incidental expenses for market intervention.  Beef stocks this year are much higher than anticipated.  This has meant extra expenditure on handling, freezing, storing etc. and also on servicing the capital which has to be borrowed to finance the stocks.  I would point <Col N="1890" /> out, however, that there is no net overall increase in the amount being spent on market intervention operations this year. As Deputies will note, some £17.4 million extra is shown under subhead N.22 as additional receipts from the EC in respect of market intervention operations.</P>
    <P>Another significant item being provided for in the Supplementary Estimate is £5.2 million extra under subhead M.7 in respect of the special premium on exports of beef to the United Kingdom. This variable premium is financed 60 per cent by the British Exchequer and 40 per cent by the EC, and beef exported from Ireland to the UK for consumption there qualifies for the premium.  Payment of the premium to Irish beef exporters is made by my Department on receipt of the necessary funds from the UK.  Because of a higher level of beef exports we expect to receive some £5.2 million more from the UK than had been anticipated.  This is reflected under subhead N.25 as an additional appropriation-in-aid, offsetting in full the extra expenditure provided for under subhead M.7.</P>
    <P>The saving on M.3 &mdash; disadvantaged areas schemes &mdash; arises mainly because of a slight but unavoidable slowing down in the processing of payments in recent months.  This is due to the introduction of the new EC special beef premium scheme which necessitated extra inspections at marts, at meat factories and on applicants' farms, and considerable extra clerical work in my Department's local offices.  All of this work has had to be done without increasing staff numbers.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for some other adjustments to appropriations-in-aid.  Extra receipts of £0.5 million for certain land annuities under N.15 are offset by a corresponding shortfall in receipts under N.12 from the sale of land purchased under the farmers' retirement scheme.  Almost £1 million extra is shown under subhead N.23 in respect of receipts for intervention stock losses, etc.  These additional receipts arise because of adjustments and corrections in the clearance by the EC Commission of the 1983 and 1984 FEOGA guarantee accounts and from settlement <Col N="1891" /> of an insurance claim involving intervention beef.</P>
    <P>Finally, allowance is made for a shortfall of some £3.7 million under subhead N.18 in respect of receipts from the EC under the farm improvement programme and other farm investment schemes. These receipts have not come up to expectations this year; some of the amount expected will not arrive until after the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I have referred to all the items covered by the Supplementary Estimate, which I now commend to the House.</P>

It can be said honestly that never in the history of agriculture in this State has so much been provided by way of promise and expectation over the past year.  It could also be said rightly that so little has been delivered as to render the whole concept of outlining programmes prior to general elections a total farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to the saving effected on subhead M.3 &mdash; disadvantaged areas schemes &mdash; saying that it arose mainly because of a slight but unavoidable slowing down in the processing of payments in recent months.  I am not so sure that slowing down was unavoidable.  Given the Minister's party's statements in the past in relation to the need to get the money quickly to those for whom it was intended and the great hardship that would be likely to be caused if that were not done, what the Minister has just told us represents a complete U-turn in relation to such matters.  Judging by the number of complaints we have all received in relation to the payment of premia and various other grants &mdash; and here I have to admit that I do not deal in great detail with disadvantaged areas in my constituency &mdash; and from the information available to me, it would appear that there are continuous complaints about a slow down in the processing of applications and a consequent delay in payment.  That being the case, there is an obvious saving effected but I am not so <Col N="1892" /> sure that it is unavoidable.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that matter when replying.  I would put it to the Minister that the slow down could be avoided if he were prepared to redeploy staff within his Department in order to ensure speedy payment.  The only reason a saving has been effected is that the money has not been paid out arising directly as a result of failure to process applications. That is completely at variance with what the Minister, when in Opposition, and his party colleague who was spokesman on Agriculture, had to say on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that a great deal was promised to agriculture by way of innuendo about this time last year when various suggestions were being processed and prepared for presentation to the electorate, when it was indicated to us by various interests that a special relationship existed between the present Government party and the farming organisations. The Government have a very peculiar way of showing recognition of that special relationship, for instance, when one thinks of the rather scathing attack made by the Minister on the educational research and advisory services. As yet we are not aware of what the Minister proposes by way of replacement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Durkan has just expressed disappointment that I did not refer to the ACOT/AFT amalgamation.  It would not be in order for me to do so.  It is not covered by the Supplementary Estimate; it does not arise.  That is the only reason I did not refer to it but we will have the Bill in the Dáil next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been customary, when Ministers introduce Supplementary Estimates, to refer to their intentions in other areas in the future, particularly if those intentions are of a positive nature. By his interjection the Minister has indicated that there is a somewhat sensitive area there he does not intend to address yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make one other general point, that notwithstanding all the great expectations and the hype there has been in relation to agriculture and food over the past eight or nine months, it transpires, amazingly, that there are fewer people employed in the food industry now than there were a year ago.  That is a serious indictment of the Government.  We have heard repeatedly about the great numbers of new jobs likely to be created under that heading; we know about the millions of pounds invested.  But the statistics now indicate that job numbers have dropped in the past 12 months and, in reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, the Minister was unable to say whether or not expectations would be realised in the coming year.  I would sound a word of warning in relation to the expectations that have been created amongst the community in regard to this very pivotal area.  The Minister has indicated that he considers agriculture to be fundamentally important, and I agree with him.  There is vast potential in this area for import substitution and exploitation of our food products.  I would subscribe to anything the Minister proposes, provided it is workable and that the targets can be achieved.  There is no sense <Col N="1894" /> in putting forward grandiose proposals unless the targets can be achieved, and going on past experience the likelihood of achieving those targets is not as great as the Minister would have us believe.  I would be delighted to be proved wrong, but the indications so far are that the position is otherwise than as the Minister has indicated.</P>
    <P>In the light of extra administration costs that are likely to be incurred, I see no reason that the Minister should not redeploy some of the staff with a view to speeding up the payment of grants and premiums.  My guess is that no attempt was made to speed up such payments at all.  The result is that we have a nominal saving simply because the paper mountain has not been shifted quickly enough. Everybody could achieve savings in that fashion.  That seems to be the system whereby savings will be made under several headings.  It just pushes problems not dealt with into the following year.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the performance to date, given what we were led to believe, and given the special relationship that the Government had with the farming community.  The only promise that the Government kept was in relation to the abolition of farm tax, but even that had the proverbial sting in the tail, because coupled with it was the reduction in VAT refunds which was a far heavier blow than the farm tax was ever likely to be.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would be supportive of any proposals the Minister may have in relation to the creation of jobs and the expansion of the food industry and agribusiness generally, but I warn that there will be dire consequences if targets are not met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks on this supplementary estimate, much of which was brought about by the additional payments that were found necessary under the intervention system.  I find it disappointing that in the year 1987 we are still so heavily dependent on intervention for so much of our agricultural produce.  This year we have, happily, not had to resort to intervention <Col N="1895" /> for skim milk powder.  That fact is very welcome but, given that the EC is to all intents and purposes bankrupt, we are still dangerously reliant on intervention for our beef and butter output.  We simply have to develop alternative outlets.  This we have conspicuously failed to do over the years.  We have to realise that the clock is about to strike midnight so far as dependence on community intervention stores is concerned.  It is very disappointing, for example, to find that the great bulk of our milk is still converted into skim milk powder and into butter each of which are sold as commodities rather than as real value-added products. The fact that so much more is spent this year on intervention than was anticipated is a source of disappointment.</P>
      <P>Similarly, with regard to these beef exports to Britian and the payment of the premium on them I do not know what the breakdown is.  But it would seem that unfortunately very little of that is real value-added beef exports; a lot of it is going out as carcase beef and probably some proportion of it is even going out as live cattle.  It would be very encouraging to see this increase in beef exports if it was mainly in terms of processed beef rather than the way it is in fact going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the headings on which this Supplementary Estimate is required relates, of all things, to the Land Commission's activities in collecting annuities that are still payable out of land here. When one considers the appalling cut in resources for AFT and ACOT for the next year, with the virtual dismemberment of both of those bodies, and the minute cut that is proposed so far as the Department proper are concerned, who of course are not directly providing any services for farmers or for agriculture, it makes one wonder.  In particular we have to reflect on recent reports that there are 235 civil servants still employed in the administration of what was once the Land Commission although the Land Commission was closed down by a decision of the Government in 1984, a decision with which, I might add, I fully agree.  The 235 civil <Col N="1896" /> servants who are still employed in the Land Commission under the Department of Agriculture and Food and as part of that Department cost £4.3 million per annum directly in salaries, to which various overheads must be added in terms of expenses, accommodation and so forth. The total cost therefore is probably not much less than £7 million.</P>
    <P>A total of £8 million was collected last year from 270,000 landholders by the Land Commission.  That is an average of £30 per landholder.  There must be many landholders who pay less than the collection cost of their annuity each year. Land division is not now seen as a priority of the State.  The value of the annuities to the State has declined, due to inflation. This is a prime example of a work area which appears not to have been reviewed and which has continued in a traditional way.  I wonder, for example, what these civil servants, properly trained or even untrained, could achieve if they were transferred to the Revenue Commissioners or to Customs and Excise, rather than having them engaged in the futile work in which they are engaged at present.</P>
    <P>There seems an unanswerable case for writing off many of these small annuities or for providing a means of closing off the loans by one final single payment, or for selling the right to the annuities to an insurance company, a bank or some other institution of that kind which would be prepared to collect them during the remainder of their existence.  For the State to be engaged in this wasteful and futile work out of which there is no net gain to the State at all is ridiculous.  That people are retained at useless work like this which even they themselves must see as useless while people who are engaged in agricultural research or in giving advice to farmers are let go is a ridiculous state of priorities.</P>
    <P>While there are other aspects of that Department and their staff that are worth commenting on, they are perhaps the Department who have had most examination or scrutiny, often as a result of comments of the IFA and these comments are justified.  When one considers <Col N="1897" /> the huge number of people engaged in administering the notoriously unsuccessful bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, which is as costly as it is unsuccessful and consistently unsuccessful, one asks why there are 600 or more people engaged in clerical work in relation to that scheme when a very small fraction of those could more efficiently and effectively operate the scheme by means of computers.  We still have the primitive card system that we had when this unfortunate and unsuccessful scheme was introduced approximately 30 years ago. It is crazy and an appalling example of bureaucratic priorities.</P>
    <P>What has happened with the recent announcement of the amalgamation of ACOT and AFT has been particularly deplorable.  The chief executive designate should have been appointed to oversee the merger and also to seek to structure the redundancies package in a way that would have been useful for the newly amalgamated organisation.  That was not done and as a result the directionless pattern of recent months has left both organisations deeply demoralised. Some of the best and brightest talent, as is inevitable in such a climate of uncertainty, have taken the redundancy package.  Indeed, I am told that in some of the major stations of AFT throughout the country all the most talented research people have decided to leave.  This is a major setback for agricultural development.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister had something more to tell the House about our premier industry.  Is he aware that agriculture, since the foundation of the State, has been the backbone of this economy? Yet he comes into the House this morning and in a brief statement outlines, with the stroke of a pen, the existing potential for the development of agriculture. If he is serious about the future of agriculture, surely he would not order the abolition of the country committees of agriculture.  Is the Minister's formula to promote agriculture going to be the stifling of the legitimate voice of the democratically elected representatives on those committees, as well as the voice of the members nominated by their respective farm bodies?  Surely this is an attack on the democratic rights of public representatives.  It is a slap in the face to the agricultural bodies who went to the trouble of nominating members for these committees.</P>
      <P>No matter what way the Minister attempts to whitewash this action, the consequences will not go away.  It will have serious repercussions on the farming community because the only voice the farmer had to expound his grievances has now been silenced.

Must they now consult the fortune teller and gaze into the crystal ball to get information about their farming activities and the future of agriculture? Surely the industry which means so much to the country should not be treated in that way?  I remind the Minister that there is no premium boar scheme now being operated by his Department.  There are fewer than 750,000 pigs in this country, while there are over 17 million pigs in Denmark.  Why does the Minister not take a trip to Denmark to see if he could acquire some knowlege which would be to the benefit of the farmers of this country?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and taking no steps whatsoever to arrest the very serious problems which exist in agriculture.  It is clear that if we are to have prosperity in this country it has to come from a prosperous agricultural community.  We cannot all live in the Golden Vale where, if the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the leader of the Progressive Democrats lost their walking sticks in the evening, they would not be able to find them in the morning because of the growth in the level of grass.</P>
      <P>I speak for a constituency which contains three peninsula areas which rely very much on EC aid and schemes for the promotion of agriculture.  If the Minister is serious about expanding agriculture in those areas why has he inserted a clause on off farm income in the cattle headage and the cow suckler schemes? Last year the figure was £6,400 and this year it was reduced £5,700 to disqualify people who are playing a legitimate part in promoting the future of agriculture in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If the Minister knows anything at all about agriculture he must realise that if there is to be a future for agriculture it will come from an expansion not an annihilation of the cow herd.  Why does the Minister not face up to that fact, completely abolish the clause on off farm income and let the part time fishermen and part time farmers, whom I represent in my constituency, play their part in bringing agriculture back to the position where it should be?  I am amazed that the Minister is so reluctant to do this. Instead, he is taking the retrograde step of reducing the figure in order to cut more people out of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excuse the Minister has given for not paying the headage grants at the same time as last year is that there were some problems with the EC.  I do not think it is correct for the Minister to say that in this House.  I appeal to the Minister to pay the cattle and sheep headage grants to the farmers before Christmas.  During the four years and three months the <Col N="1901" /> Coalition were in office we made sure that every farmer received his Christmas cheque as a Christmas box to spend.  The Minister should now do the same honourable thing and pay out these cheques next week to the farmers.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about promoting agriculture why does he not provide sufficient funds for the ACOT committees?  Penny pinching seems to be the criterion used by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I cannot see why the Minister is victimising farmers in not allowing them to receive the knowledge which the ACOT advisers can give them. The ACOT advisers are hampered from doing so because of a lack of funds.  No agricultural classes have been held this year and we have been told there is no money for the education of young farmers. The Minister even introduced a Mickey Mouse scheme to compensate small farmers for the decrease in their milk quotas.  How can the small farmer compete with the cheque book farmers? How can they get their quotas increased to a viable level?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to spell out to this House why his Department penalise a farmer whose quota is under 15,000 gallons for exceeding that quota.  A farmer who has a quota of only 5,000 gallons is penalised in the same way as a farmer with a quota of 250,000 gallons. Surely, commonsense will prevail.  The Minister should take immediate steps to rectify the anomalies which exist in that scheme.  The small farmer will be wiped out completely by the cheque book farmer unless the Minister takes steps to give him a viable quota.  Otherwise, he has no hope.  The Minister may say he can lease it from his creamery but he cannot because he has not got the money to pay the creamery.  He is already in debt up to his neck with the creamery. How can he make money to rear his family on a quota of less than 15,000 gallons?  Some of these farmers have a quota of only 5,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>I think the speakers who have contributed to this debate.  There is <Col N="1902" /> one obvious point which I have to make by way of introduction, that is, that I confined myself in my speech in introducing the Supplementary Estimate to the areas where the adjustments were required and those areas alone.  That is in accordance with the procedure and requirements of this House.  The fact that the number of areas which require adjustment is so limited is a vindication of the management structures which I have implemented in the Department to ensure that we stay within the allocation this year and next year.  I am glad to say that we are providing only for a token Estimate which will enable us to make the adjustments for the reasons I have given.</P>
      <P>For their own reasons, speakers decided to introduce much broader issues.  I am very glad they have done so because I will address each and every one of those issues.  I have to say that 20 minutes will not be adequate to outline the record of achievement of the Government in this area during the past eight months.  I propose to take up the challenge now and I will give the precise details of those achievements and how they were brought about.

      <P>I did not want to advertise in Europe the level of success we have achieved in agriculture as their incomes are going down.  In Europe we <Col N="1903" /> are unique, as the Agricultural Institute recently indicated, in that there has been a 20 per cent increase in farm incomes this year.  Yet Deputy Durkan calls that a promise, not a performance.  Every other country in Europe &mdash; and I can give many examples &mdash; is showing major decreases in farm incomes in 1987 as compared with 1986.  I did not want to raise problems with my colleagues in the European Community but I am going to do it now anyway.  Denmark, a country comparable in size and almost comparable in the importance of agriculture to Ireland has experienced a decrease in farm incomes of 8 per cent this year as compared with last year.  We have an increase of 20 per cent.  I do not think it is reasonable for Deputy Durkan or anyone else to call that a promise and not performance.</P>

The level of farm incomes in 1986 was so low that the increase of 20 per cent is, of course, an increase over the most depressed level of income any Government ever presided over, namely, the Government of which Deputy Durkan was a member.  One of the reasons it has been a little easier for me to make such a major jump forward is the outrageously poor performance of the previous Government.</P>

      <P>I inherited from the previous Government quota restrictions which were crucifying the small farmers. For four years the only test for purchasing quotas was the size of your cheque book and the amount in your pocket.  It is true to say that during the past four years in every parish &mdash; and not just in west Cork but in Limerick and Tipperary also &mdash; it was the big farmers who were going around buying up the quotas and increasing the price of leases all over the place. I do not think it was carelessness on the previous Government's part because that is the way they wanted it.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to beef exports to the UK.  There was a very major decrease in cattle exports and a huge increase in beef exports.  I am glad to say that there has been a 25 per cent increase this year in vac-pac exports to the United Kingdom. That is the pattern all over.  It is not because of any increase in intervention stores.  It is the very opposite.  We have virtually nothing in intervention in skim milk powder.  Deputy O'Malley should know that.</P>

If he checked back over the records he would find &mdash;and I do not know who accompanied him &mdash; that it cost the Exchequer much more than my couple of hundred quid cost on what has been a very successful trip to Venezuela.  If he checked the records from 1977, 1978 and 1979 he would find out who was the most travelled Minister and who cost the Exchequer most. Deputy O'Malley would come out way on top, even ahead of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am sure he has lots of mementoes in his house or elsewhere to record the fact that he visited widely and was widely received.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary and Additional Estimates, 1987. - Vote 32: Post-Primary Education.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for Post-Primary Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This token Supplementary Estimate is <Col N="1909" /> needed to allow for the payment of an additional sum of £12.707 million out of subhead A2 of the Vote &mdash; Grants to Vocational Education Committees &mdash; arising from the deferral by the European Social Fund from 1986 to 1987 of the payment of aid which has been approved for courses run by VECs.</P>
    <P>It will be easier for Deputies to understand the need for this Supplementary Estimate if I give some background information. European Social Fund aid towards the cost of certain programmes offered by schools and colleges administered by vocational education committees is now an important source of funding.  This is brought to account as appropriations-in-aid of the Post-Primary Vote and is shown in the Estimates volume under Part III of the Post-Primary Vote as subsection (4) of subhead L.</P>
    <P>Application for aid is made annually in advance on the basis of the estimated cost of the programmes concerned.  Normally, an advance payment of 50 per cent is received from the ESF following approval of applications and the balance is received after final accounts have been submitted and approved.  As a result, the aid which is received in any one financial year comprises advance payments in respect of the current year and final payments in respect of previous years.</P>
    <P>When the Estimates for 1986 were formulated, it was expected that ESF aid would amount to £44.5 million.  The actual receipts in 1986 amounted to £31.294 million only.  Some of this shortfall arose because the take-up of places on ESF-aided courses was less than anticipated but the main reason was that final payments in respect of 1985, which normally have been brought to account in 1986, were not received, even though they had been approved for payment. This deferral was mentioned in the House on 5 December last by my predecessor, Deputy Cooney, when moving Supplementary Estimates for 1986.  It was expected at that time that aid relating to 1984 as well as 1985 and amounting to £13.489 million in all would be deferred. <Col N="1910" /> However, the aid relating to 1984 was received later in December 1986.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that this deferral was not, of course, a loss of aid and the reason for the deferral was quite outside the control of my Department.  It was due, I understand, to cash constraints on the ESF budget resulting from the impact of the extended ESF-aided operations following the 1983-84 review of the fund.</P>
    <P>This shortfall could have been met by a Supplementary Estimate in 1986. However, this would have transferred the charge from the ESF funding to the Exchequer.  As the aid had been approved and constituted a good debt, it was considered more appropriate to avail of the facility provided by the Vocational Education Act, 1930, which provides for short-term borrowing by VECs for the purposes of their schemes, and to reduce the total amount of the Department's grant out of subhead A2 accordingly.  The reduction in the grants paid out of subhead A2 amounted to £12.6 million.</P>
    <P>The deferred aid was received in 1987. Indeed, Deputies will be glad to know that we now expect ESF aid in 1987 to come to almost £53 million in all, some £18 million more than provided for, and some £8 million extra over and above the deferred payment.  The short-term borrowing incurred at the end of 1986 has been repaid in 1987 out of the grants issued to date and the additional amount now sought is to make up for the reduction in the grant in 1986 and for interest on the borrowing.  As this is more than offset by the additional receipts, no additional Exchequer funding is required.</P>
    <P>ESF aid is received for a large number of individual programmes but most of the aid is accounted for by just two programmes. These are the vocational preparation and training programme and the middle level technician programme. These two programmes currently cater for 19,129 and 11,856 participants respectively.  These figures represent a decrease of 4 per cent over last year's total of participants in the case of the vocational preparation and training programme but an increase of 6.5 per cent <Col N="1911" /> in the case of the middle level technician programme.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished the Minister has come to the House with an Estimate dealing with post-primary education without making reference to what is going on around her in terms of the confusion being caused by her actions in the area of vocational education.  Is she aware that confusion arises daily?  For example, we have discovered quite by accident &mdash; or perhaps it was not an accident &mdash; that, as the Minister for Finance announced in the Dáil, £12 million has been miraculously discovered in the Department this year.  We understand that there has been a £12 million saving on the pay portion of the Vote.  I do not know what portion of that sum will come from vocational education and I hope the Minister, when replying, will tell us how much arises from savings in the vocational education sector, the primary education sector, the voluntary secondary sector and third level.  It is important that we are given that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that in 1987 the Minister will not be spending £12 million of the amount allocated.  As a result, for 1988 the Minister will be starting £12 million better off because her starting figure will be lower.  The Minister will be aware that Estimates are based on what the Minister in the previous year expects to spend. The Minister's starting point for 1988 will be £12 million less and it seems to me that that obviates any necessity for the cuts that have taken place, particularly in the vocational and primary school sectors. I hope the Minister will answer that. Her starting point will be £12 million better than it was when the Department were preparing the Estimate during the summer.  The Minister should tell us if she needs that money in 1988.  Perhaps the Department have decided that they want to save a further £12 million in 1988? The parents who will be attending meetings throughout the country tomorrow <Col N="1912" /> will be astonished to learn that £12 million has been saved on their children's education in 1987 and I have no doubt they will be anxious to know why those children will be asked to suffer more in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate concerns the European Social Fund.  The Minister will forgive me if I say I am pleased to hear that the amount of money expected in 1987 will be £53 million.  She will be aware that I started that scheme, went to Europe and obtained the aid for our RTC students.  She will also be aware that I started the vocational preparation and training courses.  I am sorry to hear that the figures represent a decrease of 4 per cent over last year's total of participants in those courses.  Will the Minister explain how that occurred and if it is expected that more young people will be embarking on those courses next year.  In my view those courses represent a vital bridging of the gap for young people between school and the world outside.  I am proud of the middle level technician programme and the VPTP courses which I initiated.  I know the Minister praised them generously when she was in Opposition. That does not mean that she praises them still because things change quickly between Opposition and Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress one point arising from the European Social Fund.  I am aware that there have been difficulties between the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.  A quarrel has been going on for some considerable time about whether the VECs can have staff to pay the grants to the students.  That bedevilled me when I was in the Department and I understand from deputations I have had from students all over the country that it is still bedevilling the Department.  Can the Minister tell us if that problem, particularly with the City of Dublin VEC, the one I have most recently had contact with, has been solved?  The youngsters who came to me recently were in distress.  They had had no money at all under the ESF this session from moneys they are entitled to.  They were told that the young lady who was <Col N="1913" /> supposed to pay them out in the City of Dublin VEC has been instructed by her union that she was to pay nobody because she was being required to do double the work she had done previously.</P>
    <P>As I have said many times on different subjects, that kind of conflict between adults while young people suffer is intolerable. I hope that this Government will find a way to solve that problem.  It does not make sense.  The obduracy of the Department of Finance, coupled with certain difficulties caused by the unions, put the Minister for Education in an appalling situation where she could not publicly blame her colleague, the Minister for Finance, as I am sure she often wishes to, on this and other subjects.</P>
    <P>We have an Estimate before us which refers to paying money to VECs who in turn pay their teachers.  This year we have been told again that in the Estimate for pay there was a saving of £12 million.  I notice there is nobody in the box beside the Minister.  I hope she will be able to answer all these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Estimates for 1987 proved to be wrong.  The Estimates for 1988 envisage a £4.4 million saving on staff in community, vocational and comprehensive schools.  It is quite clear now that it is not necessary to make those changes next year.  There is no educational justification whatsoever for them.  They have thrown vocational schools into a panic.  Wicklow VEC are due to lose 19 posts in all their schools. This comes on top of the desperately bad news that the building plans are indefinitely shelved for several schools which are in a very bad situation.  One is in such a bad way that the classes are to be moved out into temporary premises.  I speak of Rathdrum.  Blessington vocational school which was ready to move to tender has now been indefinitely shelved, we are told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For practical classes rooms are fitted for a maximum of 24 pupils in vocational schools.  They cannot take any more than that.  The whole thing makes no sense <Col N="1914" /> and I ask the Minister to tell me exactly the number of voluntary secondary schools which offer these kinds of practical classes.  She seemed to try to justify the vocational cuts on the basis that secondary schools were now offering all these practical classes and so everybody should be the same.  The Minister knows as well as I do that a tiny fraction of voluntary secondary schools offer the kind of technical courses the vocational schools offer.  How many schools in that sector offer those courses and what is the proportion there?  I am talking about technical subjects that require major equipment and which the vocational schools have been charged to carry out.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the vocational schools have got more and more students in their system to take the leaving certificate. That is admirable.  They have overcome to a great extent many of the disadvantages that young people coming to them were suffering from, but in this latest round of cuts we see the Minister telling them that they are going to be penalised for their success, that they are winning the battle over disadvantage but that we are going to say, &ldquo;thus far and no further&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Therefore, very important questions arise from a Supplementary Estimate which is put before us today and which, if it is as reliable as the other Estimate on pay we have seen disbanded or thrown up in confusion last week, we cannot pay much attention to.</P>
      <P>On this Friday before all these parents take to the streets again tomorrow and while the vocational sector are gathering their forces for a major battle against what they feel is a grave injustice, it is important that the Minister deals with the realities of what is going on in education and does not avoid these questions, as I am sure she will not.  I hope to hear a considerable answer from her on each of these areas.</P>

      <P>The consideration of this Supplementary Estimate, which is largely non-contentious, ought to give us time to consider calmly and cooly where we stand where education is concerned from the point of view of accounting, of communicating our policies to the general public and of having a general discussion, even though minor, on what our policy on education really is.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to address any Estimate without expressing some concern about the nature of the accounting that seems to be carried out in the Department of Education and branches thereof at this moment.  Last week this House was told, as Deputy Hussey said, that the budget for the teachers' wage bill for 1987 was overestimated to the tune of £12 million, a great deal of money.  We keep going back to the taxpayer year after year for more and more money.  The least we can do if we are to continue to claim the confidence of the taxpayer is ensure that every penny of taxpayers' money is accurately and competently accounted for.  At that level alone, apart altogether from the implications it has for education, it is extremely serious that that kind of accounting can be tolerated by this House.  I would welcome a very clear statement from the Minister for Education as to how that error arose in the first instance, what steps she intends to take to ensure that that sort of error is not repeated in future financial years and, more important from the point of view of education, how that money will now be spent in the education year that is upcoming because £12 million would pay for a great number of teachers indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally worrying is the revelation that came through the Committee of Public Accounts, the details of which were revealed in this House yesterday.  I read about them for the first time in newspapers this morning.  It emerges that this country has lost £382,500 in the context of the Social Fund between 1979 and 1983.  That is more than one third of £1 million of very scarce money, and that amount has been lost to this country, the committee were told, because of the <Col N="1916" /> failure of certain persons to estimate correctly and accurately the cost of certain courses in the VEC sector.  The courses mentioned were CERT, craft and management. It is serious that that happened. It is worrying to parents and their children and to taxpayers generally that people charged with carrying out accounting competently, accurately and well could be so out of line in their judgments and because of that this country has lost that much money in this much time.  That does little if anything to instil confidence among people, especially young people, in our system of accounting. That sort of thing will have to be explained and steps must be taken to ensure that it does not continue.  The least we can expect from people in administration, be it at central education level or local level, is that they estimate accurately the proposed cost of courses.  They can then submit an accurate claim for funding to the ESF.  We need assurances on those two matters.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about communication. It is extremely worrying that, despite a number of assurances given by the Minister in this House, we still can have the level and scale of public protest that we had outside the gates of this House two days ago.  Despite the fact that we were told by the Minister that a certain infamous circular has been suspended, the degree of anxiety among teachers, parents and pupils is such that they still protest in very large numbers, as they did outside this House and at certain other points throughout the country all the week.  I am told there are similar protests being planned for next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

In any event, it puts an obligation on the Minister and on <Col N="1917" /> all of us to communicate clearly to the public the present status of Circular 20/87 because as long as it remains, and is not officially withdrawn, we will continue to have that level of protest.  There is only one way to ensure that that does not continue and that is for the Minister to state it officially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I want to point out that this morning's Supplementary Estimate in respect of Education deals primarily, if not essentially, with vocational education.  I am allowing a lot of latitude, but there is a limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but I want the Minister to tell the public what her intention is as regards this circular because that is the only way to ensure that these protests will not continue and also that similar protests will not be carried out in relation to cutbacks in the vocational sector.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with vocational education.  This sector has traditionally had to deal with the most disadvantaged in our community.  There is a great deal of evidence to hand as to the value of education.  We have reports from the National Council of Adult Literacy and very worrying reports from the Youth Employment Agency indicating that large numbers of young people leave our schools every year without being prepared to live a decent normal life, to meet the demands of ordinary living in the world after school and to be in a position to earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;unemployable&rdquo; has been used by the Youth Employment Agency in relation to large numbers of young school leavers who have not attained a minimun standard of education.  Unfortunately for vocational schools, it seems to fall to their lot to provide education for many children who have learning difficulties. For that reason, the Minister must look very carefully at the vocational education sector when it comes to utilising resources in the years ahead.  An educational system geared to working towards equality of opportunity for all <Col N="1918" /> our citizens should not allow that practice to continue year after year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to please have a look at the vocational sector, to see what can be done there and also what should be done in the primary sector to ensure that the problems early school leavers have been experiencing in recent years will not continue.  If the Minister does not act in this way the social and economic consequences for the country will be very serious.  The time has come when we must examine the amount of money spent on administration and that going directly into the classrooms.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposals to rationalise vocational education committees. The time has come when we must critically examine how effectively these committees are improving for the educational needs of our young people.  We must look at parallel schools and see how they are organised.  A number of schools seem to be organised very well, given a board of management, a principal, a secretary and a caretaker.  They seem to be able to organise their educational activities extremely well and to be able to deliver the aims and objectives of educational policy.  The time has come when we must sit down and ask ourselves if all schools can deliver accordingly, with the same resources.  I am not saying it is possible for any Minister to dismantle overnight structures that have been there since 1930, but in any review of the vocational education sector that question must be submitted to critical scrutiny.</P>

      <P>The essential point is that at a time when money is scarce &mdash; and it is extremely scarce now &mdash; it is incumbent on us to ensure that we get the best value for every penny spent.  We must communicate this fact very clearly to the public.  Again, I ask the Minister to look at accounting, and the proper balance between the money going into the classroom and the money spent on administration.</P>

      <P>When she was Minister her proposals would have practically wiped out the VEC system.  She would have changed over to a regional system which would be a negation of the democracy in the VEC system and would have been virtually an abolition of the 1930 Act.  That is the only education Act we have had and it is a very progressive Act.</P>
      <P>I am glad the problem in regard to ESF grants has finally been resolved.  The Minister's proposals for the current year could damage the ability of the vocational education committees to take up ESF grants because of the difficulties that would be created for them in running the vocational preparation and training programmes due to the cutbacks, lack of teachers and so on.  The Minister should examine the effect the changes in teacher numbers may have on the vocational preparation and training programmes for our vocational education schools.  To my knowledge, there are a number of schools which will have great difficulty continuing last year's programme, let alone developing or expanding that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister to look at the point Deputy Hussey raised?  She mentioned the difference between vocational schools and voluntary secondary schools. The Minister should remember that vocational schools are non-selective. That means they take everybody, whereas voluntary secondary schools are selective.  The vocational schools will take the most difficult pupils, not only those who have remedial problems &mdash; which will increase if the famous circular goes ahead at primary level because there will be increasing remedial problems for pupils coming from primary to second level &mdash; but also pupils who have very great difficulties.  I am talking about pupils who are violent and who come from problem backgrounds.  There are hundreds of these pupils who have great <Col N="1920" /> problems in classes.  The VECs do not refuse to take them but they pose enormous difficulties.  The Minister should look into the problems caused by even one or two difficult students because pupil-teacher ratios go out the window when you talk about difficult pupils, boys in particular, from problem homes.  They can be quite violent with other pupils and teachers and they must be watched all the time.</P>
    <P>The Department seem to have the idea &mdash; and the Minister should not take their word in this &mdash; that all second level schools are the same as far as pupilteacher ratios are concerned but there is no comparison whatsoever between voluntary second level and VEC schools. As Deputy Hussey said, the VEC schools have to deal with practical subjects and you cannot have large classes.  By their nature, they must be small if the teacher is to give any training in practical subjects and to watch them to make sure they do not chop off their fingers with the machinery with which they are dealing. The teacher must have a small number to be able to control them.  You cannot have a 20 to one ratio in practical classes or, indeed, anything approaching that ratio.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider what I have already said in regard to the difficulties which VEC schools have in regard to pupils who need remedial care. The VEC schools also teach travellers and those in prison and you cannot apply a 20 to one ratio in a prison or an itinerant camp with three or four caravans.  The VEC schools are in a totally different situation from, say, the Belvedere College-type voluntary second level school where you have children who not alone can read and write but are also very bright.  These colleges are selective about children they take and they have no problems about remedial teaching or special categories of pupils.  Yet the Minister seems to have accepted that she can cut the number of teachers in VEC schools by 10 per cent increasing the pupilteacher ratio to 20 to one without damaging teaching.  Not alone will it damage teaching, it will also damage children. <Col N="1921" /> The standard of education will be worse and there will also be dangers in classrooms.  If the Minister does not understand the types of pupils and the difficulties teachers have in VEC schools, she should go along to any of them on any one day &mdash; even the best day &mdash; which would soon make her appreciate the differences between Belvedere College and North Strand technical school which are in the same area.  Yet these schools seem to be treated the same as far as allocations and cuts are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> devoted five paragraphs to education, one consisting of two lines.  The comments on education deal specifically with the disadvantaged, nothing else.  The opening paragraph says that the Government will ensure that the burden of adjustment in regard to financial difficulties will not fall on the disadvantaged. The document then goes on to speak about handicapped people, travellers, people requiring special measures, etc.  It said the Government will continue to encourage and foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education.  A particular area of focus will be to encourage more second level pupils to complete the senior cycle. The possibility of more second level pupils completing the senior cycle will be discarded if the proposals for the coming year are put into effect, specifically in regard to the elimination of 700 teachers in the VEC system and 200 in the community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph said it is considered that this will be a key factor in encouraging more working-class children to advance to third level education.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> signed by the Government, trade unions, FUE and the IFA, all of whom the Government expect to agree to their terms, is already being broken by the Government in the manner in which they are dealing with the VEC system which is the only second level education system open to disadvantaged and working-class children.</P>
    <P>With regard to moving on to third level <Col N="1922" /> education, the capital programme indicates that third level education will also be out of the question for working-class children because &mdash; as it says in the document &mdash; in the regional technical colleges programme the £11.5 million allocation for this year is being cut to £3.49 million, that is by one-third, by far the biggest cut in capital spending in the whole of RTCs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We should ask the Minister for a breakdown of the £12 million in pay and pensions which has become apparent at the year end forecast for the overall education Vote.  It would be particularly interesting to find out the extent to which this has accrued at primary level and in Vote 32 on postprimary education.</P>
      <P>It now appears that at the end of the year in relation to the overall education allocation for 1987 there is a surplus in the Votes across the board generally of £18 million made up of £12 million on pay and pensions and £6 million in additional receipts.  At yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts we had the Accounting Officer before us and I gathered that some £18 million of additional ESF moneys accrued to the Department, over and above that which had been anticipated for 1987.  In net terms that is worth about £6 million to the overall Education Vote.  With the carry over effect of the £12 million and the buttressing effect of the £6 million of ESF moneys, it strikes me as extraordinary that the Minister for Education should not consider herself to be in an exceptionally strong position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister for Finance and the draconian cuts proposed by the Government on a collective basis in respect of her Vote for 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows &mdash; I presume the practice is still in operation &mdash; she <Col N="1923" /> and her colleagues get the two monthly budget trends.  That was initiated sometime back by Deputy FitzGerald in a previous Government.  I know that Fianna Fáil Cabinet meetings are extraordinarily attenuated affairs, about four hours a week at maximum and the Taoiseach more or less decides what is going on.  I gather that in recent weeks he has decided to take over the Education Vote as well, particularly in the past week, and is now talking to some members of the INTO on a direct basis and telling the Minister, more or less, what the decision will be.  On that basis the Minister needs to advise the House as to what the prospects are for 1988 because the outturn of the overall votes is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact there is to be a new format in the Education Vote for 1988. That will be welcomed and has been approved by the Committee of Public Accounts following consultation with the Department of Finance and the relevant Accounting Officers in the area.  I hope the overall analysis of the Vote will be easier to get to grips with in the new format than in the more traditional form, as we have in the current Estimates.  I will conclude my comments on this note. The figure of £12 million which has emerged at year end is quite exceptional.  I admit that some primary and post-primary teachers during the year may have taken decisions to emigrate and their pay will be saved.  This was alluded to this morning by the Minister for Finance who said that emigration by some teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Not £12 million that could go to teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, £12 million would pay for 1,000 teachers.  This was one of the explanations he gave, but overall it does not gel together and more particularly since the original Estimate was formulated in October 1986, carried through in November, December and January and revised by the present Government and then published in the revised Book <Col N="1924" /> of Estimates.  Either something extraordinary has happened in terms of the pay unit within the Department or the Department of Finance have failed to get it together in an effective way.  We are entitled to know that.</P>
      <P>I must make the point to the Minister, and I must make it very adamantly, that the carry over saving of a further £12 million into 1988 is inevitable if one starts out with that sum and presumably there will be a revised Vote.  The abridged version of the Estimates for 1988 will suffer revision and must be revised for 1988 on the outturn.  The Minister should take her courage in her hands and go back to the Cabinet and say that for September 1988, Circular 20/87 is unnecessary even in terms of savings because the carry over moneys are truly there.  There is no need for this kind of monumental confusion which has emerged.</P>
      <P>I want to explain the background to the Minister lest she may not be aware of it.  When the Department of Health sent over a memorandum on 20 June last year to the Minister for Finance stating they had acquired some moneys, £8 million or £10 million, for compensation for loss of office by health employees, the Minister for Finance looked at it and said: Great, let us apply this all over the place, education, local government, public service generally, Civil Service and, inevitably, education became embroiled.  There was no need whatsoever for education to become embroiled.  I am adamantly and vigorously opposed to giving any teacher, no matter what age they are, a lump sum payment of 18 weeks salary and an advance of a total lump sum on their pension and an accelerated advanced pensions payments.  I am opposed to doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers can retire at their ordinary retirement age which is quite adequate at this stage.  They should stay in their jobs, doing their work for which they are paid salaries and will be paid public service pay increases over the next three years. There is no need for redundancy and there is no need to incur an expenditure of £20 million next year on teachers' lump sum payments.  The Minister could save <Col N="1925" /> herself all the odium and nonsense that has gone on because the Cabinet decided to go macho on reducing public service numbers.  The Cabinet should have another look at the Estimates for 1988, because the outturn is now quite favourable to the Minister for Education in 1987.  There is no need for the chaos which the Minister has landed herself in and she can be quite easily extricated from it within the current budget deficit figure.</P>

      <P>I thank the speakers for their contributions.  Deputy Hussey wondered why I was presenting this Estimate. I must present it in the terms of the Estimate for the Department of Education. It is necessary and, indeed, as Deputy Hussey is aware it is only a tidying up of a deferral of payments of ESF.  It is a technical matter which had to be presented to the House.  I wish to reiterate the acclaim and praise which I then gave to the securing of funds from Europe for both VPTPs, the regional colleges and the middle level technician programme. I think they are excellent.  I hope that, whilst we have this huge growth of numbers at second and third level, the funding will continue to come from Europe.  Like the previous Minister I have taken a particular interest in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey asked why the VPTP was 4 per cent down and the middle level technician programme 6 per cent up?  I believe the reason is non take up of courses as offered.  However one more than offsets the other.  I know they are in different spheres but there is no accounting from time to time for non take up of courses.  There certainly was no lack of <Col N="1926" /> encourgement and I would hope the numbers will increase.  The Deputy also asked about the numbers for next year.  It is early yet to indicate the likely numbers but we will be giving every encouragement to people to take up these places.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of ESF payments and generously acknowledged that she had had those difficulties for four years.  They are still there but they are in hand as they were this time last year and in previous years to be settled in December at the end of the first term.  As the Deputy said, they are compounded by union, finance and various difficulties. I am working on it daily and I hope we will reach a settlement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hussey, Mac Giolla, Desmond and Quill asked for the various VEC figures.  I will give the answer to that globally and if all four Deputies would take it that I am answering each of them in turn rather than individually it would be helpful.  The first point is that the Estimates for 1987 on salaries were the Estimates as provided by the outgoing Fine Gael Government in the period 20 January to March.  With regard to salaries in all Departments, as I understand it, they were the Estimates as adopted.  That is my first point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister revised them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I will now deal with the revisions.  They were the Estimates as provided by the previous Government. The various breakdowns led to considerable misinterpretation.  The Minister, Deputy MacSharry, gave his answer and it is a pity that questions were not asked.  The figure is £11.49, not £12 million. In 1987 pay savings for the training colleges were £180,000.  It is interesting to note that in 1986 the pay savings were £209,000 in the previous Coalition Government's time on that Estimate.  Pay savings on the salaries of primary teachers in 1987 were £1.279 million.  It is interesting to note that in 1986 under the previous Coalition Government the <Col N="1927" /> savings were £2.647 million on the same sector.  The pay savings on the superannuation of national teachers in 1987 were £824,000.  It is interesting to note that under previous Coalition Governments pay savings under the same heading were £2.355 million.  The saving for secondary teachers &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the superannuation figures again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Savings on the superannuation of national teachers was £824,000 in 1987 and in 1986 it was £2.355 million.  The saving on community and comprehensive schools was £274,000, VECs paid £493,000, RTCs paid £3.400 million, HEA institutions paid £1.015 million and others £27,000 totalling £11.49 million.  The two largest items are the following: extra youth employment levies of £1.6 million and £2.9 million, amounting to £4.5 million.  Out of the £11.49 million a sum of £4.5 million is extra youth employment levies of £2.9 million respectively.  That accounts for £4.5 million out of the £11.49 million.  The other measures arise as follows.  I gave the training colleges £180,000, primary teachers' salaries £1.279 million, superannuation of national teachers £824,000. I will go through them and explain how they came about.</P>
      <P>Two came about by way of policy decisions.  This was post-budget and this brings out Deputy Hussey's point.  In the post 1987 budget policy measures, there was a 1 per cent cut in pay amounting to £0.6 million and a pay element of additional youth employment levy &mdash; that came about in the RTC pay &mdash; pay totaling £3.4 million.  Pay savings for the HEA institutions of £1.015 million came about by a 1 per cent cut in pay; a post-1987 budget measure of £1 million.  I can circulate these figures if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain that the percentages overall are very small in the total allocation of moneys &mdash; over 80 per cent of which is for salaries &mdash; in the Department of Education.  Bearing in mind the facts I have outlined, the pay savings <Col N="1928" /> amount to £7 million on a pay bill of over £954 million; that is savings of approximately 0.7 per cent.  To go through the reasons, and I fully understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that some Deputies would want to know, for instance, why there were savings of £4 million on the salaries of secondary teachers.  I will quote the facts.  Substantial savings had been anticipated for some time but could not be qualified or confirmed until the final staffing position for 1987-88 had become clear following allocations and appeals.  Many factors were involved. There were fewer pupils than projected when the previous Government's Estimates were formulated.  There was greater success than anticipated in bringing the VPs within the quota, again this was a Fine Gael measure.  There was a more conservative approach to appeals in the light of Government decisions on the 1988 Estimates, and an enormous take-up of the career break scheme which, as Deputies know, gives rise to very substantial offsetting payments and of part time teachers and so on.  I make that point because I understand why alarm might have been caused by it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill referred to the shortfall of £0.3 million for CERT from Europe in the period 1979-83.  I will find out what that was about.  It was before my time but I will have it looked at for the Deputy. I make the point that if CERT was an element of it, it would relate to the Department of Labour.  They are responsible and they are the parent body for getting the moneys from Europe.  I fully accept that.</P>

The Deputy referred to the need for communications and wondered whether the <Col N="1929" /> public protests will go ahead.  I do not know whether they will go ahead.  That is a matter for the people concerned and I thank the Deputy for her concern regarding the incident in Cork.  The Deputy's third point related to the vocational sector.  The Deputy quite rightly referred to administration of the VEC sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> administration of other types of second level schools.  She also referred to the greater question of rationalisation, proposals on which I hope to bring to the House early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the regionalisation of VECs but I think that was by way of an aside.  He praised the vocational preparation and training programmes. I have already dealt with that in my first answer.  He compared the running of VEC schools with the voluntary schools and said that VEC schools were non-selective.  He made general points in relation to their efficiency and progress. He also brought up the point of provision of education for travellers and prisoners. I am glad to tell him that neither the provision for the travellers or their children or the provision for the education of prisoners will be affected in any way. We have made that very clear.  The Deputy referred to the Government's development programme and said he doubted their ability to bring more second level pupils to complete the senior cycle.  I hope that is what we will do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond asked me for the list of savings which I have given.  He referred to attenuated Cabinet meetings. It was nothing in comparison with the Deputy's Government Cabinet meetings where they had great walk-outs from time to time.  I agree with the Deputy that the subject mater of education is very lively at Cabinet and I note the Deputy's point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,500,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £10.5 <Col N="1931" /> million I am asking the House to approve today for my Department is essentially to provide part of the additional funds needed for the payment of the Christmas bonus to social welfare beneficiaries.  This is the net additional cost for social welfare services which I am seeking from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate would be considerably greater if it were not for the substantial savings achieved in 1987.  We had to cope with an increase of 6,200 in the average live register figure at a cost of £16 million.  A shortfall of £10 million occurred in PRSI contribution income and £2.5 million had to be found to continue the alleviating payments under equal treatment which, under the proposals of the former Government, would have ceased on 17 November.  Finally, we had to find the resources needed to meet the cost of the Christmas bonus of £20 million, of which £18.8 million arises on the social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>Taking all of these factors into consideration, I should now be asking the House to vote an additional £47 million for my Department.  That I do not have to do so and the fact that we are almost in a position to meet our commitments within our original allocation is due in large measure to our policy of making the social welfare system more effective and more efficient.  We have improved the efficiency in the delivery of services to clients and strengthened the review and control procedures to ensure that the scope for abuse of the system is minimised, and that the services are provided to those most in need.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate for my Department passed by Dáil Éireann on 11 June 1987 was for £1,595,945,000.  The additional sum now required &mdash; £10.5 million &mdash; will bring the total Exchequer provision for the social welfare services this year to £1,606,445,000.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate represents a series of excesses and savings on a number of subheads.  The additional £10.5 million I am now seeking is a net amount needed essentially to provide the balance of the money required for the <Col N="1932" /> Christmas bonus.  Of the full cost of the bonus of £20 million, £18.8 million arises on the social insurance and social assistance services provided by my Department. The occupational injuries benefit scheme, £0.2 million; health allowances, £0.8 million and certain AnCO and CERT courses for long term unemployed, £0.2 million are the other areas affected.</P>
    <P>It has been possible to find part of the social welfare cost of the bonus &mdash; £8.3 million of it &mdash; from savings in other areas of my Department's spending.  This has been achieved through decisive action to eliminate fraud and unwarranted claiming.</P>
    <P>In relation to the £10.5 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate I can assure the House that this money has also been found from savings in the Government's overall expenditure allocations. The payment of the bonus will not consequently result in any overrun on Government expenditure.  Indeed, but for the shortfall in PRSI contribution income it would have been possible to fund the Christmas bonus fully from savings within my Department's area of expenditure and the question of a Supplementary Estimate would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to protect those dependent on social welfare, we are maintaining the Christmas bonus at last year's level of 65 per cent.  The provision of £20 million for the bonus this year, as against the £18.5 million last year, is a considerable achievement in the current extremely difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Over 570,000 beneficiaries have received the bonus as compared with 508,000 last year.  The bonus was paid in the first week of December to ensure that beneficiaries received it well in advance of Christmas.  If we include dependants, the total number of people who benefit is well in excess of 900,000.</P>
    <P>Some examples will serve to illustrate the effect of the bonus for social welfare beneficiaries.  A couple on an old age contributory pension received a bonus of £58.60 bringing their total payment for that week to £148.80.  A couple with three <Col N="1933" /> children on long-term unemployment assistance received a bonus of almost £60. Payment of the bonus will help people on social welfare to cope with the extra financial commitments they have coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The features of the Supplementary Estimate involve additional expenditures or deficiencies on seven subheads amounting to £22.36 million, offset by savings amounting to £11.76 million on a further nine subheads.  The net additional requirement is £10.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Estimate is complex because, while total expenditure this year will amount to £2.6 billion, only about £1.6 billion is accounted for through the Estimate for my Department. This is because all of the PRSI contribution income is paid directly into the social insurance fund and all social insurance benefits are paid directly out of that fund.  The only element of the social insurance code which is paid through the Vote is the deficit on the fund which is paid out of subhead E.  This year that will amount to just over £401 million.</P>
    <P>The size of social welfare expenditure and the sheer volume of transactions involved means precision in estimating is difficult.  This year, however, if provision had not to be made for the bonus, we would have been able to live well within our allocation.  Even allowing for overruns on some schemes arising from increased numbers claiming, we were on target to save £8.3 million.  We would have saved almost the full cost of the bonus were it not for the shortfall of £10 million on PRSI contribution income.</P>
    <P>The major savings arose on the disability and unemployment benefits schemes largely as a result of the intensification of control and anti-abuse measures.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the original estimate for my Department in June I expressed my concern then that, in the light of the vast amount now being spent on social welfare, it was more important than ever that every social welfare programme be examined to ensure that the resources involved are directed to those in greatest need.  In that context I am <Col N="1934" /> determined to take whatever steps are necessary to eliminate social welfare fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>I accept, and I think there would be general agreement on all sides of the House to this, that the vast majority of those claiming benefit are entitled to their payments.  My philosophy as Minister for Social Welfare is to support and protect the poor and needy and to ensure that they are provided with a speedy accessible service.  At the same time, I am aware that the size of the social welfare system exposes it to certain risks of fraudulent claiming and this must be eliminated so that all of the available resources are targeted to those in most need.</P>
    <P>This year special measures were directed towards suspect claims and I would like to give the House some examples of our successes in detecting abuse; of 7,000 claimants called for special control interviews to review their entitlement to unemployment payments, 1,900 left the register, 1,300 of them voluntarily and savings of £2.7 million have accrued to date this year; of 6,145 unemployment claims investigated by our special investigation unit following allegations by members of the public of working and drawing the dole, 1,622 were disallowed and savings of £4 million will result from all SIU activity this year; of 14,000 inquiries sent out to employers to check if the claimant was working or on holiday leave while claiming disability benefit, 1,100 cases of possible abuse were revealed and overpayments of £460,000 have been detected to date and of 88,000 disability benefit claimants referred to a medical referee, 22,000 had their claims ended because they were found capable of work or voluntarily ceased to claim.</P>
    <P>The weekly number of claims for disability benefit has been reduced from 81,619 in February last to 72,528 in November 1987.  This has resulted in a net saving on disability payments in excess of £8 million.</P>
    <P>As a result of PRSI surveys of employers, arrears of £3.3 million have been reported to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> In this regard the Jobsearch programme calls for particular mention.  The purpose of this programme is to help those on the live register, especially the long-term unemployed, in their search for work.  An important side-effect of the programme is that many of those who should not be on the live register leave it voluntarily.  The initial savings target set for the Jobsearch programme was £11.5 million.  The latest indications now are that savings of the order of £18 million will be realised this year from the programme.</P>
    <P>The figures for the numbers participating under the programme are equally striking.  Up to 4 December this year 135,115 persons were interviewed by the NMS under the scheme of which 29,137 received places in schemes or programmes and a further 4,025 were placed in jobs.  Of those who failed to avail of assistance under the programme, 1,785 were disallowed following review of their entitlements while 11,445 left the live register voluntarily.</P>
    <P>A survey of participants has shown that a staggering 79 per cent had never participated in a scheme or programme for the unemployed.  Of those who left school at primary level 57 per cent were unemployed for over three years.</P>
    <P>Looking briefly to the detailed features of this Supplementary Estimate the main components are: a substantial increase of £7.3 million under subhead F for old age pensions because of the bonus, £3.8 million and increased numbers claiming; a net increase of £6.4 million on the Unemployment Assistance Scheme.  This allows for the cost of the bonus, £4 million, and increased numbers claiming, and is offset by savings arising from the application of the control measures which I have spoken about; savings under various administration subheads through the application of good management housekeeping, and substantial savings under subhead E &mdash; the State contribution to the Social Insurance Fund &mdash; arising mainly on the disability and unemployment benefit schemes through the <Col N="1936" /> application of controls and anti-fraud measures, and despite the shortfall of £10 million on PRSI contribution income.</P>
    <P>In the time available it has only been possible for me to give a brief outline of the features of this Supplementary Estimate. However, if any Deputy wishes clarification on any specific point I will, of course, be happy to elaborate.</P>
    <P>This year has been a particularly difficult year for the social welfare finances and our additional requirement of only £10.5 million is an indication of the success of the policies we have pursued.  The provision of this additional money for the Christmas bonus at a time of such acute financial pressure is an indication of the commitment of this Government to the needs of those on social welfare.  The coming year will be no less difficult with increasing numbers of the elderly to be catered for.  I will be seeking ways of making the system more flexible and adaptable, particularly for the unemployed, with the ultimate aim of a social welfare system which is in tune with the changing needs of our community today.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>Because of the time I spent in Ballymun I know how much this Christmas payment will mean to the people on long term social welfare.  At its most basic, it will provide that little bit extra to make Christmas different from any other time of the year.  I endorse the Government's decision to continue with the policy of paying an extra week to all social welfare recipients for Christmas. This payment has become an expectation and it has gained almost the status of a right in a social welfare system which is creaking at the joints from complication and bureaucracy.  After nine months as a TD I still have not found out where the system begins and ends.  The Christmas bonus is just another <i>ad hoc</i> payment in a social welfare system badly in need of fundamental reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been advocating the streamlining <Col N="1937" /> of the social welfare system to ensure that those now benefiting from the Christmas bonus will have an adequate income for the 52 weeks of the year.  At the same time, the major disincentives for people to work or to make any effort to help themselves should be removed from the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I am one of the few TDs who appreciates what it is to live even for a very short period of a week on social welfare.  When I was in Ballymun I lived on £21.50 for five days.  It meant that everything was governed by money.  The lack of money led to an extremely limited existence: I could not call it a living.  Far worse than the poverty level in Ballymun is official policy to create a whole culture of social welfare in the 3,000 odd flats in the Ballymun area.  About 70 per cent of the people there are living on social welfare, half of the unmarried mothers of Dublin city are put into flats in the area which comprises only 10 per cent of Dublin's housing stock and psychiatric patients are now being released to live without proper medical attention in the flats.  The whole Ballymun complex is officially being designated as a social welfare ghetto.  This is extremely unfair to the settled families who take pride in the Ballymun flats built 21 years ago.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to give some information about my experience in Ballymun. The Dublin Corporation official policy, obviously backed by successive Governments, is a scandal.  I have no hesitation in saying that Ballymun is the most deprived area in Dublin.  I say this unapologetically as a TD for what is regarded as one of the better off constituencies in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Granted there are public housing problems in Dún Laoghaire but they bear no relation to the deprivation which is officially condoned in Ballymun.  There is no need, as has been confirmed to me by community leaders in the area, for Ballymun to be <Col N="1938" /> the social welfare ghetto, the no-go housing area that it is.  I had never seen the Ballymun flats before I went there, except from the air.  They are fine flats and I would tell Deputy Barnes that if they were built in Ballsbridge, Monkstown, Dún Laoghaire or Dalkey they would be netting a high rental for the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just mentioning something about Ballymun.  The Ballymun flats should be an asset to the city of Dublin in terms of housing: yet they are being officially abused, they are being allowed to be vandalised and they are being designated for the current rejects of the capital city.  A change in policy for Ballymun could net great benefits for the State.  The flats in Ballymun should be privatised.  I know the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; tends to have ugly ideological connotations and tends to raise the hackles of politicians.  In this context the Ballymun flats should be handed over to the residents with the existing corporation budget.  Having met the community leaders I am confident they would make a better go of managing and maintaining the Ballymun flats than do the corporation officials from their fine offices in Wood Quay.  The local community conducted a study of the flats called <i>A block of facts</i> and I would recommend it to the Minister.  The community are anxious to have a different housing policy implemented.  They want to restore the mix of old and new communities.  They want to have the normal social mix in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the many people from around the country who sent secondhand clothes through my office to the community enterprise project in Ballymun.  These clothes are being renovated and restored and given to people in the community there.  I thank all the families who brought their secondhand toys to all Masses in Dalkey village last Sunday for the people in Ballymun.  Their action is <Col N="1939" /> much appreciated.  I assure the Government that the public response to such projects carries with it a lesson we should not forget.  There is a genuine consensus in the community that spending cuts are needed for the next few years, but people want to see them implemented fairly. They want to see the poor and needy being properly looked after.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the axe has been wielded so swiftly by the Government that the genuine poor are not always uppermost in Ministers' minds.  There are great injustices in the social welfare system and the feeling of injustice is compounded by the complexity of the system. There are 37 cash and non-cash schemes administered by different Departments and agencies, for practically the one purpose. There are about 80 different payment rates for children.  The social welfare services have been allowed to develop on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by successive Governments and there is little or no coordination between the different bodies or agencies.</P>
    <P>The view has wrongly been fostered that the expenditure of more and more money leads to a better level of service for the public.  The Progressive Democrats believe this is a fallacy.  Across the board increases have merely added another layer of bureaucracy and red tape to a service already choked by administration. Expenditure on our social services has developed in many cases into an industry serving the needs of those employed in it rather than the public in general.  The taxpayer is certainly not getting value for money and the most vulnerable and marginal groups in our society have not had a chance to catch up or improve their position.  Our universal approach to social policy, giving a little to everyone instead of being selective and focussing attention on those in genuine need, has resulted in people on low incomes being as badly off, relatively speaking, as they were 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare set out to address these problems but unfortunately their report was rather disappointing since it called for huge <Col N="1940" /> expenditure in these straitened times. The amount of money involved cannot be afforded.  For this reason I appeal to the Minister to take a fundamental look at our social welfare system during the next year.  Nowhere is a selective approach to public expenditure more urgently required than in the whole area of social welfare.  I thank the Minister for telling the House that he is now examining all the schemes in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged for the opportunity to comment on this Estimate. One could not let pass the chance to make some comment on the most unbelievable intervention on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  The high water mark of their contribution appears to come from someone who comes down from the clouds to have a look at Ballymun a bit more closely for five days and who comes in here to thank the people of Dún Laoghaire for sending renovated second-hand clothes and toys as a means of dealing with the problems there.  To suggest that what is needed in Ballymun is the introduction of the private racketeer to deal with the housing there is unbelievable in the extreme and must be condemned out of hand.  It is an incredible contribution from a party which would profess national standing with some notion of how the country's problems might be dealt with and disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any member from The Workers' Party would welcome any additional expenditure in that area but the point must be <Col N="1941" /> made that it is too little.  When one looks at the trend which commenced in this year's budget, it is to be welcomed that there is not even an extra penny to be found for persons on long-term social welfare who are in need of a decent living. During the budget debate we talked about the fact that people in the poorest areas of this city were merely being afforded the price of the bus fare to town and back, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this Minister for Social Welfare does not have the best interests of social welfare recipients at heart.  He is another apostle of the cutback, a person who believes that the economic stringency advocated by this Government should be visited as heavily and as uncaringly on those who can least afford it as on all other sectors.  A Minister in that Department should be fighting against the tide, using arguments that cannot be answered.  Those who live below the poverty line should be positively aided and not subjected to the stringent cutbacks which are the hallmark of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Estimate affords us the opportunity to reflect on the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Their report recommended a minimum income of £60 per week for a single person.  We are very far from achieving that.  Reference has been made to the Christmas bonus, which was once known as the Christmas double week.  When the Minister visited Darndale, as he has very often done in my company and that of others, he said that the Christmas double week would be restored as soon as Fianna Fáil returned to Government.  That has not happened.  The bonus represents 65 per cent of the payment for a second week. It is far short of the original concept.  If the Minister has to bend to the cutback whip this time, I hope he will commit himself to pursuing the restoration of the full bonus payment to long-term recipients in 1988.</P>
    <P>During his first year in office the Minister has missed the opportunity to deal with some of the anomalies which exist in the social welfare system.  An example <Col N="1942" /> is the anomaly which differentiates substantially between a widower and a widow.</P>
    <P>We must also reject out of hand the findings of the OECD report with regard to our economic future and the prospects for job creation.  We must create jobs for the long-term unemployed so that we can move them, not hound them, off the social welfare system.  The Minister cannot talk about the effectiveness and efficiency of the social welfare system. The Jobsearch programme has not yet brought home the full picture of those who were hounded out of the system and are now appealing to get back.  That figure was not given in the Minister's contribution today, but I believe it to be substantial.  How many of the 30,000 or so who have been hounded out are now appealing their cases?  They are coming on a daily basis to advice clinics in my constituency and explaining the tortuous workings of the system.  Married women are being declared unfit or unavailable for work simply because they are married. Recently I sent the Minister details of a case of a constituent who was found to be unavailable for work one week and denied upwards of four months entitlements, that being the time it took to have her appeal heard.  Within a week of that finding she took up full time employment, as she had had for upwards of five years preceding that incident.  Within a week of the Department saying she was not available for work she was back working full time.  There is a saving, there is inefficiency for you.</P>

      <P>Well, it is happening on a weekly basis and I should like to hear the Minister's view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is not operating in the caring way the Minister would have us believe.  The savings are not achieving the justice he would have us all believe. There is this constant reference to fraud within the welfare system.  In the overall budget it constitutes a minute element, a minute percentage of overall claimants. <Col N="1943" /> I would respectfully submit that the savings are not achieving justice at all, that this procedure is victimising far more people than it is dealing with effectively. It must be operated much more carefully and caringly in the future.</P>
    <P>In the context of savings one aspect of the Supplementary Estimate being presented here today is the incredible fact that under subhead N &mdash; Anti-Poverty Programme &mdash; there is a figure of a saving of £300,000.  How can a Government or a Department of Social Welfare, with the slightest consideration for or involvement in anti-poverty turn around, at the end of their first year in office and after all the promises of their February manifesto, and say that they have managed to save the economy £300,000 on an anti-poverty programme?  How has this saving been achieved?  I hope the Minister will tell us before leaving the House today.  What has happened?  Equally, bearing that saving in mind how could the Minister have come in here and supported the abolition of the National Social Service Board, handing over a very small sum to the Combat Poverty Agency to enable them provide the services of that board in whatever way they can?  It is a hallmark of all Government manoeuvres in this area to do down independent advisory boards who would help, criticise and, where necessary, advise people of their entitlements.  It is a symbol of the Department's inefficiency that they are devising and reverting to the days when people in receipt of social welfare were not informed of the intricacies of the system or of their entitlements.  That is not the type of saving we want to see in this or any other area.</P>
    <P>At the end of their first year in office there are many questions that must be asked of the Minister and his Government. The ten minutes available to me did not afford me an opportunity to ask all the questions I would have liked but I have touched on some of them.  Having listened to Members' contributions I hope the Minister will leave the House today determined that, in their second year in office, he and his Government <Col N="1944" /> will be fighting in a serious, committed way on behalf of those in receipt of long-term benefit.</P>

      <P>We have just heard two contributions on this Supplementary Estimate, one on behalf of the Progressive Democrats and another on behalf of The Workers' Party that discredit those two parties and are of no benefit whatsoever to the poor of this country.  There was, on the one hand, the rather extraordinary contribution by Deputy Kennedy who showed clearly that the Progressive Democrats have no idea whatever of what life is like at ground level here, who admitted that she had never been in Ballymun or had any idea of what life there was like except from what could be perceived from the air as she flew in and one of Dublin Airport. These are the same people who condemn what they call clienteleism, alluding to Deputies who are in touch with their constituents.  On the other hand, there is this left wing &mdash; they will not call it Marxist/Leninist, but it is Marxist/Leninist rhetoric &mdash; on the part of The Workers' Party, well-to-do members who can afford to be members of the Royal Saint George Yacht Club in Dún Laoghaire, condescendingly addressing what they see as the absolute good of social welfare.  Social welfare is not necessarily good <i>per se</i>.  Certainly it is not good if it is unselective, if it is being paid to too many people who do not need it, and if it is not being paid in sufficient proportions to those who badly need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been one word from The Workers' Party &mdash; in regard to the Christmas bonus which they have welcomed &mdash; of the fact that people in receipt of two and three pensions will receive a £65 bonus for Christmas while those people living on £35 a week will receive a bonus of £20.  Where is the cry for social justice from The Workers' Party?  Where is the understanding of the poverty afflicting so many of our people when, in this Supplementary Estimate, <Col N="1945" /> we are being asked to pass within a short time today we are being totally unselective? Percentage increases are being given which mean that the higher one's weekly allowance the higher will be one's bonus and, the lower one's weekly allowance, the lower one's bonus.  That is inverted justice.  The Society of Major Religious Superiors, in a document they published, a document which has many flaws and could be much criticised, at least highlighted this anomaly of percentage increases which mean that the larger one's social welfare payment, the larger one's bonus.  This applies not only to Christmas bonuses but to annual increases.  Those people at the bottom rung of the social welfare ladder &mdash; who are, by definition, the most needy in our society &mdash; receive the lowest annual increases and Christmas bonuses.</P>
      <P>I have pleaded in this House many times that the Minister be more selective. I pleaded with him months ago not to grant a Christmas bonus which would repeat the mistakes of the Government of which I was a member and which paid these across-the-board increases.  Rather than paying those percentage increases it would have been much fairer had the Minister come in and said that everybody would be paid an extra £40 or £50.  It would have been even more fair, though administratively inconvenient, were he to have said that we have £20 million to distribute, that we are not going to pay it to those who are not in need but, rather, that we will give it all to those who are in need.  Unfortunately, the Department of Social Welfare follow the path of administrative convenience all too readily. They do not see themselves, as they ought, as a combat poverty agency, as I have said before in this House.  Rather do they see themselves more as a form of a money-dispensing machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a plea in this House today that this be the last time we have non-selective Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare, that we stop rubbing the noses of the poor in the ground, that we stop dispensing largesse to those who do not need it.  Time and again I have cited cases <Col N="1946" /> of several people with two pensions from former employment amounting to perhaps £33,000 a year, who have jobs but who qualify for free travel, free electricity, and free television licence and who are the owners of large houses on which they pay no rates, and country cottages to which they commute by way of free travel.  By virtue of this Estimate such people will receive a bonus of £60, while there are people living on £35 a week with no other means of support and who have no free travel entitlement. They will not have a television so there can be no question of getting a free television licence.  Neither do they have a telephone and, even if they did, would not be granted free rental.  These are people in abject poverty, who go hungry, who do not know what it means to have a full meal daily; perhaps they manage a meal three or four days a week.  What affronts me in this House is that those who call themselves socialists, even Marxist, have no regard to or make no reference to the need for selectivity, the need to help the most needy in our society.  I condemn them as I condemn the Minister.  He has only been nine months a Minister, but he was Minister in this Department before. It is not that he has newly taken up the cudgels; he was there before.  He could have started reforms immediately which would have given hope to the poor of our country on this day.  But no, the poor are to remain poor.</P>
    <P>Probably the reason I am the main Opposition spokesman on Social Welfare is that I have a burning passion, and have had for many years, about abuses in social welfare.  Money dispensed to those abusing the system is money diverted from those who really need it.  In my constituency, and in most constituencies in the country, there are people who are genuinely in desperate need.  I had a telephone call this morning from an unfortunate mother of three children who does not even have a proper chair to sit on in her kitchen.  She is not talking about toys for Christmas; she does not have food for Christmas.  She is getting £65 a week.  She does not get the Christmas bonus because <Col N="1947" /> in the last three months she went to England and came back, foregoing her long term unemployment assistance in the meantime.  Yet we are giving the Christmas bonus to many well to do people.  It is a shame that this House has tolerated this for so long.  Let this be the last time this sort of unselective proposal is put before this House.</P>
    <P>On abuse, I have to say a word of praise to the Minister.  He has done a lot to tackle abuse for the coming year and in a way that has not provoked a backlash, and he deserves congratulations on it.  It has been mainly based on the Jobsearch scheme, but there have also been significant achievements in the area of disability benefit.  I have no doubt that further efforts need to be made in the area of abuse.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk at greater length about unemployment but we do not have time today.  Not only do we need to tackle abuse but to redirect our efforts in regard to unemployment.  There is a need for radical new thinking on the social insurance fund.  It is absurd, given the amount of unemployment here, that we should be taxing employment by the way we draw pay-related social insurance from employers.  Therefore, the fashion in the public sector and in the private sector is to make people redundant, because all the incentive is in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, whose job it is to pay the unemployed, has a major role in redirecting social insurance. We should be considering altering radically our social insurance base to company turnover rather than to company payroll with rebates per person employed, thus reversing the incentive from getting rid of people back to getting people on the register, away from encouraging black market employees and restoring them to legitimate employment on the register where they will pay their taxes and stop abusing the system.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we do not have more time. Next week we will have a Social Welfare Bill and a Social Welfare Question Time <Col N="1948" /> and I will have a great deal more to say on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear from all sides about the need for the social welfare system to create an incentive to work. We hear a great deal about alleged abuse of the system.  The Minister has joined that bandwagon.  We hear about the need to tax social welfare benefits.  The latest instalment today is from the OECD report on the Irish economy, no doubt inspired by various officers of the Department of Finance.  In addition, we hear a great deal about the need to be selective. Let us put all of this into perspective.  This week there are 136,000 people drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They deserve more help than they are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The money does not exist.  These 136,000 people are paid on average a miserable £53.45 a week. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> or the back page of the <i>Tribune</i> supplement a dinner for two, even with a Member of the Oireachtas, would get rid of £53.  That is all some people will get for Christmas this year.  They will get a 60 per cent bonus this year and that will hardly pay for Christmas week.</P>
      <P>There is an obsession with controlling the payments made to those who are sick, and they are insured persons paying PRSI all their life.  Out of a labour force of one million we have 78,000 drawing disability benefit at any one time.  The average is £56.  They do not all get pay-related benefit.  Only one in every five gets it &mdash; and they get nothing for the first three weeks anyway.  So if a person breaks his leg on the job and is out sick, he gets an average benefit this year of about £17.  It is peanuts.  An industrial worker who has double pneumonia and has to stay in his bed for four or five weeks, or who has a major illness and has to go to hospital and undergo surgery is on disability benefit and has to live and feed his family on £80 a week for eight or nine weeks.  The cry for taxation of that is selective indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on.  There are 85,000 on <Col N="1949" /> unemployment benefit, and the restrictions have been very severe.  The average payment this year is £53.83 and about half of them get pay-related benefit of about £14 a week.  The levels of social welfare payments are low.  They are not the kind of exotic income levels that are alleged by so many people in the community. Occasionally one meets the industrial worker, referred to by Deputy Mitchell, who has two pensions.  So what if he has two pensions?  When I retire I will have two pensions.  I will have an Oireachtas pension for which I paid 6 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is all that the Gouldings pensioners get.  I know them.  My father represented them for 30 years as a trade union official.  There is a lot of mythology about the incomes of people and this must be discarded.  I spent four years in Government trying to stop some of that mythology taking root.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us today a horrifying figure.  He said that of those who left school at primary level 57 per cent were unemployed for over three years.  That is the reality.  That is the social crisis in our community.  I am glad the Minister has given a 60 per cent bonus for Christmas. I got that bonus down to 60 or 65 per cent last year and the year before to give the additional amount saved to the long term unemployed.  I recall vividly Deputy McCarthy in the House and also Deputy Roche; I was vilified.  I will not ever forget that, but I will forgive it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister because the experience he had in office previously and his further experience in Opposition have meant that the Social Welfare Vote has remained intact.  I congratulate him on surviving some of the more draconian proposals which he had to face last July. He has kept the Department of Finance at bay and has refused to yield to some of the most right-wing, conservative, vicious thinking in this country in recent years in relation to social welfare.  I hope he does not succumb next year: I do not think he will.  Now that the Government are beginning to realise they are a minority Government they will be that bit more careful in the coming 12 months, which is no harm.  I hope the Government will continue in that vein for a couple of years.  We will keep a rein on them against some of the nonsense which goes around about public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister briefly about the subhead for assistance allowances in relation to single parents in our community. I notice there is a requirement <Col N="1951" /> of an additional £3.1 million here.  Is that because of additional numbers?  I congratulate the Department of Social Welfare on the capacity to have precision in relation to their Estimates, not like that of the Department of Education which we have just had now.  The Department of Social Welfare, to their eternal credit, with limited resources have always been very competent in the manner in which they have handled a budget of £2.6 billion. They can still find £10.5 million one way or the other in order to bring forward proposals such as this.</P>
    <P>Next week we will be talking about a Social Welfare Bill.  I am gravely concerned that we will see a further erosion in the basic social welfare rights of insured workers.  A person must now have five years stamps before he goes on to long-term disability benefit, or qualifies for an invalidity pension.  That is an extremely long time.  If he breaks his leg and never goes back to work he must wait for five years.  When I was Minister for the Department it was a three year wait for long duration disability and three years for eligibility for invalidity pension. The changes are massive and the cuts are very major cuts.  The cuts in pay-related benefit which have been brought in in the past two budgets means there is no need whatsoever to tax them because those payment levels are right down to rock bottom.  They have gone down from an average of about £28 a week to £14 a week, so, effectively, taxation is not required.  The replacement ratios are well down to about 65 per cent, or 70 per cent for disability.  I am completely opposed to any taxation measures as proposed in the OECD report.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for keeping his Vote intact this year.  I know the pressures that are on him and he has done a very good job.  I congratulate him on the Christmas bonus and on having to find only about £8.5 million.  I hope he wins the battle against the conservative &mdash; I will not say bureaucratic &mdash; forces in Irish society in 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not want <Col N="1952" /> to interfere with the time left for the Minister's response.  I have a few questions which he may be able to answer. As Deputy Mitchell has said, there is Question Time and also a debate on the Social Welfare Bill next week and we shall be able to make our points then.  My basic point is that we should think in terms of a basic income rather than social welfare.  In the light of unemployment and the incredible number of categories of payments, entitlements, eligibility and, above all, the future structure of work &mdash; which perhaps not this country but the rest of the industrialised world is facing &mdash; we must think seriously of basic incomes.  That could be basic household or basic personal incomes.  We must remove the shame, the degradation, the queuing up for information, the administration, the bureaucracy, the incredible waste both in human and in administrative terms.  As Deputy Mitchell has said, there are different categories of people who are not getting enough to survive on a day-to-day basis. Because of the patchwork approach to these problems, we have built in certain differences so that there is resentment and discrimination in the system itself.</P>
      <P>I note with pleasure that the Minister says the Government will be seeking ways to make the system more flexible and adaptable, particularly for the unemployed. That is how we should go about it.  We must remove the stigma from social welfare benefits, give back to people a sense of honour and decency and make them feel they are useful human beings in this community, whether their work be formal or informal.  A basic income is the only way in which this will be achieved.  I hope that some work has been done in the Department on that aspect.  I do not know what the Department of Finance would say about it, but there are enlightened people in the Department of Social Welfare who might agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is anything active being done with regard to the training of the staff who have to deal with people who are queuing up hopelessly at hatches, sometimes in very inclement weather, week after <Col N="1953" /> week?  When Deputy Boland was Minister he had schemes ready for introduction &mdash; and I ask if they have been introduced &mdash; under which you do not put very junior staff in the Department of Social Welfare dealing with people who have incredible difficulties, psychological and mental, because of the traumas they are going through.  Could we ensure privacy and confidentiality of information in our offices so that people are not turned away, made to feel they are in some way guilty, when the difficulties may be bureaucratic or official?</P>
    <P>Above all let us guarantee those people who must go through the system the greatest degree of communication and information with dignity.  We must remember the numbers, the proportion of our population involved here.  If a basic income plan cannot be adopted this year or next year, at least let there be a humane, dignified, well-trained staff.  I know also the pressures put on staff who work behind the hatches.  Let us be able to report progress on all fronts by this time next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available I will refer briefly to some of the points which were raised.  Deputy Kennedy referred to the need for fundamental reform and the need for removing disincentives to work. In any steps which a Minister takes he must be careful not to create disincentives to work.  My principal concern must be that those who need the benefits in the first instance should get them.  As long as one accepts that that is the first thing I will be doing I am prepared to look at ways of removing disincentives and at rationalisation.  Deputy Desmond makes very wise contributions but the fact of the matter is that the disincentives may be taken out of the context in which you initially intended them.  Nevertheless, I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for reform and rationalisation was stressed by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Mitchell, but in changing or altering the many schemes you will have to make sure that <Col N="1954" /> you will not hurt those who should not be omitted.  That is the great danger and one of the problems with the schemes is that often there is a lack of information about the people concerned.  What we need to do is to set up a system which will obtain that information and leave us in a better position to tackle the problems. I am sorry that Deputy McCartan was not in the House for Deputy Desmond's contribution because he might have gained from that Deputy's experience in Government.  Deputy McCartan seems to hold a very simplistic view of the whole social welfare situation.  He suggested that I should be fighting against the cuts.  I will take on Mr. Cuts wherever I have to take him on at any time but as Minister for Social Welfare I have to look for rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke particularly about the Combat Poverty Agency.  The director of that agency only took up his duties full time last September and in the current year they were not in a position to carry out the research they had in mind.  They have managed to do some of it but to a fair extent they have ended up paying out grants to voluntary groups, and as Deputies will be aware, there is a voluntary grant scheme operated by the Department.  Next year the Combat Poverty Agency will be in a better position to tackle the work they want to engage in.  That is where the saving of £300,000 rose although it did not prevent the agency from doing the work which it managed to get underway.  It did affect the volume of voluntary grants but there was another £750,000 allocated to that by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also referred to the Jobsearch scheme.  Out of a total number of 135,000 people interviewed only 1,785 were disallowed.  The number of appeals was 705, of which 222 were allowed.  As Deputy Desmond has emphasised, the Department of Social Welfare will ensure that people receive their rights and benefits and the basic criteria which are used in that context are the right of appeal and a fair hearing.  This can be seen clearly from the Jobsearch scheme.  Compared to the total number of people who were <Col N="1955" /> interviewed the number of appeals is extremely low.  Also the appeal system works in a very fair way.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with Deputy Mitchell when he said there is a need for targeting. At the beginning of this year, there was little time, as the Deputy will recognise in which to target the schemes, but I have now begun to do this.  It is proving difficult as it is very hard to avoid hitting people who should not be affected by such targeting.  Nonetheless, I accept the point he made.  In the forthcoming budget I will bear in mind what Deputy Mitchell had to say as it is also a view which I share.  Here again we come back to the question of balance which Deputy Desmond emphasised.</P>
    <P>In regard to abuse I thank Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Desmond for their words of praise.  Deputy Mitchell said that further effort is needed and that there was a need for radical change.  The only trouble is that there is only a certain number of radical changes we can implement at any one time.  At present we are implementing two major administrative changes in regard to statutory sick pay and PRSI for farmers and the self employed.  Nonetheless, I appreciate the point which the Deputy made in that respect.</P>
    <P>One of the other findings at the Jobsearch scheme was that 79 per cent of the long term unemployed had never had a course or scheme offered to them before. That emphasises just how wise it was to make 40,000 places available on these schemes and courses for the long term unemployed.  There are many reasons why those people were never given such opportunities but the fact of the matter is they were never given those options previously.  As Deputy Desmond has pointed out, 57 per cent of those who left school after completing their primary certificate were over three years on the register.  That is a very telling statistic. As I said at the outset we will pursue the Jobsearch scheme in a positive manner and if there happens to be indirect benefits, which we believe there will be, we will be glad to have them.  There are many <Col N="1956" /> lessons being learned from that scheme which I hope we can build on next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked about social assistance allowances and I can tell him that the bonus amounts to £800,000 while the extra numbers amount to 2.3 million. Therefore, there is a fair increase in numbers. Deputy Barnes and a number of other Deputies referred to the need for a satisfactory basic income.  This is one of our major problems.  As Deputies will be aware, allowances for the long term unemployed, for those on unemployment assistance along with those on supplementary welfare are at the lowest level.  They receive about £35 per week and £34 in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, these are matters which I will give my attention to in the future.  Deputy Barnes spoke about flexibility and we will certainly give our attention to that.  I have mentioned some of these matters and we will probably discuss them again next week.  She referred also to the training of staff and the approach of the Department.  We have training programmes and computerisation will help this a lot.  We have completed the computerisation of unemployment assistance in Dublin and we are about to extend that to Cork and then to other areas.  Of course, that will make life much easier for the staff who deal with people.  This is a big undertaking and we are working on the unemployment benefit side in the Dublin exchanges at present.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that there should be privacy and separate sections in exchanges.  We have some fine exchanges in different areas of the country and we would like to see that extended as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>During the course of 1987 the House has had opportunities for debate on the Estimate for my Department and on a number of pieces of legislation relating to the affairs of the Department.  In the circumstances I propose to be brief in my remarks on the purposes for which this Supplementary Estimate is required.  As Deputies will have noted, this Estimate is a token Estimate for £1,000.  It arises principally to provide for a new subhead and to provide additional sums under subheads A1, A3, A5, B4 and B6.  While the total additional amount required under these subheads amounts to £1,036,000, there is an offset of £535,000 in savings on other subheads and increased appropriations-in-aid of £500,000.</P>
      <P>One hundred and five thousand pounds is required for the introduction of a new subhead, D11, which would provide expenditure for an insurance premium to cover Air Navigation Services.  In the course of the year I decided it would be prudent for the State to take insurance cover in respect of air navigation services provided by the Department so as to ensure that the State's liability would be covered in the event of it ever being found that, for example, an aircraft accident was attributable in whole or in part or fault or negligence on the part of the Department or its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State carried its own insurance in this area prior to 1987.  The sanction of the Minister for Finance was obtained and the necessary insurance cover is effective since September last.  Payment <Col N="1958" /> of two quarterly instalments arise in 1987 at an approximate cost of £105,000 which allows for currency fluctuation.  A substantial part of the cost of the annual premium is recoverable under user charges.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £256,000 is required under subhead B6 &mdash; currency exchange losses on certain Industrial Credit Corporation foreign borrowings for tourism development.  In 1981, the European Investment Bank-Industrial Credit Company loan facilities for capital development in the hotel sector were introduced by the then Minister.  These facilities were subsequently extended to other sectors of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The scheme is administered by the ICC which also operates a working loan scheme for tourism.  Under the terms of the schemes any exchange losses arising after 1982 are to be met out of Exchequer funds.  Because of fluctuations in the international currency exchange rates the original allocation of £520,000 for this year have proved inadequate.</P>
    <P>On subhead B4 an additional sum of £55,000 is required.  Under this subhead, Bord Fáilte assist in the development of a wide range of amenities and facilities of both a commercial and non-commercial nature.  Many of the grants are aimed at encouraging the improvment of facilities for such activities as watersports and fieldsports and in the provision of amenities such as cultural and historical projects and tourist trails and signposting. The usual level of grant aid is 50 per cent. Bord Fáilte now require an additional £55,000, bringing total expenditure in the year to £1.241 million, in order to meet commitments already entered into.  The additional £55,000 will be off-set by a saving from Bord Fáilte of the same amount under subhead B2 &mdash; development of holiday accommodation.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £300,000 is required under subhead A1 for the provision of wages, salaries and allowances of staff of my Department.  The allocation to my Department for this purpose was £700,000 short of requirements but through a series of measures including the non-filling of vacancies, the grant of <Col N="1959" /> career breaks and a severe curtailment of overtime a saving of £400,000 on this amount has been achieved.  The remaining sum of £300,000 is now being sought.</P>
    <P>An additional £70,000 is required under subhead A3, travelling and incidental expenses and an additional £250,000 under subhead A5 &mdash; postal and telecommunications services.  These additional sums are required for the Air Navigation Services Offices and the Meteorological Service of my Department. The Air Navigation Services Office is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the safety and regularity of civil aviation while the Meteorological Service provides, <i>inter alia,</i> weather forecast information for aircraft in flight, for shipping, fisheries and other marine interests and for the general public.</P>
    <P>Increased usage of telecommunication equipment in these areas has resulted in higher expenditure.  In addition arrears of charges totalling £170,000 in the A5 subhead relating to 1986 became due for payment in 1987.  In relation to A3, costs for 1985 and 1986 totalling £60,000 approximately were recouped to the Department of Defence which operates the scheme of medical tests on behalf of my Department for commercial and private pilots.  Most of the cost of these services is recovered through user charges.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is a curious one. I note in particular, the provision for insurance premium for the Air Navigation Services.  I very much appreciate the necessity for it given this Government's record in the provision and support for Air Navigation Services.  I am referring, in particular, to the aviation service at Ballygirreen and the marine radio service at Malin Head.  The Government have decided to give less money to these services than what is required and in so doing they are not alone putting jobs at risk &mdash; and there are 150 jobs in these areas &mdash; but are <Col N="1960" /> putting lives at risk also.  This is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity to ask the Minister that rather than applying the blanket embargo on public service recruitment right across the board to lift the embargo in relation to recruitment for Ballygirreen and Malin Head.  By bringing this insurance premium before the House and asking the House to agree to the moneys for it, I am sure the Minister appreciates the serious situation arising at present because of undermanning in the service.  There is a great risk involved and a need to pay a high insurance premium.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it was prudent for the State to take insurance cover in respect of air navigation services provided by the Department so as to ensure that the State's liability would be covered in the event of it ever being found that an aircraft accident was attributable in whole or in part to fault or negligence on the part of the Department or their employees.  There is a real danger of that occurring and the Minister is wise to take out such insurance cover but that is not the way to correct the fault in this case. The real problem arises because of a lack of manpower.  That is the question the Minister, and the Government, should be addressing rather than taking out insurance cover.  I am sure the Minister is aware that when there is lack of manpower inefficiencies follow.</P>
      <P>It is worth recording that Ballygirreen has an excellent international reputation. All airlines from the northern hemisphere have been full of praise for the service provided by Ballygirreen.  The problem at that station is causing great concern to the 150 employees whose jobs are at risk.  Thousands of lives may be put at risk if sufficient money is not provided to upgrade the service by installing sufficient equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the items discussed at the Washington Summit was improved transport facilities between New York and Moscow.  I understand that Pan American Airways propose operating a 747 on a direct flight from New York to Moscow and that the same company have made a <Col N="1961" /> bid to run the duty-free shop at Moscow Airport.  The Minister, who has responsibility for Aer Rianta, will be aware that that company were involved in negotiations with the authorities in Moscow with a view to running the duty-free shop there.  The Minister should deal with that matter immediately.  I do not want the Shannon Region, Aer Rianta and Ireland losing out because of a lack of action on the part of the Minister.  We all welcome the improvement in East-West relations as a result of the Washington Summit but we must be concerned about our own interests.  Mr. Gorbachev may have complimented Ireland on her neutrality when passing over the country but one must question the sincerity of that compliment. I would like to know the reason for paying that compliment because at the Washington Summit he may have reached an agreement with the Americans that will affect us.  We should show we are not prepared to accept such treatment. We must remember we have friends nearer home than Moscow.</P>
    <P>The drop in value of the US dollar will have serious repercussions on our tourist industry.  I have no doubt that next year it will suffer if the slide in the value of the US currency continues.  There is an onus on the Minister, Bord Fáilte and SFADCo, to do everything possible to encourage American tourists to visit Ireland.  The drop in value of the dollar will benefit us in one way in that the money allocated to Bord Fáilte and SFADCo to promote tourism in the US will have greater purchasing power.  The Department should ensure that that money is spent shrewdly and on a different package to that envisaged initially. There should be greater use of television advertising because it is more beneficial than some of the activities that Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and other bodies engage in in the US.</P>
    <P>To date we have not received any information about the transfer of responsibility from Bord Fáilte to SFADCo for the mid-west region.  Tourist interests in those counties are concerned that they <Col N="1962" /> will be discriminated against.  I understand that the experts employed by Shannonside will not be re-employed in the tourism promotion field by SFADCo.  I accept that the latter company had a tourist interest prior to this but it was a very specialised and narrow one.  That concern excelled in their area but I would be concerned if they moved into tourism promotion for the region without employing a number of tourist experts.  I am concerned about the plight of the small hoteliers, owners of guesthouses and farmhouses in the area who must call on the services of officials who are expert in tourist promotion.  There is a danger that they will not have anybody to call on next year.  The Minister should ensure that the mid-west region is not downgraded.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that SFADCo's responsibility for the Bunratty Folk Park will conflict with the operations of those responsible for Kilfenora, Corofin Heritage Centre and Ailwee Caves.  SFADCo's interest in the Curraghchase Caravan Park near Foynes would be in conflict with other caravan parks in the mid-west region.  The Bunratty, Knappogue and Kinvara Castle entertainment centres will be in conflict with other centres that SFADCo will be expected to promote.  The Minister should ensure that centres where SFADCo do not have an interest are not discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make several points on what the Minister has said.  First, I consider this general approach to approving expenditure of public moneys almost an absolute waste of parliamentary time, rubber stamp type discussions at a remove of light years from public interest or relevance, filling in the heel of a week.  We should find some better way of doing the business. Perhaps a committee of the House would look at these Estimates seriously line by line when they come up and let us not have this absolute nonsense of a debate not just today but every other day for many years.  I know what it is there to achieve and whom it is there to facilitate. <Col N="1963" /> Generally it is a disservice and I see no or very little advantage in it.  I recommend strongly that we find some other way of examining public moneys.  I do not want to convey or be associated with conveying the impression that we are seriously evaluating the efficacy, efficiency or effectiveness of public expenditure by this rubber stamping approach.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I ask the Minister to consider, as a former member of a committee who took seriously, as he himself did, questions relating to public expenditure, the possibility of having established or reestablishing a committee who would look at this in a detailed, systematic way over a period of time.  They should look at the Estimates of expenditure, how the money is being spent, what the demands for Supplementary Estimates are based on and how they are justified.  This Supplementary Estimate does not justify any of the requests it makes.  It purports to explain them but does not justify them. I would prefer a studied approach to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third thing I want to say relates to transport in general.  The key question in transport relates not to a Supplementary Estimate seeking additional sums to top up existing programmes but a radical reform of our whole transport policy. Lest I be accused of tossing off a cliché with no meaning, I am talking essentially about a total review both of our philosophy in relation to the provision of public transport and the co-ordination of elements within the present fabric of public transport.  The philosophy is that public transport is provided by the State and anything else is at best suspect and at worst not to be approved or recommended. That is outdated and extremely expensive as a way of doing business.  I recommended that the Minister initiate a new policy which would result in a joint venture approach between the responsibility the State has to oversee the fabric of public transport and the resources available in public and private hands in the community, so that we would have a new and dynamic public transport facility and not as at present a somewhat deficient public transport service which is <Col N="1964" /> often maligned quite wrongly because it is being asked to do a job which it simply cannot do by virtue of lack of definition of its responsibility and lack of resources. There should be a mix of public and private transport elements and those in the business of seeking to provide private transport input to the total fabric should be encouraged and welcomed as a way of taking the burden off the Exchequer and CIE, not in direct confrontation or competition but as a form of joint venture in the first instance.  Those are the questions I would like to see addressed in any attempt to increase expenditure on transportation.</P>
    <P>In that context the fourth point I want to make is that it is an extraordinary vacuum in relation to CIE that there is not yet a serious statement of their social role.  I have often seen headings stating that CIE lose £x million.  It is about as valid as saying that old age pensions lose £x million.  If we expect from the public transport facility a series of arteries into areas of our country which need that kind of lifeline that must be provided on the assumption and understanding that it must cost money.  Therefore, I am asking for a radical review of our present way of providing those transport services and a clear statement for CIE of what their job is socially and economically.  It is wrong to blame them for losing money if their job is essentially that of providing a social service which at the very least is part of their job.</P>
    <P>Fifth, this approach to approving Estimates is extremely superficial.  The sums of money involved here are significant, but bear in mind they are topping up extremely substantial sums already approved of.  We might as well not bother our heads with this kind of approach or else do it seriously, and I am for doing it seriously.  By that I mean getting a forum away from this Dáil Chamber where we can all take off our party political hats and in a systematic way over a period of months get down to making our assessments on behalf of the people of how their money is being spent.  This nod and wink approach of rushing things through will not work except in that it continues <Col N="1965" /> to fuel public cynicism and much political apathy among many of our colleagues, present company possibly included.  It is wrong for any Minister to come into the House and seek extra moneys without justifying how they should be spent or why they should be so spent.</P>
    <P>There are six different requests in the Minister's speech.  I accept that the request for £105,000 for an insurance premium is a policy decision by the Minister, and it is a good one.  It should be approved and no further justification may be necessary there though perhaps a little elaboration on how the premium is being placed and whether there was open tendering for it would not go astray.  Most of the others are requests to make up shortfalls.  The currency exchange losses on certain Industrial Credit Corporation foreign borrowings could be perceived to arise from some form of misjudgment, although that may be too hard an interpretation.</P>
    <P>The additional £55,000 required for Bord Fáilte is simply a statement that Bord Fáilte now require an additional £55,000.  I want to know why.  The Minister said it was in order to meet commitments already entered into.  Is it possible that State bodies are still able to enter into open-ended commitments as they have done many times without reference to this House or to various Ministers? If they so do we should tell them that those moneys will not necessarily be approved of here.  Bord Fáilte are one of the bodies I want to make it easy for in terms of their success as they do a very good job, but I am questioning the principle of State agencies spending money without apparent approval.  It is not good enough to force us into retrospective endorsement of moneys already spent or committed.  Whereas we are not opposing this Estimate today, in future State agencies who come via the Minister to this House looking for cash to make up for commitments already entered into will not necessarily get our approval here.  If we all were to do that we would not be able to survive and that maximum should apply to these bodies also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> In relation to wages, salaries and allowances an additional £300,000 is required and the allocation for that purpose was apparently £700,000 short of requirements. How was that in a year when inflation was extremely low and wage increases niggardly if at all?  How can we be so far out?  That gives the lie to the kind of debate we had on those Estimates. Despite the best efforts of the Department they are still looking for more money.</P>
    <P>I see under the same principle, a sum needed for travel and incidental expenses arises apparently from &ldquo;increased usage of telecommunications equipment in these areas&rdquo;.  Why?  The Minister should say why without having to be asked. When the Minister wants more money he should say that the reasons are 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Where there has been either a miscalculation or an error it is appropriate that we should know whether action has been taken to ensure that the systems in place which gave rise to that capacity for miscalculation are now eradicated and that in future when we discuss Estimates for Departments they mean what they say and that Supplementary Estimates arise only in the case of policy decisions made by Governments or unforeseen circumstances where moneys might be necessary.  It should not arise in relation to current expenditure which was miscalculated significantly on the basis of the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the speech the Minister said: &ldquo;In addition arrears of charges totalling £170,000 in the A5 Subhead relating to 1986 became due for payment in 1987.&rdquo;  Was that estimated for and provided for initially?  If not why not?  Are we to take it that, despite the fact that changes are due in a Department, they are not often costed into the Estimate because it is next year's worry?</P>
    <P>We must become serious about this kind of exercise and not cod ourselves and the public.  There is not a line of justification in anything the Minister has submitted here today.  He does not explain how even one of these increases is necessary except in regard to moneys for <Col N="1967" /> insurance when he said he decided it was prudent.  Fair play to him, that is his prerogative and he is entitled to our support on it, but the other cases do not arise from actions of the Minister.  They arise from action from the public service and it is not good enough for anybody in the public service to assume that an open cheque book will be presented to the Dáil and we will all be co-signatories in future. I want to put down a marker on behalf of my party.  That will not be the philosophy we will be applying in future. Unless there are very strong reasons for it, we will want to know how the initial Estimate was wrong, why it was wrong, what is being done about it and how the people who made that miscalculation are being held accountable.  The rest of us cannot simply spend, spend, spend and expect somebody else to pay the bills, which is essentially what has happened in this country over the past five or ten years.</P>

      <P>I thank you for your guidance and I am sure your very wise ruling will not restrict some passing reference to aspects of the Transport Estimate which deserve an airing.  I would not wish to deprive the House of hearing the Minister's eloquent reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>While I observe that there is no provision in this Estimate for the B &amp; I, I regard the Minister's silence on this subject as ominous.  I would have thought, given the developments in the B &amp; I, that the Minister would have taken this opportunity to speak on this subject and to take the House into his confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister, the Deputy will appreciate that even Ministers can be ruled out <Col N="1968" /> of order.  Unless he got special permission from the Ceann Comhairle he would not have the opportunity to speak on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  I do not wish to waste my time contesting rulings of the Chair, but I hope the Minister takes advantage of his right of reply to say something about the B &amp; I.  I welcome the agreement of the marine officers.  I hope this will be a significant turning point for the B &amp; I and that, like the other transport companies, they will now head for profit because this is the last company to be turned around.  It is only right that we should recognise the efforts made by the Minister, the chairman, board and management of the B &amp; I and the unions who played a very constructive role.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provisions suggested for the Air Navigation Services Office, I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister.  Aviation is one of our growth industries.  This sector is growing because, I hope, of the very wise and adventurous moves taken in the past few years in the Department of Transport, over which I had the honour to preside. I am very glad the present Minister is pursuing and expanding those policies.  I also welcome, as he does, the developments at the European Council of Transport Ministers meeting last Monday.  The provision for the Air Navigation Services Office is all the more urgent because of the growth in the aviation sector.  More growth is possible and desirable, but the size of that growth will be dictated to a large degree by the Minister's judgment, by his openness and his willingness to change.  I strongly encourage his willingness to that change not just in the number of routes granted to Irish airlines, or the fifth freedom rights sought and won, but in the manner of licensing airlines, and the future operations of Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an adventurous approach to the future of Aer Lingus but they need large capital sums to replenish their fleet.  It will require legislation to privatise, or to part privatise, Aer <Col N="1969" /> Lingus, or perhaps there are other ways of doing it, such as joint venture operations. There are many people at home and abroad who would be very interested in participating in joint ventures with Aer Lingus and ensuring the maximum growth for Irish aviation in the opening markets of Europe.  Because of this growth I welcome the provision made in this Estimate in relation to the insurance taken out by the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>
    <P>If we could develop every sector the way we are developing the aviation sector, we would be well on the way to solving this country's problems.  We have a very exciting package already decided for the shipping sector.  I know this is largely the responsibility of another Minister &mdash; it was the responsibility of the Department of Communications when I was there &mdash; but I see great potential for the expansion of the shipping sector because of the package which was put in place by myself and continued by the present Minister for the Marine.  That is what Ministers should be doing &mdash; developing the sectors for which they are responsible and increasing employment where they can.  I do not think there is nearly enough of this.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that these developments took place in the past five years when the budget for the Department of Communications was being cut more than any other Department.  There were no riots or protests in the streets because these cuts were introduced prudently and intelligently.  As I said, this sector has had more cuts than any other but services have not diminished, they have increased.  That is the model for what should be done elsewhere in the public sector.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for pursuing the policies initiated in my time and which he is now expanding.  It is only right that I should say a few words of congratulation and encouragement to the officials of the Department who were very often the authors of many ideas which led to this expansion.</P>
    <P>There is another area I want to mention very briefly, that is, the road transport <Col N="1970" /> and distribution area.  This is another area of great potential expansion.  As we head towards 1992 &mdash; what has been referred to in the Council and Commission in Brussels as the Holy Year, the year when all things will be equal on the internal market &mdash; there will be a great opening up in this area and there will be great opportunities for Irish transport.  I want to make a few suggestions to the Minister, some of which I had hoped to pursue to maturity, and I hope the Minister will pursue them with the same, if not more, vigour.</P>
    <P>If Irish transport is to seize the opportunities for expansion in the opening markets of Europe they will have to be put on a competitive basis by 1992.  At the moment they are at a competitive disadvantage of perhaps as much as 20 per cent against United Kingdom operators. If we add that to the cost of getting to the main markets of Europe, they are at a severe disadvantage.  This means we have to look at our VAT on lorries, fuel costs, road tax and insurance costs, and, of course, we have to look at the state of our roads.  I hope the Minister and the transport operators are trying to persuade the Minister for Finance to do something for them in the next budget. The coming budget should be the first step in the right direction so that in 1992 our transport industry will be at least on the same cost structure as the United Kingdom.  Otherwise they will lose a great opportunity and it will be the Northern Ireland and British hauliers who will seize the opportunity for growth in the distribution market in Europe which is opening up because of the transportation plans in keeping with the internal market objective.  We have a problem of getting to the market-place.  If there are rough seas or a strike they cause great difficulties so the reliability and distance from the market is not as good as if we were on the mainland of Europe, which is a huge disadvantage for distributors.</P>
    <P>The Minister should urgently consider the idea of setting up an Irish distribution centre on the mainland of Europe, in France, Belgium or the Netherlands.  I envisage a major depot with warehouse <Col N="1971" /> facilities for Irish industries, including cold storage, offices and even a hostel for drivers.  It could be used as a base for onward ferrying of Irish goods so that their distribution would not be obstructed by bad weather or strikes.  We could guarantee the delivery of our goods on time and at a good price.  It would be a major opportunity for employing Irish drivers in such a centre, perhaps they could arrange to work one or two weeks on and off.  Ideally, such a depot would have an airstrip or be near an airport.</P>

I strongly urge the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Taylor-Quinn, Keating and Mitchell for their contributions.  I wish to give a number of reassurances.  There is no risk whatever connected with the services being provided at Ballygirreen nor, for that matter, at Malin Head.  I wish to state that strongly lest anybody gets the idea from the remarks made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn that there is such a danger or risk. We pay for the services at Malin Head and we are refunded from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn also referred to Aer Rianta and the recent MoscowWashington talks.  I had the opportunity of signing a contract with Minister Volkoff in Moscow which is bringing substantial benefits to the country.  I discussed with him and his deputy the potential development of Aer Rianta services, including the one mentioned by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, of providing duty-free shop facilities at USSR airports.  I <Col N="1972" /> understand that discussions are continuing and I should not like to be pessimistic about them.  The implication of Deputy Taylor-Quinn's remarks was that somehow or other the GorbachevReagan meeting put those initiatives in danger.  I hope she is wrong, I would not like to be defeatist about it.  The experience of Shannon in her own constituency in its dealings with the USSR has been happy and to the advantage of Shannon and the country generally.</P>
    <P>I full accept her point that the weakening dollar has a strong impact on tourism business from the United States to Ireland.  In the year when the punt and dollar were at par &mdash; at one stage the dollar was even stronger than the punt &mdash; there was a huge increase in visitors from the United States.  The deduction is obvious; the weaker our punt is <i>vis-á-vis</i> the dollar the better the opportunity for developing tourism to the country.  The tourism sector of my Department and Bord Fáilte are fully aware of this and whatever steps can be taken in the circumstances will be taken.  I do not want to expand on that because my time is limited but I have already put a number of things in place which should help in this regard, including a very liberal charter policy which I announced quite recently.</P>
    <P>The next major point made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn was about the transfer of tourist functions to SFADCo at Shannon. I understand that that transfer is taking place smoothly, that there will be no injustice to anyone involved in it and, above all, that there will be no discrimination against any facility or provider of facilities in that area.  I assure the Deputy that that is the philosophy which was outlined to me by SFADCo when dealing with this.  I know the Deputy mentioned a number of facilities where there might be rivalry but I do not think there will be any discrimination in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating raised a philosophic point at the outset of his speech.  It is fair to say that the House had the opportunity to debate the Estimate in full earlier and that was the proper occasion for dealing with it in philosophic terms, to use the <Col N="1973" /> Deputy's word.  He put forward the proposition that we should be addressing ourselves to the problem of a mixture of private and public transport.  I am on record in the House as saying that my Department are examining minutely the 1932 Act which is out of date and upon which the whole transport scene is based. We will have proposals arising out of that examination in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The social role of CIE is well accepted and one could advance the argument that it is also costed from the time when the State subvention was paid above the line. I agree with the Deputy that a close examination of the individual parts of that subvention is important and that it is the business of this House.</P>
    <P>I served on the Committee on Public Expenditure with Deputy Keating as chairman and I understand quite clearly what he was talking about in that regard. He made an inquiry about insurance.  We invited tenders and the insurance was placed with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  With regard to the carryover system, it is not sloppy accounting or carelessness.  Under existing arrangements &mdash; I am talking about subhead A.5 &mdash; payments of £60,000 on account are made quarterly to Telecom Éireann in <Col N="1974" /> respect of the provision of engineering services at State airports and other outstations. Any outstanding charges over and above the payments on account are settled in the following year.  The Telecom Éireann charges for 1985, and 1986 were £321,366 and £300,807.78 respectively. The payments on account in both instances were £240,000, leaving a balance to be paid of £81,366 and £60,807.78.  It is a system of payment.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with Deputy Mitchell on the importance of ANSO &mdash; Air Navigation Services Offices &mdash; in that there is a magnificent and pleasing growth in air transport.  He was partly responsible for that and I pay him that tribute. I hope to do even better than he did.  I know that great opportunities will arise in 1992 when the free market comes into effect in Europe.  I will keep his comments in mind in regard to ameliorating the position of our own hauliers and equipping them better for competition in the future.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 December 1987.</P>
