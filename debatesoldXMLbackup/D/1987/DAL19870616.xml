    <P>(2)  I gcás iarratasóra ar dheontas i leith tí nua i gceantar Gaeltachta atá lasmuigh de na limistéirí a shonraítear in Orduithe na Limistéar Gaeltachta, 1956-1982, ní mór an Roinn a shásamh go bhfuil cónaí ar an iarratasóir sin i sean teach atá neamhoiriúnach ar fad chun cóiríocht cheart shláintiúil a thabhairt dó féin agus dá chúram agus go mbeadh i gceist an teach nua a thógáil in ionad an tseantí sin.</P>

      <P>An bhféadfainn a iarraidh ar an Aire an bhfuil deontais níos airde ar fáil ar na hoileáin atá sa Ghaeltacht ná na deontais atá ar fáil sna hoileáin nach bhfuil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus an bhfuil sé riachtanach ar na hoileáin go mbeadh conraitheoir cláraithe i gceist sula n-íocfaí deontas agus an bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire nach bhfuil conraitheoirí cláraithe ar fáil sna hoileáin seo agus dá bharr sin níl a lán daoine in ann tairbhe a bhaint as na deontais sin?</P>

      <P>Tá 50 faoin gcéad sa bhreis ar dheontais do dhaoine atá in a gcónaí ar oileáin Ghaeltachta agus tá an deontas sin níos airde ná an deontas atá le fáil ar oileáin Ghaeltachta iad.  Tuigim an cheist a chuir an Teachta faoi chonraitheoirí.  Tá deacracht maidir le conraitheoirí ar na hoileáin agus tá an rud sin á mheas i láthair na huaire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is dócha go dtuigeann an Teachta go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag muintir na n-oileán le fearaistí agus ábhair tí a thabhairt isteach nuair a bhíonn teach á thógáil, go mbíonn costais níos mó orthu.  Sin an fáth gur cuireadh an deontas 50 faoin gcéad sa bhreis ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán, agus tá an riail sin ann le fada an lá, sílim o 1977.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta, níl na deontais chéanna le fáil ar oileáin nach oileáin Ghaeltachta iad.</P>

      <P>Má ghlacann an tAire go bhfuil costais sa bhreis ar oileáin agus go bhfuil gá le 50 faoin gcéad méadú ar an deontais, an bhfuil sé féaráilte an deighilt a dhéanamh agus an 50 faoin gcéad a dhiúltú dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí ar oileáin nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht?  Nach bhfuil sé in am anois na deontais chéanna a bheith ar fáil dóibh siúd atá in a gcónaí ar oileáin is cuma sa Ghaeltacht nó taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht iad.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the plans, if any, there are to encourage the calling of an international peace conference on the Middle East, particularly to find a solution to the Palestinian problem, if the Government will sponsor or support such a proposal at the United Nations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve meeting in Brussels on 23 February of this year, in the European Political Co-operation framework, declared their support for an international peace conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development. Ireland together with the other members of the Twelve, made clear their readiness to play their part with respect to such a conference and to make an active contribution both through the Presidency and individually to bringing the positions of the parties concerned closer to one another with a view to such a conference being convened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether the Irish representatives at the United Nations have taken any initiatives on this matter?  Will he further indicate the Government's willingness to insist that any such peace conference should include the acknowledged representatives of the Palestinian people, namely, the PLO?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present this is being pursued under the aegis of the Twelve. Discussions have taken place with the PLO and all the other countries involved. The United Nations believe that is the best way to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our approach has always been to adopt the Community attitude on this matter.  The Community, through the Presidency and individually, have had meetings with the PLO and Israel.  The Deputy can be assured that direct contact <Col N="1846" /> of the kind I have mentioned is maintained between the Presidency and all the countries involved.  There are countries outside the Community involved &mdash; Syria, Egypt and so on &mdash; who are immediately concerned as well as the PLO, the North African countries and Israel.  It is a complex matter but the objective is to secure a conference of the kind I mentioned at which all parties can be represented.  Side conferences can also take place so that everybody is fully apprised of this initiative which is favoured by the United Nations and other powers outside the Community and those immediately concerned in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that the European Community had engaged in discussions with the PLO about representation at this international conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community had their own discussions with the PLO and with all the other countries in the area to which I referred.  Naturally, this is a delicate, sensitive and diplomatic process which is being carried out under the Belgian Presidency and which will be carried on under the Danish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not new.  As a former representative of the Government in political co-operation, I distinctly remember such discussions taking place seven or eight years ago when the Venice Declaration recognised the rights of the PLO in regard to a Palestinian homeland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> These diplomatic discussions are continuing at present and, as I said, are complex and delicate.  I hope they will lead to an international conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the PLO are not represented at the conference, will there be a conference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just a simplistic conference.  Discussions are going on at present and there are no arrangements for a conference to take place.  So far, there has been a series of diplomatic exchanges between all the interests involved with a view to establishing a conference.  The question of representation at the conference and its formalisation has not arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not true that the five members of the Security Council have agreed to the conference and that Israel have said they will not be at the conference if the PLO are officially represented, has a formula been worked out whereby there would be Palestinian representation which did not involve the PLO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not deter continuing discussions as to who should represent the Palestinian interests, whether it should be the PLO or another Arab country.  Israel is also regularly contacted with a view to doing something in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Acknowledging the extremely complex nature of the Middle East problem, does the Minister agree that a peace conference which did not have the representatives of all parties in the conflict would not be able to achieve very much?  It is essential that parties to the conflict are present at a conference of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1848" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of black and white simplistic speculation that should not be raised at this stage in regard to any sensitive dealings in relation to this matter.  Discussions are taking place with all the parties concerned and arrangements can be made to have many different views heard at the conference, side conferences or through representatives of one group or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos.  5, 8, 34 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>International law permits coastal States to extend their territorial sea to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles from baselines.  I refer the Deputies to my reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy John Kelly on 24 March 1987 in which I set out the position of this country in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House at that time, the views of the Government regarding their legislation extending their territorial sea were conveyed to the British and it was made clear that the Government would not accept any action which affected Irish interests.  The British in their response relied on their rights under international law to extend their territorial sea to 12 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from our claim to jurisdiction, international law recognises a right to unimpeded passage for all vessels through straits and this law must apply also in the area between Northern Ireland and Scotland.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take any further steps in the matter at present, but should the British authorities take any action which does not conform with international law and which affects any Irish interest or the interest of its citizens the Government will immediately take the matter up with the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a court action.  It was an arbitration between Britain and Ireland and other countries which indicated their interest in joining the arbitration to seek their rights, namely, Iceland and Denmark with its Faroese interests.  It was an international arbitration, not a court action.</P>

I also have instructed my Department to propose legislation which I hope to have in the House in the next session in which we will claim our rights to the 12-mile territorial sea which the British have also claimed.

      <P>The arbitration at the moment is between only Britain and Ireland.  Any discussions are between those two nations.  Ireland cannot stop the Danes and the Icelanders from pursuing claims which we, of course, reject absolutely.  There is no question about that.  Under international law they are entitled to be joined into arbitration; that is their right.  We reject any claim that they have in the area mentioned.  This does apply to the North Atlantic area on which they are seeking to establish rights.</P>

      <P>No objections to joint accreditation on the basis of economic cost.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  7 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Since the invasion of Afghanistan Ireland has consistently supported resolutions adopted each year on the situation in that country at the UN General Assembly.  Likewise we have repeatedly expressed there and elsewhere our concerns on this issue in national and Community statements and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>We welcome and support the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary General and believe that any solution must be based on the principles set out in successive UN resolutions.  These principles include withdrawal of Soviet troops, the right of the Afghan people to self-determination and the voluntary return in safety and honour of the refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their statements of 16 March 1987 the 12 member states of the European Community reiterated their support for the UN Secretary General's efforts in the wake of the latest round of indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Geneva.  They expressed the strong hope that, during the next round of talks, these negotiations will result in satisfactory agreement involving the rapid and total withdrawal of Soviet troops on the basis of an irrevocable timetable.  In the Twelve's view, such a withdrawal represents the essential precondition if this conflict is to end and if the Afghan people are to <Col N="1858" /> be able to exercise their right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>I am aware from the report of the special rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights to the UN General Assembly last year that he was told that some Afghan children are sent to the Soviet Union for a short period of time and thereafter used as spies.  One 16 year old boy informed the special rapporteur that he had been sent to the Soviet Union against his will, trained for two months in espionage and forced to collect information on the activities of Afghan opposition movements based in Pakistan.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about these accounts.  Ireland has manifested its concern about human rights in Afghanistan by co-sponsoring resolutions adopted on the matter at the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly.  At the UN Commission on Human Rights earlier this year we also supported the extension of the mandate of the special rapporteur for one year and the request that he report to the UN General Assembly later this year on the human rights situation.</P>

      <P>Because of our unique position so far as neutrality is concerned is the Minister prepared to advise the Government that we should actually sponsor such a motion because, coming from us, it would have a far greater impact than if it came from the militarily aligned countries of the EC.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly consider it but, the whole purpose of Title III of the Single European Act is to ensure that there is scope for political co-operation in the sphere of foreign affairs. This is precisely what we mean by &ldquo;political co-operation&rdquo; in areas like Afghanistan, South Africa, the Middle East and Central America.  Where there is a common European attitude in relation to any of these areas we try to co-operate as a member of the Community in the area of political co-operation.  There is no need for any argument or debate about this because this is the way it functions.</P>

      <P>Because of the oppression and tyranny in Afghanistan and the lack of information emanating from that country, there is a belief that the matter has been forgotten.  That country has been occupied for ten years, I think, and it is important that our protest is kept alive and heard by other countries. Would the Minister consider putting a motion before the United Nations condemning the Russian occupation of that country and asking that it be ended?  I appreciate the point the Minister made about the Single European Act and our political co-operation within the Community. Nevertheless, we have always maintained that we have the right as an individual State to make our protest and I am asking the Minister to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

We will co-operate and take a lead in sponsoring any such resolution and this has been done already through the area of European <Col N="1860" /> political co-operation.  That does not stop us taking our own initiative as a country within the United Nations framework.  I will follow up the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <P>The trust was granted £18,000 by my Department in 1986.  This grant was made from Subhead I of the Department's vote which provides moneys for the promotion of peace and reconciliation in Ireland and for Anglo-Irish co-operation.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Government published the following material on the Single European Act with a view to providing the information necessary for the national debate preparatory to the referendum:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a detailed information booklet in which the full text of the Single European Act was included.  Twenty thousand copies of this booklet were ordered;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a brief guide which summarised the provisions of the Single European Act of which 50,000 copies were printed;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a series of eight explanatory leaflets in which key questions about various aspects of the Single European Act were addressed.  The total quantity of leaflets printed was 9,600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it nine million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This relates to the various leaflets, not to the basic document. These were very small leaflets about various aspects.  Through this approach, the Government sought to anticipate and respond to the various concerns and information requirements of the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> The total net cost of producing the foregoing material is estimated at £1,000,730 of which £1,000,719 is in respect of the brief guide and the explanatory leaflets and £6,500 is in respect of the information booklet.  The total net cost of media advertising taken by the Government in connection with the referendum was £164,263.96.</P>
    <P>The criterion which governed the award of the contracts to print these publications was the need to ensure that they were made available to the public within the shortest period possible.  On this basis, the contract for printing the brief guide and the explanatory leaflets and other material was awarded to Irish Printers Limited.  In the case of the information booklet, which was a revised and updated booklet similar in nature and scope to the explanatory guide to the Single European Act issued in November 1986, it was decided, also with a view to minimising the delay in production, to award the contract to the firm that printed the explanatory guide, namely, Cahill Printers Limited.  For this reason, tenders were not sought.</P>
    <P>In making this information available, the Government naturally considered that it was in the public interest that the people should be aware of the Government's conviction that it was in Ireland's interest that we should ratify the Single European Act.  The Government felt that, given their role as the executive organ of the State in connection with its external relations, they had an important contribution to make to informed public debate on the Single European Act.  They considered that they would be failing in their duty if they were to neglect to use all the means at their disposal including press advertising to draw to the attention of the people the implications of the decision they were called on to make. The Government were, accordingly, concerned to explain the reasons they considered that the Single European Act was in Ireland's best interests and why they were asking the electorate to approve the amendment to the constitution which <Col N="1864" /> would permit Ireland to ratify the Single European Act.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on acquiring responsibility for the Government Information Service in respect of which this question was asked. Does the Minister accept that much of the material produced by the GIS presented only one side of the case, that of the yes vote and that for that reason it was more a propaganda exercise than an information exercise?  Is it normal to give out printing work to the value of £1.7 million without offering it to tender?  How much of the material produced is still in the hands of the GIS?  How many of the 9 million leaflets were distributed?  How many of the 50,000 guides and how many of the 20,000 leaflets were distributed?</P>

      <P>They were made available to all political parties who were interested in ensuring that the referendum was successful.

      <P>All of this secured a distribution of this literature and none of it is left at base.  These were the small leaflets on specific issues within the overall guide.  I am sure the Deputy saw them. They were not costly, they were two page leaflets.  They were distributed on an information basis.  If the Deputy puts down another question I can give the figures for the accession of Ireland in 1972, when a similar rate of expenditure was organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the community, on behalf of the silent majority in the community and distributed to all of the political parties interested in securing our membership of the Community at that time.  There is no difference between then and now in relation to the literature published. Any impartial reader of this literature will see how impartial are the terms <Col N="1865" /> of the advice being given to the people having regard to the fact that we were asking the people to vote yes for the most rational reasons possible.</P>

      <P>In view of the large expenditure involved and in view of the Minister's Department's ability to recognise the silent majority, was it not extraordinary that no literature could be published in the Irish language?  Is it not curious that the booklet did not quote clause 3 in relation to European political co-operation, but an abridged and entirely tendentious version of EPC?</P>

What was done officially stands above reproach with regard to its independence of declaration in regard to the position.  We set out the official position as fairly as possible on the basis that the official position was that in Ireland's interests we should vote yes.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that quite clearly.  It was the view of the Government, as distinct from political parties, that on the balance of the argument we should vote yes and that people should ratify the Single European Act.  We had the same view at the time of the Treaty of Accession.  It was our duty to give the Government's view and to put out rational reasons that the people should vote yes and ratify the Single European Act.  We would have been failing in our duty as a Government if we did not do that and it was quite open to everybody who advocated otherwise to use the airwaves and the media, which they did, to advocate the other case.  The Government would have been guilty of the gravest dereliction of duty if they allowed the complete case against ratification of the Single European Act to be presented to the public without the Government making their view known.  The Government made their view known and as I said, distributed their publications to the various people, parties and groups in our society who were interested in supporting the Government's case.  That was not a partisan Fianna Fáil attitude, it was strictly a Government doing their duty.</P>

      <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment, with your permission, Sir, about three weeks ago the Minister said that he was, with other security forces, investigating the reports <Col N="1869" /> and that he would let the House know the outcome.  I think I am quoting him correctly.  Why the change of attitude now?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's anxiety in having raised that matter on the Adjournemnt.  He will correct me if I am wrong, but on that occasion he raised the matter on foot of an article by David McKittrick which appeared in the London newspaper, <i>The Independent.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The article was wrongly based.  We investigated the facts alleged in his article and the basis of it and it did not measure up.  That is in relation just to his article.  At the same time I share the Deputy's concern about this matter. It is being looked at on an ongoing security basis with other countries who are concerned also, but the allegations made in the article were not sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that the allegation that the Libyan Government were supplying explosives, whether they be newfangled explosives or whatever their origin, to the IRA was without foundation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We found on full investigation that the allegation of 14 May that a particular type of explosive, a Semtex explosive, manufactured in Eastern Europe was supplied to the IRA, was without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the type of explosive.  I would not know one from another.  I am asking about any explosive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are examining on a broader basis in regard to other allegations such as allegations made here by the Deputy and more in other countries, too.  All I am saying is that the allegation which formed the basis <Col N="1870" /> of the Deputy's question on the Adjournment was found to be without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the entire article was not without foundation?  The Minister has admitted this when he said that investigations or other aspects are still going on.  If that is so what does he propose to do about it?  It is most serious when a government who profess to be friendly towards this country supply some kind of explosive to an organisation whose aims are to bring down the Government of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, but I gather from his original reply that the thrust of the article was correct because, he says, an investigation is still going on with other countries.  If that is so the Minister has an obligation to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, every country has an obligation with regard to maintaining its own resources, but that does not run one into the trap of blaming particular countries for everything that happens or setting up particular countries as a whipping boy in given situations.  I do not feel that is our business.  We can have good relations with a wide spectrum of countries.  Certainly we will not act unless there is proof that such countries are behaving in a way that is damaging to the security of this country.  That is the aspect <Col N="1871" /> we will continue to monitor closely and keep examining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;whipping boy&rdquo;.  Will he not agree the Leader of Libya on a number of occasions declared his intentions to support an illegal organisation in this country and that senior officials of his have done likewise?  Will he not agree that there is, therefore, no question of us setting him up as a whipping boy, that he is a self-acknowledged supporter of the Provisional IRA?</P>

This specific allegation made in <i>The Independent</i> of London and repeated here by Deputy Barry, was proved to be without foundation.  That is all I am saying.</P>

Another one I had down you ruled out of order, Sir, because a similar question had been asked on 24 March last.  In relation to Questions Nos. 59, 34 and 4 similar questions were asked on 24 March last, yet they are on the Order Paper but mine is not.  I draw it to your attention, Sir.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Minister's reply to Question No. 41, was the allegation made on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme incorrect, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark said that for the first time an Irish Minister had allowed a discussion on defence matters to take place in EPC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs does not agree that that is specifically what he said. However, that is another day's work.  I am not here to defend the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As the Deputy is well aware, in any formal meetings on European Political Co-operation defence and military matters are not raised.  If the debate on European Political Co-operation tends to move into that area, the Irish Foreign Minister, or indeed often the Danish Foreign Minister, raises an objection to it.  This does not at all prevent &mdash; at informal meetings which the former Minister will have attended also &mdash; informal conversations taking place between the Ministers of countries, <Col N="1873" /> members of NATO or the Western European Union, concerning their own matters. That takes place side-by-side, in an informal way.  We are not involved in those discussions.  I hope that puts it clearly, that at formal meetings these do not arise but in informal discussions between countries members of NATO or the WEU they can arise within an informal framework or setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept I appreciate that at informal gatherings of members any discussions can take place but the allegation was that at an EPC meeting the Irish Minister remained quiet while matters of defence were being discussed?  Whether or not that is so, would the Minister not consider it his duty to stop any discussion like that taking place at EPC meetings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 42 and Oral Question No. 20 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal of the Republic of Korea to establish a resident embassy in Dublin was considered in the light of Ireland's foreign policy interests and approved by Government on that basis.  There are no proposals for the opening of an Irish Embassy in Seoul to coincide with the holding of the 1988 Olympic Games in that city.  Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea in 1984, the Irish Ambassador in Tokyo has been concurrently accredited to the Republic of Korea.  No change in this arrangement is at present contemplated, for obvious financial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in this House last month, <Col N="1875" /> the principal criterion applied to proposals to establish diplomatic relations with other countries is the extent to which such moves can assist in the achievement of the State's foreign policy objectives in the political, economic, consular and other fields.  The availability of the financial and personnel resources necessary to implement a proposal is also an important factor.  While it would be inappropriate for me to engage in public speculation on proposals received from specific countries in relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations, I can say that when such a proposal is made the Government of the country concerned are always made aware, through normal diplomatic channels, of our position in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section of the Minister's reply which refers to my question, that is, that it is in the Irish interest that a South Korean Embassy be established in Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us exactly what is that interest.  Also, in view of the fact that the President of South Korea has suspended democratic reforms until after the Olympic Games in 1988, does the Minister not agree it is precipitous of the Minister's Department to go ahead and acknowledge the correctness of establishing such an embassy?  Is the Minister further aware that 13 Opposition leaders, including the Deputy Leader of the main Opposition party, are currently in jail in South Korea?  Furthermore, is he aware that 10,000 people were on the streets yesterday and that 60,000 members of the public have protested against the régime there?  What are the reasons for the establishment of an embassy from such a country of military dictatorship in Dublin?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, no country inquires into the nature of the political structure in another country with which it establishes diplomatic relations &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have diplomatic relations with the USSR, with Turkey. We have diplomatic relations with a number of countries throughout the world.  I might add that every country throughout the world has such diplomatic relations with countries with which it does not agree in terms of political philosophy. The reason for this precise decision is that the Industrial Development Authority have representatives in Seoul.  They have developed business investment interests here as a result of which substantial employment has recently been created in certain towns, notably in Sligo. Further investment can be expected to take place from that region of the Far East.  It was felt expedient that, when they requested it, they should have an embassy here.  We can extend the mandate of our Ambassador in Tokyo to Seoul to look after our interests there, in an expanding community in the economic sense, whatever about the Deputy's views in regard to the political structure of that State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that it is not my opinions on South Korea that are important but, for example, those of Cardinal Kim, the 13 Opposition leaders who are in jail, the 60,000 people who demonstrated this week and the 3,000 students who took refuge in a cathedral?  All of the policy considerations which we heard earlier are important in evaluating whether or not we should open embassies, not diplomatic relations.  We should consider the appropriateness of allowing an embassy to be opened in Dublin even though the President of that country has said he will not consider democratic reforms until after April 1988.  Am I to address my questions about when embassies will open in Dublin and in Ireland to the IDA and to ask them what are the criteria for investment decisions or when we might expect another one?</P>

      <P>The Deputy might also address a similar supplementary question to me in regard to a number of other countries throughout the world which I <Col N="1877" /> mentioned to the Deputy, with whom we have diplomatic relations and who have diplomatic relations here also.  The question of the political structure of a country with whom we may have diplomatic relations is a consideration, but it is not the primary consideration.  That applies to diplomacy in respect of every country throughout the world, ranging from Soviet Russia, Turkey, Iraq and right through the continent of Africa.  The Deputy is well aware of the countries with whom we have diplomatic relations and who have diplomatic relations with us and I am certain he would not share the ideology or the political structures of those countries.</P>

      <P>The Minister can correspond with me about my views about other countries but this priority question deals with South Korea.  Following the logic of the Minister's argument, is he satisfied that he can balance the human rights aspects, for example, the record which we have abroad and the political aspects?  Can he say if these can be happily overridden as he told this House in the light of an investment decision on the recommendation of the IDA?  Does this not represent a serious erosion of Irish foreign policy and a major diminution of our standing in relation to human rights all around the world?</P>

      <P>I have replied very adequately to this matter.

Freezing them in the cold will do nothing to moderate their attitude to <Col N="1878" /> human rights to which the Deputy alluded.

    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> The papers were kept in locked boxes in a strong room in the school.  The way in which the removal of the papers came about is under investigation at present by the Garda.  I am taking all steps necessary to preserve the integrity of the public examinations and to ensure that no candidate is at any advantage or disadvantage because of this occurrence.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister realises that this question has been put down with considerable concern for the situation which now exists, in that there are examination papers at large for examinations which have not been held.  There is a possibility, as the Minister is well aware, that these examination papers might be at present being photocopied and distributed across the country.  From the Minister's answer I can see the papers have not been recovered.  What steps has the Minister taken to preserve the integrity of the examinations?  Will she now announce alternative dates for these examinations without delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the parameters set for me I do not wish to prejudice the Garda inquiries which are at present under way and which are extremely active.  I am confident the inquiries will reveal matters which will offset the Deputy's fears.  These inquiries are at present nearing conclusion.  I cannot anticipate them, but we expect that the inquiries will yield fruit within a matter of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to a further point raised by the Deputy, I am confident that it will not be necessary to ask candidates to resit any of the papers which they have done.  I do not anticipate that it will be necessary for re-examinations to be held in the subjects affected, nor do I expect they will have to be postponed.  If any changes become necessary in the published timetable of the examinations an announcement will be made in good time. In the meantime, I suggest to the Deputy, <Col N="1880" /> to the House and to the public that candidates should get on with their examinations confident that the integrity of the examinations will be upheld.  I give that assurance to this House with confidence but I do not want to be premature about the Garda investigation on which, on coming into the House, I have had up-to-date information.  I am very confident that the results of their investigation will prove very fruitful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try, but the answer I received was very vague and it would be very difficult to conclude on that note. Will the Minister be more specific?  If it is discovered that in regard to the leaving certificate Irish papers &mdash; they are the ones that concern us most &mdash; there is a possibility that the higher level and lower level papers were missing, could have been photocopied and distributed, will the Minister announce very shortly a new paper and a new date for that examination?</P>

      <P>This occurrence took place in one school in County Clare where the papers were under the authority of the school management.  It is important to make it clear that this occurred in one school.  I should like to assure all Members representing as they do the electorate, who have an interest in the examinations that I am confident <Col N="1881" /> the investigation which is nearing completion will show that the measures suggested by the Deputy will not be necessary.  However, should they be necessary I will be willing to return to the House to discuss the matter.</P>

I rise simply to clarify one point in relation to that, that is, to put it beyond doubt that, in the event that a section is reached and is ready to be put to the question before the stated time, that question, being within the group of questions provided for within that time, can be put within the time.  In other words, if it appears that a section between sections 6 and 11 is ready to be put to the question between 4.45 p.m. and 7 p.m. the question will be put from the Chair during that time.</P>

      <P>It is also necessary to delete the words &ldquo;without debate&rdquo; in relation to the proposal to take this motion in the name of the Government Whip which has the effect of changing fundamentally the whole arrangements in relation to Private Members' Business. The House will recall that, as recently as November and December of last year, new Standing Orders were made and they were agreed by the House at that time. They were circulated to Members as a new bound volume and we saw them for the first time after the reassembly of the present Dáil towards the end of March. It is very ominous at this extremely early stage in this Dáil's lifetime that it should now be thought appropriate by the Government, in consort with the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, to do away with the various provisions and changes that were made at that time.</P>

      <P>It is very much a point of order because the Deputies on that wing <Col N="2000" /> of the House appear to be anticipating the Order of Business.  I can inform the House for the edification of Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues that the arrangements for Items Nos. 7 to 12 to be taken without debate have been agreed by my party on the basis that further provisions in relation to other committees of the House will be made immediately after the resumption of the Dáil after the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the third paragraph of the motion which is the one that was not agreed to first, as I understand it.  The second paragraph has now been agreed.  With regard to the first paragraph, it is the Taoiseach's prerogative to name the items on the Order Paper in the order in which they will be taken but beyond that it needs a motion and the agreement of the House. That is clear from Standing Order No. 25 which says:</P>
      <P>... The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from Standing Order No. 25 that the Taoiseach's only prerogative in this respect is to name the order in which the items will be taken.  He does not have any prerogative to enforce an announcement <Col N="2002" /> that items will be taken without debate, that they will stop at a particular time, or that they will be decided in a particular way by one question only.</P>
      <P>So far as the committees are concerned, I put down an amendment as soon as I could after I got this motion, which I got a short time ago, to delete the words in the third paragraph &ldquo;without debate and shall be decided by one question&rdquo;. It would then read: &ldquo;It is further proposed that Nos.  7 to 12, inclusive, shall be taken.&rdquo; This would enable Members to debate motions Nos.  7 to 12 to consider the terms in which the six committees are set up, to propose possible amendments to their terms of reference and, in particular, to allow Members the opportunity to put down further motions establishing further committees in respect of different matters which they thought appropriate, such as public expenditure, health, education, foreign affairs, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These are my main areas of opposition.  Fundamentally my opposition is this: this proposal to have a small number of committees is part and parcel of a broader scenario to try to confine as much as possible the business of this House and, in particular, to seek to achieve a situation in which only the two major parties will have a say in what the House debates, for how long, what committees will be set up, and things of that kind.  I find that objectionable.  This is the trend at present in this House, not just in matters coming before the House or that are prevented coming before the House, but also in wider matters.  For example, the debate which is going on in relation to changes in the electoral system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I am objecting to the Order of Business.  It is ludicrous to expect that the Order of Business as set out could be accepted by the smaller parties.  What is at stake here is fundamental.  This is only the tip of the iceberg in relation to the procedures which have been adopted by the Government Whip and the major Opposition Party Whip since the House assembled.  It is not in the best interest of democracy that the Whips of the two major parties, to the exclusion of the Whips of the other parties, should meet to agree business without any consultation with the Whips of the Labour Party or the other parties on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I bring it to your Notice, Sir, as the Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that what is proposed here today in relation to Private Members' Time is an attack on the rights of smaller parties.  I do not think it is good enough for the Government members of that committee to stand back from the debate because, despite the fact that they do not have a majority in this House, they have a large number of members on that committee and they also have a responsibility to ensure that democracy prevails.</P>
      <P>We are objecting to the Order of Business. I shall try to stay within your restrictions and save you from raising you hand to me any further today, but I have to stress that it is not in the best interests of the House that the Order of Business before us should be accepted by us.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I also oppose the Order of Business for a number of reasons but specifically because of the schedule of business for the Finance Bill.  The Committee Stage of that Bill is to be dealt with in less than one and a half days.  It is now 4.15 p.m. and there are only 30 minutes available to deal with the PAYE sector in the Finance Bill &mdash; sections 1 to <Col N="2004" /> 5.  Once again the PAYE sector is treated like dirt.  I object to the procedure of dividing the debate as is being done here. I am amazed any so-called Opposition leader would agree to this procedure where it would be almost impossible for a vote to be called on any amendment because this gives the Minister almost total control over the debate.</P>

I ask you to rule in particular in relation to the amendment tabled by the Minister for Finance which apparently even he cannot move.  I ask you, or the Taoiseach, if there is any prospect of giving some time, even an hour, to debate the first five sections of the Finance Bill which deal with farm tax, retention tax, the basic rate of taxation.  All are scrubbed in the most appalling manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, Sir, it is an unusual privilege in this House to be allowed to move an amendment, or to speak on it.  This amendment, comes long after many of the major provisions in the Bill which have been just walked past because of the guillotine system which has been put into operation here today by the Government, with the full agreement and, indeed, encouragement of the Fine Gael Party.  This has prevented these important matters being discussed at all. This amendment in my name and that of Deputy McDowell is for the purpose of re-activating section 7 of the Finance Act of 1979 which was allowed to lapse some years ago.</P>
      <P>The object of section 7 of that Finance Act was to allow a taxpayer, against his tax, a certain amount on the labour content of work which he did on his own residence.  The purpose of that was to encourage building activities without any cost to the State because grants were specifically excluded and could not be taken into account in evaluating the work which was done.  When this was introduced in 1979 the amount allowed was an amount not exceeding £450 in excess of the first £50 which was disallowed.  I propose in this amendment to reactivate the section to increase the figure of £450 in 1979 to £900 which eight years later in real terms is roughly about the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other difference from the 1979 section, that is, that it is necessary now to include a provision for a married couple.  The 1979 section was enacted before the decision in the Murphy case and it would not be allowed to stand as it is.  A double amount has to be given to a married couple.  While the <Col N="2049" /> basic figure of £900 corresponds in real terms to the figure of £450 in the 1979 section the amount which should be allowed for a married couple is £1,800. This is in accordance with the normal way in which tax provisions for married people are drawn at present so as not to differentiate against them or give them any advantage vis-a-vis single people.</P>
    <P>It is thought necessary by the Government in 1979 to introduce this provision in order to encourage the building industry at no cost to the State.  If that was thought necessary in 1979, how much more necessary is it now?  The building industry is in an appalling state and reeling under the effects of the budget of 31 March last.  This provision will not do a great deal for the building industry.  If it generates perhaps £10 million to £20 million worth of work in a year that would not otherwise have been available that will be the outside of it.  Therefore, I do not claim that it will work wonders. However, taken in conjunction with another amendment to reactivate section 23 in so far as designated inner city areas are concerned, it would be a help to an industry that is not just in trouble but is literally devastated.  Many long established building companies have closed down and the chance of getting any worth-while work is negligible at the moment because of the lack of activity.</P>
    <P>There is no question of any State money being put up by definition.  This is confined to the expenditure of private money.  Whatever benefit in terms of his personal income tax a taxpayer who is prepared to undertake this work on his house may get so far as the State is concerned it is more than off-set by gains in revenue from additional legitimate employment, increases in PAYE and PRSI contributions, increased VAT revenue and corporation tax revenue on the profits of the companies who are involved in the work.  Therefore, the State is a net winner by a significant amount.  It does not cost the State anything in terms of having to put up any money to prime this activity because, by definition, it is all private money.</P>
    <P>This section is confined to contractors <Col N="2050" /> who are tax registered.  Under the 1979 section you do not get the benefit of this unless you can show that you have expended the money with a contractor who is registered for tax purposes with the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, accountable for and paying his tax. If he were not, the Revenue Commissioners would withdraw his certificate. It will help to some extent to keep down some of the black economy firms which are proliferating at the moment, particularly as a result of the decisions of 31 March last and the manner in which they were taken.  It will help to keep some legitimate businesses in operation. Many companies have gone out of business over the past few years and, in particular, over the past few months.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new or revolutionary about this amendment.  It is simply a proposal to reactivate something that was there and that worked very well.  It was thought feasible to allow this provision to drop in the early eighties when much higher grants for building were brought in.  It was not thought necessary to have this section in order to encourage work on private houses.  Now that almost all grants have been removed, with one relatively minor exception, and since there is no incentive from the State to do work on one's house since the home improvement grants are gone in their entirety, it is essential to bring back something like this.</P>
    <P>This accords with the philosophy of this party which is to encourage people to help themselves rather than going to the State for hand-outs.  This encourages people to work in partnership with the State and to carry out work they are prepared to undertake themselves is an excellent example of it.  The needs of the industry and the need for people to repair their houses is much greater now than it was in 1979 since no grant of any description is available to them.  The beauty of this is that it can be done without any public money having to be put up.  It is a simple reactivation of a section which is no longer in force.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, under this section as redrafted, to have it for three years; this <Col N="2051" /> year, next year and the year after.  It could be looked at again at the end of the three year period.  It does not in real terms increase the amount of the allowance that was available in 1979 because in real terms it is roughly the same.  It gives a higher allowance to married couples.  I am not saying that the 1979 Act was wrong in this respect but, because of the Murphy judgment, it is necessary to make distinctions of that kind in tax legislation. Nobody in the House could reasonably object to this amendment and I look to the House to enact it speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must first dispose of the section.  I thought you were going to speak on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I intend to speak on amendment No. 14 and I accept your ruling.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 is going back to something which was the practice in 1979 when Deputy O'Malley, the late Deputy Colley and former Deputy O'Donoghue were the main economic Ministers.  I would be disposed to support this amendment if it confined itself to extensions to houses in respect of persons who did not have home improvement grants.  The amendment, as drafted, will give three distinct benefits to the same people.  Since it is confined to extensions to one's primary residence people will be able to avail of mortgage interest relief.  I will say something further about mortgage interest relief very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it would have the benefit of the home improvement grant.  While it is true that the home improvement grant scheme has been abolished, it is not true to suggest that nobody will get home improvement grants because thousands of people have had grants sanctioned for extensions such as would be covered by this amendment.  Then there would be the effect of this for a married couple <Col N="2052" /> where the maximum of £1,800 as a labour content of work on an extension could be claimed for income tax purposes.  On the one hand, one would have mortgage interest relief at 58 per cent, then one would have a further £1,800 as labour content at 58 per cent and on top of that several thousand pounds of a grant.  That is overdoing it a bit.  Those people do not need three benefits and I doubt if it would do a lot for the building industry which is already devastated and which has lost confidence.</P>
    <P>Because of certain things that were said by Fianna Fáil such as that they would pump in £200 million, the building industry had confidence.  In the event, the capital budget was cut by about £80 million. Because of things that were said before the election, the building industry thought Fianna Fáil would reduce the VAT rate to 5 per cent from 10 per cent and that the whole plethora of home improvement grants which we brought in would be maintained.  The building industry is now devastated economically and in terms of confidence.  The professionals involved in that industry are deeply depressed by the implications of the withholding tax for the industry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in putting down this amendment the Progressive Democrats Party have pinpointed an area which needs some kind of boost.  However, this is the wrong boost because it applies a triple benefit to the extent that people would actually gain money out of building an extension, and rather than a pumppriming exercise, which would encourage people to invest some of their own money, the net effect would be that not alone would it be State money only but there would be money left over on account of the triple benefit.  Secondly, it is iniquitous for taxpayers because somebody on high marginal rates would get the benefit at 58 per cent, somebody on the standard rate would get the benefit at 35 per cent and somebody with a large family who is below the tax margins would get nothing at all.</P>
    <P>On the point of the registered builder, the provision in this case was welcomed when it was introduced initially because <Col N="2053" /> it was the first attempt to bring the black economy into the white economy.  It was the first tentative step but it did not work very well.  It did not generate much activity.  When the scheme was abolished it was at a cost of something like £12 million.  Many steps have been taken subsequently. In the home improvement grant system certification applied only to registered builders.  There is a system of certification operating now for anybody who has a public sector contract of any sort or for anybody involved in an area of the building industry to which State benefit accrues.  At least theoretically they are certified as being in the white economy and are, consequently, taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The case has not been made for this amendment.  With the disorganised way in which the debate has proceeded, I presume we will not get the opportunity to vote on this amendment on its own, and when we take the inclusive vote on sections 6 to 11&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not often that the Chair has an answer even before the question is put.  As I indicated, that happens occasionally, but this amendment refers to the insertion of a new section so it did not allow for the situation that obtained in certain circumstances where one only moves one amendment but takes four amendments for debate.  The situation here is that amendment No. 14 will be taken separately and the question put after the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  I will be brief in view of the delays <Col N="2055" /> that have already taken place.  I do not accept what either Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Noonan have said in relation to the devastation of the construction industry. The construction industry has been going downhill for a few years.  That relates to demand for houses, office blocks or whatever.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the Murphy case.  When the scheme was being extended in 1980 the aspect of the married couples' question the Deputy raised was catered for under the old regime before it was abolished in 1983.  Turning to Deputy Noonan's question, it would have cost about £5 million when it was discontinued in 1982-1983.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What is the projected cost now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the proposed relief would depend on the extent to which taxpaying householders availed of the relief but it could reasonably be expected that it would cost at least £10 million.  It is wrong for Deputy O'Malley to say that it would not cost anything. This measure cannot be viewed in isolation from the house grants scheme in respect of which there is a very substantial accumulation of claims waiting presentation and settlement.  Very many of such claims would also qualify for relief under this measure.  I agree with what Deputy Noonan has said in that regard. In view of the current budgetary situation where tax relief in one area can only be granted at the expense of another, the amendment cannot be accepted primarily on the grounds of cost.  For the information of Deputies and the House, last year, taking the house improvement grant area, £34 million was spent.  This year the allocation is £100 million and next year it will be a further £100 million. That is because of the number of schemes already in the pipeline without this incentive. These schemes will cost the taxpayer generally and the Exchequer £100 million this year and £100 million next year as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1979 which defines the various terms for the purposes of this legislation defines <Col N="2058" />&ldquo;qualifying work&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;any work of maintenance, repair, improvement, or insulation of residential premises&rdquo;.  I see no word of extension there.  What it covers are the very things that are needed.  The Minister made the point that there is a tremendous amount, hundreds of millions of £s, awaiting payment in house improvement grants and other grants.  Undoubtedly that is the case.  The last Government built these up and the present Government are trying to pay them off, and I sympathise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

None of those cases, the many thousands awaiting grants, would be affected by this or would get any benefit from this because if you get a grant under section 7 of the 1979 Act you do not get the benefit of this relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Section 7 of the 1979 Act provides that if you get a grant this relief is not available to you. I advise the Minister to read that at page 201 of the 1979 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister's point is quite invalid in that respect.  The other point he makes is that the cost to the Exchequer of this provision when it was in operation previously was £5 million and, depending on the number of people who might avail of it now, it could be £10 million this time, he thought, but he did not really know.  The point I made at the outset is that he misunderstands this.  That is the cost in the smaller amount of income tax collected but it is, as I said at the outset, more than offset by the higher amount of employment that is given, the higher amount of VAT collected, the higher <Col N="2059" /> amount of PAYE paid, the higher amount of PRSI paid and the higher amount of corporation tax paid, and it costs the State nothing.  It has to put no money up front.  It seems that in the extraordinarily depressed condition we are in at the moment this is an ideal way of trying to generate some activity particularly among smaller firms who are going out of business by the new time now.  One of the main purposes of introducing this relief in 1979 was to prevent too much of this kind of work going to those who were in the black economy.  If that was thought necessary in 1979 it is umpteen times more necessary and appropriate now because the black economy today is many times greater than in 1979.  Therefore, the validity of this section and its legitimacy in this context is evident and should be accepted.  If the Minister is going to reject it he should reject it for the correct reasons rather than for the incorrect one he gave.  The same points could have been made in 1979.  Clearly they were not, perhaps because there were people with more vision around at that time and the need for this section was much less than it is today.</P>

      <P>This is a two and a half hour debate.  The reason Deputy O'Malley raised the whole issue on the Order of Business was, he said, that he had not got the Order of Business in time. The Order of Business was given to his Chief Whip and signed for at 12.05 p.m. today.  That cannot be denied, so it is the PDs who have delayed the discussion that we, particularly myself, would all like to have on all of these sections.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point Deputy O'Malley made about section 7 and the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1979, these provided tax relief within certain limits for the labour cost element in expenditure in 1979-80 by householders on the improvement and maintenance of their residence including gardens.  The relief was given by way of a deduction in the calculations of an individual's total income for tax purposes.  Only the net labour cost expenditure after deduction of any grant apportionable to such cost qualified for the relief which would apply to the excess of the net cost over £50 and subject to a maximum allowance of £450. Therefore, people who did not get grants get this tax allowance.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>  That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to implement the proposals of the Green Paper <i>Partners in Education</i> published in November, 1985.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to mention some of the background factors which led to the publication of the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>, which was published in November 1985.  It was not a document which was published in any haste.  It was published after considerable debate and discussion within the Department and considerable study of factors which led to it as a logical development.</P>
      <P>Some of those factors were the recommendation in the report of the Adult Education Commission of the establishment of local adult education committees; the recommendation in the report of the national youth policy committee, part of a comprehensive youth policy, that local youth committees should be established; the creation in recent years of a variety of programmes which were aimed at young people who were about to enter or who were already in the labour market.  On the basis of that phenomenon there had just been created on a pilot basis a number of community training and employment consortia which were called COMTEC.</P>
      <P>There was also the very welcome development of the vocational preparation and training courses in post-primary schools and they were receiving financial assistance from the European Social Fund.  In the Programme for Action in Education, published in early 1984, there was a proposal that local co-ordination committees be established and the recognition of the need for a regional structure by the establishment in the voluntary secondary schools sector of county associations of school principals broadly in parallel with VEC areas.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the main reason behind the publication of the Green Paper was the development of the Irish post-primary system over the past 20 years.  As the House will be well aware, that development has led to the creation of a number of different types of schools.  Despite their differences in areas such as management, they are all seeking to provide essentially the same education service to the same public.  Up to the mid sixties the voluntary secondary schools and vocational schools provided services at post-primary level which were different in character and were different in emphasis. Since then, anybody observing the education scene will realise that, in fact, those differences have largely disappeared. Each type of school has developed within its own curriculum elements of the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the results of these developments has been that controversy has arisen between school authorities at post-primary level.  That controversy, unfortunately, often relates to issues of school management rather than to educational considerations.  For all those reasons it was important to seek new structures which would, on a regional basis, provide <Col N="2067" /> educational and other services for all second level schools and that the management of these schools would be local boards of management.  That would eliminate friction which so often happens because of the management structure of schools.  There would be a better framework for the rationalisation of post-primary facilities and for the delivery of other services.  That, briefly, is the background to the Green Paper and the main reasons it was proposed to launch it in November 1985.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the structure and role proposed by the Green Paper in its first part.  It proposed local education councils.  These would be councils for a specific geographical area.  Side by side with the local education council there would be an individual board of management for each post-primary school. There would be 13 local education committees based roughly on a combination of local authority areas.  At the back of the Green Paper was published a map of Ireland showing the proposed areas for the local education councils.</P>
    <P>The structure of the local education councils was somewhat flexible.  We were talking about 30 to 32 members who would be nominated as follows: ten to 12 from local authorities, depending on the number of authorities involved; five would comprise one representative from each of the following: youth services, training and manpower agencies, adult education agencies and economic interests including the social partners; five representatives of the authorities of voluntary secondary schools in the area; three representatives of the authorities of vocational, community and comprehensive schools; two parents of post-primary pupils, two post-primary teachers and three primary school representatives, one parent, one teacher and one manager.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper went on to describe the vocational, community and comprehensive schools and suggested boards of management based on the community school model with three religious nominees, three LEC nominees, two elected <Col N="2068" /> teachers, two elected parents and one non-voting principal.  There were some special arrangements suggested for the boards of the Protestant schools and the Jesuit comprehensive schools.  The boards of management of voluntary secondary schools could consist of six representatives of trustees plus two elected parents, two elected teachers and two representatives of the LECs.</P>
    <P>The LECs were to have the following functions: the provision, planning and development of second level education, including technical education in its region;. the provision of a general advisory and educational welfare service; the payment of teachers; the maintenance of second level schools, other than minor works; the payment of capitation and other grants to second level schools; the promotion of liaison and co-ordination between the primary and post-primary sectors; and providing advice in relation to the provision of new primary schools. That was the first broad area of their responsibility.</P>
    <P>The second area was the provision and co-ordination of youth services; the provision and co-ordination of training schemes for young people in conjunction with other agencies such as AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, CERT and the National Manpower Service &mdash; with the labour services Bill just published it makes it all the more important that there should be liaison at regional level; the provision and co-ordination of adult education in its region &mdash; at the moment the voluntary sector is almost entirely excluded from adult education and this seems a very poor arrangement when there is such an enormous demand for adult education.  The last area which was tentatively suggested was that consideration might be given to the transfer of responsibility for the public library service to the local education councils.</P>
    <P>Apart from the factors I mentioned as leading to the need to propose new structures there were, of course, financial implications.  There have been fears that regionalisation might increase expenses rather than save the taxpayers' money.  It was comprehensively established in the <Col N="2069" /> Green Paper that there would be enough compensatory factors in the proposals to neutralise, if not diminish, the expectation of greater costs.  One of those was the rationalisation of the functions at present performed by 38 educational committees which deal with a relatively small number of schools &mdash; 250 second level schools.  This would mean a more efficient deployment of VEC staff.  In the Department of Education there would be savings in staffing levels if certain functions were distributed to the LECs and the undertaking of all management functions by individual boards of management.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the VEC is the management body for vocational schools and any question requiring management input which arises in a vocational school must be referred to the VEC central office and that involves the staff there. Under the proposed LEC arrangement, each school would have its own board of management responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school and matters requiring the attention of the board would be referred to it and not to the LEC.  It is proposed to set up adult education boards, local youth service boards and comtechs.  If they were set up, they would require staffing.  Obviously the establishment of LECs would provide an opportunity to achieve a rationalisation of additional staffing requirements.  If the library service were included in the new LECs, no additional costs would be involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in any proposed devolution of functions, the risk of duplicating the functions which are at present centrally administered would arise.  It would be very important, therefore, that planning and budgeting and the work between the Department's inspectorate and education officers attached to the LECs be very carefully done to make sure there would be no overlapping.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Green Paper deals with the ever topical area of the regional technical colleges and other colleges.  This is very much in the news at present.  There are comments in the newspapers and the Minister occasionally makes reference to <Col N="2070" /> proposed changes in the structure of the RTCs.  In the Green Paper a new arrangement is set out for the RTCs to change their management structure to one of complete autonomy.  I will talk about the reasons for that later.</P>
    <P>The boards of the RTCs under the Green Paper proposal could be along the following lines: A chairperson and a principal, plus about 20 members as follows: five members nominated by the appropriate local education council in the region, one member nominated by each of the LECs, if any, in the RTC catchment area, two academic staff, one non-academic staff, two students, one nominee of the Minister for Labour and six appointed by the Minister.  As regards the six appointees, the Green Paper said that the Minister would have regard to the extent to which industry, commerce, the professions and the trade unions should be represented.  The proposed management structure of the RTCs was much simpler than the present structure. As the House will be aware, the RTCs are very much under the control of the local vocational education committee. The RTCs say they find this increasingly anomalous in this day and age.  They say they need more freedom of movement to involve themselves in research, industrial liaison initiatives and generally to fulfil in a dynamic way the functions of a technological and education centre for the region in which they are placed.</P>
    <P>Turning to the suggestions for the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Dublin colleges, the Green Paper reminds us that the Dublin Institute of Technology has six constituent colleges and in terms of its total enrolment is second only to University College, Dublin.  The Green Paper proposed that the Dublin Institute of Technology would be established on a statutory basis in its own right.  This is something the people involved in running the colleges have been seeking for some time.  This statute might provide for a governing body of 26 members as well as an academic council along the lines of higher education institutions which would bring the colleges together and make sure there is complete <Col N="2071" /> co-ordination.  The question obviously arises whether the Dublin Institute of Technology should become a designated institution under the Higher Education Authority.  It was generally considered that the institute, because of its size, wide variety of courses in so many disciplines, its national rather than regional character and the relationship it already enjoys with University College, Dublin, in regard to the award of degrees should be quite different in character from the RTCs. The Dublin Institute of Technology has been developed to its present status by the City of Dublin VEC and it can be claimed that the VEC or the local education council for the City of Dublin should continue to be the institute's parent body.  That debate is raised in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The proposed board of management of the Dublin Institute of Technology is as follows: the board would consist of a chairperson and director, plus 24 members nominated for appointment as follows &mdash; seven members nominated by the City of Dublin Local Education Council, one member each nominated by the other LECs of Dublin which would consist of three members, three members from the academic staff of the institute, two members from the non-academic staff of the institute, two members from the students of the institute and one member nominated by the governing body of NIHE, Dublin, plus six members nominated by the Minister who obviously would have regard to the factors mentioned earlier in connection with LECs about the different groups of society which should have an input into the colleges including industry, commerce, the professions and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the Green Paper concerning the Dublin Institute of Technology were that it should be constituted as an independent institution by legislation.  In acknowledgment of the involvement of the City of Dublin VEC and its development, significant representation on the governing body should be given to the City of Dublin VEC or the LEC which would represent the Dublin city area.  There would be one <Col N="2072" /> overall director of the institute and six heads of colleges or schools who would be under and responsible to the director.</P>
    <P>The RTCs and the Limerick college would be reconstituted so that each would have a much expanded and more independent board of management.  The board would be a sub-committee of the appropriate LEC or VEC but its decisions would not be subject to confirmation by the parent body.  The college budget would be paid through the VEC or the LEC and the institution would maintain its own accounts and recruit its own staff.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Cork RTC, the schools of music and art would be incorporated into it.  Each RTC would continue to have a college council as at present.  As I said earlier, there were 13 LECs which caused, as expected, immediate controversy.  The 13 areas were laid out in an attempt to be as logical as possible making sure that each one would have, as nearly as possible, the same number of schools and students under its aegis.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some comments on the Green Paper and the thinking behind it. When it came out some reactions were that it was a reflection on the Vocational Education Act, 1930, but of course, as we are all aware, the 1930 Act has served the country extremely well over the last 50 plus years.  The testimony of experience is very eloquent to the vision of those who framed it and it has stood the test of time.  It was flexible and far reaching and that flexibility is one of its greatest strengths.  Therefore, one might ask if the Act is so flexible why should we think of changing it.  Of course the proposals put forward in the Green Paper did not imply a repeal or a complete change in the 1930 Act.  The Green Paper envisaged that it would be a development rather than an abandonment of the 1930 Act.  Indeed, it also envisages &mdash; which would be a very good idea &mdash; that much of the detail of the 1930 Act should be incorporated into any new legislation.</P>
    <P>To get back to the problems which have been thrown up as the post-primary sector has developed in its diversity in <Col N="2073" /> recent years; we have a system of post-primary schools whose different structures do not always harmonise, to put it mildly.  As Deputies are aware, right across the country there has been, unfortunately, more emphasis on competition between post-primary schools rather than the co-operation required if the needs of our young people are to be met adequately.  I hope this Minister will not run into too much of it but I expect her to be embroiled in some of it.  As Minister I was greatly distressed by very bitter divisions which had shattered communities and left them locked in argument about the relative merits of community schools and colleges.  It was a great shame that in many cases very worthy and necessary building projects were held up for years while the best efforts of Ministers, local representatives, Department officials and all their skills were unable to bring the factions together.  The sad part about it is that there are so many similarities between the two categories of schools in terms of the educational programmes they offer.  The differences, distinctions and the trouble that arose centred on issues of control and management.  It amounted to very painful power struggles which were in nobody's best interests, least of all those of the children.  Obviously, in many of these cases, a decision must finally be made and it is usually the unfortunate Minister who has to make that decision in the end which, in the circumstances of community division, leaves one faction aggrieved and disappointed no matter how much the Minister may try to mollify them.  A climate like that for starting a new school in any community should be a beacon of hope and unity.  It is a shame that many schools have had to begin their new life in an atmosphere of acrimony and division in a community.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Green Paper certainly seek to overcome this problem and essentially it will be overcome by bringing people together and eliminating the distinctions between these two types of school.  We must offer greater prospects for harmony within communities who <Col N="2074" /> could then more freely celebrate the excitement of the provision of new school facilities.  Of course it will not mean the elimination of all differences between schools.  The two categories, public and private, would remain.  The idea of a publicly owned school is now well established and should be retained albeit with some changes in terms of management control.  Likewise, the concept of the voluntary school is a very long established one and to change this would be to tamper in the area of rights guaranteed under the Constitution and which I certainly respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any large public demand for fundamental changes of this character anyway.  Apart from that very serious problem of the division between the communities while children wait for their educational facilities to be provided for them, a second problem must be addressed.  This is the adequate delivery structure that must be developed to deliver services which are allied to the mainstream education programme. Adult education, youth services, co-ordination of education and training, these are all areas which are alive and which are progressing.  While it may be argued that an appropriate structure exists in the form of VECs, one very frequently hears the view expressed that VECs naturally cannot be seen as totally neutral parties, that they are naturally identified with their own schools.  Rightly or wrongly, it has been suggested that they have by their very nature an inbuilt bias in favour of a minority of schools and would not be in a position, therefore, to provide services naturally and objectively to all. I do not imply that I accept that there is such bias, but the fairly widespread perception in this regard cannot be ignored.  Indeed, the Costello Youth Policy report recognised that difficulty in the context of their consideration of what would be an appropriate parent body to which the new Youth Services Board should relate.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper it was proposed that local education councils would stand neutral in relation to all post primary schools in the sense that they could not <Col N="2075" /> enjoy a particular relationship to just one kind of school.  There are two problems whose solutions might be found in the context of the Green Paper.  Those problems alone perhaps would not justify the need for new structures, but in the search for solutions to those problems we certainly find issues being raised which help to point in the general direction of establishing LECs.  One of the factors which points to the proposals is the way in which the different categories of schools have been moving towards each other.  The historical situation which gave rise to differences between them is in many respects irrelevant now.  All post primary schools pursue similar goals.  They cater by and large for similar pupils and they follow courses which lead to the same examinations.  This suggests that the differences in the systems are becoming increasingly anomalous.</P>
    <P>The chief rationale for the new proposals in the Green Paper, which was greeted with mixed reactions when published, might be found in its title, and I remember taking considerable care to arrive at a suitable title.  The full title was &ldquo;Partners in Education serving Community Needs&rdquo;; that is what the Green Paper was all about.  It was seeing how a Minister and the Department of Education in the very best interests of the whole community, in the interest of providing a first class quality of service to the full community, would set about taking precedence over all sectional or vested interests.  That was the quest which I set out upon and that was the whole reasoning behind the Green Paper &mdash; serving the community and partnership.  Above all, in serving the community, a sharing, a drawing together of the various interest groups so that collective wisdom, experience and strength could be pooled to provide an efficient and effective service. Sharing and partnership imply give and take, generosity and openmindedness. The various groups involved in education have obviously a distinctive contribution to make, without any of them dominating.</P>
    <P>There are very serious reasons that consideration should be given very <Col N="2076" /> quickly by this Government to implementing the proposals of the Green Paper as the motion calls for.  We have heard reports in recent days not confirmed or denied by the Minister.  In particular I refer to a report in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>, on the top of the front page, about the abolition of vocational education committees in order to save money.  Such an <i>ad hoc</i> procedure implied by that kind of approach would be most regrettable.  It must be approached in a national perspective. The work is already done.  The difficulties and the phenomena which caused publication of the the Green Paper have been identified; the discussions have been held.  I well recall considerable discussions being held in the Department and submissions received.  The Minister will be well aware that all that documentation, skilfully interpreted for her by her Department, is there at hand.</P>
    <P>Perhaps normally one might expect that it would take some years to go through a process like this of establishing what the problem was and gradually coming to look at a whole range of solutions, but that process has been undertaken already and that has been done. There is no need to hold back.  The time to act is now because day by day while these divisions and waste of resources continue our young people are suffering in their education.  Recently statements were reported about rationalisation and amalgamation of second level schools sharing resources.  I am sure the Minister is already aware but, if not, I warn her that when one starts talking about amalgamation or sharing of resources, unfortunately one always brings up the same divisive power struggles and despite the great resourcefulness of the Minister and her determination to consult all the time, which every Minister shares, some of these problems have to be faced up to in the end by the Minister taking a decision.</P>
    <P>There were many and diverse reactions when the Green Paper was first published. Many of the reactions were instantaneous, which was rather a pity, but in the media world in which we live one is telephoned for a reaction and one is <Col N="2077" /> inclined to give one.  There were some positive reactions to it and in particular I want to quote in part the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 November:</P>
    <P>Organisationally, post-primary education has been in a mess for some time.  There are five different types of post-primary school, each with a different management structure.  Vocational schools compete with secondary schools which, in turn, compete with community schools; courses and facilities are duplicated, and energies which would be better utilised in improving the quality of general educational provision locally are wasted in pointless rivalries.  So absurd is the situation that one town is being provided with both a vocational and a community school, despite widespread agreement that only one school was needed.</P>
    <P>The editorial goes on in that vein generally to applaud this initiative and says that the proposed reform is long-overdue.</P>
    <P>The reactions were not all like that. Every group, it seemed at the time, had something to say, often contradicting each other and disagreeing with the Green Paper for completely different reasons.  That in itself was a testimony to the need for action.  Faced with an area so fraught with conflicting views, it is tempting for a Minister to play safe, play dumb and do nothing.  When the situation cries out for action which can only be approached by a Minister, it is time for that Minister to tackle a very unsatisfactory position.  She should keep right in the forefront of her mind the interests, above all, of the consumer, the young person who depends on the education system for the most valuable support that the State can give &mdash; the best possible education system.</P>
    <P>The interests of these young people and, <i>ipso facto</i>, the interests of the country are not served by the present divisions and differences in a country as small as Ireland where energies and skills are being used to further the interests of each group at second level &mdash; witness the <Col N="2078" /> divisive campaign between the voluntary and vocational sectors during the recent election campaign.  Accusation and counter-accusation were flung across the pages of the media about which sector got better treatment.  Neither is the taxpayers' interests served by such a plethora of management and administrative structures, each using up resources in their own area.  The administrative costs alone of the 38 vocational education committees amounted to £11 million according to a reply which the Minister gave today to a written question put down by me.  Therefore, it seems totally logical to ask the Government to build on what has been set out, tested and researched and to act on that.  I hope the reaction of public representatives to any change in their function &mdash; in this case their functions on VECs &mdash; will be very thoughtful.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection that when the Green Paper was published unfortunately one of the reactions of the Minister was to accuse me of trying to get at the Fianna Fáil-controlled VECs after the local elections in 1985.  The Minister has now been elevated to a position of immense responsibility and I am sure she can see the real reasons behind the Green Paper.  It was a strong and logical attempt to tackle a chaotic situation which the longer it is left alone will impede progress towards unity and strength in the Irish educational scene.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the proposals contained in the Green Paper <i>Partners in Education</i> published in November 1985 and also notes the Government's intention to give full consideration to the proposals in coming to any decisions in this regard.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I want to say to Deputy Hussey and all interested parties that I greatly welcome the opportunity this debate provides.  It is one in which there <Col N="2079" /> can be some common ground and then again there are some points on which we will necessarily differ.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the points raised by Deputy Hussey, I note that in November 1985 when she was Minister for Education she introduced the Green Paper.  Fourteen months later the Government went out of office.  There was no proposal from here, as Minister for Education, or from the following Minister for Education with regard to any part of Part I of the Green Paper.  There was total silence regardless of the fact that many submissions had been made in the interim period relating to proposals. Most of these submissions were against the proposals but, of course, that might be expected in many instances.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Green Paper were printed and given out in November 1985 and the Government went out of office on 10 March 1987.  During that 14-month period the only proposal that emanated from the then Fine Gael Government was one regarding regional colleges and this was totally at variance with the one in the Green Paper.  Part II of the Green Paper proposed that regional colleges would remain within the system while, at the same time, getting a greater degree of autonomy.  Yet, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney, stated that RTCs were to be entirely autonomous and would come under the aegis of the HEA.  I refer to this because it is anomalous &mdash; I will not use any stronger word. It is odd that Deputy Hussey now wants the Fianna Fáil Government to implement what the Coalition and the later Fine Gael Government were unable to implement.  This is a fact of life and, therefore, should be noted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate for the opportunity it gives one to explore the issue as set out in the Green Paper and its ramifications.  Deputy Hussey seems to say that Ministers in some fashion would not be able to take the difficult decisions which are involved in amalgamation and rationalisation.  That being so, this would be one of the main reasons she would see that Part I of the Green Paper should be <Col N="2080" /> implemented so that another body &mdash; an LEC &mdash; would take the post primary decisions which would be necessary to ensure a proper delivery of educational resources to pupils in the post primary sector.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's view that the Office of the Minister for Education is one of immense responsibility.  It is one I intend to discharge very thoroughly, as she did during her time as Minister.  I do not see that I should thankfully shrug off my function of responsibility to an imaginary LEC and say to them: &ldquo;You must take your own decisions.  I want nothing of your divisions within society&rdquo;. Since I have come into office I have been extremely conscious of the need for planning. I have not been modest or shrinking in stating what I want to see with regard to the proper planning and provision of resources at post primary level and rationalisation and amalgamation where necessary.</P>
    <P>From looking at files and viewing various proposals which were made to various Ministers, what happened in the past is that Ministers allowed community interests to over-ride what should have been their function in coming to a decision, having taken into account all the information available to them.  Since coming to office I have taken some very distinct decisions with regard to rationalisation. I have told the authorities concerned what my decision has been on some cases which were hanging about for some considerable time.  Of course, there have been hurt feelings.  Of course there will be communities who will feel they should have got a school rather than another area but I intend to proceed with another list which I will be considering closely.  Because a Minister cannot make up his or her mind about the provision of suitable post primary facilities is no reason the functions which should be properly vested in the Minister would be vested in a local education council.  I have consulted widely on the proposals I have approved, many of which were a long time waiting.  I do not accept the idea that if one sets up an imaginary council the hard decisions would be taken <Col N="2081" /> from one's desk and, therefore, pupils would all benefit greatly.  I see my duty as one of making decisions and I hope to involve myself more and more in this area.  It is an area where there is immense scope for the provision of better educational resources in the post primary sector.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper was issued in November 1985.  It was essentially a discussion document and it sought to open up dialogue. However, it is fairly clear that it failed to achieve a consensus, judging by the public reaction.  It may have been premature and a more comprehensive examination of the second level system should have been undertaken before such radical proposals were put forward. Deputy Hussey charted the main points of the proposed Green Paper as it then was so there is no point in going back over all the various points.</P>
    <P>My feeling &mdash; shared by many of the 100 or so interested groups who made submissions on the content of the Green Paper &mdash; was that the proposals were made with very little regard to the incalculable contribution which the VECs have made, and continue to make, to our education system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy opposite freely acknowledged the work of the VECs.  I had the honour of serving on a VEC for a number of years.  Indeed, I chaired a VEC for a number of years.  I am conversant, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will forgive me for being immodest, with the strong and positive aspects of the system and also with its shortcomings.  I am aware of the advantages and great flexibilities of the 1930 Vocational Education Act and I am also conscious of the debt which society owes to the provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>That legislation provided for an educational system and an administrative mechanism which has proved able to meet every challenge put to it in the intervening half century by a country which in that time has evolved into a modern industrial, and increasingly urbanised nation.</P>
    <P>Even a cursory look at the history and activities of the VECs will reveal two great qualities &mdash; their adaptability and <Col N="2082" /> flexibility.  Thanks to the close links between the schools and local communities and also to the knowledge and concern of committee members, special needs were readily identified and met with a quick and effective response.</P>
    <P>In the midst of change the vocational system has not lost sight of the need for all-round development of human potential. All the members drawn from representative interest &mdash; the elected persons and non-elected persons &mdash; have had a great input into it.  My regard for the VEC system, my knowledge of its working and my appreciation of the debt we owe to it is very real.  It is because of my regard for the VEC system that I am anxious to ensure that the structures presently in place are delivering the services for which they are responsible in the most efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing that in the 1985/86 school year VECs were responsible for 247 second level schools with nearly 5,000 whole time teacher equivalents and some 82,000 pupils.  It has been my aim since I became Minister for Education to continue to foster a spirit of co-operation between all those involved in an education system.  I have made a special effort as Minister to meet as many as possible of the various interest groups involved in education, and I will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of Part I of the Coalition's Green Paper envisaged a reduction from 38 VECs involving city, town and county to 13.  It is my contention that that act of butchery was quite savage in its concept and would have been savage in its effect were it carried out.  It was a great wonder that in 15 or 16 months nothing was done on Part I.  I will not go over all of what the Deputy opposite spoke on but the main thrust of her remarks was that the reason for that was so that decisions would be taken regarding rationalisation and amalgamation and a better delivery of services within communities which have become divided over these issues.  Problems which Ministers have been unable to resolve.  I assure the House that I intend to resolve those problems and I have already commenced <Col N="2083" /> that process.  I will continue to do this, using the powers of my office.</P>
    <P>The second part of the document dealt with the position of regional colleges.  It is strange that Part II of the document envisaged in the Green Paper that regional colleges would secure a degree of autonomy while retaining their links with VECs.  That is the conclusion I came to.  The conclusion arrived at by Deputy Cooney as Minister and made known by him on 9 March, just a day before the new Government took office, was that the RTCs would be completely divorced from the VECs and would become independent institutions.  That seemed a very odd conclusion to have reached as it was completely out of kilter with what had been proposed.  It will be appreciated that the proposals with regard to the regional technical colleges which were published in the Green Paper while the proposer was Minister for Education are inextricably linked with the other proposals in this paper with regard to the establishment of local education councils.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to consider these proposals, however, it would be at least illuminating to delineate their progress under the administration which proposed them and which is now, in Private Members time, seeking their implementation.</P>
    <P>The first reference to regional technical colleges in a planning document published by that administration was contained in the paper &ldquo;Programme for Action in Education 1984-87&rdquo;, published in January, 1984.</P>
    <P>I quote from page 29, paragraph 6.6 of the said programme.</P>
    <P>A review will be carried out concerning the extent to which the Regional Technical Colleges have succeeded in achieving the goals originally set out for them in the Report of the Steering Committee for Technical Education.</P>
    <P>One might well ask whether such a review was carried out by whom.  If so what were the results of this proposed review?  I have to state that since becoming Minister for <Col N="2084" /> Education I have sought the results of that promised review, but so far I have been unable to unearth them.  Perhaps it was not carried out at all.  It would be a reasonable and logical assumption that having proposed a review the authors of the Green Paper we are now discussing would have awaited the results of the review before going on to propose fundamental changes in the structures of the colleges which were being reviewed.  We talked about what was proposed in the Green Paper with regard to the regional colleges.  The Green Paper praised the fact that these were regional institutions and had been developed as such by the VEC committees.  It was important, according to the Green Paper that they retain this regional characteristic and remain strongly connected with whatever regional education structures may emerge in the future.  The Green Paper went on to propose a future management structure for RTCs with boards of management larger and more representative than they are at present and with considerably more autonomy in relation to their parent body, whether it be vocational education committee or local education council.  However, as we know, &ldquo;the best laid schemes of mice and men&rdquo; are prove to &ldquo;gang aft agley&rdquo; and this seems to have been particularly the case in the matter of the previous Administration's intentions with regard to their own Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The next we heard about regional technical colleges was a press announcement in connection with proposed new management structures.  This announcement stated that the Minister for Education wished to announce that the Government had authorised the drafting of a Bill along the lines of a scheme submitted by him to give greater autonomy to regional technical colleges in the context of the Green Paper <i>Partners in Education.</i> It went on to say that the effect of the scheme would be to constitute each of the nine regional technical colleges, the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology, and future regional technical colleges as institutions under the control of governing bodies comprising <Col N="2085" /> representatives of vocational education committees, the academic staff of the colleges, full time students and nominees of the Minister for Education.  I have given this outline to indicate that the previous Administration, at least so far as regional colleges were concerned, had departed fundamentally from the proposals in the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education.</i> It is also, perhaps not without significance, that the foregoing press announcement was made on a historic day, 9 March 1987, one day before the present Government took office.  Perhaps it is also worth nothing that that proposal was made by a Government who had separated from their Labour partners.</P>
    <P>Let me return now to the <i>Programme for Action in Education</i> and to the promised review which did not take place. Without the benefit of the findings of such a review the Green Paper came to a conclusion which was, to say the least, highly questionable, and I quote: &ldquo;The actual work of the Colleges has grown away considerably from the original concept of the RTCs and it can be argued that it is no longer valid that their administration should be undertaken by VECs but rather that they should be more closely related to the rest of the third-level area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to find the basis for this conclusion.  I have looked again at the Vocational Education Act, 1930, legislation which has stood the test of time, and I see that section 38 of that Act envisaged the provision by VECs, albeit in borough areas, of higher technical education.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the historical development of such well known institutions as the College of Technology in Bolton Street and Kevin Street in Dublin, the College of Commerce in Rathmines, the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute and the School of Art in Cork and observed that their administration under VECs did not inhibit the standard of their courses, their relationships with other components of the third level sector or the public acceptance of the genuine worth of their qualifications.</P>
    <P>I looked finally at the RTCs themselves <Col N="2086" /> and at the record of their achievement since they were established.  In this connection I am glad to have been closely associated with the regional college in my own town of Athlone, having served as a member and then as Chairperson of the board, and I can assure the Deputy and other Deputies that I have a close knowledge of what goes on in the colleges, of their day-to-day operation, of the excellent courses which have been provided by them and of how faithfully and imaginatively they have interpreted the mandate under which they were established. We can be proud of the record of achievement and growth of these colleges.  Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels, so citing what happened in the past and using that as an occasion to do nothing would not be at all correct.  I do not see that as my role.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to press on with the regional colleges.  We will talk for a moment about the record of achievement and the growth of those colleges, a growth illustrated by an enrolement of wholetime students in the nine RTCs of approximately 11,500 in 1986-87 as against some 6,000 in 1980-81.  I cannot see how it can be contended, as it is in the Green Paper, that the work of the colleges has grown away considerably from the original concept of the RTCs or that I should accept and recommend to our Government conclusions based on such an invalid premise, conclusions which, as I have pointed out, the Administration which proposed them, as is quite obvious now, had no intention of implementing.</P>
    <P>It is not my brief, however, to be negative in respect of this motion because I know it is well intended and I acknowledge that certain things have changed since the RTCs were established.  Of course they have changed, because life constantly moves on and has done so since the RTCs were established.  It may be fruitful and it will be helpful to look at some of these changes and to see what their implications should be for the colleges. The most important of those is undoubtedly that brought about by the <Col N="2087" /> rapid progress in technology.  This progress has been reflected in the whole-time programmes on offer in the colleges. Computing, for example, which was a rarity in the early days, is now a common feature, with a growing necessity that it becomes not only a study in itself but a support to the majority of courses on offer.</P>
    <P>We are more aware than ever now of how much this country must rely on its own resources, on the skill, the knowledge, the imagination and the enterprise of our people to survive and prosper in the competitive society in which we live. Increasingly in our colleges we must look to the interdisciplinary activities that foster the range of skills necessary to the establishment of significant enterprise. We must, too, foster, cultivate and strengthen the links between our colleges and the agencies and individuals involved in the creation and maintenance of enterprise and thereby ensure that no opportunities are lost to the country, the regions and the people.  There is in each of our colleges a resource of technical and professional skills, of planning, expertise, laboratories, libraries and sources of knowledge which we must exploit to the full.  Undoubtedly, the main function of the colleges will remain as set out in the steering committee's report, but over and above that I see it as important that the resources of the colleges could and should be called into play in support of regional enterprise, and, indeed, where necessary, taking a priming role in that area. Such an involvement by the colleges can result not only in dividends to their immediate region and to enterprise but also to the colleges themselves, their staffs and their students.  For the staff, research and development work will keep alive and fine hone their professional skills from which the students will benefit in terms of the quality of the teaching, of involvement in projects and of access to developing enterprises.</P>
    <P>A second stage we must consider is the increasing trend towards democratic structures within and concerning our public institutions.  Few can be in doubt <Col N="2088" /> about the pressures on public finances. Of that situation we will have to take full cognisance.  For these reasons I am having the position of the colleges examined in my Department.  I do not see the necessity, given the remarkable progress which has been made by the colleges under the Vocational Education Act and within the VEC structures, to alter their position in this regard any way radically. My intention, however, is to develop proposals for amendments to the Vocational Education Act under which the college boards of management could be made larger and more representative, whereby the boards, while operating within the VEC structures, would have a higher degree of automony than they at present enjoy and whereby the colleges can in accordance with agreed policies and guidelines become involved in research and development work consonant with their teaching functions and in support of the development of enterprise within the regions.  These proposals, once developed, will form the basis of consultations with all interested bodies and agencies and will, I hope, provide for the drafting of appropriate legislative amendments to the Vocational Education Act.  For these reasons I am asking the Dáil to agree to the amendment I have before the House.</P>
    <P>Let me put on record in regard to the proposals I will be drawing up for Government that it will be my honour to bring these legislative proposals to the House in the context of the Vocational Education Act.  I am very conscious of the fact that it is frequently levied at Education that it is very slow to respond to the need for change, that legislative change in regard to it is very slow.  I often think that the <i>festina lente</i> advice is a good thing with regard to fundamental changes, but I am sure that our Government will stay in office for a considerable period and that it will be my honour and my joy to be enabled to bring before the House educational proposals by way of amendment to legislation.  It is interesting to note that it is quite a number of years since there was any Government legislation with regard to education, so the <Col N="2089" /> legislation in that regard should be very interesting.  Forward looking proposals will be embodied in the amendment of the Vocational Education Act.  I look forward to consultations with the interested bodies to ensure that the amendments we will bring forward will be progressive, will find a basis of consensus with all the interested parties and above all will greatly serve the education needs of this country as the Act has done for the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>  That a sum not exceeding £86,239,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Education, certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I have already spoken at some length in this House on the provision for education in 1987, on 8 April last, during the course of the debate on the budget.  Today, I am seeking approval for the five Votes, No. 30 to 34, inclusive, which make up the Education group of Votes.  I propose, at the outset, to touch briefly on the global figures and to refer in greater detail at a later stage to individual services.</P>
      <P>The total gross provision in these five Votes is £1,231 million.  This includes Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £72.5 million.  Gross expenditure last year came to £1,120 million.  The amount sought for 1987 thus represents an increase of £111 million or 10 per cent. In addition to the amount being provided in these Votes, a further £28.59 million will be received from youth levy funds and will be a charge on the Vote for Labour, No. 38.  A further £3.15 million will be received from the proceeds of the national lottery in respect of youth and sports activities and will be a charge on the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross overall Exchequer provision for 1987, therefore, if one includes the youth levy funds, will come to £1,260 million as compared with expenditure of £1,145 million in 1986, an increase of 10 per cent.  If the proceeds of the national lottery are included, the figure is £1,263 million.  The provision for capital expenditure for 1987 is £97.525 million.  The total non-capital provision, including the youth levy, is £1,162 million, 11.3 per cent more than the outturn for 1986 of £1,044 million.  Including the proceeds from the national lottery, the figure is <Col N="2091" /> £1,165 million an increase of 11.6 per cent.  I know all of these figures may be somewhat tedious in the telling but, of necessity, I must repeat them.  The provision for pay and pensions is £954 million which is 82 per cent of the total non-capital provision.  No provision is included for any further increases in rates of remuneration.  An overall total of £211 million is being provided for non-pay expenditure, 4.7 per cent more than the 1986 outturn.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in recent months about education cuts.  There is no doubt that if additional funding were available for education it could be used to good effect.  I am also fully aware of the difficulties faced by the many diligent and committed people involved in education as they seek to make the best use of the resources available to them.  The reality is, however, that the country faces serious fiscal, economic and social problems. This Government have set themselves the unenviable task of taking the stern measures necessary to tackle the underlying problems.  These measures include reductions in public expenditure in order to reduce the overpowering burden of national debt, in which the educational sector must play its part. Nevertheless, the Government's commitment to education and the high priority accorded to educational needs even in these difficult times, is clearly illustrated by the fact that this year's allocation is more than 11 per cent greater than the 1986 outturn; at 7 per cent of GNP, represents a greater proportion of national resources than ever before; and amounts to almost 18 per cent of the total Exchequer spending.</P>
    <P>Apart from an increase in the overall financial provision other positive aspects of the allocation do need to be stressed. For example, there has been no worsening of the basic pupil-teacher ratios at first and second level despite the new restrictions on the filling of vacancies in the public service; no restriction has been placed on entry to education or limit to educational opportunities; the guidance <Col N="2092" /> service has been preserved in post-primary schools; vocational preparation and training courses continue and the transition year option has been approved again for schools in which it had been established; the capital programme has been kept intact.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that responsibility for the national library, including the Genealogical Office, has been transferred to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Funding for certain third-level mature students' grants, for women, has been transferred from the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach and has been included in the provision for the programme to promote equality in education. On a personal note I might say I am very pleased on having been given responsibility for this allocation.  It is one which aptly fits in my priorities and philosophy in regard to provision for women in education.  It is a small but significant step.</P>
    <P>The net estimate for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is £86.239 million or 5 per cent over the 1986 outturn.  This provision is required for salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and for certain cultural and educational services and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Salaries and wages of the staff of my Department will cost £13.323 million in 1987.  Although this is an increase of 2 per cent it represents a reduction in real terms in staff resources in view of the increases in rates of pay.  At a time when all bodies engaged in education are being asked to make sacrifices, it is well to note that central administration in the Department of Education is playing its full part in contributing to reductions in public expenditure, for example, since the staffing embargo was introduced, a total of 246 posts have been left unfilled in the Department of Education.  In the past year alone, 36 posts were suppressed. At the same time, there has been no reduction in the range of services for which my Department are responsible. The allocation for 1987 will require further substantial staff reductions within the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> The total operating expenses of the Department come to less than £17 million which is only 1.3 per cent of the expenditure for which the Department are responsible, a very low level of management costs.</P>
    <P>The cost of higher education grants continues to increase.  The provision being made is £20.6 million, a full 25 per cent more than the 1986 outturn.  It is expected that about 11,800 students, compared with 10,139 last year, will be grant-aided in 1986-87.  The income eligibility limits and the maintenance elements of the grants in the schemes for 1987-88 have been increased in line with inflation.  I might mention here that the difficulties which hitherto held up the payment of these grants to students taking theology and religious science courses have been resolved.  An additional 15 per cent is being provided for university scholarships, research grants and fellowships.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the school transport service will amount to £38.2 million this year, of which £34.7 million will come from the Exchequer and £3.5 million from charges.  The amount of the charges is being increased from £1 to £2 per pupil per term or a maximum £5 per family from September next.  These have already been announced.  I will continue to keep the school transport service under review to ensure the greatest possible cost-effectiveness.  The £1.749 million being provided for the scheme of grants for recreational facilities is an increase of 53 per cent on the 1986 outturn.</P>
    <P>The provision for youth and sports activities, on which the Minister of State will speak at length, has again been combined in one grant-in-aid fund as they were in years past.  The grant-in-aid fund for sports organisations was introduced in 1970.  Since then it has made a very substantial contribution towards sport and leisure activities in the country.  The provision being made in this Vote for youth and sport combined for 1987 is £2.134 million.  The year 1987 has seen an exciting new development with the launching of the national lottery which has already shown itself to be a great <Col N="2094" /> success.  The Government have decided that 45 per cent of the proceeds of the national lottery will be applied to youth and sport.  On the basis of the provision made in the Revised Estimates this would amount to £3.15 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>The net amount sought for the Vote for primary education is £444.015 million, 13 per cent more than the 1987 outturn. Gross pay and pensions of primary teachers, as provided for in subheads C and D, account for 94 per cent of the total gross non-capital provision in the Vote.</P>
    <P>Salaries and allocations of national teachers will cost £357.9 million.  This is 16 per cent more than in 1986.  The increase in the number of national teachers has been very substantial in recent years and has placed a considerable burden on the Exchequer.  In 1977, we provided £78 million for 17,400 teachers. In 1987, we are providing £358 million for 21,161 teachers.  The number of teachers has increased by 22 per cent in that period.</P>
    <P>For the past 25 years additional posts of remedial teacher have been recognised and there are now some 850 such posts. Different levels of ability and attainment must be catered for.  Many of these differences can be accommodated in the modern primary school with its emphasis on response to individual needs and group teaching.  There are children, however, who fall so far short of average attainment that they need the special help which is met by these remedial teachers. There has been a modest but steady increase in the number of these teachers in recent years and a further small additional number of posts will be established this year with teachers being recruited from the panel.</P>
    <P>Superannuation of national school teachers will cost £48.7 million this year, 12 per cent more than in 1986.  This is another area where cost increases have been very substantial over the years.  The provision for national school teachers' superannuation in 1977 was £13.5 million compared with £48.7 million this year.</P>
    <P>We are providing £30 million for the building, equipping and furnishing of primary schools.  This provision has <Col N="2095" /> attracted some adverse comment as it represents an apparent reduction on the 1986 level.  In reality, however, it represents an increase of 6 per cent on the provision for 1986.  Despite this substantial increase of 6 per cent the funds available are fully committed as 40 contracts were authorised in January by the previous Minister for Education.  It is not envisaged that further major projects for permanent accommodation can proceed to contract this year.  It was a major cause of concern and of frustration to me that I found myself mistress of a kitty which was denuded before I came to view it.</P>

      <P>While the national school building programme is mainly concerned with the provision of new schools and extensions in developing urban areas and with the replacement of obsolete and unsuitable buildings in rural areas, a substantial sum must be reserved each year for essential works to existing schools. This might entail the replacement of windows, roofs, sanitation, heating systems and similar improvements and does not usually involve the provision of any extra floorspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources available at present, both in terms of capital allocations and staffing resources within the primary buildings branch of my Department, are such that it could take many years &mdash; perhaps as many as seven or eight &mdash; to clear the backlog of projects which are seeking to be funded.  Every effort must therefore be made to get the most value from the resources we have and to deal, with the least possible delay, with the most urgent accommodation needs.  The policy of centralising smaller schools into larger units will continue to make an <Col N="2096" /> important contribution to the effective utilisation of facilities.  Indeed, the merging of separate boys' and girls' schools into co-educational units and the decline in enrolments in certain urban areas are examples of new developments which provide a renewed opportunity for rationalisation.  Such rationalisation, of course, while offering a welcome long term financial savings, must always be firmly founded on the improvement of the quality of education and the optimisation of resources.</P>
    <P>The necessity to provide teachers, premises and finance to cater for ever growing numbers of pupils has brought its own considerable challenge in the past 20 years.  We are now entering a period which will present a different but a no less important set of challenges.  I refer, of course, to the declining birthrate of recent years, which is now beginning or will shortly begin to make itself felt on the pupil population at primary level.  The initial levelling off and the subsequent decline in pupil numbers may appear at first glance simply to present an opportunity of reducing pupil-teacher ratios.  It is however, a more complex matter than that.  There will be an effect on physical facilities resulting in empty classrooms or even some empty schools.  This has to be taken into account in planning our capital building programme both as regards the location of new facilities and the construction methods used.  There will be substantial implications for the school transport system.  This new situation will also present us with opportunities and I intend to ensure that full advantage is taken of them.  This Government, as previous Governments have done, will continue to regard primary education as an area of special priority.  I hope to use the opportunities presented by falling numbers to identify and examine areas of special need and to divert towards those areas some of the resources which will be released, both teaching resources and support services.  I plan to do this in a coordinated way in consultation with all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The effect of the falling birth rate has already been felt in the training colleges. <Col N="2097" /> Overall there are 1,795 students in the colleges this year compared with 2,471 in 1982-83.  I am at present engaged in discussions with the representatives of one of those colleges.  We had meetings last week.  There are more planned for this week and we hope to reach a conclusion shortly.</P>
    <P>Mature students are still being dealt with under the special scheme for the colleges.  This has been adapted to take account of the new fee structure.  School leavers who secure places in the colleges and who satisfy the means test requirements for higher education grants but not the academic requirements may still avail of the loan schemes administered by the Department.</P>
    <P>Subhead 3 includes a sum of £500,000 for special assistance for schools in disadvantaged areas.  This is a continuation of a scheme initiated in 1984.  Since then a total of 155 schools catering for approximately 50,000 pupils have been assisted through the programme.  Benefits include special grants for the purchase of books and equipment, the sponsorship of home-school-community liaison initiatives, special inservice training for teachers, funds for the relief of school debts for special disadvantaged urban areas and grants for the purchase of equipment for pre-schools for travellers' children.</P>
    <P>Subhead C8 provides for both the special educational project involving Rutland Street national school and the special education projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The net provision sought for the Vote for post primary education is £498.558 million, 9 per cent more than 1986.  The secondary teachers' incremental salary grant will cost £205.7 million in 1987. Allowances for posts of responsibility and special functions will cost £12.6 million, qualification allowances £10.8 million and substitution and part time teachers £4.2 million.  A sum of £133.652 million is being provided for annual grants to vocational education committees.  In addition, £20.829 million will be received from youth employment levy funds in respect of vocational preparation and <Col N="2098" /> training programmes and other ESF-aided courses and a further £12.3 million will accrue to committees from fees and other income.  The total expenditure being provided for is therefore of the order of £167 million.  The bulk of this money is required to meet the pay costs of the committees' programme.  Other costs include third-level VEC student scholarships, grants to students on ESF-aided courses, servicing of capital building loans raised before 1983, youth and sport activities, local contributions for community schools, as well as heat, light, maintenance and other general expenses.</P>
    <P>Grants to secondary school authorities will amount to £31.5 million.  It has been decided to reclassify as capital the greater portion of the grants paid towards the cost of equipment.  The reclassified element of these grants will be a charge on subhead G1 for 1987.</P>
    <P>A new comprehensive school is scheduled to open in 1987.  This will bring the number of comprehensive and community schools to 60, 16 comprehensive schools and 44 community schools.  These schools cater for approximately 39,400 full-time students at the moment.  The £46.8 million being provided represents an increase of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The number of full-time third-level students in the RTCS and technological colleges continues to rise.  In addition to the £53.8 million provided for these colleges in subhead D2, £7.761 million will be received from youth employment levy funds in respect of middle-level technicians courses and a further £10.3 million will accrue from fees and other income.  Total expenditure on the colleges in 1987 will be about £71.9 million. The revenue from tuition fees represents only 12 per cent of the total cost of education services in these colleges compared with an estimated 25 per cent in the case of the universities.  At present approximately three out of every four students in the technological sector have their fees paid by the State, either by way of vocational education committee scholarships or higher education grants or through the expansion of the ESF-aided scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> £38 million is included for second-level capital building.  Since the introduction of free post-primary education there has been a very substantial investment in the building of secondary, vocational and comprehensive/community schools. Despite the falling birth rate which will soon be evident in primary school enrolments it will be some time before this is felt at post-primary level.  Rationalisation will, therefore, be of crucial significance and, as I outlined earlier in this speech and in the debate just concluded, it is a topic I am embracing with some fervour.</P>
    <P>The special schools covered by the Vote for Special Schools are not those catering for the mentally and physically handicapped but the special centres for young offenders namely Finglas Children's Centre, St. Joseph's, Clonmel, Trinity House, Lusk, and Cuan Mhuire, Whitehall, Dublin.  These centres will accommodate up to 190 boys and 10 girls in 1987.  They employ a staff of about 200 including 100 child-care workers.  Salaries of the teaching staff are a charge on Subhead C1 of the Vote for Primary Education. The cost of maintaining a young person in these centres is substantial, ranging from just under £12,000 per annum at St. Joseph's, Clonmel, to over £50,000 at Trinity House.  Apart from the running costs of these centres, the other major provision is for capital amounting to £2.08 million.  This is mainly for the construction of new residential and administrative accommodation at St. Joseph's, Clonmel.  Other projects include additional security fencing at Trinity House and alterations to Fingas Children's Centre.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Higher Education includes provision for grants-in-aid of the Higher Education Authority and of the recognised institutions of higher education which are funded through the HEA.  It includes provision also for grants-in-aid for other institutions such as the Dublin Dental Hospital and Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  The net amount sought for this vote is £124.644 million.  Grants towards the general <Col N="2100" /> expenses of the Higher Education Authority itself will amount to £509,000.</P>
    <P>The non-capital grants to the institutions funded through the HEA will amount to £106.604 million.  A further £40.7 million will accrue to these institutions from student fees and other income, making a total amount available for current expenditure of over £147 million, an increase of more than 6 per cent. Income from student fees accounts for about 25 per cent of the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The provision for capital grants for the HEA institutions comes to £13.9 million. Expenditure will be incurred on final accounts for projects already completed, for example, NIHE Limerick, Albert College extension at NIHE Dublin and UCD Library extension and on projects in progress such as the School of Engineering at UCD.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that we have such a short time for this Estimate.  On previous occasions we had more time to discuss education.  However, I undertook to provide an analysis of the policy points I have hoped to outline.  Of necessity I must now compress them into six minutes.  It does not give me any joy to have to read a speech because I prefer to speak informally.  However, the question of money and its precise allocation is one that must be faithfully recorded.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline some initiatives I intend to take during my term of office as Minister for Education.  These initiatives will encompass all sectors of the education service and will predominantly concentrate on short and medium term strategies relating to specific practical issues.  The first is the primary curriculum.  The principal educational objective which I hope to achieve in my term of office as Minister for Education is the undertaking and completion of a review of the primary curriculum.  This review is one of the key objectives outlined by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It has been my personal aspiration for some years, as I have indicated on many occasions, most recently in a public forum, at the teachers' conferences at Easter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> The present curriculum was introduced into our primary schools in 1971.  It was widely welcomed at the time by all concerned in the education process and over the intervening years has brought about substantial change.  All those involved in this area will agree that a review of these developments after 16 years is both appropriate and timely to analyse its successes and identify what difficulties, if any, have arisen.  I would like to pay tribute at this point to the enormous contribution the primary teachers have made to the development of education over all these years in implementing this new curriculum.  They have successfully created a very positive attitude towards school itself and the whole learning process and have removed from students' minds any fears they may have had about school.</P>
    <P>As I have said I propose to initiate this review in the near future.  It will be a joint review involving the Interim CEB and my own Department, whose members will be advisers to the review committee. The review will take into account research data already existing on the primary school curriculum, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of work and to ensure that the review will proceed as effectively and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In my view it will be necessary to have an acceleration in the process of school rationalisation.  In order that everyone be fully aware of developments in this area which have already taken place in recent years, I will be publishing an account of the rationalisation process to date.  This will be published in conjunction with an assessment of demographic trends.  Subsequent to this I will be seeking submissions as to how this can be progressed within a five-year period.  It is worth reminding ourselves that in the ten years 1974-75 to 1984-85 enrolments rose by 26 per cent in second-level schools while the number of schools fell by 17.  As well as eliminating unnecessary duplication of resources, co-operation between the schools in the same area can make for a greater range of subject options in a very cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>Planning for the future is crucial for the <Col N="2102" /> successful development of the education service.  When this programme is well under way, it will then perhaps be appropriate to examine the possibility of local education structures for the country.</P>
    <P>My third objective is inservice teacher training, one of the fundamental elements of the entire education service is the area of inservice training, including that of retraining.  Current educational developments in technology, sciences and the arts as well as changes in society have highlighted the very real need for such developments.</P>
    <P>One should underline a new and growing feature of the teaching profession &mdash; the fact that the age profile of its members will gradually become an older one.  This is occurring already and will give rise to a major demand for retraining by these teachers in the near future.  It is essential, therefore, that we begin to address this problem and anticipate in such retraining what new skills will be required.  The first step will be an updating of the available information and strategies and I hope to commence this in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of modern languages.  The position of modern continental languages, other than French, in schools has been a source of particular concern to many, including the business community, over recent years.  Our involvement in Europe has not resulted to date in any major change in the status of some languages in the schools.  The recent accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC underlines clearly the relatively isolated position of Spanish in schools as well as that of, say, German and Italian.  I propose to initiate a series of discussions with those directly involved in the teaching of these languages, as well as representatives of the business world, and those involved with the EC Commission. I hope from this to be in a position to establish a programme of language study appropriate to the needs of the students of the nineties.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  Since becoming Minister, and indeed long before that, I have become aware of the high level of <Col N="2103" /> responsibility and commitment exerted by the Interim Board in relation to the carrying out of its complex remit over two levels of education.  I welcome this opportunity to pay public tribute to its chairperson and to each of its members, to its executive officers and to all those involved in its many committees.</P>
    <P>The position of the interim CEB is currently due for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their graciousness.</P>
      <P>Third level is another area, in terms of education provision, in which vital and significant developments are already in progress.  A task force was established in 1986 to examine admission procedures to third level education and also the administrative procedures in relation to grants and scholarships.  I spoke at length on this point last week in answer to a question and there is no point in going over that again.  The report is expected to issue shortly and the next stage will follow on that.  The report will be a source of very valuable information, while also codifying and making the admission and administrative procedures much easier.</P>
      <P>Another recent development of major significance for third level students is the adoption of the Erasmus project, which I spoke about last week.  This programme is designed to increase the mobility of students throughout the EC by increased co-operation between educational institutions. A sum of £65 million will be allocated by Europe to this project over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>I should like to make three final points.</P>
      <P>First, when I visited the teachers' conferences this year one of the points raised at all the conferences was the question of a Teaching Council.  The desire of the teachers to have a professional institution to monitor their profession appears to me to be a worthwhile one.  I would like very much to develop this idea and with that in mind I have invited the teacher unions to meet me so that we can discuss the feasibility of such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I have requested the reestablishment of the Equality Working Party of my Department &mdash; which seemed to lapse in the previous administration &mdash; in order to identify current problems in this area and to submit to me proposals which will improve the equalisation of education provision.  This area is one for which I have ensured that <Col N="2105" /> money be made available, as real equality of opportunity is an objective I regard as of major importance for my term of office.  I am very happy with the progress realised through the current initiative in the sciences and I will be investigating the possibility of a further extension of this programme in the near future.</P>
    <P>As you can see, in my term of office I intend to achieve specific and concrete reforms in the education service and also to set down equally specific objectives to be achieved within a realisable timespan. We have a sound education system in this country and with the co-operation of so many committed and dedicated persons who are in the education area we can develop and improve the already high standards for which the Irish education system is so well known.  Within our limited resources, the Government and I are determined to provide the best possible programmes for our young people.</P>
    <P>Let me thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the provision of extra time and I thank the Members also.  I record my honour at being allocated the post of Minister for Education.  I give a commitment to this House and to the country that I will endeavour to work to the best of my ability to carry out the remit which has been given to me.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt not to take more than five minutes extra, like the Minister.  Much has been said as the Minister has pointed out about education cuts.  In my view, not half enough has been said, and the Minister has said almost nothing about education cuts.  I intend to concentrate on the real situation facing education.  This Minister presented this evening the most draconian cuts ever known in the history of Irish education.  She has started her term of office disastrously.  In her statements, frequently in the media, and again this evening the Minister talks about 11 per cent plus growth in spending.  That is totally misleading.  Nearly 100 per cent <Col N="2106" /> of that increase has gone to meet the increase in teachers' salaries and pensions. The increase for primary and secondary teachers alone is £78 million. With over 8,000 community, comprehensive and vocational teachers in the system, the total increase for all categories of teachers is approaching £100 million.  This excludes pay increases at third level or bodies such as training colleges:</P>
      <P>I mention that fact as it is very relevant to the debate.  The non-pay provision &mdash; the nuts and bolts of education, the class equipment, materials, books, heating, cleaning &mdash; all have been reduced in real terms, as well as the grants to adult literacy organisations, grants for travellers' children, and &mdash; most disquieting of all &mdash; the grant to help the children of those deprived families in inner city primary schools in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  School transport charges have been increased again.  The Minister when answering a question in the Dáil refused to guarantee the same level of service in September.  She has plunged the examination system back ten years by throwing all the progress towards computerisation out the window.  On top of all these cuts &mdash; which since 31 March the Minister has desperately tried to hide &mdash; she has demanded huge cuts in the pay and non-pay bills of RTCs, the Dublin colleges and the universities, the fastest-growing area in education where the ratios are already very poor.</P>
      <P>This all amounts to a very sad failure at the Cabinet table.  It is sad for education, sad for young people and their parents, sad for teachers and management &mdash; these groups who were eagerly assured by this Minister and her leader that education was &ldquo;special&rdquo; and that the very minor Fine Gael cuts were &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; and could not be contemplated. Then we were treated on radio on the excellent &ldquo;Education Forum&rdquo; programme at the end of April to the Minister's assertion that there was &ldquo;growth in every area&rdquo;.  That statement is, and was, false: false when it was made and false still.  I intend to show that it was false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> Never was there such a betrayal of trust, such a cynical misuse of democracy, as the performance of Fianna Fáil in the education area before and after the election of February 1987.  For four and a half years, this Minister opposed all and every measure which I took or which was taken by my successor, to improve the efficiency and logic of education spending, and she called for more spending in every area.  In particular, she championed the cause of teachers' pay and led the call for giving a full £75 million extra to the teachers.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign Fianna Fáil candidates attended mass meetings of education groups and assured them that Fianna Fáil would never contemplate education cuts as suggested by Fine Gael, but would restore any cuts over the previous years.  If that was not enough, the Taoiseach Deputy Haughey went on the `This Week' radio programme on 15 February &mdash; two days before the election &mdash; to assure the nation that &ldquo;the cuts would be counter-productive; the Government would lose more in the end than they would by not proceeding with them&rdquo;.  With that piece of dishonest gobbledegook, he gave the teacher unions and the &ldquo;Partners in Education&rdquo; campaign great comfort, as evidenced by the secondary teachers' publication <i>Astir</i> March 1987, which details the total assurances of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Haughey to them.  <i>The Irish Press</i> headline the next day read &ldquo;Haughey pledge on school cuts is welcomed&rdquo; and quoted him as pledging to reverse the cutbacks because they would cause &ldquo;absolute devastation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All these assurances were given in the full knowledge of the financial situation of the country, made clear by Fine Gael in unmistakeable form in the January budget.  There was, quite simply, a cold, calculated series of manoeuvres by Fianna Fáil to get power at any price, irrespective of who got hurt.</P>
    <P>On 31 March &mdash; budget day &mdash; the confidence trick was complete.  Not only were the minor cuts in Fine Gael's budget <Col N="2108" /> implemented, with one exception costing a few hundred thousand pounds, but a further £11 million at least was chopped off education.  It is indeed a sorry story and an eloquent testimony to this Minister's inability to protect this most sensitive of areas in the face of the implacable, uncaring attitude of this Fianna Fáil Government towards our young people.</P>
    <P>No wonder she has tried to conceal the cuts.  No wonder she has stalled every inquiry at Question Time with bland, continual waffling and no wonder she waits until the schools have closed and teachers have dispersed before she comes out with the teacher allocations for September &mdash; teachers who have just been told that any new appointments will be temporary and that no job is secure.</P>
    <P>My job as Opposition spokesperson is to make the Minister deal honestly with her brief and to let the education world know exactly what is going on because it is clear the Minister is afraid to do so.</P>
    <P>Let us examine some of the cuts in these Estimates.  First, £500,000 taken from subhead A. 3 for Vote 30, by stopping the computerisation of the certificate examinations.  To quote the Minister on 13 June 1986 at column 2206 of the Official Report: &ldquo;I welcome this development, particularly in relation to the examination results&rdquo;.  This was the most cost efficient administrative procedure planned by the Department, initiated by me, supported by my Cabinet colleagues as the logical and essential step it was.  It is a nonsense to talk, as the Minister has done, about entry to third level being improved while the lynchpin of that process has been removed.</P>
    <P>Second, school transport, subhead D. 3, £700,000 gone, school transport charges increased again and the Minister's refusal in a parliamentary question to guarantee even a proper service for September.  Who will ever forget the Minister's hand wringing and protests and Dáil motions over school transport? Third, subhead D. 8, £76,000 gone for the Curriculum and Examinations Board. This is a monstrous cut when the schools are crying out for reform and updating. <Col N="2109" /> Fourth, subhead E. 1, a cut of £100,000, for cultural and educational bodies.  What this really means is adult literacy education, but more of that later.</P>
    <P>Primary Education &mdash; subhead A. 1 &mdash; training colleges &mdash; £250,000 gone; and this from a Minister who has vociferously championed the reopening and retention of Carysfort College.  The silence on that is deafening.  Subhead C. 3 (2) &mdash; a cut of £230,000 for those poorest primary schools which the Minister now asserts do not need the money, at a time of the freezing of the capitation grants &mdash; which she only mentioned when I dragged it out of her in a Dáil question.  Subhead C. 4 (4) &mdash; library grants &mdash; a cut of £120,000, a drastic more than 50 per cent reduction on this already inadequate provision for primary schools, again, hidden and not mentioned.  The Minister should be ashamed of herself.</P>
    <P>Post-Primary Education &mdash; Vote 32: A. 1 &mdash; secondary teachers &mdash; £1.0 million gone.  Does this mean no guidance or remedial teachers this year, or is it a pseudo saving?  I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what that means.  Subhead A. 2 &mdash; £1,064,000 for vocational committees gone.  How can the Minister reconcile this savage cut on vocational schools with her constant eulogising of vocational education?  How long will the Fianna Fáil-controlled committees stay silent and refuse to defend their students? In this section of the Estimates, £500,000 is taken from the community and comprehensive schools' running costs, £3,100,000 from the RTCs, £2.65 million from the universities.  Those cuts amount to the most devastating attack on third level education ever known in the history of the State.  Never was there such a demand for third level education and that demand will grow inexorably every year until 1995, as the Minister well knows. What do she or her Government care for the chances of these young people who will be squeezed out of education by the simple inability of the institutions to cope with the massive staff cuts and obsolete equipment?</P>
    <P>In volume terms the cut of 4 per cent by 1988 in the gross pay of the staff of all <Col N="2110" /> third level institutions, recently conveyed to the institutions, will have horrendous consequences for the development of this fastest growing sector.  Allowing for the normal incremental progression of third level staff and the full effect in 1988 of the present national wage agreement, it is clear that staff cuts of 6 per cent to 7 per cent will be necessary from next September-October if the institutions are to achieve the Government's target.  With student numbers increasing by 4 per cent to 5 per cent per annum, it is obvious that student numbers will have to be seriously curtailed, staff will have to become redundant and/or suffer a severe cut in salary.  When will the Minister announce the reality of all this?  When will the students and the parents be told what this really means?</P>
    <P>I would like to make some further comments on these cuts.  Almost a year ago, on 13 June 1986, the Minister, then an experienced and presumably expert spokesperson on Education said in the Dáil &ldquo;Everyone would share the philosophical view that the money should go, first of all, to the disadvantaged and in particular the disadvantaged in primary schools because there it all begins&rdquo;.  And later, criticising my increase of the fund to £750,000 as being too small, she said: &ldquo;But while that amount has increased, so has the problem, which means that the money spread among the number of pupils needing aid is very small&rdquo;&mdash; columns 2201 and 2202 of the Official Report.  I could not have said it better myself, and then she cuts £230,000 off these same children.  It is below contempt.</P>
    <P>Itinerant children are no longer a priority either.  The great progress we made for them is being attacked and undone.  A despairing Sister Colette, that champion of the travelling people, tells me that in Offaly, Navan, Wicklow, Carlow, Mayo, Clondalkin, County Dublin, every day the travellers' centres are being told by the CEOs of the vocational education committees that their grants are either gone altogether or <Col N="2111" /> drastically reduced.  And yet in a parliamentary question last week the Minister informed me that she is &ldquo;unaware&rdquo; of any CEOs telling of cuts.  That is not good enough: it is crassly uncaring.</P>
    <P>The organisations dealing with adult literacy, in particular NALA, have been dealt a sudden and demoralising blow by the Minister by a massive cutback in their resources, as well as Aontas, the People's College and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, all being cut by amounts which are tiny by national standards but huge by the budgets these mostly voluntary bodies, are trying to run on &mdash; £17,500 for Aontas, £6,000 for the People's College, £11,500 for the Dublin Institute for Adult Education, £7,000 for the ICA, and £13,500 for the National Adult Literacy Agency.  I hope the Minister will never burden us again in the House with talk of her own or her Government's concern for the weakest in this country.  This is the same Minister who said in this House on 13 June 1986: &ldquo;We cannot live any longer with this staggering rate of illiteracy since we view ourselves as a modern country with a very advanced education system&rdquo;, (column 2206 of the Official Report).  The Minister's posturing, and her honeyed words over the past few years will haunt her every day and I will make sure they do.</P>
    <P>The biggest cuts, the pay and non-pay in the vocational, community and comprehensive schools, the RTCs., and the universities, represent a U-turn of staggering proportions.  It will tax the ingenuity of all those managements to run their services at present levels, let alone deal with increased numbers.  March 31 was a black day for Irish students and the education system, the day when it was clearly seen that education had no champion at Cabinet, and when the particular protection given to our young people and their parents by Fine Gael and the last Government was seen in retrospect as resolute and caring.</P>
    <P>Having made a disastrous beginning, the Minister needs to do something to rescue her reputation.  There is another side to the education coin, the curriculum <Col N="2112" /> and administrative reform which is so desperately needed and which has been put in place for the Minister to act swiftly and decisively.  The signs are ominous, and already some dreadful and backward-looking decisions have been made.</P>
    <P>I am horrified that the transition year option has been scrapped.  This was one of the most progressive decisions made over the last four years, welcomed by everyone, including the Minister.  For the Minister to state, &ldquo;I am pleased to be able to continue the transition year this year for the 74 schools despite the financial problems we face&rdquo; is nothing but cynicism, seeing that any expenditure for the pupils enrolling in transition year this year, and the <i>per capita</i> grant, could not arise until September 1989.  Therefore, the Minister obviously concedes cutbacks like this for the next few years.  The Minister said also when announcing her decision to refuse all new applications for transition year, &ldquo;When the transition year had been sanctioned for the 74 schools last year, no financial provision was made for it, so I am pleased to be able to provide the finances.&rdquo; Either the Minister is ignorant of the workings of the transition year or she is being dishonest: either proposition is a sorry state of affairs.  In the Dáil, almost exactly a year ago, while in Opposition, she waxed eloquent and at great length about the transition year.  In a long exhortation to provide resources and allow all schools immediately to have transition years, she said, &ldquo;the Government should prepare a programme and provide the resources so that all schools still anxious to participate in the scheme will be able to do so from September.&rdquo; No wonder the schools flooded the Minister with applications &mdash; only to be told last week that not one new application would be granted, a disastrous, fundamentally backward decision which all the accusations or self-justification do not hide.</P>
    <P>The second area I want to touch on is the standing and achievements of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  No State Board ever justified their existence so rapidly and so devotedly than this board.  They have produced reports on <Col N="2113" /> major areas of the curriculum and have set in place the new junior cycle certificate and assessment system which is ready and needs the Minister's sanction. Now the education world waits to see if this Minister will grasp the nettle and bring in the legislation to make the board a statutory part of our education development, so that a dynamic and continual flow of ideas from all areas &mdash; education, business, agriculture and the social partners &mdash; will continually enrich the process of evolution which must go on in the education system.  To my dismay, £76,000 has been taken from the budget for the board in a year when there is great work to be done.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 this Minister has been calling for curriculum reform, for strengthening the board, for improving their resources.  As reported at columns 2209 and 2210 of the Official Report of 13 June 1986, she said &ldquo;I am not suggesting that the Department should rush the legislation but I hope it will be ready for the autumn.&rdquo; She went on to say, &ldquo;We should give the Curriculum and Examinations Board the resources it needs to implement recommendations.&rdquo; The legislation was ready and published in the autumn.  The Minister, so often on record for praising the board's work, must keep faith with the education world and speedily bring in that legislation.</P>
    <P>The board must know where they stand; they must be clear that their functions will include both curriculum and assessment examinations &mdash; as the Minister knows, one without the other is simply meaningless.  The inspectorate of the Department need to be released from the crushing burden of work on the examination system so that they can return to their primary task &mdash; of helping schools and teachers to develop and interpret the curriculum as taught in the schools, and encourage the pursuit of excellence in the classrooms.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister today to stop stalling, to make the brave step of overcoming the counsellors of conservatism and the <i>status quo</i> both inside and outside the Department and to bring to this House the Bill she welcomed last November in <Col N="2114" /> its entirety.  She will have my full support. The consequences of any further delay on this are unthinkable &mdash; a disillusioned board and a further depressed education system.</P>
    <P>We mentioned earlier the question of RTCs and VECs in the context of the Green Paper proposals so I will not go into that again.</P>
    <P>Despite her attack on the funding of education seen at its most severe in its setback for technological specialists and computer areas in the RTCs and the Dublin Colleges and her attack on the disadvantaged &mdash; in complete contradiction to the claims for technological education made in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto &mdash; the Minister may have some opportunities to rescue her crumbling reputation.  Let her work for the summer months on a rapid response to the reform needs of the system, let her throw aside the traditional Fianna Fáil fear of any legislation which was not thought of first by them, and let her show that her four years on this side of the House was not entirely wasted.  It defies belief that she should say in reply to a parliamentary question and referring to the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board, &ldquo;My intention is to study all the initiatives in curriculum reform which have taken place over the last ten to 15 years before deciding how future curriculum development and related activities should be structured.&rdquo; That is the answer of someone who is either ignorant or afraid of the great work done by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  I do not believe the Minister really meant those depressing and gloomy words.  They would put a dead hand on educational progress.</P>
    <P>They are a complete and unexplained contradiction of her anxiety in Opposition to proceed with the legislation.  To undertake the work that needs to be done in education needs a resolute and courageous Minister advised by people inside and outside the Department who care enough to challenge the <i>status quo.</i> Despite the ominous signs to the contrary, I cling to the hope that this Minister will be such a Minister.  If so, I look <Col N="2115" /> forward to an autumn and winter of dynamism and excitement in education.  If not, it will be a massive failure.  I hope the Minister will not let us down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little intrigued to hear the Minister announce that it gave her pleasure to introduce the Estimate for Education.  I am sorry it does not give me any pleasure to respond to her speech as it could hardly give anybody pleasure to talk about an Estimate which envisages very serious and severe cutbacks for young people.  It is a big change from the time when money on education was seen as an investment.  We talked about growth and investment in education and when we see budgeting in those terms it is very sad to be brought to the point where we have cutbacks on such a scale.</P>
      <P>It is intriguing to see that these cutbacks, severe as they will be, have been totally overshadowed by the overwhelming effect of the health cuts.  Very little attention has been given to the education budget to date but this Estimate, with its severe surgery on an already amputated education budget, is a bit like the phoney war, its effects will not be felt until September when outrage will be expressed by parents, teachers and children as they try to confront them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the litany of cuts outlined by Deputy Hussey, it is obvious that they are a series of very minor savings to the Exchequer.  They will have no substantial effect on Exchequer spending but will have a severe and corrosive effect on the education system, much of which will be crippled and create problems for young people which will cost us dearly in future years.  To illustrate my point, I have no better person to support me than the Taoiseach.  I will quote from the radio programme &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on the Sunday prior to the last general election, already referred to by Deputy Hussey.  Deputy Haughey was asked if he would go ahead with Coalition cutbacks and he responded by saying that in so far as the education cutbacks were <Col N="2116" /> concerned he thought it was quite obvious that they would be counter-productive and that if the Government pursued those cutbacks they would lose more than they would gain.  I could hardly put the point better.  The cutbacks as envisaged and applied will lose for the education system and the Exchequer a great deal more than they would gain.  If the cutbacks proposed by the outgoing Government were expected by the Taoiseach to be counter-productive how much more counter-productive will the cutbacks of his own Minister be?  A further £11 million is being extracted from the Education budget this year.  How can you extract that much money without causing severe hardship?</P>
    <P>People who will suffer most from these cutbacks are those already deprived, the disadvantaged and those who live in underprivileged circumstances.  The cutbacks as applied to the vocational education committees I find rather strange. The Minister has never lost an opportunity to praise the work of those schools. In the previous debate here this evening and the debate on the Private Members' Bill she went out of he way to be ecstatic in her praise of what was done by vocational schools.  Unfortunately, her estimation of those schools does not reflect itself in the budgetary provisions for those schools in the coming year. Many of the schools under the vocational education system will be called upon to make savings of as much as 50 per cent of their running costs in the coming year. How on earth does the Minister expect savings on that scale to be made?  How will they be implemented?  Or is it envisaged that the lights would be switched off at about 2.30 p.m. on a November evening, or that the heat would be cut down in January, or that young people would be expected to bring to school with them wood for their woodwork classes and metal for their metal work classes?</P>
    <P>How are vocational schools expected to live on the budget that they will be given in the coming year?  They do not have the range of options open to them that other schools might have. Vocational schools, because of their very <Col N="2117" /> location, cannot appeal to parents to supplement their education budgets. Parents in these areas do not have that amount of money and certainly do not have it for education.  These parents, in common with most parents these days, are already put to the pin of their collar to provide for their youngsters moneys for schoolbooks, which are disgracefully expensive, for school uniforms, examination fees and all the other essential costs that go with education, without being asked to provide additional moneys to supply essential things like heating, lighting and chalk.  Or will the teachers be expected to buy their own chalk, as they did in the bad old days?  I see no way whatever that vocational education schools can be expected to live within the budget being given to them this year.</P>
    <P>As for all second level schools, I fail to see how they can manage with the teacher allocation that will be theirs when they open in September.  Even as things stood, most schools were feeling badly the pinch of cutbacks in teacher allocation.  They see no justification whatever, nor do I, for reduction in teacher numbers.  What is there to justify this?  There is no evidence in second level schools that pupil numbers are on the decrease; as a matter of fact they are not.  The Minister said earlier that pupil numbers will be on the decrease in primary schools and that is so, if certain populations trends continue as they expect them to, but there is no decrease whatever in the pupil entry into second level schools.</P>
    <P>In some schools the number of students seeking admission is continuing to rise. How can these schools be expected to cope, with their reduced allocation of teachers?  How can they provide the range of subjects expected of them?  How can they cope with the constant demand for new courses such as vocational preparation and training programmes and transition year programmes?  How can they make provision for the additional continental languages of which the Minister spoke?  How can they make provision for the greater emphasis demanded for education in the area of social relationships, health education, including <Col N="2118" /> drug awareness and all the new area with which teachers are expected to cope in the days in which we live?  How can they possibly cope with those demands and yet contend with a reduced teacher allocation? I do not know if it is possible.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a time when we want to put increased emphasis on science and technology and there is now a greater demand for equality of subject choices as between boys and girls.  How is that demand going to be met?  There is greater demand for new and more effective ways of getting a worthwhile education for weaker pupils.  We are looking for new forms of assessment such as oral examinations in French.  How can we cope with those demands on reduced teacher allocation?</P>
    <P>How can the Minister propose to implement her own election promises, fine and lofty as they were?  I would remind her of some of those promises. She promised to reactivate links between post-primary schools and industry &mdash; a very worthwhile objective but where is the wherewithal to put it in being?  She promised to put more emphasis on science and language teaching and asked schools to offer a second European language to assist in our export marketing &mdash; a very worthy objective, but how is it to be achieved?  She promised to reduce the pupil-teacher ratios at primary level and progressively to do so at post-primary level.  She said that she would introduce more reforms and innovations and make provisions for them and would put more emphasis on the teaching of the Irish language.  All these were very definite promises made by the Minister during the course of the last election campaign. They were promises that gave us all hope that the future of education would be brighter and better.  What good are these promises now when the resources are not being put in place to enable them to be implemented?  Surely these objectives were difficult enough to achieve under existing resources but they will be impossible with the severely reduced resources provided in this budget.</P>
    <P>Some of the major achievements of recent years stand to be scuttled by the <Col N="2119" /> provisions of this budget.  Having criticised her predecessors from the Opposition benches for four years, the Minister now stands to undermine some of the Coalition Government's more important achievements, achievements like the development of vocational preparation and training programmes, the introduction of the six year cycle through the Ages for Learning policy, the development of the transition year option.  Each of these changes was a forced modernisation and improvement within our schools.  With few resources and with the transition year option programme suspended for all new schools, can any guarantee be given that, having accepted each of these changes, schools will not now be in a much worse position two or three years down the road than they were before the Minister took over?  This worries me deeply.</P>
    <P>Having given an election commitment to the development of the Curriculum and Examinations Board on a statutory basis, what does the Minister now propose to do about that board?  This is a question which is being asked very legitimately by Deputy Hussey.  How long is this board to continue to be an interim board?  How soon is it to be given the kind of budget that will give it the teeth to bring about the very necessary reforms in our educational system?  I see the development of this board as being the key to all educational reform, the key to bringing our educational system in line with modern educational systems in every other developed country.  It cannot and will not function if it is not provided with a proper statutory status on the one hand and if it is not given the proper financial resources on the other.  I see no evidence at all in this Estimate that either is being provided and that saddens me deeply.</P>
    <P>I am greatly heartened to hear that the Minister plans to make provision for the introduction of in-service courses for teachers.  That is a very good investment in the work force, and is absolutely essential if the aims and objectives of the Curriculum and Examinations Board are to <Col N="2120" /> be achieved at any level.  I welcome that very sincerely and hope it will be taken in conjunction with the development of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  That is the key to the development of all future educational policy.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the effects of the Government cutbacks will be as follows: temporary teachers will replace full time teachers in redeployment programmes in 1988 and 1989.  That may sound innocuous in theory, but in practice it will mean that good teachers will be pulled out of the schools, that there will be inevitable increases in class sizes and inevitable restrictions on subject options.  Already there are classes almost up to 40 in some post-primary schools.  The result of all this is and inevitably will be that discipline problems, already harrowing for most teachers, will increase as class sizes increase and as pupils become disaffected and lose interest through lack of personal attention from teachers.  Teachers will inevitably become more and more demoralised as they see their jobs being valued less and less by virtue of the very low commitment of resources by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Instead of an increase in the number of European languages being taught, there will, in fact, be a decrease; this is happening already.  There is already a significant reduction in the number of children being offered German as a subject in second level schools.  This has been the subject of concern.  This concern has been voiced by bodies like the Confederation of Irish Industry and it was mentioned by the Minister in her pre-election promises.  Yet I cannot see how it can be met.  The saddest part of all is that more pupils will leave school with poor results as a result of these cutbacks. What will happen to these pupils?  The lucky ones will be taken into AnCO courses which cost around £6,000 per course.  Where is the saving there?  I can see no saving.</P>
    <P>I welcome very sincerely the commitment the Minister has made as reported in this morning's papers and in her speech this evening to the development of primary education.  There is no <Col N="2121" /> doubt that primary education is the cornerstone of our educational system.  If we have a sound and good primary system the remainder of the system can take heart from that.  If we have a poor, neglected and under financed primary system, the remainder of the system will suffer.  I am very glad the Minister has made a commitment that during her term of office she will give increased resources and attention to the primary school system.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to set up a review body to review the primary school curriculum.  I remember the introduction of the curriculum in 1971.  It brought a sense of creativity, exploration and excitement to primary schools.  It helped in no small way to brighten up primary schools and to make them pleasant places for young people.  That curriculum was a great success by any standard.  Of course, that does not mean that the time is not now ripe to review it.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned quite frequently in recent years that a number of children come to post primary school level not ready and not having the basic skills to the degree demanded of them in post primary schools.  The reason for this may be that even the brightest of young children leave primary school too soon. These children would benefit from remaining for one additional year in the post primary school system.  I hope that possibility will not be overlooked.  The problem of the transition from primary school to post primary school &mdash; from a child centred curriculum to a subject centred curriculum with all the tensions it creates &mdash; could be eliminated if there was a more child centred approach to teaching in the junior stages of post primary schools.</P>
    <P>My main concern is for the young people who leave school after seven, eight or nine years without having mastered the most basic skills of numeracy or literacy.  If the Minister does nothing else during her term of office, I hope she takes every step open to her to ensure that in the future no child leaves the educational system without at least having mastered the very minimum skills <Col N="2122" /> of reading, writing and arithmetic &mdash; numeracy, literacy and basic life skills.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that we have to demand the kind of money we are looking for for adult literacy programmes.  These programmes would not arise in the first instance if we were paying proper attention to the primary school programme. Many of the failures of the primary school system could be eliminated if we had a more sympathetic pupil-teacher ratio, if we had more pre-school programmes for children in disadvantaged areas, if we had an area based schools psychological and guidance programme and if we had generally an intervention programme that would catch these people before it was too late and give them remedial teaching at that level.</P>
    <P>If the Minister addresses herself to these problems she will grow in my estimation as the year goes on.  She comes in a line of very illustrious people who had a vision for education &mdash; people like Dr. Hillery, the late George Colley and the late Donogh O'Malley.  Those people had a vision, courage and commitment to education.  The Minister stands in line with those people and she has a great opportunity to emulate their successes and bring about a renaissance in education but she will not do this if she sets out to fashion the educational system to fit her budget; she must fit her budget to the educational system.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education, her predecessor and other Ministers have achieved a little in recent years addressing the question of sexism in education.  I want to get this out of the way rather quickly because it is one of the few achievements in education.  What I have to say will be relatively brief and direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience in this House and in the Seanad there are few other places in which I have found representative parliamentary democracy treated in a less forthcoming way than in matters of education. When I was a Member of Seanad Éireann I repeatedly asked for and got some guidance, but never specific information, despite being promised it as late as November 1986, on many features of the Irish educational system.  I asked what were the origins of the control of the system.  Advisers to the then Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, promised to write to me to tell me the origin of the patron system.  Not a line has appeared from them, nor will it ever appear.  Of <Col N="2124" /> course the word &ldquo;patron&rdquo; did not occur in the Minister's speech because there was not a line of philosophy in it.  There was no reference to the control of education as if it did not matter who controlled it, who paid for it, and who took the decisions.</P>
    <P>There was not a line in the speech about that much abused word the &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; of education even though it has affected the livelihood, the hiring, the promotion and the dispersal of teachers.  I am not only talking about a clerical ethos.  The subject has been discussed in the journals of education, as to whether the ethos of a school is critical, whether it believes in a romantic theory of education or in the idea of an authoritarian ethos and so on. It does not matter because that word will not be written into a Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I, like the other speakers wish I had hours in which to speak because I have rarely seen a more illiterate abuse of figures, the firing in of figures without any comparative base to previous years and proportions are not compared with proportions in other years.  What is the meaning of saying that consultancy services will cost £390,000 this year?  It is like saying that bullocks cost so much in Blessington today.  It is that level of insulting irrelevance to this House and, as a person interested in education, I object to it.  I object to the deceit in the figures, the conscious attempt to deceive this House by suggesting there are increases in educational provision when we know that if the figures were divided by the number of people involved in education there are actual reductions.  I am precluded by the Standing Orders of this House from describing what that presentation of facts constitutes, but it is obvious to anyone who wants to draw the conclusion.</P>
    <P>A lot of other matters are missing from this speech and it fills me with despair.  I join with all the others who have paid tribute to anyone who has ever taught.  I was a teacher and I consider it a great privilege.  Anyone who has spent a wet day in education knows that we are participating in an educational system that is one of the most unequal in Europe and I <Col N="2125" /> challenge the Minister of the day and her officials to disprove that fact.</P>
    <P>Can we answer the question, compared to other countries in Europe, can the children of a poor family here go to a national school and say that primary education is free of all charges for books or any other additional charge?  Can they say that every child is equal, that every child has an equal chance of finishing the second level cycle?  Can they deny that the child of a professional person has 18 times the chance of participating in third level education &mdash; I am not talking about finishing &mdash; and will they compare those facts with Europe?  I am expected to go &ldquo;ga ga&rdquo; in this House listening to people talking about review groups.  Where is the reference to the Clancy report in the Minister's speech?  What does that tell us about educational opportunities and inequality of opportunity?  Where is the reference to Hannan's work?  The list of scholars is endless, but always there will be this business that we will stay staring at the system and imagine it is equal when it is not.  At the end of this year, before the summer is out, before this Dáil will have resumed, quietly, so that questions cannot be asked they will have driven more working-class children away from educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>I want to finish this by referring to the paucity and the misery of the people who write these speeches.  What are their comments on the absence of creativity in the educational system?  I have four children attending primary school and I know something about primary education.  I welcome creativity wherever it occurs. What of the people who built all the buildings where walls are fixed and can never be moved back so that rooms might be used as a theatre, who put in floors that could never be danced upon, the people who never bothered about the acoustics of buildings, who organised, when I was Chairman of the Galway/Mayo Arts Committee a special competitive seminar on physical education because they told me that physical education had nothing to do with dance and drama or with modern movement? That miserable attitude is what has <Col N="2126" /> turned Irish education into what it is for so many people, a miserable experience deprived of joy and creativity.  It has made it so unfortunate for so many parents to look so often at how sad their children are when they come back from the depressing environment and the miserable authoritarian attitudes and the exclusion of parents from participation in education.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to all of that in the Minister's speech.  There is a lovely bland presentation about the involvement of parents.  Can parents be said to be involved in education here when they set their children down outside a wall with railings on top and let them go across the concrete yard into the school, and come out in lines, where a school has not a single room provided in which parents might meet and converse and be part of the educational process?  Of course, we had a brilliant reform, derived from God himself or his mother, and that was that they could become involved through either of the two denominational representative organisations, the parents' organisations.  One could come up through the National Catholic Parents' Association or its equivalent in relation to the Church of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my constituency today there are two children who have not gone to school for five weeks because their parents from the North of Ireland wanted them to go to a non-denominational school, wanted them to be treated outside the ethos of denominational education.  Listening to this lovely exchange this evening one would imagine there was no problem about non-denominational education.  I challenge the Minister to survey nationally the case for non-denominational and multi-denominational education in this country, and I will accept the findings but I object to being told that provision should not be made or that provision should be built into an existing system.  I certainly do not want to get involved in that argument again.  It is a preposterous idea that one could drag one's children out of the religion class and put them in the corridor, or let them out in the &ldquo;clós&rdquo; to be &ldquo;ag súgradh&rdquo; while the normal <Col N="2127" /> children went on, and then one could let them back into the class again.  Is that an allowance for freedom of expression?  Is it any wonder we have sectarian murders in Northern Ireland when we have that insular bigoted narrow outlook down here?</P>
    <P>I will come to the main thrust of what derives in some respects from the words of the great Eamon de Valera who once said we will have to put up with 10 per cent of the children of the country going to second level education while, at the same time, he was looking after his own family very well in the educational institutions of Ireland.  Thus it was in the fifties.  Thousands of people flocked out of this country, badly educated, educated to work in the building sites and live on the fringes of British society.  Of course that is what will happen now.</P>
    <P>I will use my remaining time to make a number of positive points.  In relation to the Estimate, I do not know who is trying to fool whom but there are a number of basic points which must be borne in mind.  The people who will be asked to take the major brunt of the cuts this autumn are the vocational sector. Maybe these figures are just figments of my imagination.  No doubt, the Minister's advisers will tell her how they work out and whether they are true, but the budget for 1987 provides for a £2 million reduction in the 1986 provision for second level VEC schools, a 4.8 per cent cut, a £500,000 reduction in the allocation to community and comprehensive schools, £10,000 roughly per school, a £1 million reduction in the RTCs services, and a £100,000 reduction in adult education services.  It also provides for school transport charges possibly being increased, vice-principal posts will no longer be ex quota, tariffs can be negotiated and it goes on.  Consider the areas in which cuts are being made.</P>
    <P>The Minister, speaking to the TUI conference in Bundoran, used the most sinister phrase of all.  Speaking to the teachers who worked in the TUI she said, &ldquo;The mainstream of your activities will be all <Col N="2128" /> right.  It is the peripheral activities that may have to be cut.&rdquo; Can the Minister, back from Bundoran and the heady days of the conference, tell us what peripheral activities are?  Is she referring to the courses that have been referred to already for literacy training for itinerant children?  Is she referring to courses for prisoners, to courses taken by women looking for a second chance in education, to courses taken at night by people who never had an opportunity of attending school?  Where did that phrase &ldquo;peripheral activities&rdquo; come from?  Those of us who have gone to the trouble of going to look at the vocational schools know very well that they are open earliest in the morning and latest at night.  They are controlled by the State.  An Act was passed in these Houses of the Oireachtas that made them more accountable than any other form of education, and it is to that section of education that the eyes of the Minister and her officials were directed in term of carrying the cuts.  Will the Minister tell us when replying whether part time posts are safe?  Will the posts of the 50 or 60 per cent of teachers who are part time, who provide education in those institutions, be safe? What of the people who were relying on special advantages and assistance?</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the kind of misery I am talking of.  Let me quote the figures lest people think I am using them inaccurately.  The aid towards buying books in primary schools in 1985 was £719, in 1986 it was £827 and in 1987 it is £846.  The capital grants towards the operating costs of a national school in 1985 was £13,236, in 1986 it was £14,445 and in 1987 it is £14,590, but there were other interesting items.  There was the question of buildings, furnishings and so forth.  I made a point in relation to the provision of assistance towards the question of the Irish language.  I do not believe in attacking any Minister, and I wish that the Minister had all the money in the world to spend on education, but it is time that Ministers for Education did one of two things.  We need time in this House to debate the philosophy of education and see where we agree or differ.  Let us <Col N="2129" /> see evidence that the work that is already done is being studied, is being advised to Ministers and is not being replicated by expensive review committees.  Secondly, are we happy to live in a society where we can continue to be sure that the children of the privileged, the professional classes, will know for certain that they will participate in third level education while those below those classes will have a different kind of educational experience? There is no point in running around with administrative riddle-me-ree to say that you are reproducing a classless society.</P>
    <P>We would all feel better, those of us who have children attending school, to know that before we die or before our children die there will be an opportunity to go to school, to be able to learn independently, to develop critical minds, to be able to participate not in an authoritarian culture but in an open, pluralist one, in buildings that are adaptable and flexible, that use music, that have art and creativity at the centre as the dominating needs of schooling.  We will never have that from the misery merchants who are producing one incomprehensible, badly written manual after another.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we would like to think that our children are not being produced as slaves for a labour market and told they are to be useful in one kind of skill one year and another kind of skill in another but that they will live as full persons educated for citizenship and told they have the right to practise democracy in school, not brought in a crocodile to see the likes of us taking decisions in Parliament, but educated to participate in democracy in the classroom, to take part in elections and learn how to treat minorities.  We would like to think that in relation to culture they will know the meaning of a pluralist and a liberal culture and will not be given a diet of authoritarian half versions of history.  We want them to experience the generosity, wonder and greatness of realising that all children are equal.  We do not want them in the final class in primary school to realise that a <Col N="2130" /> few of them will be going on for secondary, that another few of them will only go half way through secondary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I always shudder when I come in to speak following Deputy Michael Higgins who, because he has a far better flow and oratory to do so, expresses so very well many of the thoughts I have on education.</P>
      <P>The Irish education system both North and South is permeated by privilege and by an undemocratic and sectarian control. There is little doubt that most of our second and third level education is controlled by religious authorities.  In Northern Ireland that is also the case and we can see the terrible results there which are due partly to that kind of education. I often quote an interview I read some years ago in a magazine.  The interview was with one of the leaders of the provisional IRA, Mr. Danny Morrison, who pointed out that he believed that but for the existence of Roman Catholic schooling in Northern Ireland the terrible sectarian divisions that existed there and which his organisation so ably perpetuate in such a vicious way, could have died many years ago.  Obviously, the sectarian divisions and the viciousness of those divisions in Northern Ireland are not so plain in the South, in the Republic, but they are here.  We have sectarian education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2131" /> The Minister for Education in this House replying to a question of mine concerning the employment of teachers said that the people who control our schools, the religious orders, the Churches, have a right to demand that teachers be practising Catholics before they can be employed in the schools controlled by those religious orders.  The Minister is not prepared to take any action to reverse that decision of the managers of Catholic schools.  It is an ominous and serious development of which many parents are not aware.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of non-Catholics in my constituency who sought to send their child or children to a school run by a religious order.  One parent sought permission to have a child remain outside religious classes.  Despite the fact that the school concerned is almost fully funded by the State and the teachers' salaries paid by the State, that parent was told that unless she was prepared to allow her child to attend religious classes she need not bother bringing the child to the school at all.  That is a totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable facet of our educational system.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for the replacement of our present educational system by a modern, egalitarian, properly-funded and democratically-controlled one.  I am sure Deputy Higgins would agree with me that the likelihood of that taking place in the kind of society obtaining here today is practically nil, that it would be possible only in a Socialist society which has a more human approach to people in general.  I fervently hope and work for the day when the ethos of our schools will be a democratic one, rather than the ethos of any one Church whether that be Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or any other.  Neither should there be an objection to parents who may want to provide a particular type of religious education for their children. As a democrat, as people in this State who pride themselves on being democrats, I believe we must insist that a public education system is not dominated by any particular religion, that no school <Col N="2132" /> is established and publicly-funded on the basis of providing education of a particular religious ethos.</P>
    <P>To deal specifically with the Estimates before the House I am concerned that the present Minister and indeed the former one have attacked the education of children of the working classes.  It is not those people who can afford to send their children to fee-paying schools, or those who can afford to pay for the university education of their children who are being deprived of educational facilities; it is those who cannot afford to pay. It is significant that most of the educational system is paid for by the people who cannot afford to avail of its facilities. Yet we are told we must accept the present position, that it has obtained for generations and must continue.</P>
    <P>I know from personal knowledge that the fact that parents have to pay fees &mdash; which are called voluntary contributions &mdash; that the price of school books rises continously, that they must be replaced almost every year, that money must be found for school uniforms drives more and more families, many living on social welfare, into the hands of legal and illegal moneylenders.  There is even a proliferation of what might be described as the more respectable end of the money-lending market offering all kinds of schemes to parents to invest some savings so that they will be able to pay for their children's education.  At the lower end of the scale a family with three children existing on social welfare of approximately £90 a week will face bills next September of approximately £350 between school uniforms, fees and school books in addition to all the incidentals that will have to be met in the course of the school year for various pieces of equipment, outings and so on which are essential if the children are to be provided with any kind of a broader education.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she has not cut back the provision for education this year but all of those directly involved in education clearly indicate that she has done so.  I am sure there is hardly a Member of this House who has not received representations from those involved in the <Col N="2133" /> adult literacy area.  Equally I am sure there is not a Member who has not received representations from the Teachers' Union of Ireland who are involved in the VECs and third level colleges, who have itemised areas where there have been severe cuts in the provision for their services both in relation to teachers and a whole range of other services.  Deputy MacCartan will be dealing with the literacy area so I will not deal with it in any great detail.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat dishonest of the Minister to come into the House and make a bland statement in relation to her Department, attempting to give the impression that everything is fine, that by some means or other she managed to preserve a marvellous system of education which was fair in every way and which was adequately provided for.  In fact, she gave the impression that the reduced numbers attending primary schools in future years, due to the decline in the birth rate, would solve many of the problems of the Department in relation to the provision of education.  That is something which frightens me.  She remarked that she does not intend to allow the falling birth rate to affect the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools which, in many cases, is as high as 40 per class.  Bad and all as the present system is, it would appear that in the future we will have an even more unequal system, one under which those who are most disadvantaged will be hit even harder.</P>
    <P>I have argued with the present and former Ministers in relation to areas which have been designated as disadvantaged. The scheme of designating certain areas as disadvantaged, providing some extra moneys for them, providing links between schools, parents and so on is a good idea.  But unless that is done simultaneously with ensuring an adequate pupil-teacher ratio, it will be a waste of money.  Practically every school in my constituency say they would much prefer an extra couple of teachers to deal with their many problems, that they would even hand back a couple of thousand pounds if only they could get a few extra teachers in order to reduce class <Col N="2134" /> numbers, thereby providing the personal attention which many pupils need because of their deprived background.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points in relation to third level education.  It is true to say that that whole area has changed fairly significantly over the past ten years with the growth of the non-university, third level colleges.  This has eroded the dominance of universities in that sector while, over that period, student numbers have increased.  But it must be said that the participation rates representing the various classes in our society have not improved significantly.  That is a fact which can be proven by simple observation in one's own constituency.  I am sure it is the case in most urban constituencies, if not in rural areas as well, that the lower the income of your parents the less is the likelihood that you will ever get third level education.</P>
    <P>I also recognise that there are problems in relation to the manner in which people are prepared for third level eduction both in primary and second level schools and that in many cases the disadvantages start at primary level.  There is a whole range of issues involved which I will not have time to go into tonight.  It is ludicrous and discriminatory that people who are academically suitable to enter third level education and deprived from doing so simply because they do not have a sufficient number of points to get a grant.</P>
    <P>I know of one case where a young girl has been offered a place in UCD and can take it up next September if she can find the money to pay the fees.  UCD have said they are not prepared to waive the fees and the Minister has said she has no responsibility in the matter, that it is a matter for the college.  Because this young girl does not have the requisite number of points to qualify for a grant she is to be deprived of third level education. That is an example of the kind of discrimination which is embedded in the whole grants system and in access to third level education.  The Minister said she will rationalise the system and make it simpler for people to get into third level education.  I hope she applies herself to <Col N="2135" /> that apsect of access to third level education as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one further point in relation to third level education and that relates to our tendency to view the products of our third level system in purely manpower terms, in terms of gearing all our efforts towards producing technocrats or engineers of one kind or another.  While it is obviously essential from the point of view of economic development that we have people who are skilled in various economic areas, it is essential that our third level education system takes into account the cultural and even the spiritual needs of our students and of the society they are being educated to serve.  If the Minister intends to take any steps to reform our education system, I urge her to apply herself to that aspect.  She should not accept willy nilly all the pressures that come from the various economic interests.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Confederation of Irish Industry in the past year or two have been making great efforts to influence the kind of education which is being provided and the direction in which it is being pursued.  They have produced all kinds of videos and promotional material on the great service they provide and on the need to provide technological education, which is essential in many ways.  There is also a social dimension to education and it is important that that be fully maintained and developed.  I also urge the Minister to try to ensure that the education of the physically and the mentally handicapped in society is integrated, in so far as it is possible to do so, with the normal education system and with those who are not physically or mentally impaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the House and to the Deputies for the opportunity to raise the issue of the adult literacy programme and to nail a lie that has been repeated many times, and again as recent as Thursday last 11 June, in answer to a question which I put to the Minister in respect of the funding that has been afforded adult literacy schemes throughout the country this year.  The <Col N="2136" /> Minister sought to make the case that funding has been increased by £50,000. The reality is that it represents a decrease of £100,000 over the figure that had been ear-marked by the previous Government in a three year programme allowing for, in 1985, £150,000; in 1986, £350,000 and in 1987, £500,000.  That plan was presented to the national adult literacy groups.  They expected, right up to mid-1987, to have that money available to them.  Half way through this year they are advised for the first time by the Government that their budget would be decreased by £150,000.  What that means is that a sum of £46,500 under this heading is made available for this entire year for the city of Dublin.  The city of Dublin now has the princely sum of £14,000 to fund all adult literacy schemes with the result that only £3,820 is allocated to the north city area.  One scheme in the Coolock area requires £3,500 to survive for the rest of this year.  It is not possible, in the way the funds have been allocated, that that can be achieved.</P>
      <P>I am taking this brief opportunity to plead to the Department and to the Minister not to treat adult literacy as a marginal area of education.  It must be recognised as an integral part of the system.  A system that currently spends £4,500 per head on third level education must do better than allocate a mere £85 per head nationally in order to give adult education a fair opportunity to develop and to give the people involved in that scheme an opportunity of getting back to school and of helping their children as they come through school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to comment on the contribution of Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Unfortunately he is not in the House at present.  I am rather surprised at the content of his contribution. It paints a picture of education in this country which could not be further from the truth.  His description of primary school education as the scene of misery is one which I think anybody will agree is quite untrue.  His description of the lack of creativity in the primary school <Col N="2137" /> system is also quite untrue.  The Department and the educators are to be complimented for developments which have taken place in recent years in regard to the development of creative education at primary school level.  Contrary to what Deputy Higgins said, the new developments in school buildings very much reflect the presence of creativity.  Deputy Higgins and I visited a school yesterday where such evidence is to be found.</P>

That development is costing the State an enormous amount of money but it lends itself to the best possible type of education and the enjoyment of creative education by our children.</P>
      <P>Before Deputy Michael Higgins came into the Chamber I said that his contribution was far from factual.  I decry his description of misery in our primary school system.  That is not the position.  I have always been impressed by what my former lecturer has to say but I am not in agreement with his description of Irish education.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's description reminds me of the educational system in some of the countries he visited in recent years.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to place on the record of the House the Government's commitment to the support of voluntary endeavour in the areas of youth and sport.  The area of youth and sport which is vitally important comes under my stewardship.  The value and extent of voluntary activity and initiative in these areas are fully appreciated by the Government who, despite the unprecedented nature of prevailing difficulties in relation to the public finances, are endeavouring to ensure that the necessary level of financial support for their maintenance is forthcoming during the current year.</P>
      <P>A total sum of £2,134,000 is being provided in the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Education for the purpose of grant-aid towards youth and sport activities.  The Government have already agreed to supplement this provision by the allocation of £3.150 million from the surplus proceeds of the national lottery to youth and sport activities and projects. The total fund of £5,284,000 available to me, therefore, represents a reasonable provision to cover essential needs in these areas in 1987, mindful of the very severe financial constraints facing the Government. Of this total provision, a sum of £3,766,500 is designated for expenditure on youth, while the balance of £1,517,500 will be expended on sport.  This distribution has been determined having careful regard to the level of activity and expenditure approved for these areas in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to clarify the position in regard to the division of lottery proceeds arising out of certain comments that were made.  The Government have decided that 45 per cent of the proceeds of the national lottery will be applied to youth and sport and on the basis of the provision made in the revised Estimates, this will amount to £3.15 million in 1987.  I should like to emphasise that that is on the basis of the revised Estimate.  It is clear that the lottery will provide a significant increase in this amount of money to the <Col N="2139" /> Exchequer in 1987.  The remaining allocation from the lottery has yet to be decided by the Government and there has not been a final decision on the allocation to youth and sport.</P>
    <P>The total fund of £3,766,500 available to my Department for support of the voluntary youth work service this year represents positive recognition by the Government, in the face of acute financial constraints, of the value of on-going activity in this area.  It means that, in general, grant assistance to youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme, which is the core activity of my Department in this context, will be maintained at, or near, the individual amounts provided to organisations in this way last year.  It will also enable continued support, in 1987, for locally based projects on behalf of disadvantaged young people funded by my Department in 1986.  All things considered, I believe that a realistic and significant provision has been made by my Department for the continued support of voluntary endeavours by, and for, young people in the area of youth work for the current year.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been deeply involved in all aspects of sporting endeavour.  The achievements of our sporting heroes and heroines, of whom there has been a remarkably consistent stream for such a small country, have become enshrined in the collective memory or culture of the nation.  To a considerable degree Ireland's international profile and status have been built upon and continue to derive strong support from the successful exploits of sports men and women.  Sport contributes directly to many different facets of life and industry of the nation.  It provides direct and indirect employment for hundreds of individuals, generates wealth which adds significantly to national income, provides a popular and generally accessible opportunity for fitness, health, entertainment, the pursuit of excellence and sheer good fun.  Its pervasive presence in Irish life, as well as the value which the Irish place upon it, is easily proven by looking at the nation's newspapers, television programmes and <Col N="2140" /> the advertisements that appear in the media.  Sport is something that appeals to and has an intrinsic interest for every Irish person.</P>
    <P>The Government realise the value of sport to the economic and social life of the nation.  They have prepared their plans on the premise that sport represents an area of human endeavour as deserving of public support as any other.  In my view the valuable relationship that exists between sport development and the other major areas of national development, the economy, health and welfare, has been insufficiently recognised in the past and valuable opportunities to harness sport development to the pursuit of broader national goals have been sadly lost.  In my view the under developed state of sport in Ireland places us at a severe disadvantage compared to other countries with which we compete.  We do not have available the organisational resources or the professional expertise to achieve and sustain significant growth in each sport.</P>
    <P>Ireland has indulged in its passion for sport and sporting success without being prepared to support an appropriate level of investment in the substantial effort required to produce the end results.  I am working on the preparation of a corporate plan for sport which will outline our sport development policy.  I can guarantee the House that the financial input will provide as great a return to the country as any other form of investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we have been issued with a script by the Minister of State but I cannot find this contribution in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the script.  In the field of sport, I am pleased that it will be possible to maintain the level of grant-aid to national sports organisations at the 1986 level and to provide funding again this year for the scheme of grants to outstanding sportspersons.  The aim of this scheme is to enable outstanding sports <Col N="2141" /> persons to undertake training and competition at the highest level and to compete with distinction in international events.  This scheme enables funding to be allocated directly to our most promising athletes to help alleviate the very high cost of training and competition.  I am very pleased with the success of this particular scheme and I look forward to Irish sports people, many of whom have benefited under the scheme, continuing to compete successfully with their peers from other countries.</P>
      <P>The Government have a policy of promoting sport for all, the philosophy of which is, that every person irrespective of age, sex, at whatever level of skill, ability or commitment has a right to participate in sport.  COSPOIR, the National Sports Council, promotes this policy and this year has launched a new scheme to promote sport for all in the primary school sector.  Under this scheme, which includes all 3,500 primary schools and about 500,000 pupils, projects designed to enhance awareness of and shape attitudes to sport for all have been invited. Attractive awards will be made under the scheme in conjunction with a commercial sponsor.  This current initiative by COSPOIR is directed at a very important target group &mdash; those of formative years, for whom positive attitudes to participation in healthy and enjoyable sporting activity, can be effectively inculcated by thoughtfully prepared sport for all programmes in primary schools.  In this regard I would like to make special reference to the co-operation and willing assistance of teachers and schools in this initiative and would like to express my satisfaction with the work which they do in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add, and this is not scripted either, that in addition to that we have a programme to develop mass participation in sport to encourage people to live lifestyles conducive to health through the medium of sport.  In this country we tend to attempt to prevent things after they have happened. Sport is a preventative medicine.  Its therapeutic and health care value can be of great benefit to the nation and it is <Col N="2142" /> along those lines we propose to develop sport.</P>
    <P>The area of youth and sport will be kept under review and will, of course, receive every consideration, as circumstances permit, when the Government are deciding on the distribution of any additional income accruing to the Exchequer from the national lottery when the total surplus available for 1987 can be more clearly identified.  Accordingly, it represents a substantial response to established need in the difficult financial circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>The scheme under which these grants for the provision of recreational facilities may be made has proved extremely popular with voluntary bodies since it was introduced in 1985.  At all times the level of demand for grants greatly exceeded the resources available for the scheme and by the end of last year there was a considerable accumulation of grant commitments which could not be met from the 1986 provision.  The limited funds in 1987 must now be applied solely to existing commitments and there is unfortunately no scope, therefore, for making any further grant allocations at present.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of special education special emphasis continues to be placed on the provision of education for handicapped children.  Over the years much development work has taken place under different administrations.  The early emphasis on special schools for handicapped children has, for the more common and milder forms of handicap, given way to the development of special classes attached to ordinary national schools.  There is an increasing demand for the education of handicapped children as near as possible to their homes, on the grounds that this would be educationally sound policy.  There will always, of course, be a need for some educational facilities to be provided in centralised establishments, particularly for the rarer handicaps and those handicaps requiring a large investment of staff and equipment.  However, my Department are prepared to review such provision in the light of the educational and social needs of the pupils and the <Col N="2143" /> resources already available.  The committee which was established to consider how special schools might be developed as resource centres in their areas is coming to the end of its work and is due to report in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the 1986-87 school year a second allocation of teaching posts was made available to selected centres to cater for children with severe and profound mental handicap.  It is hoped to continue this expansion service as resources permit.  The provision of additional assistant teachers to provide remedial education for pupils who fall behind their peers in numeracy and literacy in ordinary national schools will continue.  It is hoped to do this by the redeployment of teachers from areas of lesser need.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee which was set up to review progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Government task force in the wake of the publication of the report of the Travelling People Review Body, continues to meet on a regular basis.  This committee includes representatives of the travellers and has just published its second annual report.  I want to assure the House that I am taking a keen personal interest in the development of education for travelling people.  Continued emphasis is being placed on the provision of educational facilities for those travelling children at primary level.  Additional special classes are provided as the need arises and there has been a steady growth in the number of pre-schools grant-aided by my Department.</P>
    <P>The provision for school transport in the 1987 Estimates for Public Services is £34,700,000.  Based on an out-turn on current expenditure of £33,640,000 in 1986, the increase in the net cost of operating the scheme will be £1,060,000 or 3.2 per cent.  Based on the allocation for school transport and the expected yield from school transport charges, the gross cost of running the school transport scheme in 1987 is estimated to be £38,200,000, compared to £36,987,000 in 1986.  This is an increase of 3.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> The difference between the gross and net costs of operating the scheme in 1987 is £3,500,000.  In order to provide for this amount, the term charges and concessionary fares will be increased from September 1987 as follows:</P>

    <P>The additional yield in 1987 from the increased charges will be of the order of £90,000.  The medical card concession will continue to apply in the case of eligible post primary pupils.  It is estimated that the number of pupils who will be eligible for and availing themselves of school transport during 1987 will show an increase of about 1,100, or 0.7 per cent, on the 1986 figure.</P>
    <P>A provision of £30,010,000 is being made for the national schools building programme.  This programme is concerned in the main with the provision where necessary of new schools and extensions and the replacement of obsolete and unsuitable buildings.  Included in the provision is a substantial sum for essential improvement works to existing schools &mdash; for example, replacement of windows, roofs, sanitation, heating systems and similar works which while not involving the provision of any extra school places as such are nevertheless of importance in maintaining existing buildings in serviceable condition.</P>
    <P>A sum of £38 million is being provided in the Estimate for capital projects at post-primary schools during 1987.  This capital investment is required in order to provide additional school accommodation in new urban areas where the pupils concerned cannot be accommodated in existing schools within a <Col N="2145" /> reasonable distance; to provide increased pupils capacity at existing schools where such is justified by reference to present and projected pupil numbers and to replace existing unsatisfactory classrooms, whether of a traditional or prefabricated type, which have outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>In order to cater for the rapid expansion in numbers during the late sixties and seventies, over 60,000 places were provided by means of prefabricated accommodation.  An ongoing part of the capital programme for second level schools is the eventual replacement over time of such accommodation by permanent type buildings in all cases where it is justified by long term school population needs.  The provision of new accommodation or the replacement of existing accommodation is only undertaken after careful assessment of local demographic trends and their implications for future enrolment levels in existing schools, not only in the areas directly involved but also quite frequently in schools in neighbouring areas as well.  Finally, to ensure as far as possible cost-effective investment, each proposed new capital project is now examined in the context of school resources generally in the catchment area to investigate, before committing resources, the options for integration or co-ordination of facilities.</P>

      <P>These restricted Estimate debates are inherently unsatisfactory, and particularly unsatisfactory for a subject such as education because, in addition to the nuts and bolts of the Estimate, there are serious philosophical matters which need to be discussed. These have been touched on by Deputy Higgins and to a lesser extent by Deputy De Rossa and, in themselves, would form an interesting and very important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise if <Col N="2146" /> the survey which Deputy Higgins suggested were taken among the parents of Ireland as to whether they like the denominational system that pertains or if they would like to see a change.  I would be prepared to bet a fair amount of money that the survey would show a wish for no change but &mdash; and it is important to put this on record &mdash; wherever a group of parents wish to provide a multi-denominational or a non-denominational school, the facilities to assist them in doing so will be made available, provided the Department of Education can be satisfied that the project is viable, will continue and is not just a once off fad.  I was interested to hear Deputy De Rossa criticise the educational system.  He said it should not be dominated by any one religious system.  I thought this was somewhat ironic coming from the spokesman for Ireland's real Communist Party which masquerades under the title &ldquo;The Workers' Party.&rdquo; We know that in Russia there is only one ethos available.</P>
    <P>I mention these as some of the interesting things we could go into in more detail and in greater depth if we had more time.  We have not, unfortunately, so I will confine myself to speaking on the Minister's speech and on some matters of concern to the constituency which the Minister and I have the honour to represent. I had intended to speak only on some local matters and to draw the Minister's attention to the urgency of ensuring that they would get attention and some priority within her allocation but, having read her speech, I find myself compelled to make some comment on it.</P>
    <P>It grieves me to have to say that I consider this speech to be less than frank, and that is to be diplomatic about it. Deputy Hussey in her analysis of it, which was quite devastating, exposed the inadequacies of the Minister's presentation. Somebody who did not know the educational scene and who will not have the advantage of reading Deputy Hussey's analysis might read the Minister's speech and think things are rosy in the educational garden.  Of course, there have been some savage and ruthless cutbacks in a number of areas and it behaves the <Col N="2147" /> Minister to be frank with the House and the educational sector and to indicate chapter and verse the changes and the reductions that are being made so that they will not come as a surprise or as a bolt from the blue to the unfortunate people in the educational sector.  I am sure if they were told about these cuts and if they were rationalised, there might be a better acceptance and possibly a better implementation of them.</P>
    <P>An example is the Minister's facile reference to the fact that the transition year option has been approved for schools in which it had been established.  As Deputy Hussey pointed out, the Minister was in the forefront demanding that that transition year option would not merely be continued but would be expanded into all schools.  That wish on the part of the Minister has gone.  The fact that it is not being extended to any extra school is due entirely to a policy decision by the Minister because I was prepared to allow it to be expanded to a restricted number of schools.  Because of budgetary constraints it was not possible to allow all schools into it, but it was possible to allow a certain extra limited number of schools in because we have to admit it is still experimental in nature and we have to go slowly in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is being totally frank about the school transport system and her intentions.  She merely gives the cost of it and says she will keep it under review to ensure the greatest possible cost effectiveness.  On 9 June Deputy Carey asked the Minister if she was considering a pilot private transport scheme of school buses in County Clare and if she would make a statement in the matter.  The Minister said she has made no decision on introducing a pilot project under which the organisation of school transport would be devolved.  That was not answering the question &ldquo;if she was considering a pilot private transport scheme&rdquo;.  I know, and the Minister knows, that there were proposals for such developments in the school transport scheme and the Minister should be frank <Col N="2148" /> with us and let us know if she is considering them.  If she is, she should give us an idea when her considerations are likely to be concluded and if she has any indication at this stage how she will conclude those considerations.</P>
    <P>There was what I consider to be a glaring omission from the Minister's speech.  I could not see any reference to her plans for the future of Carysfort Training College.  We all remember the emotional debates we had in this House when the previous Minister, Deputy Hussey, and myself at the later date, were castigated for the decision taken with regard to the rationalisation of primary teacher training, a decision which involved the phasing out of Carysfort College as a centre for the training of primary teachers.  Before I left office I had set up an eminent working party which produced what I thought to be a viable set of proposals for the future of that college which would give it &mdash; if you will forgive the word &mdash; a meaningful role in education for the future and would also, and this is very important, safeguard the future of the staff.  It was not very acceptable to some of the authorities in the college, but I am anxious to know what is happening there because it must be a matter of great uncertainty to the staff not to have their future decided at this stage.</P>
    <P>One of the hopes I had for the new role for Carysfort was that it would become a powerhouse for language teaching.  As we are confirmed in our membership of a Europe which is becoming more and more integrated, it is becoming more important that our young people should have a facility in at least one modern continental language.  That would require a crash programme of language teaching and I had a vision of Carysfort as the engine room for generating an enhanced crash programme of modern language teaching.  I also had the vision that in every RTC it would be compulsory for all students to attend a language course so that they would complete their time in the RTC with a fluency in a modern continental language, not necessarily in the grammar of the language, but that <Col N="2149" /> they would have colloquial fluency.  I am anxious to know if the Minister shares my ambitions in that regard and if she will indicate some activity towards that end.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter in train was the investigation of the review of the possibility of setting up a technological university embracing at least the two national institutes in Limerick and Dublin.  A distinguished team of local and foreign academics were surveying that scene and I imagine their deliberations must be nearly complete by now.  I am anxious to hear if the Minister has the report or expects it since the people in those institutions are anxious for an early decision because it will have considerable importance for the future of technological training and education in this country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the lack of a positive statement from the Minister on the future of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  The Bill has been published, but the Minister does not give a commitment to pursue the legislation. We get a rather odd statement in her speech: &ldquo;The position of the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board is currently due for clarification.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I should like the Minister to explain when she is replying.  Does she intend to proceed with the legislation, will she alter it and, if so, when will we know of the changes?  If she intends to pursue it, may we have a commitment that it will be brought to the House when we resume after the summer recess?  It is very important that that matter should be clarified because it has been left on an interim basis for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In-service training was, rightly, one of the Minister's great concerns when she was in Opposition but the couple of paragraphs in her script are delightfully vague about her proposals for that service.  It is expensive but terribly important.  If the funds are not there to continue it we <Col N="2150" /> should at least be told.  The bland two paragraphs conceal a lessening of the funds because I am quite certain that if the funds had been increased the matter would not have been presented in such a quiet way.  I should like to hear from the Minister in that regard, it is another example of how her script avoids telling us the full truth &mdash; I use the words deliberately &mdash; about the position in the Minister's Department following the revised Estimates prepared by her and her colleagues in Government.  A lot of bad news is concealed under the bland generalties of the script and it is less than proper for the Minister to come into this House on an Estimates debate and to conceal realities from it and from the people.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, my primary purpose in intervening was to talk about a couple of matters relating to the constituency which the Minister and I have the honour to represent.  Two matters in regard to Athlone come within the Minister's bailiewick. I had indicated to Athlone Regional Technical College that I would make funds available for the purchase of lands adjoining the campus which are strategically placed for the future development of the college.  I understand that the VEC, the body with responsibility for receiving and spending these moneys, have been unable to get any decision from the Department on their availability.  I am quite certain that the Minister, as a former chairperson of the VEC, an ex-member of the board of management as well as sharing with me the honour of being a Deputy for the town, will want to ensure that these essential and urgent funds will be made available so that negotiations for this strategic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Deputy Cooney provide the funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they were provided for in the capital allocation.  I am not asking the Minister to provide extra money as she has a very large capital budget and it is entirely up to her to order the priorities of spending within the ceilings available to her.  I was long <Col N="2151" /> enough in office to learn that the Minister can order those priorities in such a way as to make available for the County Westmeath VEC the funds needed to purchase the extra grounds at Athlone Regional Technical College.  I also provided for funds for the VEC for the purchase of playing fields for Athlone Vocational School.  The Minister will be aware that Athlone Vocational School over the last couple of years has developed in an extraordinary fashion.  It has become revitalised and is equal, if it does not exceed, in attraction the other post primary schools in the district. However, it needs playing fields to complement it.  The ground is there but it needs to be developed and it is a matter for the Minister to order the funds within the allocation available to her to provide much needed playing fields for this excellent school in her home town.  I appeal to the Minister not to let us down.</P>
      <P>County Longford is also part of our constituency and there is an excellent vocational school in Ballymahon with a very good and active parents' committee who gathered a substantial amount of money towards the cost of building a gymnasium.  They went to the United States and ran fund raising activities among emigrants.  They also raised a lot of funds locally and accumulated a very substantial sum.  I felt that that community effort should be matched by an input from central funds.  I agreed to make an allocation to them so that they could build the gymnasium in Ballymahon which would not just be available to the school but to the community. It would be a wonderful facility.  I hope the Minister will ensure the ordering of the funds within her disposal and within the allocation of her Department to ensure that that worthwhile project will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also provided funds for Longford Vocational School for the refurbishment of the playing fields attached to it.  I told the parents that the granting of funds would be on condition that there would be a contribution from them and that they would raise funds in the community. <Col N="2152" /> They set about that task and worked with a will.  They raised &mdash; and are continuing to raise &mdash; a substantial amount of money locally.  That effort should be matched and acknowledged by the Department.  I ask the Minister, bearing in mind the loyalty of that constituency to her party and the obligations she has to repay that loyalty, not to let down herself, Minister Reynolds, Deputy Abbott, Senator Cassidy, Senator Fallon and Senator Doherty.  In fairness to all the constituency colleagues of her party she has an obligation to ensure that she will allocate these funds.  They are not asking for any extra, the funds are available and it is a question of her having the political will to deliver on these worthwhile projects.</P>

      <P>I did indicate that to the Chair.  I am almost finished but my speech was so important that I did not want to stint my contribution and acknowledgement of the dedication of the parents and school staffs in Ballymahon, Athlone <Col N="2153" /> and Longford.  I understand that the Minister had a deputation from Granard Vocational School recently from which she will be aware that the community has raised a considerable amount of money for a gymnasium there.  I had not allocated any funds for that, if I had been in office a little longer perhaps I might have managed that as well.  However, the Minister could compensate in this regard.</P>
      <P>Another point is in relation to adult literacy.  The Minister will be aware that a very advanced scheme had been devised in County Longford to combat this problem which is a very difficult one in a rural area.  In a large city people in need of literacy training can come forward in a more impersonal and anonymous way but it is not so easy in rural areas.  County Longford VEC have done trojan work and have identified many people in need. Unfortunately, that very valuable programme will now be curtailed.  I make a plea to the Minister &mdash; I do not want to make a sexist remark but women generally are regarded as being more compassionate than men &mdash; to ensure that the adult literacy scheme, above all other things in her Department, will not be prejudiced.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not advert to the national sports centres.  I should like the Minister to confirm that the decision made to locate a sports centre in Athlone will be implemented.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak in particular about the case that has been made for higher education grants.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the income limits in line with inflation.  It is very sad that, year after year, the same case has to be made at local authority level and with the Department that there are many areas here that should be looked at by the Minister and in particular that there is so little information for parents and students about such basic things as the closing date for application for higher education grants. This has caused problems year after year. This year the closing date has been brought forward.  I cannot understand why there is not some information leaflet which sets out very clearly the types of grants available for higher education, vocational education and, ESF grants.  I raised this matter in the Dáil on many occasions in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> There are many shortcomings in the higher education grants system.  It seems unfair that where there are two, three or perhaps more children in the one family attending third level college, no provision is made within the very strict income limits to give even a fee or a maintenance grant to such families.  There is no provision relating to any income tax allowance for people on PAYE or other people paying tax.  We hear much talk of insurance companies bringing in schemes so that families can provide for finance for higher education.  It is sad that we have not looked in any imaginative way at helping people, apart from what the insurance companies are trying to do, in many cases providing bad insurance schemes which will not provide for higher education.</P>

      <P>There has been much talk by various Governments in the past about the new facilities being provided in primary schools.  We all welcome new buildings and extensions and the very fine school built and opened in Craughwell by the Minister of State.  As a teacher I have visited many older schools which are looking for extension.  They are certainly very dreary places and we urgently need to provide new facilities.  It is ironic to hear talk about new schools being opened when there are such dreadful facilities in schools.  In my own constituency of County Galway over the past number of years we have seen very bad facilities for parents and children.  I raised on the Adjournment with Deputy Cooney last year the case of Labally national school where in one classroom there are two teachers teaching approximately 60 pupils with a partition between the two classes.  In this day and age it is deplorable and scandalous that that should be allowed to continue.  I hope that contract will be awarded now for that school.</P>

      <P>It is very galling for parents and teachers in those old schools to hear of money being provided for gymnasia and all the modern facilities in the second and third level colleges and universities. That is an area I hope the Minister will look at &mdash; the question of improving schools which are in such very bad need of facilities.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister and Minister of State well in their offices and hope that we can improve facilities, particularly at primary school level which is the cornerstone of education.  On the review of the curriculum, the primary school curriculum has been very successful.  I heard Deputy Higgins speak about imagination, creativity, music and dance. The primary school curriculum helped to bring that about.  There were areas where the idea was not embraced with as much zeal as in the majority of schools, but it helped.  That has been a success.  It is time to review all these schemes.  It is very significant that national primary teachers undertook that scheme with great zeal and there was no question of looking for extra money or allowances to bring it in. I was a student in a training college at the time the scheme was piloted through.  I saw in my first year in training college that things had to be done according to a very set pattern and in my second year it turned out to be a child-centred primary education programme.  I have always wished it well and I have always enjoyed teaching under that programme.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her well in her new role. I am sure she will be quite closely marked by her experienced predecessor, Deputy Hussey.  I am happy that the Minister has addressed many of the real and pressing problems.  There is an urgent need to change the education system and to put greater emphasis on assessment rather than examinations.  At present we have thousands of young students enduring a system which does not make sense &mdash; a three hour paper deciding a student's future.</P>
      <P>In the present system there is no personality or character monitoring of students and no emphasis is placed on communicative skills.  We have the same rigid curriculum as was there in 1922 except that Latin and Greek have been deleted from it.  These have been replaced by broader languages which are killed off by over emphasis on writing and grammar.  There is too much stress on literature and not enough on language. Language should be the window to literature. A teaching concept should be experimented with.  Interchange at the top of a class would stimulate discussion and encourage greater involvement and participation by students.</P>
      <P>I regret the limitations and constraints placed by the Minister on career breaks. It is essential that teachers, for whatever reasons, are allowed to recharge their batteries and rediscover their appetite for the very important and demanding role they fulfil.  It also affords the opportunity to graduates to gain valuable experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider implementing a phased early retirement scheme.  How can a teacher with 40 years experience be expected to cope with the strains and demands of the modern classroom? It is demanding too much of a teacher who was trained in the chalk and blackboard era to continue to keep abreast of modern advances and to <Col N="2158" /> retain, after a lifetime of service, the necessary energy, motivation and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the Minister's proposal for a reduction in the number of remedial teachers.  One out of every ten children leaves school without an adequate grasp of the curriculum.  Many are left behind for the want of attention. They feel rejected and disheartened and enter the main stream and jobs market demoralised and deflated.  Surely this growing problem requires to be given priority and adequate funding.</P>
    <P>It was with disbelief and anger that I learned of the Department's decision to refuse to issue the schedule of accommodation for the Tipperary Regional College to be based at Thurles.  This decision effectively means that the establishment of the college is long-fingered indefinitely or abandoned completely. The Department of Education, various Ministers and all the political parties have accepted the validity of the case put forward by the North Tipperary Vocational Education Committee.  I request the Minister to assure the House that Fianna Fáil's pre-election commitments in this regard will not be totally reneged on or completely disregarded.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government took office in 1982 the allocation in the 1983 Book of Estimates to the 70 governing bodies of sport was £619,000.  In 1986 under the Coalition Government the State allocation to sport increased to £1.6 million.  The Coalition then introduced the national lottery.  This was originally intended to be a sports lottery.  The Coalition gave a commitment to divert 55 per cent of the proceeds from the lottery to sport.  Its ability to raise money has been a staggering success.  It now realised more during the first few months than was envisaged for the first full year.  Despite this the Government say they will allocate 45 per cent of £7 million to sport. This type of activity can only be described as fraudulent.  Sport is an excellent antidote to drug abuse, vandalism and violence. Young people involved in sport are not generally involved in any anti-social behaviour.  Many young people with <Col N="2159" /> nothing to do and nowhere to go all day every day will end up locked away in an institution costing the State £800 per week paid for with hard earned taxpayers' money.  Does the Minister accept that there is a strong economic argument in favour of much more State aid for sport?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what will happen to the national sports centre.  A former Minister for my party set up a committee to examine and consult all the interests involved in sport.  That committee presented their report almost six months ago.  Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that the national sports centre will be commenced this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief in my remarks.  As a member of Kerry VEC I am rather saddened that VECs have been singled out more than any other sector of education for drastic cutbacks. Having worked within the VEC for the past two years I realise fully the problems the VECs face.  The problems teachers in VECs face are very different from the problems faced by teachers in the religious sector and other sectors of secondary education.  For this reason, rather than being discriminated against they should be further funded.  In the light of my own experience, and I am sure the Minister's experience, I appeal to her that rather than singling out the VECs for cutbacks they should be given increased funding and every effort should be made to ensure that the teachers and pupils in the VECs are not exposed to any further stress or strain.</P>
      <P>VECs have a heavy burden to carry in our secondary education system.  There is a distinct possibility that some of the students who are attending VECs will have to buy their own materials when they go back to school after the summer holidays.  This may be an exaggeration but I would like clarification from the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the adult literacy programmes have been singled out and badly hit by the cutbacks.  Adult <Col N="2160" /> literacy programmes deal with the most deprived sections of our community, a section who probably were deprived in the post free educational era.  These people now have an opportunity to learn the basics of communication.  I do not have to point out that basic reading skills are critical in modern society.  This proposal has been received with widespread indignation by the people involved in VECs.  It will have to be corrected in next year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher I am very concerned about the embargo on staffing. This will have a very serious effect on the employment of specialist teachers.  My understanding &mdash; and I may be corrected on this &mdash; is that teachers will not be replaced.  There is a school in Tipperary where the woodwork teacher is leaving and the school authorities cannot replace him because they are over the quota. Where a school is under the quota and a specialist teacher has to be replaced, be it maths, languages or whatever, I understand the authorities can employ a teacher only on a part time basis.  It will be very difficult to get an honours maths teacher to take on a job for one year.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, made reference to special education. There is no doubt that as a nation we have improved by leaps and bounds in the provision of facilities for the handicapped. We must ensure that this funding in this time of financial crisis will not be reduced over the next few years.  Where schools are to be provided we should go through the various stages with every possible speed.  I will refer briefly to the proposed Nano Nagle school for the handicapped in Lixnaw, County Kerry. There is a problem regarding the siting of the school.  I appeal to the Department, to site the school in the best interests of the children and to carry out the site examinations and ensure that the various stages are expedited.  At the moment over 60 children are placed in a school that has long outlived its purpose. As this school serves all of north Kerry, there is urgent need for a school in this locality.  Indeed, the intake is increasing <Col N="2161" /> as assessment measures prove to be more effective and as more parents recognise the whole dimension of handicap.  I am sure all members agree that whatever the financial crisis this vulnerable section must be helped in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if Deputy Fahey were here at the moment as I am about to refer to the funding for youth and sport.  The change of policy with regard to the percentage of the lottery to be spent on sport was a total betrayal of youth and of sport.  I do not blame Deputy Fahey whom I am sure would like to avail of all the proceeds from the lottery.  I blame the people in the Department of Finance.  In the Seanad debate on the national lottery, I foretold what took place when it was decided to reduce the funding from 55 per cent to 45 per cent.  I pointed out in that debate that in times of crisis sport would take the rap first.  This is what has happened. The idea of the national lottery was promoted to ensure that for once in our history sport would be put on a sound financial footing so that we would have the type of facilities needed, so that we could have a national sports stadium, so that we could have better coaching facilities for sport organisations, so that we could have the possibility of setting up a sports centre to house all the various organisations and so that we could fund outdoor activities and ensure that centres like Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre in County Kerry would be kept going.</P>
    <P>There was an Adjournment debate on Cappanalea but there is still a huge question mark hanging over its future.  Will the Minister clarify the position as regards the continuation of Cappanalea and indeed the Department's policy on outdoor education and recreation.  Outdoor education and recreation is one of the fastest growth areas in the world. Instead of taking funding from these centres, we should increase funding.  If the national lottery money was left solely to sport and to youth there would be adequate funding to ensure the continuation and promotion of these centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> Not alone have these centres an educational value but they have a tourism value.  We have many sites that could be developed as recreational and outdoor pursuit centres and they could attract numerous youth groups from the Continent, for example.  Great work has been going on in Cappanalea in the fusion of youth groups from the North and the South in activities there.  Unless the centre is funded this type of progress will collapse.  I appeal to the Minister to be specific in her reply to Cappanalea and in relation to outdoor education in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in his speech mentioned that grants were not available this year for the provision of recreational facilities and that the money available would only compete existing ones. Moneys in excess of the £7 million collected from the lottery should be devoted to sport and to the provision of recreational facilities especially as the purpose of the lottery was to promote sport. If we seriously recognised the value of sport we would realise its value in relation to health.  A huge amount of money is spent here on curative medicine as compared with the amount spent on preventative medicine by comparison with countries like Australia and other States. If we had a major investment in sport we could bring down our health bill considerably. That is a well documented fact. I know that at the Cabinet table the Minister's colleagues will be pressed for funds too but I would appeal to the Minister for Education to make a special case for increased funding for sport from the lottery.</P>

He gave a very fine speech to which I listened with great eagerness and I hope to respond to some of the points he made.  I welcome the very comprehensive debate which has occurred here tonight on the Education Estimate and I thank all of the Members who contributed to that debate.  In particular I congratulate Deputy Lowry.  I did not know until I heard the Leas-Cheann Comhairle issuing his comhgairdeas that it was the Deputy's maiden speech.  That seems a singularly inappropriate word to use for a gentleman Member for his first speech in this House, for what I hope will be the first of many speeches.</P>
      <P>I regret that I had to leave because of a very urgent matter which was brought to my attention but I will try to deal with some of the issues raised here and others, which I cannot deal with, will be referred to my Department for reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regretted greatly the intervention from a Member whom I regarded as my esteemed colleague in my constituency but whose contribution was less than honest in the explanation he gave to this House and which he presumes to give to the people in Athlone, Westmeath and Longford regarding the provision he made for facilities in the educational establishment in the heady weeks leading up to the general election.  I did not wish to become political.  I always valued a certain bi-partisan approach between Deputy Cooney and me when he was Minister and I assumed that this would continue in a constructive way when I became Minister.  However, I am afraid I must refute the comment he made here tonight, more presumably for local consumption and the local papers.  His allegation that he provided playing fields at Ballymahon, Granard, and Athlone <Col N="2165" /> vocational school and at the regional college is untrue.  There was no specific provision for these resources in the Estimate he left behind.  When I indicated by my facial expression that I knew this and was going to say so he then said that there was a total provision so one could go bumpety, bump, bump.  There was no specific provision for these resources within the allocation he left behind him, neither has there been a disturbance in the capital allocation he left behind him. There was a huge wallop of those resources over which, as I said, I had no control.  His allegation in this House tonight that he made provision for those proposals is untrue.  In regard to his record of service to his constituents it is remarkable that in the four months since he was elected he has not chosen to make himself publicly available to his constituents in Longford or Westmeath.  To come into the House and disturb what was a constructive relationship at political level is mischievous and out of character with what I had assumed was his method of operation.  However, once I know that it will make things very simple for me in how I operate.  The people of Athlone know well, as they showed in their vote in February, which Deputy they prefer.  Two to one is a fair record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to the silence on Carysfort.  I said in my speech that I had met the sisters there about four weeks ago, and again last Friday, for an hour and a half in my Department.  I am conducting each meeting with the sisters. They come at my invitation to the Department and I will make that a feature of the meetings.  They have requested that until all negotiations are worked out between the sisters, the staffing and ourselves, matters remain confidential, and I have agreed to that request.  I respect their wishes in this regard and will continue to have a deep commitment to the talks which are proceeding with the Carysfort authorities and to working out a solution which will be painful perhaps but which will be an attempt to identify and serve the needs of all concerned.  It is completely untrue that there is silence on that issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> I want to knock another myth raised by Deputy Hussey and Deputy Cooney about the transition year.  The transition year is not scrapped.  It remains in place for the schools which take part in it already.  I was quite intrigued when I got into the Department to read a memorandum of some time in early January regarding a Government decision that the transition year was to be scrapped <i>in toto.</i> For an interval nothing happened and then came a confused decision which on my interpretation was that there was no written Government decision to overcome that earlier decision.  Again I smile at the assumptions and assertions. Deputy Hussey was a member of the Fine Gael Government which lasted for about six weeks or so, and she and Deputy Cooney talked so lovingly of a transition year.  Of course it was a wonderful concept. Of course it would be admirable if every school in the land could provide a transition year, but they did not provide the resources for such a transition year.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we will have to scrap all those courtesies, but I hope not because we should share a common cause in education.  The Curriculum and Examinations Board attracted immense interest in this House tonight.  Could it be that we have distinguished people in the gallery?  Indeed, they are very distinguished and I paid tribute to them tonight when I spoke about the tremendous dedication and work put in, an enormous amount of it voluntary, by the various course and syllibi committees and by the executive of the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board.  That is exactly what they are; they were set up as an interim board.  I smiled when <Col N="2167" /> Deputy Cooney spoke about his legislation, remembering private conversations, which I would not repeat here tonight, which he and I had on this matter during the 12 months he was Minister. However, if similar provocations arise again in this forum or other fora I shall not hesitate to break the protocol of private conversation regarding all the workings and the legislation of the interim board.  I have met with the interim board and I expect to meet them again in the morning.  I am engaging them in a very distinguished task in conjunction with my Department.  It was wonderful to introduce all sorts of exciting and heady ideas and never have to provide the money for them.  I should love to have been in that position.</P>
      <P>I note that in all of my remarks from the initiation of the Curriculum and Examinations Board I warned against raising too high expectations about the possible implementation of such proposals when the reality was bound to be so very different.  I well remember two years ago huge press headlines reading &ldquo;Inter-Cert to be scrapped&rdquo;, and visiting classes with children expressing the fear that there would be no intermediate certificate next year.  I talked constantly about the raising of such expectations, advocating the planned way in which developments could be announced and funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Lowry was quite sincere when he spoke about the need for assessment.  It should be remembered that assessment has huge implications for young people.  It also has huge implications for teachers in regard to objectivity, correct standards and all sorts of things.  It would have to be implemented in a very precise, correct way.  I have a strong commitment to curriculum reform.  To that end I am hopeful that the Curriculum and Examinations Board whose distinguished members I will be meeting in the morning in what I hope will prove to be a fruitful meeting &mdash; will come along with me and my Department on a most comprehensive review of the <Col N="2168" /> primary schools curriculum I have announced already.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill raised the issue of the schools-industry links, an area in which I am very interested.  I was very pleased about three weeks ago to be able to introduce a pilot project in Finglas on the schools-industry links and to allocate finance for that project.  It is an example of what I meant about my development programme in education.  I have dealt with this matter quite early in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>Several Members raised the matter of there being more time available to Members generally to debate Education Estimates.  Deputy Cooney raised the matter because, he said he had an hour last year and spoke for ten minutes.  I would have wished to have spoken for an hour and a half but was not afforded the opportunity.  Perhaps we can press for more time next year.</P>
    <P>To those who said I did not make myself clear I should say I have availed of every opportunity on which I have been asked to speak on radio and elsewhere. For example, within a week of assuming office, I took part in an open telephone broadcast lasting one hour.  I was available with no screening to any incoming call and answered each one.  I do not remember my former Minister for Education having done the same.  I have also met various groups and I have not shirked my responsibilities in what I have had to say to them.  For example, I have said: &ldquo;This is your budgetary allocation. That is all I have, I wish I had more but I have not&rdquo;.  Delegation after delegation expressed the view that that was the first time they had met any Minister for Education, the first time there was ever such open and honest contact between them and a Minister.  Therefore, the allegation of other Members, particularly former Ministers, that I was less than honest is totally incorrect.  I would point out also that I spoke in the House in early April on the budgetary Estimates at great length, something many other Ministers did not do.</P>
    <P>I emphasise all of the operations of my Department are open to scrutiny and I <Col N="2169" /> resent the allegation that questions for written answer are somehow being answered in a bland way, an assertion which Deputy Hussey made with incresing ferocity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much resent that assertion.  The Deputy should remember that in this House she frequently stood over the integrity of public servants in the Department of Education. I have nothing but the highest of praise for the men and women working in my Department who deliver such a very fine service to the public and country at large in very difficult circumstances.  To cast aspersions on their replies furnished to me and, through me, to the public at large is reprehensible</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism levelled was not at the Minister present but rather the fact that replies could be more explicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter but to assert that they were less than honest is completely wrong.  With regard to the teaching of languages, again Deputy Cooney referred to his vision of what might happen at Carysfort College with regard to the teaching of languages. It is remarkable that there is no record of that vision whatsoever in the Department. There is the trace of an idea which he had last year, a very worthy one, for the devising of a scheme whereby the teaching of German could be introduced on a more comprehensive basis in post-primary schools.  Regrettably, Deputy Cooney did not appear to have followed that up.  I make the point because he waxed lyrical about it this evening.  As the assertion of dishonesty was being bandied about, it is as well that I make the position clear and perhaps puncture the fine notions espoused on the part of a Department the Deputy left so recently.  Deputy Cooney said that the report of the experts in the technological university area is awaited.  I would remind him he established that committee and their remit <Col N="2170" /> from him was to report in September 1987.  He might remember that fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan's point was directed to the Minister of State but as I have overall responsibility I will reply, that is, about the needs of special children.  The Deputy mentioned privately to me the school in which he was interested.  He asked that I reply on the matter of outdoor recreational centres in general and the particular one in which he was interested, Cappanalea.  I do not have that information with me.  I will have it compiled and let the Deputy have it.</P>
      <P>I explained to Deputy M. Higgins why I could not be present for his contribution. I am interested in the points he raised with me both privately and in the House this evening about the denominational system of education, the need, as he sees it, of a survey to be undertaken indicating people's wishes for the provision of various types of primary education for their children.  Where a case is made to my Department based on the need for a multi-denominational facility, it will be examined.  I am at present engaged in negotiations and talks about the Sligo school project along with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has expressed a great interest in the matter, understandably it being in his constituency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter.  The Deputy raised the general matter of the provision of such education. I am emphasising the fact that the Department have been most generous and willing to listen to cases put to them, of course bearing in mind the overall financial constraints within which we must labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>Of course the Deputy may dispense any advice he wishes to his <Col N="2171" /> constituents; that is a correct interpretation of his duty as a public representative. I will revert to one point raised, that is about vacancies occurring in schools which are in quota.  Deputy Deenihan spoke as though he thought such schools were being provided with teacher hours.  They will be provided with a full teacher who will be timetabled to teach full hours, in other words a full-time teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is the point to which I am coming.  The Deputy spoke as though it was for partial hours only. Pending the working out of the parameters and ramifications of an efficient, workable redeployment scheme &mdash; something former Ministers appear to have shirked &mdash; which we hope can be achieved with the co-operation of all concerned there being many hurdles to be overcome before it is satisfactorily devised and pending its introduction, hopefully in the academic year commencing September 1988, it would have been incorrect to have embarked on further recruitment of what might be termed permanent teachers until the position becomes clear as to what teachers are currently available following a redeployment scheme.  To clear up the point raised by the Deputy, a teacher will teach full hours in the school and not a diminishment of the hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is often the case at the end of an Estimates debate that the Minister agrees to answer one small uncontentious question.  Earlier in the day the Minister said that within a couple <Col N="2172" /> of hours she should have clarification regarding the theft of leaving certificate papers.  Can she now tell us if that matter has been sorted out?</P>

      <P>No, I do not have information yet.  Because of the Deputy's assiduous application of her duties as Opposition spokesperson, I have been confined to the House since 7 p.m.  The matter is being extensively followed up. Quite a serious incident took place during the Deputy's time in office and I took a very distinctly sensitive and disciplined approach to that matter in the interest of students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I put down a Private Notice Question but it was turned down on the basis that the factory had not closed, that there was a three week schedule of closure and that, therefore it was not a matter of urgency. According to announcements that have been made the factory is in the course of closure.  This is a most unusual case.  I doubt if any such case has ever occurred in our history.  This is a case of an Irish firm taking an extraordinary decision which seems almost to amount to treachery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the case is that 85 people were to be laid off last November by the manager of this company, Mr. Hanlon. The decision as to who should go was taken by management without consultation with the workers and without conceding that the workers involved had any right to consultation in the matter. The question of seniority did not arise but certain people were picked to be laid <Col N="2174" /> off.  There are approximately 200 to 210 employees in this factory and they all objected to this.  The plant is as big as Hyster Automated Handling Limited which went out of business last week in Blanchardstown.  The staff of the factory in Longford showed extraordinary loyalty to each other.  Rather than have 85 people let go they were prepared to work a three day week or on a week on, week off basis in order to keep all the people employed.  That was an extraordinary indication of loyalty of workers to each other.  They were prepared to sacrifice part of their wages in order to keep their colleagues employed.  This contrasts completely with the extraordinary selfish and greedy attitude of the employer.</P>
    <P>The case then went to the Labour Court which upheld the position of the staff and agreed that the appropriate thing to do would be for the staff to work a three day week or to work on a week on, week off basis.  The manager refused to accept the Labour Court's decision, saying that suggestion was not possible but he did not give any reason as to why it it was not possible.  The staff then went on strike.  That was five weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The manager, Mr. Hanlon, has now decided to close the factory putting all 210 workers out of work and thereby causing immense hardship to the town of Longford.  He will move his business to Liverpool where he will, he says, make a bigger profit and remain in business.  He will make his decisions, he will not change his mind, it is his business and he will do what he likes with it.  Surely that is an extraordinary attitude as we are approaching the 21st century.  We thought this Victorian attitude was gone for good but there are people like this who think they can move the clock backwards, that they are under the Thatcher Government.  They may be coming close to it.  They think they have a Margaret Thatcher to back them up in smashing unions, destroying the interest of workers in their workplace and denying them the right to question managements' decisions.  This type of attitude is being taken from multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Mr. Hanlon considers his <Col N="2175" /> company a multinational company because he has 40 employees in Britain. He thinks he will be as good as Semperit (Ireland) Limited who tried to overcome the union by saying they would close down unless the workers did what management said they should do.  The workers there had to accept the decision of management in order to keep their jobs.  The position was similar with regard to Packard Electric Ireland Limited in Tallaght.  This is becoming the norm in the multinational area so perhaps Mr. Hanlon thought he could do the same &mdash; close down the factory if the employees did not accept what he said.  A stop must be put to this attitude because it is highly dangerous.  This is an effort to wipe out at one stroke all the gains workers achieved over a century of struggle and return to the old Victorian attitudes of the boss is the boss with workers having no rights except to do what they are told, get out when they are told and start when they are told.</P>

That is creeping in in Ireland.  We must not go back irrespective of what people like this might try to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to use the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; in regard to this factory owner in Longford.  Fianna Fáil have always come back to the basic principle of stand by our country and our people, whatever their faults in various areas.  That was the old type of patriotism and that is what this is all about, standing by our people, our communities and our country, whatever differences we may have politically. We should try to develop and help each other like the workers did in that factory who made sacrifices to help others.  That patriotic attitude is absent in the case of <Col N="2176" /> this man who had links with the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

It is a treacherous act to workers, their families, to a town, to a county and to a country.  This man has described himself as a self-made man, a self-made millionaire.</P>

      <P>In this case the factory was established with assistance from the State and the taxpayers.  The country helped to provide a factory which would give employment in Longford and, perhaps, make somebody rich.  Those <Col N="2177" /> who get assistance from the State, whether it is in the form of grants or tax relief, have a debt to the society which gives them that help.  They have a responsibility &mdash; it has not been seen in this case &mdash; to give back something.  I accept that this man created jobs but now he is shutting down the factory.  I suggest that anyone who reneges on their debt to society, and on their responsibilities, loses any right to further assistance.  I suggest that in this case, as in the case of Hyster, a concern that shut down without any notice to their staff &mdash; the IDA have declared that they are pursuing Hyster for every penny of assistance they gave &mdash; if the person insists on proceeding as he said he intends he should be pursued for every penny of grant or assistance he was given.

      <P>Why should people be allowed to take PAYE or PRSI from employees and not hand it over to the State?  The Revenue Commissioners should, if any money is owing to the State in taxes, pursue the company before all the assets of the concern are moved out of the State to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in the initial stages, and since, the company were helped by the purchase of its goods by health boards.  That was of vital importance in the early years and it helped to build up exports.  I understand that health boards have contracts with the company.  I suggest that if the factory in Longford is closed and the concern moves to Britain all contracts here be cancelled and nothing more be purchased from the <Col N="2178" /> company.  This is one of the most serious occurrences in Irish industry and if it is to be copied by other companies &mdash; it appears that the company are copying multinationals &mdash; it could lead to a disaster. Many managements are being taught to develop such confrontations with their workforce, to threaten closures and, if they can close, to do so.  That is a dangerous development and it should be stopped.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may be personal friendships involved and I understand that that might be an inhibiting factor but the whole ethos of Fianna Fáil through the years is directly opposed to this type of action.  I hope the Government will be no different from former Fianna Fáil Administrations and that irrespective of friendships they will ensure that the long tradition provided by Fianna Fáil of attempting to build Irish industry will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Government should make it clear that this type of action is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  The Government should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all grants paid to the company to date are refunded and that all taxes are paid.  The Government should ensure that if this type of action is pursued the company will get no further contracts from the State or other public bodies.  In the meantime great pressure should be put on the company not to take this action by pointing out that this will be the Government's attitude.  They should put the maximum pressure on the company to retain the factory in Longford. They should have appropriate meetings with the workforce and the Labour Court again, if necessary to ensure that management and workers come to an understanding, as has been done in many other industries on how they can work together rather than having the confrontational attitude which has developed.  I hope the Minister will bring the parties together immediately to endeavour to ensure that they can work together, whether on a three day week, week to week, or whatever other basis in order to help management over whatever difficulties they have.  At the same time the Minister <Col N="2179" /> should should ensure that the workforce have their say and that their point of view is listened to and that both can come to an agreement to save the jobs of the workforce.</P>

      <P>First, it is extraordinary that Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, a member of The Workers' Party should come into this House to raise the question of the closure of a factory in Longford.  I totally resent the inflammatory and despicable allegations made by Deputy Mac Giolla against an upright citizen.  I challenge Deputy Mac Giolla to make these allegations outside this House.  It is totally despicable and unworthy of any Deputy of this House to try to allege that this man has not paid his taxes and PRSI.  The Deputy should inform himself properly before making such allegations.</P>
      <P>Let us listen to the true story.  The branch secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Mr. Bob Brady, is a decent man and he did not give the Deputy his information.  I want to have nothing to do with The Workers' Party in Longford in relation to the preservation of jobs in Longford.  We know what The Workers' Party did in other factories.  They should keep their hands off Longford as we will look after our own business.  If the Deputy wants to say Noel Hanlon is a friend of mine, I have 10,542 friends in Longford and he is one of them.  If he wants to challenge that, he should come down and put up one of his people in Longford-Westmeath and we will talk to him.  We have plenty of people to represent us here and we do not need the Deputy to come in and try to stir up more trouble which will cause the loss of 220 jobs which all of us are trying to save in Longford.  He should get his facts right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The news that Noel Hanlon of Hanlon (Ireland) Limited decided to cease operations at his plant on Dublin Road, Longford and has decided to relocate operations at Liverpool is, indeed, most untimely and regrettable.  It is a very serious body blow to the economy of Longford town and county.  Noel Hanlon <Col N="2180" /> (Ireland) Limited was established in 1970.  At the beginning it employed eight people and there were 224 people employed when it ceased.  The company manufactures GPR ambulance bodies which are sold almost entirely to regional health authorities in the UK where it holds almost 65 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>Hanlon's have a virtual monopoly of the Irish market.  Sales in the UK market have been declining in recent years because purchases there are financed from each region's allocations from the British Department of Health and are, therefore, subject to the absolute amount of funds available and must compete with other capital expenditure requirements in the health sector.  Spending restrictions in the UK have led to a decline in both volume demand and prices.  As a result towards the end of 1986 ambulance production in the plant fell from 14 to ten vehicles per week.  Hanlon's competitive advantage has been that its product has earned and sustained a reputation for being superior in quality to the product of similarly priced competitors. However, the position of the punt <i>vis-ávis</i> sterling has further eroded the company's competitive advantage and this combined with the decline in UK market is blamed for the company's problems. Uncertainty has been created &mdash; which Deputy Mac Giolla and his cohorts failed to recognise &mdash; in the real market in which all of us have to exist and in which we have to sell our products to pay our workers.</P>
    <P>In August 1986 the company informed the unions that, due to a shortage of work, it was forced to introduce short time working which would operate on a week on week off basis.  This continued for five weeks on and five weeks off and was found to be totally unsatisfactory from a production point of view.  Earlier that year a three day week was introduced and lasted for only two weeks with disastrous production results.  That is not denied by anybody.  After the hearing the Labour Court made the same recommendation that had been tried and failed on two different occasions.  That is the real crux of the problem that has led to <Col N="2181" /> this strike.  The company had to go back to full time working for the shortest period possible.</P>
    <P>In November 1986 the company informed the unions that it was laying off 85 workers on a temporary basis and that the remainder of the workforce would be retained in a permanent capacity.  The company offered full time employment to those workers it considered most suitable to produce the required output.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy calls this Victorian management, let me explain.  There are welders, painters, carpenters, sheet metal workers, coach builders and unskilled people employed in this plant and there is no way you can operate a last in first out system.  Everybody who knows about production lines knows that.  I accept the trade union principle but where it cannot operate to sustain the productive capacity of a factory, some other approach has to be taken.  It is time people took their heads out of the sand and recognised that.  That is the reality of the situation down there.  This is unacceptable to the unions who claim that the workers should be retained or laid off on a seniority service basis, all things being equal.  This was rejected by the company's management for the reasons I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>As no agreement could be reached at local level the matter was referred on 29 December 1986 to the concilliation service of the Labour Court.  A conciliation conference held on 4 February 1987 failed to resolve the dispute and the matter was referred to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation. The court investigated the dispute on 26 February 1987.  As I said, the court recommended that the work available should be shared among the total workforce on the basis of an undertaking given to the court that the necessary production targets would be met and the required standards of quality attained.  This had already been tried and failed.  The Labour Court also recommended that should this proposal not work out over a three month period there would be lay offs.  At that Labour Court hearing the management gave an undertaking that as soon as the <Col N="2182" /> order book revived all the people would be returned to work.  That is the reality of the situation and those are the facts.</P>
    <P>The company management reacted by saying this was not acceptable to them because a similar type of arrangement had been tried previously and had failed and had proved to be impractical because of the nature of the production methods and technology employed.  The managing director of the company stated clearly and unequivocally that he has to be in the position to run the company; otherwise he cannot stay in business and that is the nub of the matter.  He told the media that the board of the company took the decision to relocate in Liverpool where the company already has a service with 12 people employed, not 40 as the Deputy tried to indicate to this House. He also stated quite clearly that he has no wish to go to Liverpool but because of the deadlock in the situation forced upon him, he is left with no alternative.</P>
    <P>I have tried unsuccessfully to do something over the past number of weeks.  The Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnois has intervened on two occasions to try to find a resolution to this problem.  He found no way to break the deadlock.  A three man strike committee appear to have taken over total control.  A statement was made by a member of that three man strike committee to 50 or 60 workers who begged to have the situation reviewed which I will read into the record of this House: &ldquo;There will be no meeting or no talks until Hanlon's is in liquidation.&rdquo; Do Deputy Mac Giolla and his party and the people they represent take this approach?  If that is their ideology in relation to the retaining of jobs, it is not mine.  I make no apology for saying that it was a scandalous and irresponsible decision and any respectable trade union should take disciplinary action against a man like that who endangered the jobs of 220 people by making statements which would inflame an already deadlocked situation.  That is the reality in Longford town where the jobs of decent people are being put at risk.</P>
    <P>Only this morning I made a last attempt to ask Mr. Hanlon to withhold <Col N="2183" /> the running down of the factory.  Management have gone in to work this week to finish 30 ambulances.  Already orders are being lost.  Some people for their own reasons, be they what they may, invited British newspapers and television over to destroy the operation of the only ambulance factory in this country.  Noel Hanlon started from nothing and took the risks.  He looked after his workers well.  There is a good trade union record in this country but the reality is that to stay in business you have to be competitive. You have to produce your ambulances at the right price or you do not sell them.  If the Deputy wants to throw 220 people out of work the Irish people will have no part of it, and we in Longford will have no part of it either.</P>
    <P>The branch secretary of the union is a decent man but, wherever the influences <Col N="2184" /> are coming from, I tell the Deputy, we will not stand for it in Longford town.  If the Deputy wants to force an Irish industry to go to Liverpool, let him force it and he will get his answer whenever the election comes.  If Deputy Mac Giolla has any decency he will withdraw the allegation he made that the man was not paying his taxes.  Indeed five years ago that man took over a factory that was failing and doubled the workforce.  I will have no part in trying to get a job back for a man who would make a statement like that and I call on the union tonight to take disciplinary action.  If that was done some commonsense might return to the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply of 24 March the Government will continue the policy of successive Governments in opposing apartheid and working for its speedy and peaceful abolition.  This country has already introduced measures against South Africa including the restrictions on the import of South African agricultural produce in addition to our participation in the measures agreed upon by the Twelve member states of the Community. The Government will continue to work for the adoption of effective sanctions by the United Nations against South Africa and for the adoption of further common measures by the Twelve member states of the European Community.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledge the special status accorded to the ANC and the Pan African Congress by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.  However, it is normal practice for the Irish Government to recognise only States.  The Government have no plans to ask the ANC to open an office in Dublin.  ANC members have visited Ireland on a number of occasions and have been received appropriately.  I will be happy to meet Mr. Oliver Tambo should he decide to visit Ireland.</P>

      <P>The accompaniment by the RUC of UDR patrols which come into direct contact with the community is a policy to which I attach a high priority.  The Deputy will be aware that the principle of RUC accompaniment in such circumstances has already been agreed by the British authorities, so what is involved now is the implementation of that principle.  I have been availing of the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference to press for the full implementation of this principle with all possible speed.  I have also availed of the conference machinery to raise specific cases of unaccompanied UDR patrols which have been brought to my attention, and I will continue to pursue such cases vigorously in the conference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if I am satisfied with the level of accompaniment.  I am satisfied that progress is being made, but I will be fully satisfied only when all UDR patrols are accompanied by the RUC on all operations involving contact with the community.</P>

    <P>The amount represents only a small percentage of total coal imports.  The Government has no plans to introduce a unilateral ban on the importation of South African coal but favours the imposition of such a ban by the Twelve member states of the European Community. The Deputy will recall that such a move was considered last year but was not introduced as not all partners could agree.  Ireland will continue to press for such a ban by the Twelve.  It is the view of the Government that concerted action by the Twelve is a far more effective way of putting pressure on the South African Government than any unilateral action Ireland might take.</P>

      <P>As of 31 March 1987, a total of £20,124,337 was outstanding in payments due to Ireland by the United Nations in respect of costs arising from peacekeeping operations.  Of this amount, £19,554,000 relates to our involvement with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since May 1978.  It should however be noted that for the period from the establishment of the force to March 1987 the net extra cost <Col N="1885" /> (that is excluding normal pay and allowances) of maintaining our contingent with UNIFIL has not exceeded the total reimbursements received from the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The remaining amount, £570,337 arises out of our participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Of this amount, £151,422 represents general claims for the period from January 1979 to December 1984 and £418,915 is in respect of death and disability claims presented since November 1975.  As our participation in the force has been at a significantly reduced level since 1973 most of these claims relate to the period prior to that date.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in payments by the United Nations in respect of our participation in UNIFIL arises because certain UN member states refuse to pay their assessed contributions to the UNIFIL account.  The Government's concern at this situation has been made known on all appropriate occasions to the Secretary General, as well as to the States directly concerned.  Our delegation at the General Assembly has been active in highlighting this issue and has co-operated with the representatives of other troop contributing countries in pressing for its early resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards UNFICYP, the position is that the force is financed by voluntary contributions from member states, and these fall considerably short of the costs incurred.  The size of the resulting deficit, which stood at approximately $155 million in respect of the period to May 1987, makes it unlikely that early progress can be made with regard to reimbursement of the sums outstanding.  With a view to securing some improvement in the overall situation, the Secretary General, with the full support of troop contributors, including Ireland, recently raised for consideration by the members of the Security Council the question of a change in the method of financing the force from a voluntary to an assessed basis.  In the event the necessary measure of agreement was not forthcoming.  The Government will nevertheless continue to lend <Col N="1886" /> support to measures which offer the prospect of increasing the funds available to the force and of reducing the amounts due to troop contributors.</P>

Since coming into office I have informed myself of the work of the committee and chaired a number of its meetings.</P>

    <P>The committee is continuing to prepare several important projects for the bicentenary which will form the core of the Irish bicentennial programme.  These include the microfilming of the large collection of documents in the State Paper Office relating to the transportation from Ireland of convict prisoners to Australia in the period 1788-1853, for presentation during the bicentenary to the Australian authorities.  The committee is also preparing several exhibitions and presentations of wider artistic and cultural interest to take place in Australia next year.  In addition to the projects which the committee itself is organising or coordinating I expect that there will be a wide range of other Irish activities and exchanges involving Australia during the bicentennial year especially in the sporting, educational and youth areas.  The committee is examining ways in which the bicentenary can be marked by Irish people in Ireland as well as Australia and we hope that many Australians will find it possible to visit Ireland next year.  I <Col N="1888" /> should add that there is close co-operation between the bicentennial committee and its counterpart committee in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Rudolf Hess was tried before the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, sentenced and imprisoned at the end of the second World War by the four occupying powers, namely, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union.  He has been held in Spandau military prison under Four Power agreement since that time.  His continued detention in Spandau is a matter for these four powers and I understand that the three western powers involved, who are prepared to agree to his release on humanitarian grounds, keep the case under review.  I do not consider that there is any useful action that I, or the Twelve within the framework of European Political Co-operation, could take on this question.</P>

      <P>As I have previously indicated to the Deputy our efforts at the United Nations and other international fora on the conflict in the Western Sahara have been directed towards a peaceful settlement. At the United Nations we have supported the guidelines of the OAU as set out in a General Assembly resolution adopted by consensus in 1983.  The consensus adoption of a resolution on this <Col N="1890" /> issue in our view assisted the peace process and together with our partners in the Twelve and other west European states we have continued to encourage a consensus approach.  On those occasions when no consensus has emerged we have taken the view that the tabling of separate, competing and divisive resolutions would not advance the peace process and we have accordingly abstained.  This conflict involves two states, Algeria and Morocco, with whom we have friendly relations and diplomatic ties.  All parties are now agreed that a referendum should be held in the region to allow the Saharan people themselves to decide on the status of their territory.  Morocco and the Polisario continue however to lay down mutally unacceptable conditions for the organisation of such a referendum.  In such circumstances we see our role as one of encouraging consensus where possible and in supporting the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary General working in co-operation with the Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity.</P>
      <P>The fact that there was a meeting recently between President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria and King Hassan of Morocco to discuss Western Sahara is encouraging.  We would hope that it presages a move towards a consensus approach to this tragic problem.</P>
      <P>We are not in a position to recognise an independent state in the Western Sahara before the people of the region have decided the issue of self determination through a referendum.  For this reason, neither Ireland, nor any of its partners in the Twelve recognise an independent state on the territory and any claim to jurisdiction over adjacent territorial waters has to be regarded in the light of this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Along with our partners in the Community, we are following the situation in Sri Lanka with concern.  Ireland supported this year's resolution adopted at the UN Commission on Human Rights inviting the Government of Sri Lanka to intensify its co-operation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and to consider favourably the offer of the services of the ICRC to fulfil its functions of protection of humanitarian standards, including the provision of assistance and protection to victims of all affected parties.</P>
      <P>In their statement on 5 June on the tensions between India and Sri Lanka the 12 member states of the European Community stated their belief that whatever the motives for the actions undertaken on either side, the parties must avoid any increase of tension in the region.  They expressed their strong wish for improvement in India-Sri Lanka relations without which the central problem, namely the ethnical conflict within Sri Lanka, will not be resolved.  The Twelve also noted that the Government of Sri Lanka has the responsibility for maintaining law and order in that country. There is, therefore, no question of urging the United Nations to intervene in the dispute in Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>The Twelve recalled their previous statements and regretted that it has proved impossible up to now to find a peaceful solution to this internal conflict. They reiterated their condemnation of terrorist actions with numerous civilian casualties.  They are deeply shocked by the recent brutal massacre of Buddhist monks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve noted the responsibility of <Col N="1894" /> the Government of Sri Lanka for maintaining law and order and shared its conviction that a negotiated settlement is the only way to reach a lasting solution acceptable to all parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I am personally very keenly aware of the queues outside the Passport Office and I am having the operation of that office kept under continuous daily review.  To alleviate the queues and to shorten in so far as is possible the length of time people have to spend in these queues I have had the following measures taken: (a) The staff have been increased from a base of 25 permanent staff to 110 at present; (b) a new phone system is being introduced this week to deal with phone queries; (c) the actual queues themselves are being managed in such a way that applicants who wish to leave in forms or collect completed passports do not have to queue with those who wish to pursue their applications that day.</P>
      <P>As I told the House last week the Passport Office is facing a 20 per cent increase in applications this year so far.  I would again appeal to members of the public who plan to go abroad on holidays this year to apply in good time and by post. Such applications will be dealt with within ten to 14 days of receipt.

The social welfare pension is paid gross and it is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to it by an appropriate restriction of the tax-free allowances under PAYE.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information concerning the amount of the taxpayer's retirement pension now obtained by the Inspector of Taxes, an amended certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year, 1987-88, incorporating marginal relief will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.  Any tax over-deducted from his retirement pension since 6 April 1987 will be refunded by the payer of the pension on operation of the amended certificate.</P>

The decisions as to whether such provision should be made and whether the size of the provision should be published, are matters for the body's directors.  The adequacy of any provision will further be subject to scrutiny by the body's auditors. The relevant Minister will of course obtain from the body all the information he requires in regard to its operations, <Col N="1899" /> results, and financial position.  The Deputy will be aware that no specific reference is made to bad and doubtful debts in the comprehensive guidelines governing the format of the reports and accounts of State bodies which were adopted by the Government on 16 December 1986.</P>

While a considerable amount of work rémains to be done, it is expected that a preliminary design for this major scheme will be completed in the summer of 1989.  In the absence of design details, it is not possible to accurately assess the likely duration of any cost-benefit or environmental analyses or to say when scheme works might be commenced.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in reply to a <Col N="1903" /> previous parliamentary question which he put down on this subject, a considerable amount of work would be involved in the consolidation of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the related provisions of 26 subsequent Finance Acts (including the 1987 Bill when enacted). Ideally, the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and later provisions relating to capital gains together with the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, should be included in a consolidation measure of this kind.</P>
      <P>This undertaking would require the deployment of a substantial number of highly trained staff in the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The commissioners have informed me that because of the present heavy demands on staff resources they have been unable to allocate the necessary senior staff to this task on a full time basis.  While some of the work has been completed it is unlikely that the original target date of 1987 for the introduction of a new consolidated Bill will now be met.  The commissioners are, however, aware of the need for such consolidation and, within the constraints mentioned, are making every effort to have drafting work brought to a conclusion at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 to 63, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The detailed allocation of manpower and official transport to individual stations is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current Garda strength at Clondalkin is 58 and that this strength is considered to be adequate to meet the needs of all areas served from the station, including Lealand and Bawnogue.  The position will, however, continue to be kept under review.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of assigning a bangharda to Clondalkin, I understand that at present the station accommodation there is not suitable for such an assignment, but that the problem may be overcome if a proposal to convert the adjoining married quarters into station accommodation is found to be feasible. In the meantime, there is an arrangement whereby banghardaí attached to the district headquarters station at Ballyfermot are available to attend to cases in the Clondalkin sub-district, as the need arises, and the Garda authorities consider that this arrangement is working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>In so far as the allocation of official transport is concerned, the Garda authorities consider that the current allocation of two cars and two motor cycles to Clondalkin station is adequate.  If necessary, the Garda transport allocated to Ballyfermot or Ronanstown stations can be called on to provide added cover for the Clondalkin area.</P>

      <P>This case involves the participation of CIE in the Local Government (Transfer of Service Scheme), 1984, operated by the Department of the Environment.  Primary responsibility in relation to such transfer of service rests between CIE and the Department of the Environment.  My only function in the matter, in the event of amendments being required to the CIE superannuation schemes on foot of any transfer arrangements entered into, is to consider and confirm any such amendments that may be approved.</P>
      <P>I have already advised CIE that I would have no objection to their amending their salaried staff superannuation scheme to provide for transfer of service on lines agreed with the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>CIE is prepared to facilitate the transfer of superannuation entitlements to Galway County Council for the person concerned.  Before effect can be given to such an arrangement, however, agreement has to be reached between the Department of the Environment and the committee of the CIE superannuation scheme concerned as to the conditions on which the transfer can take place; discussions are taking place between the parties concerned.  CIE is conscious of the urgency of this matter for the person concerned and is endeavouring to arrive at a speedy resolution of the matter.  It will be a matter for Galway County Council to advise the person concerned in due course.</P>

The FAST programme, therefore, takes a broad overview of Community science and technology policy and forecasts new directions and priorities for the future.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as a member of the Community, through the usual fora at Commission and Council levels, has contributed to the definition of the successive stages of the FAST programme since its launch in 1978.  Under the current four year programme for the years 1984-1987, Ireland has participated actively in the FAST programme through:</P>

    <P>(3)  carrying out contract research under different elements of the programme.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland's interaction with the FAST programme is co-ordinated through the National Board for Science and Technology who act as the Irish national member of the 12+ 1 FAST network which comprises the 12 member states and the FAST team of the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The implications of the work done in the FAST programme for 1984-87 is currently being assessed in the various FAST committees, sub-committees and in the European Commission.  The NBST will, in due course, co-ordinate the assessment of the implications for Ireland of the programme results at national level.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the burden which high insurance costs impose on all sections of the community and the problems being experienced by the jarveys and ponymen cannot be taken in isolation from the general insurance market conditions.  It is, unfortunately, the case that equestrian activities give rise to a particular risk of injury to and claims by members of the public.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurance if an adequate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved. In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £36 million on their general liability business.</P>
      <P>The problem has to be tackled by promoting greater safety measures and doing everything possible to avoid accidents and hence claims.  Speculative claims and unnecessary litigation and legal expenses have to be discouraged.</P>
      <P>Until such time as there is an improvement in insurance companies' underwriting experience, problems of cost and availability will persist.  I refer the Deputy to my reply on 31 March last to Deputy Spring in which I set out the steps necessary to improve the general insurance environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, <Col N="1926" /> responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services (comprising lighthouses, light vessels, beacons etc.) around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is vested in three bodies known as General Lighthouse Authorities, namely, the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) who serve the coasts around Ireland, Trinity House which has responsibility for England and Wales and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, who are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.  While the lights in the three areas are separately held and managed by the three lighthouse authorities, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit.</P>
      <P>Expenditure is met from the general lighthouse fund which derives its income from the collection of light dues in ports in Britain and Ireland.  There is a substantial gap between revenue from light dues in Ireland and expenditure by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This arises because the elaborate system of lights demanded by the geographical situation of Ireland has not been matched by a corresponding flow of shipping traffic into Irish ports.  The cost of operations of the CIL in the State in the year ended 31 March 1986 exceeded revenue by about £8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following negotiations between the Irish and British authorities, agreement was reached in 1985 that in future a greater share of the costs incurred by the CIL in the State will be met from sources in the State.  Under the agreement, the lights dues collected at Irish ports will be supplemented as necessary by an Exchequer contribution so that total revenue from sources in the State will account for 50 per cent of CIL's expenditure in the State.  The arrangement will be phased in over a five-year period commencing at a level of 30 per cent in 1987 and increasing to reach the 50 per cent level by 1991.  The 1987 Exchequer contribution (paid in January 1987) to the general lighthouse fund was £1.287 million. It is estimated that the Exchequer <Col N="1927" /> contribution for 1988 will be of the order of £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>The agreement marked the culmination of the first stage of discussions which began in 1982.  Discussions are continuing on the statutory and administrative relationships between the Irish and British authorities and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, including a joint review of the areas in which existing legislation may require to be amended.</P>

      <P>A Building Societies Consultative Council has not yet been appointed under the Building Societies (Amendment) Act, 1986.

      <P>No application has been submitted by Dublin County Council to my Department to extinguish a right of way into this cemetery.  Dublin County Council submitted the Compulsory Purchase (Colmanstown Burial Ground Access) Order, 1984, to my Department for confirmation on 5 February 1985.  The purpose of the order was the acquisition of lands to provide an access to the burial ground.  An objection was made to the order, a public local inquiry was held on 26 April 1985, and the order was annulled by the Minister for the Environment on 7 November 1985.  In deciding to annul the order, the Minister took into consideration the objection made to the order, the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and the report of the person who held the inquiry.  The council was informed at the time that the Minister considered that the compulsory acquisition of land, as proposed, for the provision of a road to a burial ground of unknown capacity would not be justified having regard also to the failure of the council to demonstrate that alternative measures could not be taken to ensure access.</P>

      <P>Statistics relating to the social employment scheme are compiled on the basis of National Manpower Service regions. Details on an individual county basis will be available only when the records of the scheme are completely computerised.</P>
      <P>In the east region of the National Manpower Service, which encompasses counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, there are currently 593 projects in operation. Of these projects it is estimated that approximately 32 per cent are sponsored by voluntary organisations, 8 per cent by public sector bodies and 60 per cent by schools.  The 593 projects employ 1,590 participants.</P>
      <P>The precise number of schools' projects and the number of participants in such projects is not readily available.  It is estimated, however, that there are approximately 350 projects employing 430 participants in schools in the east region.</P>
      <P>The cost of an SES project varies considerably for a number of reasons.  For example, the number of participants employed varies greatly between projects and differing levels of grant aid are available to the different categories of sponsor. Based on the projected expenditure and number of projects in 1987, the average cost per project is estimated to be £12,000.  I should add that the average cost of employing one person for a term of 52 weeks on the SES is approximately £4,500.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 1987 expenditure on SES operations in the east region will be about £9 million.  A detailed list of sponsors operating projects in the region is not readily available.  To provide it would require an inordinate amount of work which could not be justified.</P>

      <P>Statistics in relation to the social employment scheme are compiled on the basis of National Manpower Service regions. Details on a county basis will be available only when the records of the scheme are completely computerised.</P>
      <P>The south-east region which encompasses Counties Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary (S.R.) was the first area to launch projects under the social employment scheme in April 1985 and by December 1985 there were 852 persons participating in the SES in the region.  Participation continued to increase in 1986 and reached a peak of 1,413 persons employed in midyear. Due to participants completing their term of employment under the scheme, participation showed a small steady decrease for the remainder of 1986 and stood at 1,072 by year end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 815 persons participating in the SES in the south-east region.  The regional quota has been increased recently from 1,024 to 1,244 <Col N="1961" /> man-years.  This will allow for a significant increase in the number of participants in the region over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The health boards are responsible for the provision of long term care in their respective areas and are in receipt of many applications for approval of new nursing homes under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, for subvention purposes.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of beds in nursing homes are already being subvented by health boards.  The emphasis in health policy for the aged is for health boards to concentrate resources on developing community services for the elderly rather than providing subventions in respect of maintenance of patients in private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Due to the existing difficult financial situation health boards are unable to incur additional expenditure and further approvals are being deferred for the present.</P>

      <P>The payment of domiciliary care allowance in any individual case is a matter for determination by the health board concerned, having regard to all the relevant circumstances in that case.</P>
      <P>I had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board in this case and have been informed that domiciliary care allowance is payable to eligible persons with effect from the date of receipt of application.  It is not the practice to make payments in respect of any period prior to the date of receipt of application.  There are difficulties of an accounting and budgeting nature in the way of providing for payment of any allowance with effect prior to a date of application.  The Eastern Health Board do not intend to depart from their usual practice in this case.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board have approved a grant of £120,000 to the Irish Society for Autistic Children towards the provision of services at Dunfirth Autistic Community in 1987, an increase of 50 per cent on its 1986 grant.  This increase had regard to the opening of an additional five residential places at Dunfirth in November 1986.  The society, as a voluntary <Col N="1968" /> body, also obtains part of its funds from voluntary fund raising.  The society determines the level of services to be provided at Dunfirth.  I have asked the Eastern Health Board to monitor the situation at Dunfirth to ensure that there is no undue hardship caused to the children or their parents by any proposed curtailment by the society of services at Dunfirth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines issued by my Department set out in detail the services for which charges are to be levied under the inpatient and outpatient regulations, together with the categories of persons and the circumstances in which persons are not liable for a charge.  The guidelines were issued some time before the introduction of the charges in order to ensure that providers of inpatient and outpatient services and the general public would be fully aware of an individual's liability under the regulations.  In relation to the collection of charges the guidelines provide that as far as possible the charges should be made at the time of receipt of services or on discharge from hospital as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I have made it quite clear on a number of occasions that the introduction of charges would not affect the long standing tradition in our hospitals where persons in need of emergency treatment would continue to receive such treatment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the collection of hospital charges is a matter for local management.  Nevertheless from the information available to me, I am satisfied that while reasonable efforts must be made to collect the statutory charge, emergency treatment will not be refused where a person does not possess £10 at the time of treatment.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board have an alcoholism and drug abuse prevention centre in Arbour House, Cork city.  This is a community based out-patient centre which is involved in prevention, intervention and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse in Cork city.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation services for drug abusers are provided by the pyschiatric services.  In addition, a specific rehabilitation service is provided by the Coolemine Therapeutic Community at: Coolemine House, Lord Edward Street, Dublin; St. Martha's, Navan; Ashleigh House, Clonee and Coolemine Lodge, Clonsilla.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board also provide a service at the Talbot Day Centre in Buckingham Street.  The Rutland Centre provides a service at Templeogue and the Ana-Liffey Project provides an individually designed rehabilitation programme in Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement has been reached on the purchase of a property for a new walk-in out-patient drug treatment facility in the <Col N="1976" /> inner city area of Dublin and the contract for these premises was signed recently. The out-patient services currently provided in the drug advisory and treatment centre in Jervis Street will be transferred to the new facility.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when the new out-patient facility is functioning in the inner city area of Dublin, this, together with the detoxification service to be provided in Beaumont Hospital and other treatment facilities available, will provide a comprehensive service for drug abusers. However, the question of providing further facilities will continue to be considered in the light of the perceived need for such facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is taken to refer to national schools and raises two separate issues, namely, the rate of grant for the instalment of heating systems in two-teacher national schools, and the Department's policy and practice <Col N="1981" /> in relation to which type of heating system it will grant-aid in two-teacher national schools.</P>
      <P>As to the first of these issues, the rules for national schools set out that the amount of the grant sanctioned for building, improvement and furnishing national schools is normally two-thirds of the cost of carrying out the works.  The rules also set out that in exceptionally poor localities the Minister may make a larger grant than the normal two-thirds, and this stipulation may be availed of as necessary by national school authorities to negotiate a more favourable rate of local contribution. There is no proposal to amend this regulation.  Having regard to the long-standing policy on the part of my Department not to replace one-teacher and two-teacher national schools, capital grants to such schools are confined to the minimum necessary to maintain essential amenities, which include heating.  Where the original heating system in a small national school requires to be replaced, it has generally been found that the most efficient and cheapest replacement system is by way of electrical storage heating.  Exceptions have been made where there was evidence that the capital cost of bringing electrical power to a school was excessive and that the provision of an oil-fired system would work out more cheaply.  Such instances are now becoming fewer.  It is not my Department's intention to alter its current policy or approach in this matter and each application is dealt with on its merits.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, resulting from a resolution passed by the Irish Vocational Education Association in 1985, vocational education committees have refused to sign deeds of trust for new community schools.  This does not imply a refusal to co-operate in the efficient running of the schools in question since the relevant vocational education committees have, with one exception, nominated, their representatives to the board of managements of the schools.  I cannot accept that the status of community schools, or the quality of education being provided in them, has in any way been diminished.</P>

This was a letter addressed by the Director General of UNESCO to the Minister for Education. The letter concerns a possible Convention on Technical and Vocational Education.  A first draft of the convention was submitted by UNESCO for our comments on the understanding that a special committee of governmental experts may be convened in 1989 to prepare a final draft of the convention.</P>

The board would determine the uses for community purposes of the school building or grounds at times which would not affect school work.  The board should also submit financial estimates for the school in such form as the committee may require.  It should have responsibility for petty cash disbursements or it may delegate this responsibility to the school principal.</P>
