      <NameTxt>Prime Minister Hawke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, when I arrived at Dublin Airport on Sunday, I told the Taoiseach that I felt as if I had arrived home.  The friendly welcome you extended to me then has been borne out in all that I have been shown by all whom I have met over the past few days.  I have seen the beauty of your country and felt the spontaneous warmth of your people.  Indeed, I do feel at home.</P>
      <P>The Australian and the Irish people share so many values and so much history that our kinship could hardly be closer.  Today, however, in this place, we celebrate perhaps the most important of those shared values.  For this place is a tangible expression of the right of the people to govern themselves and of every individual to speak his mind.  Many great Irishmen &mdash; Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell among them &mdash; fought for the right to do what I am doing now: to speak in the free Parliament of a free Irish nation.</P>
      <P>Of course, many of those Irish nationalists who were never permitted to achieve their aspirations for liberty in their own homeland came to Australia to enrich our social and political life.  Charles Gavan Duffy, for example, became Premier of Victoria and lived to see Australia become a united, independent nation, after spending half his life in Ireland fighting for representative Government.  What an irony it is then that Australia, after just over a century from the time of its European settlement, should have achieved independence a generation before Ireland.</P>
      <P>The struggle of Irish patriots over centuries is fulfilled in this building, in the parliamentary service given to it by such national leaders as de Valera and MacBride, and in the vigour of your parliamentary life.</P>
      <P>I do not need to remind you how precious an achievement that is or how fundamental to political life are the liberties of free speech, inside and outside parliament &mdash; or how infinitely superior a means of government is the process of free and fair democratic election to the alternatives of violence and authoritarianism which we see around the world today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of democratic parliaments we have the gravest of responsibilities, not just to our own constituents and to our own <Col N="771" /> nation but truly to the whole world.  For there are all too few parliamentary democracies in the world, and all too many forces seeking to limit or even to snuff out those that do exist.</P>
    <P>It is not inappropriate in this context that I pause to make particular mention of Fiji, one of Australia's closest and most important South Pacific neighbours and a nation where the democratic flame burned brightly for the 17 years since it became independent.  Fiji has recently succumbed to military rule.  I am sure I speak for all of us when I express my deepest hope that all the people of the nation of Fiji will quickly secure once more their democratic rights which have been taken from them.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I know it is a rare event for a foreign leader to be invited to address the Dáil and I want to assure you that I am grateful for and deeply honoured by the motion passed unanimously on 14 October to extend this privilege to me.  You have placed me in distinguished company, since my only predecessors as foreign leaders on this podium are President Reagan and the late President Kennedy.  The choice of two Americans and one Australian reflects the historical truth, and, may I say, the paradoxical truth, of this most anti-imperialist of nations and that historical and paradoxical truth is that Ireland is the head of a huge empire in which Australia and the United States are the principal provinces.  It is an empire acquired not by force of Irish arms but by force of Irish character, an empire not of political coercion but of spiritual affiliation, created by the thousands upon thousands of Irish men and women who chose to leave these shores, or who were banished from them, to help in the building of new societies over the years.</P>
    <P>It seems appropriate, with hindsight, that President Kennedy opened his address to the Irish Parliament in June 1963 with a story about the remarkable Thomas Meagher.  Meagher led the Irish Brigade into battle at Fredericksburg in the American Civil War but his life story, in fact, spanned three continents &mdash; he was born in Waterford; he died in America; but he also spent time in Australia as a convict transported for his involvement in the 1848 uprising.</P>
    <P>It is true that more of your fellow-countrymen and forefathers became American than Australian.  But it is true, too, that the Irish form a greater proportion of the Australian population than of the American.  Indeed, almost one-third of Australia's population &mdash; more than five out of 16 million people &mdash; proudly claim Irish ancestry.</P>
    <P>Outside Ireland itself, Australia is the most Irish of nations, and we are proud of it.  Moreover, I assert that those who came to <Col N="772" /> Australia &mdash; from Ireland as well as from Great Britain and elsewhere &mdash; found a society which presented them with opportunities that were not available in older societies where rigid hierarchies and orders of social class were already established.  The Irish found in Australia a congenial and egalitarian environment where their talents were welcomed and rewarded.  That spirit of egalitarianism remains one of the distinguishing characteristics in the make-up of both our countries.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure yesterday, in an address to University College, Dublin, of outlining my thoughts about the extraordinary way the Irish took up the opportunities presented to them and contributed in almost every field to the creation of the Australian nation and the Australian identity.  In particular, I called attention to the Irish commitment to justice and equality of opportunity, a commitment which has been the central theme of your struggle for nationhood in this country and which underpinned so much of the Irish contribution to Australia.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in passing that a new eminent personage is expected to arrive in Australia soon from Ireland.  A worldwide search was instituted some time ago for a statue to grace the newly refurbished Queen Victoria building in Sydney.  The statue sought was of Queen Victoria herself but in none of the many former British colonies of the Victorian era could a town hall or city plaza or private royalist be found who was willing to part with a suitable statue of the Queen. Until the search came to Ireland &mdash; and to this city.  I am pleased to report that a statue of Queen Victoria was found not far from this very building and is to be &mdash; if I can use this term in other than its former sense &mdash; transported to Sydney and placed on public display.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as a leader of one of the oldest and proudest Labour parties, the Australian Labour Party, I acknowledge the seminal role the Irish played in the formation of that party and of our trade union movement, and in our struggle for a fairer, more compassionate, more prosperous society.</P>
    <P>A number of my predecessors as Labour Prime Minister &mdash; including the incomparable John Curtin and Joseph Benedict Chifley &mdash; were of Irish extraction.  In the way Curtin devoted himself to the task of leading Australia through the Second World War, the Irish attributes of dedicated and selfless commitment, determination, character and courage shine through.  It is equally easy to see an Irish-derived compassion and vision in his successor Chifley's sweeping reconstruction of the Australian economy to equip it for the challenges of peacetime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Among today's generation of Labour leaders, the Irish tradition is still strong and if you looked at a list of my Ministers you would see enough names like Bowen, Keating, Hayden, Kerin, Walsh, Young, Ryan, Duffy and Kelly to satisfy even the most nationalistic among you.  Indeed, half of my Ministry claims Irish origin &mdash; so now you may understand even more clearly why I said at the outset that I feel at home.</P>
    <P>In 1985 we were privileged to receive an official visit by President Hillery and last year the Australian Parliament played host to the first visit of a delegation of Irish parliamentarians.  We will be sending an Australian delegation here next year in honour of the millenium of the City of Dublin.  I can assure you that it is a delegation which poses a major problem of selection from the long list of bids that are in to join it.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it would not be appropriate if I dwelt today solely on the historical elements of our relationship, as important and enduring as they are.  As political leaders we must turn our attention to the ways in which we can address the many contemporary issues we confront.  As medium sized western industrial economies, which share and nourish the same commitment to democratic principles and practices, Australia and Ireland bring vitally important perspectives to the resolution of these problems.</P>
    <P>Neither Australia nor Ireland is a large country compared to the super powers and the economic giants.  By ourselves, our capacities to effect great international change may seem slight.  What we can do is by force of example, and by the persuasion we can apply to others.  Australia, through its alliance relationship and through our many bilateral links with other countries, and Ireland through in particular its membership of the European Community, and both of us through our membership of the United Nations and other international bodies, can take positions that advance our goals and keep faith with our principles.  And, of course, many of those goals and principles we share, and many of our aspirations we hold in common.</P>
    <P>Australia is an aligned nation, Ireland espouses neutrality; but from these different vantage points we both work for a world in which conflict and tension are lessened, and in which the arms race can be brought under control and reversed.  We both share a sense of expectation and satisfaction that the United States and the Soviet Union are about to agree to limit their intermediate nuclear forces. That agreement will be the first occasion on which the super powers <Col N="774" /> will have agreed to reduce their nuclear forces, not merely to slow down the rate of growth.</P>
    <P>With this agreement signed we must, as nations with a vital interest in both the preservation of peace and the advancement of human development, continue to work towards further reductions in the nuclear arsenals.  Our goal must be that one day the world's resources may be concentrated not on the needless accumulation of weapons which could obliterate mankind but on the essential humanitarian tasks of caring for the elderly, sheltering the homeless and feeding the hungry.</P>
    <P>Australia and Ireland are also working in harmony towards the enhancement of human rights around the world.  Neither of us should ever be diffident or apologetic about supporting in other countries the rights and freedoms which we fought and worked so hard to achieve at home.  We advocate and support decolonisation and the principles of national self-determination.  We both stand for the elimination of the evil of apartheid and the expunging of racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Vancouver, Canada.  Over recent years, Australia has been at the forefront of those in the Commonwealth who see the need for measures to place pressure on the racist Government of South Africa in the direction of negotiations with the black majority.  Australia and Ireland have been active and willing participants in the efforts of the United Nations, through its peace keeping forces, to contribute to peace and stability in many of the world's areas of tension.  May I pay, on behalf of the people of Australia, particular tribute to Ireland's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The commitment of successive Irish Governments to the enhancement of the prospects for international peace is, of course, entirely consistent with your efforts over the years to achieve peace and stability on your own borders.  The troubles in Northern Ireland pose one of the most heartrending issues facing not just Ireland, and not just countries like Australia that have Irish connections, but the whole world.  Australia strongly supports the efforts by the Irish and British Governments, through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to end the communal strife in Northern Ireland.  Above all it is clear that violence can only worsen that communal strife, and can only hamper the progress towards peace which is being made.  I assure you that the Australian Government will do all within its power to discourage any Australian citizen from adding in any way to the violence in Northern Ireland.  We believe that reconciliation and the search for <Col N="775" /> understanding provide the only way forward.  And we recognise that this is precisely Ireland's approach.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ultimately peace and the enhancement of human rights depend on economic growth and prosperity.  If as political leaders we have not understood the inter-relationship of economic policy and political stability, then we have learned nothing of the lessons of this century.  The world paid a heavy price in the Second World War for the failure of the major economies in the twenties and thirties to control the tendencies towards protectionism. As horrendous as that price was in the Second World War, it would be as nothing compared to the results of unbridled conflict in the nuclear age.</P>
    <P>Both our countries have undergone an historic transformation in their economic orientation.  In Australia, beginning in the fifties, we came to the recognition that our future lay in the Asia-Pacific region.  My Government have done everything they can, through the redirection of our external policies and domestic restructuring, to promote the enmeshment of our economy with the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest growing economic area of the world.  Fourteen years ago, Ireland too made a fundamental decision to link its future with Western Europe, through membership of the EEC.  For both of us, these changes have led to great achievements.</P>
    <P>Your President, Dr. Hillery, noted in his address to a parliamentary luncheon in Canberra in 1985, that the Irish economy has developed in a relatively short period into a highly sophisticated, modern, industrialised one.  But we both now face major new challenges. It is my firm belief that hard decisions are best made with the active understanding and co-operation of those who are most affected by them.</P>
    <P>In my talks on Monday with the Taoiseach, we discussed strategies of consensus and co-operation through which our nations can create the self-discipline needed to meet our economic challenges.  We also discussed the advantages inherent in the removal of domestic barriers which can produce uncompetitiveness, low productivity and inefficiency.</P>
    <P>We found common ground on all this.  Countries like ours cannot afford to live beyond their means.  The tough political task of responsible economic management requires us to re-order our priorities, reduce deficits, attack indebtedness, tighten spending and question the assumptions of the past.  Between us we may have differences about how we do that, but those things must be done. We must do this not by creating confrontation in our communities <Col N="776" /> but by actively seeking to inform and involve all members in making the decisions which are necessary.  Short-term costs will inevitably ensure in this process, but Governments, I believe, have the obligation to take the right and tough decisions now in the long-term interests of their people.</P>
    <P>One of the central factors facing economies of medium size is that domestic adjustment, however essential, is not enough in itself to maximise growth.  All the hard decisions and all the efforts to adjust will avail a nation little if it must swim against an international tide hostile to economic growth and development.  In a world of vast external imbalances among developed countries and enormous debt problems, particularly in the Third World, the strength of the world trading system can no longer be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>I am sure you would not expect me to visit a member of the European Community without mentioning in this context the damaging impact on that trading system of the Community's policies of agricultural subsidisation.  Australia believes high levels of protection and subsidisation in the centre of world economic powers &mdash; Europe, Japan and the United States &mdash; will in the end only hurt all consumers and producers, whether they live behind the protectionist walls of the major economies or outside them.  It would be shortsightedness of the most dangerous kind to adopt policies which fail to recognise that all would be losers in the end.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, next year Australia is to celebrate the bicentenary of the arrival of the First Fleet on Australian shores on 26 January 1788.  Dublin, this great seat of European civilisation, will celebrate its millenium in 1988. It is appropriate to recall here that before the First Fleet was ever conceived of, and before even the foundation of Dublin itself, there was a living civilisation in Australia &mdash; that of the Aboriginal people &mdash; a civilisation which stretches back at least 40,000 years.  For all that our bicentenary celebrations must focus on the achievements of the last 200 years, it will be my intention that due recognition be paid to the obligation Australians owe to the original Australians.</P>
    <P>For Australians, 1988 will be a milestone in our national development and will give us cause to reflect seriously on the progress we have made.  It will also focus our attention on the way in which Australia has relied on and been immeasurably enriched by the constant influx of new peoples, new cultures and new ideas, to sustain the momentum of that development.  It is in this context that we in Australia will have special cause to recognise the contribution of the Irish people over the last 200 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> During my visit I have been pleased to hear at first hand of the plans being made, both Government-sponsored and private, to participate in our Bicentennial celebrations in Australia.  I say on behalf of all Australians that we are deeply grateful for the contribution you are making.  And may I say how much we are looking forward to seeing the Taoiseach in Australia next March during Irish week.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are helping generously, in a number of important ways, with the celebration of the Bicentenary.  We look forward to welcoming <i>Asgard II</i> when she joins the parade of Tall Ships on Sydney Harbour next January.  She and her crew, I assure you, will be made to feel at home.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have also assisted with a number of scholarly projects investigating the Irish-Australian connection.  And of very great value &mdash; not just at the scholarly level but for the whole Australian community &mdash; the Irish Government are making available in microfilm the convict records of the 40,000 Irish men and women who were transported to Australia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  This will enable us to answer with more precision a central question of Australian history: who were the convicts?  Where did they come from?  What were their crimes?  Most of us, in our minds, use that word in inverted commas.  I can answer you that when we get these details many Australians will try to establish that they are members of a very great élite.  But this much, my friends, is already crystal clear.  Whether it was politics or poverty which forced the Irish out of their homes and across the seas to Australia, the new arrivals invested our new society with lasting and invaluable qualities.</P>
    <P>Australia is very much the richer for having been able to draw on the generous influx of Irish aspirations, Irish traditions, and Irish spirit.  We would not be the country we are today were it not for you.  It is those bequests which are the durable and over-arching bicentennial gifts from Ireland to Australia.  They are the debts Australians for their part owe to the Irish.</P>
    <P>I thank you again for your invitation to address you and for the warm hospitality you have extended during my visit, not only to myself and Hazel, but to all those travelling with me.  It has been a privilege to renew in this way the ties &mdash; the already close and friendly ties &mdash; between Australia and Ireland.  I look forward to a future in which Australia and Ireland can play an even more co-operative role with each other and a more constructive role together in world affairs.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl don Teach gur gearradh siar an cheist a chuir mé isteach toisc gur ceapadh gur bhain cuid di leis an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt.  Ach ós rud é go bhfuil an cheist mar atá sí faoi láthair, ba mhaith liom an cheist bhreise seo a chur ar an Aire Stáit. Is é rud a bhí i gceist agam ná an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas faoi láthair scríobh chuig na Ranna Stáit éagsúla agus chuig na ranna áitiúla, a aimsiú go beacht go bhfuil sé mar cheart dlí ag na daoine sin atá ag baint úsáid as an nGaeilge gach lá a ngnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge leis na Ranna Stáit.  Mar shampla, tá daoine tuirseach ós comhair na cúirte tar éis a n-ainmneacha a bheith aistrithe, tar éis fíneáil a chur orthu agus na billeoga atá i gceist scríofa agus aistrithe i mBéarla, agus níl sé sásúil.  Agus go minic, i ngach gné den chóras Stáit mar atá sé faoi láthair sa Ghaeltacht agus i mo dháilcheantar féin ní féidir glacadh leis go bhfuil an scéal sásúil.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn agan Aire Stáit a mholadh don Rialtas b'fhéidir Bille Cearta a chur i gcrích ionas go mbeidh sé mar ghnáthdhlí, go mbeidh sé mar ghnáthcheart ag muintir na Gaeltachta a ngnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge?</P>

      <P>The grant of £250,000 was allocated to meet the cost of completing the Farnanes by-pass and the cost of works in 1987 on the improvement of the road between the by-pass and Stage Cross. Cork County Council have indicated that they will not be in a position to expend the full £250,000 on this improvement work in 1987 due to difficulties in acquiring the necessary land by agreement.  The local authority recently requested that £143,405 be transferred from the allocation to meet additional expenditure incurred on other road schemes in the county.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers and functions of local authorities are prescribed in an extremely large body of legislation which does not classify these functions by reference to the categories mentioned in the question.  The legislation allows a broad measure of discretion to the individual authority in relation to the level of service to be provided in any area having regard to individual circumstances.  Many different local authority services may be required, depending on the circumstances, to respond to emergency type situations.  It is the responsibility of individual local authorities to have satisfactory plans available so that their services will respond speedily and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have copied the phrase which was contained in the press statement issued on the Minister's behalf by his Department when he announced that there would be a 14 per cent reduction in 1988 in the rate support grant: the assurance is contained in that phrase that local authorities would be able to continue to provide essential emergency services. Presumably whoever drafted that press release had an outline of the essential and emergency services.  Perhaps in the supplementary briefing which the Minister has there is a summary of that outline which he can make available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Deputy's difficulty and I recognise that he understands that local authorities have to establish their own priorities for the different services under their control. Local needs are different depending on the part of the country.  There is not an exact list as to what one authority or another would regard as essential or emergency services.  The important thing <Col N="788" /> is that an essential level of service is maintained by the authorities.  In a large city, as the Deputy would appreciate, refuse disposal would be a vital service whereas in a small rural local authority area it might not be seen in the same way and other methods of disposal would be availed of.  Everybody understands what is regarded generally as being emergency or essential services, but it is a matter for each local authority to decide on their priorities in relation to different services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty but do I take it that the press release issued in his name was issued without checking with each local authority that they would be able to provide essential and emergency services?  Given the pressure of time which no doubt existed for the Minister during the course of this busy autumn, could he say that where a local authority because of local terrain or other conditions is not able to meet the assurance of providing essential and emergency services he will facilitate them with the extra resources necessary?</P>

      <P>Accepting that there is an element of discretion with local authorities as to what constitutes essential services, surely the Minister can define what in his view and the view of the Government is regarded as an essential service to be provided by a local authority? Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the House on that point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Essential services could relate to such things as local authority housing, maintenance of roads, traffic control, public water systems, sewerage systems and that kind of thing.  Essential services could also relate to waste disposal, burial grounds and so on.  There is a whole list of essential services.  The services should be attended to by the local authority from the funds available to them up to a level that they would regard as being adequate for the whole community.  I have not got an arbitrary list to decide for any local authority as to what they should regard as essential.</P>

In view of the Minister's offer of co-operation and his vision as to the range of services in different locations and having regard to the real difficulty that local authorities will be faced with when striking the rate, will the Minister advise on one or two courses that are open to me?  I can put down the question <Col N="792" /> again so that he can define the services or, alternatively, the Government and the Minister, as the Minister responsible, can clearly set out in unambiguous terms the emergency and essential services, irrespective of any part of the country in which a citizen is located, that the Department of the Environment regard as the minimum to justify a rates support grant?</P>

Is the Minister aware of the poor supply there, of the quality of the water, that a notice to boil was issued over 12 months ago and that notice still stands, and that quite a lot of sickness in children and old people was noticed in Belturbet over the summer months?  Is the Minister aware that Belturbet is a Border town suffering extremely from cross Border traffic, with business practically at a standstill, depending on tourism for which an adequate water supply is a must, that at present many guest houses and hotels in the town have not got an adequate water supply and tourists are not attracted there for that reason?  Will the Minister see to it that a new water scheme is started immediately in Belturbet?  The people there have been campaigning for a number of years.  Contract documents have been drawn up and I charge the Minister's Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has a point. The existing system providing 60,000 gallons a day is not capable of meeting the demands placed upon it now.  There have been continuing difficulties about this scheme.  It seems unfortunate that it goes back quite some time in so far as the preparation of the necessary documentation is concerned.  But at least the Deputy will be pleased to hear that, after a long and protracted revision of the documents and the seeking of extra technical advice, these documents are finally in order at long last.  As to the question <Col N="794" /> of providing the funding in the near future, this is an important scheme.  The Deputy has made a good case and if it is possible for me to accommodate him from the allocation available I will be happy to do so.  I cannot say at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is now satisfied that the documents are in order, that the scheme is ready to go forward and that the only holdup is money.  Does the Minister agree that the fact that people have been advised to boil the water suggests that there is a health hazard if the water is not boiled?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allocated £60,000 to Kildare County Council for the initial phase of remedial works to Dara Park in respect of anticipated expenditure this year.  A pilot scheme is at present under way and, following the evaluation of the technical and cost results of this work, the allocation of additional funds will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the absolutely, totally, unsuitable nature of the houses we are talking about?  They are cardboard boxes.  They are unsuitable for human habitation.  They were built as low cost houses to save public funds and will now be the cause of wasting a large amount of public funds.  Is the Minister further aware that this scheme was not alone built of cardboard, by and large, but the sewerage scheme did not work and no money was provided to the local authority to correct it over a number of years?  All they could do was to give the <Col N="796" /> tenants sandbags to keep the sewage out of their houses every time it rained.  In view of this I ask the Minister to agree that at least the £60,000 which has been provided should be allowed to be spent forthwith by the local authority.  They are ready; the pilot scheme has been completed; the Department have been advised of that.  I ask the Minister to allow the £60,000 to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should pursue that much further now because there is a strong indication that that revised allocation might not even be fully expended this year.  But it is available to be spent.  The Deputy may take it from me that I must be in a very good humour today because I am sympathetic to this case as well and the four house pilot scheme the Deputy has referred to is going ahead.</P>

      <P>The money is not fully expended but it is my intention to extend the contract for a further six dwellings.

      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to go into matters which are now in the charge of the board appointed to deal with this very matter.  The important thing is that the matter will be finalised by the end of October.  I am sorry this question session is not taking place subsequent to that because I could have been more forthcoming.  The board have been charged with a responsibility.  They have a special job to do.  They are doing that and have virtually completed it, and by the end of this month that will be all public knowledge.

      <P>The Minister could have withheld his decision in relation to An Foras Forbartha pending a decision by the board he established to review the functions which they are carrying out. Can the Minister tell the House whether he agrees that some five years ago the advice was against abolishing An Foras Forbartha and against even pruning its services, that there was advice to increase investment in environmental research and development?  Does he not regard the present Government decision as contrary to the environmental and health interests of the citizens of this State and does he agree that the only solution is to maintain An Foras Forbartha and to expand its services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Forbartha did certain jobs on direction by the Minister, to satisfy the requirements of the Departments and local authorities.  Much of that work was important and will have to be retained in one way or another.  I do not know what happened five years ago but I would be particularly anxious that the Department of the Environment be <Col N="799" /> strengthened in one particular way anyway, that is in their environmental division.  I have never accepted that that division ever got off the ground since the changeover from the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment.  This is an opportunity to do just that but that is one of a rather long range of things.  I am satisfied that we can get the necessary testing and analytical services we require to function properly at a lower cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the statement issued by the Minister or on his behalf on 1 September announcing the decision to abolish An Foras Forbartha but to retain some of the functions currently undertaken by An Foras within the Department, is he now telling the House, in the non-content of his reply, that when that statement was issued on his behalf the people did not know what functions were going to be retained or that they now know at least some of the functions to be retained in his Department but that he is nor prepared to tell the House as he has not completed the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little of the truth in both.  We did very carefully go through the whole exercise of the functions, job specification and the usage of An Foras Forbartha before the decision was taken. In broad outline, we recognised that certain of the functions could be transferred to other Departments, other authorities and other agencies.  Some of those agencies did not exist 23 years ago and many did not exist for a long time after the setting up of An Foras Forbartha.  Taking all into consideration and to get the best usage from the money available to the Department, we decided that it was possible to achieve these economies.  It was then, I thought, a good idea and I still think it is the proper method, that the board of An Foras would decide finally on the very fine detail of the best placing of some of those essential services and perhaps the termination of some not regarded as essential in today's circumstances. Once the matter has been <Col N="800" /> finalised, by the end of October, all that will be available for public scrutiny and can be the subject of debate here at Estimates time or any other suitable time that the Ceann Comhairle allows.  I should be happy to go into the matter in great detail then.  In fairness to all concerned and perhaps in great fairness to An Foras Forbartha, the matter is being handled very sensitively and it will be much more appropriate a little later.</P>

      <P>Without being unfair to the Minister and having regard to the nature of his replies, is the House to take that he, as Minister for the Environment, decided to abolish this environmental agency in advance of knowing what he was going to do with the functions, without consultation with the people involved and without being clear on what savings were likely to be made?  At the end of October when the decision becomes irrevocable, we might as public representatives, as well as the staff, get some inkling as to the details of this decision?

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will ensure that an immediate review of the operation of the electoral register for the disabled is undertaken with a view to recommending the removal of discriminatory regulations which involve annual costs for medical examinations if a disabled person is to remain on the register; and if he will consult with the bodies representing the disabled when undertaking this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is in such good form today, let me say how disappointed I am that this group are not to be given the same attention as is given to matters of water supply to some parts of the country.  Has the Minister had representations from bodies representing disabled groups indicating their concern at two particular elements in the present operation of the special voters lists which discriminate against them?  This is a scheme which is intended to facilitate them.  They believe that they are seriously discriminated against on the <Col N="804" /> basis, first, that it costs them anything from £10 to £15 annually, depending on the cost of a medical examination, to stay on the electoral register because they must fill in a medical certificate each year. Secondly an aspect of the medical certificate which they find particularly discriminating is that the medical examiner must assess them as being of sound mind and understanding.  Is the Minister happy to allow this to continue?  It would seem that both of these matters could be resolved quite easily and at no additional cost.  If the Minister wishes, I can suggest ways in which that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no record of any objection or complaint having been received to the way the scheme has been operating.  We all understand that medical card holders do not have to pay for the medical certificate and others can get the medical certificate on a routine visit to their doctor without the necessity of any extra expense.  The only representations which I have received are those which I have received from the Deputy just now.  I understand the points she is making and one can readily understand that circumstances can change from one year to the next.  People who were treated last year for a particular complaint may not now be regarded as being disabled under the terms of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986.  The Deputy also referred to the form of certification and I will have another look at this.  I understand that the special voters' list is open only to those who are physically ill or physically disabled persons who are unable to vote for the full duration of the register.  Why would the Deputy not see that as being satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Part B of the special voters application form, which is the medical certificate, does not require certification of physical disability but requires of the medical examiner to certify whether a person is of sound mind, a requirement which a person who is not disabled does not have to undergo.  That is a further discrimination.  If I could just return&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, or ask his departmental officials to consider, that a new method of dealing with this matter which would achieve the same objective and which would remove the element of cost for the disabled would be to ask the regular checkers of the register who are employed each autumn by the local authorities to include the small number of people who would be registered in each area for a physical check-up each year?  This is feasible and would not involve any extra cost.  Instead of insisting on a medical certificate which does involve an annual cost, a simple check by those who are employed by the State could ensure that the disabled are being treated on a similar basis to everybody else and are not being penalised.  I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is requesting is an amendment to the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, which states that when the application is made a person must be of sound mind and understanding and capable of comprehending the act of voting.  Is that not what the Deputy is talking about?  I promise the Deputy that I will have a look at it but I am not sure whether it would be feasible to accommodate her on it.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but it would be fair to say that even in my predecessor's time there were considerable improvements in that area.  Quite a number of polling stations which were inaccessible to the disabled prior to that have now been removed from the list of locations for voting.  If something extra needs to be done, I would be happy to oblige.  I think there is across the board support for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that this very important question has been raised in this House.  Will the Minister agree that persons who are in receipt of long term disability benefit should not have to pay for the medical certificate which has to be presented annually?  If they are accepted as being long term physically disabled and in receipt of a pension, surely it must also be accepted by the medical authorities that it is a life-time disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like an open-ended scheme such as that, When the legislation was being promoted in this House this scheme was deliberately kept tight and it had across the House support. The matter which the Deputy has raised was purchased at that time and it was agreed that it was only when the circumstances went from one particular register to the date of the next register that a special category of person could be accommodated who would be medically certified.  We should not now go away from that.  We have had one or two reasonably bad experiences during the two former schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Building Societies Regulations, 1987, a building society <Col N="808" /> is prohibited from passing on to the borrower their legal costs in the investigation of title and I have no proposals to amend the regulations in this respect.  Corresponding arrangements apply in the case of loans advanced by local authorities. I have no function in relation to insurance companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the fact that building societies prohibited by ministerial order last year from passing on legal fees have now circumvented that ministerial order by introducing handling charges which in some cases amount to £80 and £100?  The banks are largely ignoring the regulations in relation to legal fees and people at the lowest end of the income scale, those who qualify for SDA loans from the local authorities, must pay the legal fees in full. There is duplication, triplication, delays, tardiness and much red tape as well as cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not run away with yourself. The regulations as they now exist, and which I have no intention of changing at this time, prohibit a society from charging the borrower the costs incurred by them in the legal investigation of the title. The two areas they charged for heretofore were the investigation of title and the perfection of security, that would be the creation of the mortgage.  They cannot now charge for the investigation of the title and this has resulted in a reduction of about half of one per cent, plus VAT.  In relation to the other matter &mdash; the perfection of security &mdash; the Deputy is quite right, solicitors have been charging up to approximately £80.  An agreement has now been sought with the Incorporated Law Society regarding the use of a standard certificate of title.  I have written to them in the very recent past requesting them to standardise that charge for certification of title at the lowest possible level.  I am satisfied that there will be a big saving there.  As far as local authorities are concerned, I should say that any of them who were naughty and broke the rules have been told by me that that is not to continue as a practice. <Col N="809" /> I understand they have now all complied. I have sought assurances from all local authorities that the matter referred to by the Deputy in so far as SDA charges are concerned in this area have been terminated. I should say I shall be pleased to hear of any local authority still not complying.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 45 and Question No. 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that primary responsibility for the implementation of water pollution control legislation rests with local authorities.  Accordingly, I wrote to county and city managers in August last reminding them of the range of legal powers at the disposal of the local authorities and urged that they be utilised fully to prevent pollution occurring, or, in the event of pollution incidents, to initiate prosecutions with a view to securing significant penalties, including payment of costs of court actions and any remedial measures justified.  While final statistics are not yet available in relation to prosecutions taken by local authorities <Col N="810" /> under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, arising from pollution incidents this summer, I am satisfied that authorities have responded positively to my appeal to use their legal powers to the full.  I understand that, to date, this year authorities have taken court action in respect of 19 water pollution incidents and that proceedings have been initiated in the case of a further 98 pollution incidents, compared with a total of 52 prosecutions in 1986.</P>
    <P>During a meeting with city and county managers in early September, I again raised the matter of water pollution with them and, in particular, implementation of the Water Pollution Act.  I invited managers to submit any suggestions for amendments to the Act.  These have been taken into account in a review of the legislation which I had initiated in my Department.  I hope to present legislative proposals to the Government shortly.</P>

      <P>Without going into the details now, the incidents this year would be recognised as comprising approximately 70 per cent of the pollution causing the fish kills during the year, some 120 in total or 66 extra fish kills this year which would have been caused by the agricultural sector.  Certainly some licence holders who have rights to let effluent into receiving waters have been culpable.  Some local authorities, through mismanagement, improper management or maintenance of their existing plant &mdash; plant that has not been properly maintained &mdash; can often be the cause &mdash; have been cautioned in the matter.  The legislative programme about which we are talking will be comprised of two elements: legislation introduced by me and also other legislation promoted by the Minister for the Marine.  Together, one can watch the other sufficiently to bring about a very large improvement in this matter.  Indeed I was pleased yesterday, at the start of the process of education &mdash; which I regard as essential in so far as the control of pollution is concerned &mdash; to note that the farming organisations are taking the matter very seriously.  In discussions I have had with them and in the programme for addressing this problem which we will be announcing shortly they will play a central role also.  I think &mdash; it is always dangerous to say this in advance &mdash; it is a question of education, of engineering and also one of enforcement.  If we get the three elements right, then we should see a very big improvement next year.</P>

      <P>In relation to those incidents of pollution caused by local authorities, can the Minister outline to the House what steps he has taken <i>vis-à-vis</i> those authorities in relation to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken to them and have sent them circulars indicating what I expect them to do in so far as the <Col N="812" /> maintenance of their existing plant is concerned. Only recently we have discovered that the £600 million odd of capital works in providing water and sewage treatment over the last five or six years in effect contribute somewhat to the pollution levels.  We have to consider the matter globally now.  There are three elements &mdash; not just the local authorities and the damage they cause in so far as pollution is concerned &mdash; but there is also the agricultural sector who are now fully aware of their responsibilities.  They are undertaking a major campaign.  Then there are the commercial interests who hold licences.  All things taken together, I think the House will be pleased with the package we propose to deal with the problem under all headings so that there is a collective effort to ensure that this pollution is not repeated at the level that obtained this year.  It is never possible to say we will eliminate pollution entirely. There will always be the odd mistake, whether man-made or otherwise, but we are conscious of our responsibility in this matter and are taking the necessary measures to so ensure by way of legislation and education.  Finally, if we cannot achieve the results we want in that way, then the enforcement measures will be put in place and pressed home to whatever level is necessary.  I promise the Deputy that.</P>

      <P>An in-depth review of local government finances is being carried out by my Department in order to identify appropriate means of reforming the present financing system.  The question of local service charges and other sources of finance for local authorities is being considered in the context of that review, but pending its conclusion and my consideration of the outcome, I have no proposals on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recollect that prior to the last general election his party gave an undertaking to put in place an alternative and viable method of funding of local authorities?  In that context will he explain why now &mdash; in the context of taking approximately £100 million out of the local authority funding <Col N="814" /> area for next year &mdash; no guidance whatsoever has been given to local authorities as to how they should cope with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister well remembers the undertakings given by the Fianna Fáil Party in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also wrong for the Deputy to persist in talking about figures that are not accurate.  The situation is that there is a reduction of 14 per cent in the rates support grant this year.  That grant will be £225 million.  That in effect is less than 3 per cent of the total revenue for local authorities, since the rate support grant represents about 20 per cent of their total.  We are talking about less than 3 per cent of the total available to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The cumulative effect of the reductions will be to take £100 million out of funding for local authorities, both current and capital, next year.  How are local authorities to adopt estimates for next year by 16 November, as the Minister suggested, in the absence of any guidance from him and in the context of an ongoing review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to be cross about the previous Minister's remarks, we believe that we have dealt with this matter in the best way this year by giving advance notice to the local authorities of the reductions in their support well in advance of their estimates meeting. <Col N="815" /> They have the time to consider fully all the implications in consultation with their finance officers and the members of the local authorities can decide the level of services to be provided.  It also gives them the opportunity to get full advantage of their own funding arrangements. This is a little different from the practice followed heretofore.  Deputy Boland left office having made a reduction of 8 per cent in the rate support grant but he had not thought it worthwhile to advise the local authorities about the proposed cut. That is not the practice of this Minister or this Government.  We have taken the initiative and that is the way to have the matter dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly debatable so far as local authority members are concerned as to whether it is preferable to get a long term execution notice.  The Minister might give some guidance even to members of his own party in the local authorities in relation to the Government's proposals on service charges.  The bulk of local authorities, including those controlled by the Minister's party, have been operating service charges in violation of his party's undertaking in the local election campaign two years ago and his Government's undertaking in the general election campaign this year.  Is it the Minister's intention that those councillors should adopt estimates which include service charges for 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was abundantly clear that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983, No. 2 is in place and will continue in place.  It is a reserved function and a matter for local authorities to decide whether to utilise it.  They do not have to do so if they find they have sufficient funds to provide the level of service they regard as adequate for their communities. The whole question of the funding of local authorities is under review. When that is finalised the matter of service charges will be considered in toto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it will be possible to commence any new capital projects in 1988 in (a) roads (b) sanitary services (c) local authority housing and (d) other local authority capital works; and if so, if he will make a statement regarding the total amount available for the purpose, together with an estimate of the employment effect for the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Allocations for loan capital for local authority works programmes are made annually following the receipt of applications for funds from each local authority.  Generally, the applications for each programme cover funds required for completed works, works in progress and new works to be commenced in the year in question.  Local authorities may be requested to submit separate applications for commitments and new works on some programmes.  It is only when the applications for individual work programmes are examined departmentally, early in 1988, and allocations for commitments decided, that the amount of money available for new works will be known.  In the case of road grants, I hope to notify local authorities next month of their 1988 grants as these are required by the authorities for the purposes of adopting their estimates of expenditure.  Experience over the years has shown that some new works for which funds may be provided do not necessarily commence on the projected dates or proceed as rapidly as anticipated and as a result funds originally earmarked for projects that are in progress may become available for the commencement of further projects.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that I <Col N="817" /> am not in a position at this stage to indicate the funds that will be available for new works in 1988.</P>
      <P>The Public Capital Programme published last week gives the capital provisions for each work programme.  In line with the Government's objective of reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement, reductions have been made in most of the expenditure programmes in the environment area.  However, notwithstanding this factor, some reductions would have arisen in any event, having regard to the progress made in meeting the priority needs over the past number of years and of future demographic trends.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that new projects should be started only where there is a genuine need and not just for their own sake.  Any reduction in employment which may follow the reduced allocations for public expenditure programmes should be off-set by employment created by increased private investment arising from the Government's success in reducing interest and mortgage rates.  In particular, employment of over 1,500 is expected in the development of the Custom House Docks site due to commence early next year, if not before the end of this year.  Significant employment will also be generated in urban areas already designated and other areas to be announced shortly.  As stated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government's fiscal and monetary policies should encourage extra private investment, through the creation of a climate which will stimulate investment, increase confidence and generate economic activity.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wonder if the Minister intends to speak on the Fifth Stage.  I raised a number of questions last day but I did not put down amendments on Report Stage though I was seeking information.  I got a fairly full brief from an official in the Department of Finance and I would like the Minister to deal with the effect of this legislation and the amount of money he intends writing off under the powers conferred by section 1.  As I understand it, the Minister intends using the powers under this Bill which will be effective from 1 May 1988.  I understand that is a gale day in the Office of Public Works, that on that day the Minister will write off capital and interest owed by local authorities to central Government <Col N="853" /> amounting to £2.7 billion.  Because of the double counting of certain portions of the local loans fund in the computation of the national debt, this will effectively reduce the nominal debt by £1.6 billion.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this information is correct and that he intends to proceed as described from 1 May 1988.</P>
      <P>This legislation has obvious implications. As I said, I think it is a good idea to introduce this Bill and I am not opposing its passing.  If there is double counting, and there obviously is, there is no reason why we should make the national debt appear larger than it actually is.  We owe enough without exaggerating it.  I would like the Minister to confirm the size of the write off and the effect this will have on the national debt. Does he intend at any future date, either before or subsequent to 1 May 1988, to write off more than the £2.7 billion mentioned? Does he have any intention of introducing other legislation to eliminate further double counting in the national debt?  This eliminates circular transfers. There are some savings on the administrative side in both local authorities and central Government.  This Bill is to be welcomed because it will reduce the national debt nominally.</P>

    <P>When we pick up our newspapers next May, I would not like to be informed by a Government spokesman that the debt is coming under control.  I presume the Minister will be running a deficit of around £1.6 billion next year.  If he is able to get a write off of £1.6 billion from the national debt from 1 May it will appear that the deficit has disappeared into thin air and that in 1988 we can borrow that much without increasing the national debt.  As I said outside this House when the Minister does something like this he should put all his cards on the table. There is nothing in the explanatory memorandum or in the Minister's Second Stage speech to indicate that this Bill will have any consequences for the national debt.  When we are talking about very large sums of money &mdash; and billions of pounds is a very large sum &mdash; the cards should be face up on the table and we <Col N="854" /> should know not only the intent of the Bill but its consequences.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell the House that this is a great idea because we are eliminating the double counting and making the nominal debt look lower, and I agree with that, but why did he not tell us this when he introduced the Bill?  Why did we have to drag it out of him in the House? This legislation will have more than a nominal effect.</P>
    <P>The new economic totem is not the size of the national debt or its pecentage expressed in terms of GNP; the new economic totem is to bring the debt GNP ratio into equilibrium.  If the nominal debt is reduced, we will be able to show equilibrium at a higher level of borrowing from 1 May next than we are able to do today or even next month.  Therefore this does have a real economic effect.  I want to make sure we are comparing like with like when we look at the figures next year &mdash; the level of debt and the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to clarify these matters and not to be tempted to do things in a surreptitious way but to inform the House fully, not alone of the intent of any legislation he introduces, but also of the consequences.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for facilitating me by giving me access to one of his officials who briefed me very fully once this matter was raised &mdash; I want to give the Minister credit for that &mdash; but the issue should not have arisen.  If the Minister had explained that there was double counting and that the major consequence of the Bill was to eliminate that double counting and if he had dealt in particular with the debt-GNP ratio, which is a real economic consequence, I would have been satisfied and we would not be discussing this Bill today because it would have been nodded through the last day.</P>

      <P>Earlier I indicated that I had no objection to the Bill passing all Stages and my attitude has not changed. I do not accept entirely what Deputy Noonan has said, that this had to be <Col N="855" /> extracted from or dragged out of the Minister. In my view he was forthcoming on the consequences for national accounting. I do not think the Bill was introduced as a measure to change the system of national accounting but to obviate unnecessary bureaucracy and the paperwork that went with it.  I must reflect ruefully on the fact that having issued a statement to that effect pointing out that it did not have a significant effect from the point of view of national accounts and that it would be simplistic to interpret it as having that effect, Deputy Noonan manged to get more publicity by characterising this as a potential piece of stroke politics.  It may be that the media are more alive to an allegation of that kind.</P>

In my view the measure should go through unchallenged.</P>

      <P>Some Members, particularly those from Dublin and the big centres of population, are not familiar with the financial arrangements for small local authorities.  I am interested in such authorities but I am sure that Deputy McDowell does not know anything about them.  I am satisfied that the special subvention for small local authorities will continue but I should like to ask a question in regard to the financing of sanitary services.  I understand that the subsidy for sanitary services for Dublin was 40 per cent, for county councils it was 50 per cent and for urban councils with valuations under £25,000 it was 60 per cent. <Col N="856" /> The valuations for many urban councils has been increased well in excess of £25,000 with the result that the subsidy has reduced.  The subsidies were introduced in the mid-sixties but the valuations of most urban authorities have increased since then because of the building boom in business premises and private houses.  As a consequence, many urban authorities have gone to a valuation figure in excess of £25,000 and their subsidy has been reduced from 60 per cent to 50 per cent.  Smaller urban councils are being victimised and I appeal to the Minister to eliminate that anomaly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherlock may not have been present when I replied to the debate on the last day because I pointed out that local authorities will not be any worse off or better off as a result of this legislation, irrespective of whether the subsidy was 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent.  I should like to thank Deputy McDowell for his recollection of what happened on the last day.  I was wondering over the weekend who was getting involved in stroke politics.  I was amazed because I thought we were more than helpful in responding to the queries about why the legislation was introduced.  If this is to be labelled as stroke politics, it may be that Deputy Noonan and his colleagues were responsible for the strokes because the measure was approved in his time in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were strokes it was the Deputy, or one of his former colleagues, who is responsible for them. What we are doing is stopping the non-sensical circular transfers that are costing hundreds of thousands of pounds in administrative expenses.  That will be eliminated from now on.  I told Members last week, particularly Deputy Dempsey, that the suggestions put forward during the debate will be pursued by my Department and the other relevant Departments. If we are to achieve savings of <Col N="857" /> hundreds of thousands of pounds, as we will in this case, we will take the action necessary to bring them about.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why Deputy Noonan adopted a different attitude outside the House.  The Finance accounts are published annually and they make the position abundantly clear.  The figures and statistics compiled by the Central Bank and the OECD have taken into account the issue of double accounting and have been doing so for years.  There is no question of anybody trying to hide what is being done now.  Such a system was in operation many years before Deputy Noonan or I were appointed Ministers.</P>

At Deputy's Noonan's request I made officials available to him to give him all the details.  They spent some time on the phone with him answering his queries but, arising out of that, he ran off looking for a cheap headline.  The Deputy is entitled to do that but he should be factual and honest when making statements outside the House.

That amount had not been reached and is not relevant to the amount of the write off as it includes funds advanced for mortgages which will not be affected by the present proposals. The amount involved on mortgages is about £700 million.  There will be a write off of £2.7 billion as confirmed, leaving a reduction in the debt of £1.6 billion.

      <P>The publication of the Estimates this year in early October is a further illustration of this Government's determination to take decisive action to tackle the problems facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody at this stage should be in any doubt that the country is in a very serious economic situation, and strong and decisive leadership is required to redress this. Our enormous debt problem will put major constraints on us for a number of years ahead and must be solved if we are to have any prospect of sustained recovery and growth in the future.  The cost of servicing the national debt is almost £2 billion a year which is roughly equal to the entire revenue from PAYE in a year and substantially more than the total cost of social welfare services to the taxpayer.  There is no way we can <Col N="864" /> continue to divert such a huge proportion of Government revenue to servicing a debt of this size.  At the same time there is no easy way out of the problem and there are no instant solutions.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Government's strategy has been accepted by most economic commentators and by the major political parties.  The framework outlined in the Estimates shows that the Government are committed to action to put the economy back on the road to recovery. The programme agreed with the national partners embraces a wide range of issues including pay, tax reform, employment and the social services.  It represents a milestone on the road to national recovery. At the same time the Government have examined in detail every facet of public expenditure.  Never before has such a detailed examination been undertaken. Never before has it been done with such determination and vigour. More importantly, never before has it been done by a Government who were prepared to take action, but this is a caring Government.  It would have been easy for us to decide to wield the axe indiscriminately.  That would have avoided the need for close examination and scrutiny.  It would have avoided delving into and understanding the wide variety of services the State provides and why it provides them.  Over the last few months we have carried out a careful, systematic review of expenditure and have taken firm decisions backed up by positive action.  The caring approach of this Government can clearly be seen in my own area of social welfare.  I would like to turn now to issues of importance in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>There will be a number of very major developments in the social welfare system during the period immediately ahead.  Perhaps the most significant change will be the extension of social insurance cover to self-employed persons, including farmers.  This is something which everybody accepts as necessary.  It has been talked about for years but now it is being done.  The inclusion of the self-employed in the social insurance system will bring about <Col N="865" /> a much greater degree of equity in the way the system is financed.  It will also reduce the burden on the Exchequer of financing non-contributory pensions which will be phased out with the extension of social insurance coverage to all of the working population.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board at my request are at present considering the most appropriate scheme of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will be reporting to me shortly.  I do not want to pre-empt in any way what the board may say to me.  Clearly the amount which we can pay out by way of pensions to the self-employed will depend on the amount which can be raised in contributions.  My concern will be to achieve a system in which all self-employed people contribute towards the cost of social insurance in an equitable way based on their real ability to pay. I will be bringing my proposals to the Government in this matter before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Another major development which is being planned is the transfer of responsibility for short-term sickness payments to employers.  This will reduce the duplication which exists at present where employees who are out sick are entitled to sick pay from their employers as well as disability benefit from the Department of Social Welfare.  It will also enable the payments concerned to be taxed in the same way as other income and, by giving direct responsibility to employers, provide the scope for more effective control on absenteeism.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House of a development that will be of particular concern to social welfare recipients in the next few weeks.  As Deputies will remember, last November saw the full implementation of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  One effect of this was that certain families were adversely affected.  The whole concept of dependency in the social welfare code was changed.  As a result a woman could be regarded as dependent on her husband only if she was not in receipt of a social welfare payment, or was earning <Col N="866" /> less than £50 per week from employment. People who were previously regarded as dependants were no longer so regarded and adult dependant increases were no longer payable for them.  Similarly increases for children could only be paid at half rate if a person's spouse was in employment or on social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>Because of the hardship that was caused, alleviating payments were made in these circumstances.  It was the intention of the previous Government that these payments would be for &ldquo;a maximum period of one year&rdquo; and would cease on 17 November this year. However, the Government are conscious of the hardship that would be caused to these families by ceasing the payments abruptly and have decided that these alleviating payments will continue beyond the middle of November next.  I am seeking the best approach to phasing out these payments and the Government will be considering my proposals on this matter in the light of the financial situation. Meanwhile the alleviating payments will continue at their present rates until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Returning now to the actual Estimates for 1988, they contain a provision amounting to £1.61 billion in respect of social welfare, but this is not the complete picture.  It does not reflect the full extent of the moneys distributed through the various social welfare schemes and services that have been built up over the years.  Social welfare expenditure in 1988 will amount to over £2.64 billion when account is taken of the income collected by way of PRSI contributions from employers and employees.  Expenditure on services for the elderly now stands at an estimated £752 million or 30 per cent of overall social welfare expenditure in 1988.  Expenditure on unemployment services will be an estimated £704 million or 28 per cent of overall expenditure in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Estimate represents a net increase of £12.7 million on the 1987 Estimate. This does not include any provision for increases in the rates of social welfare payments or any other improvements which the Government may decide to <Col N="867" /> introduce next year.  In a situation of restricted resources and economic difficulty, the task of developing the social welfare system is particulary formidable. However, the Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and will consider special increases for those receiving the lowest payments within the constraints of available resources.</P>
    <P>The Estimates embody a number of changes which will help rationalise aspects of the social welfare system and tighten controls to prevent abuse.  The social welfare system exists to help people who are in need.  Our systems must be effective in meeting those needs. Any leakages out of the system through inefficiencies or abuse lessen the amounts that are available for distribution to those in need.  Some of the measures that I will be taking are designed to ensure that the resources at my disposal are more effectively targeted to those genuinely in need.  The important thing is, however, that the basic fabric of the social welfare system has been maintained, every scheme has been protected and some have been extended.  Overall the Government have ensured that the burden of meeting our problems will not be laid on those who are dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The Estimates take account of the changes in schemes that have been announced in the past few weeks.  The free fuel schemes have been rationalised and extended and 210,000 people now qualify for a free fuel allowance.  This includes 30,000 recipients of unemployment assistance whom we have brought into the scheme for the first time. The estimated cost of the scheme in 1988 is £28.2 million.</P>
    <P>Another development for which provision has been made in the Estimates and which can only be regarded as an historic achievement for the Government has been the extension of the treatment benefits scheme to dependent spouses of insured workers.  From Monday this week the dependent spouses of insured workers are entitled to claim dental and <Col N="868" /> optical benefits under the social welfare treatment benefits scheme on the same basis as insured persons.  This extension of the scheme will benefit up to 330,000 people, mainly women working in the home.  Over the last number of years there have been many calls for this vital service for women who work in the home. Many promises have been made over the years about this much needed service. We have delivered on our commitment and dependent spouses are now entitled to these benefits.  From the reaction I have been getting it is clear that there is widespread support for this extension.</P>
    <P>The opticians who provide optical services for insured workers have readily agreed to the extension and I must place on record my appreciation for their support. I wish also to place on record my appreciation of the dentists throughout the country who have agreed to treat dependent spouses despite the fact that there has been a campaign waged by the Irish Dental Association over the last few months to prevent them from doing so. This campaign is based on the mistaken belief that this extension is not good value for money because the Dental Association claim that it helps the better off. This is just not true.</P>
    <P>The facts of the matter are that this is an insurance-based scheme, financed out of PRSI contributions.  It should not be confused with means tested schemes operated by the health boards, funded entirely by the Exchequer.  Entitlements are built up over a number of years by the payment of contributions.  It is also a fact that while the scheme is not means tested it is largely availed of by those in the lower income groups.  Ninety per cent of those who benefited from the scheme last year had incomes below the average industrial wage.  Many of the new beneficiaries will be dependent spouses of unemployed persons, old age pensioners and those out of work through illness.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to continue the successful Jobsearch programme which has been operating on a nation-wide basis since April last.  It is <Col N="869" /> designed to assist the long-term unemployed in their search for work by providing advice and, in many cases, placement in a Manpower scheme, AnCO training scheme or Jobsearch course.  Already, over 102,000 people have been interviewed, as part of the programme.  So far almost 3,000 persons have got jobs; some 20,000 have been placed in Manpower schemes such as the social employment scheme or AnCO courses.  Another 8,000 persons have left the register when offered the chance of a job or a place on a training course.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, a substantial amount has been provided in the 1988 Estimates for the continuation of the pilot schemes for the unemployed which my Department have been operating for the past year, namely, the part-time job allowance and the educational opportunities schemes.  In the face of the overwhelming problems that social welfare dependents are faced with today, particularly those who are unemployed, a positive and dynamic response is essential. What I am trying to ensure is that our social welfare system is more flexible and responsive to people's needs.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme gives unemployed people over age 25 the opportunity to go back to school to complete a certificate type course.  There have been many calls over the years for this type of &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; for older unemployed people, many of whom had to leave school early for various reasons. I am delighted with the success of the programme so far, since 9 or 18 per cent of the original participants are now in full-time jobs and another two are exploring the possibility of starting their own business.  Another two participants are now self-employed on a part-time basis and hoping to build this into full-time employment.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that all these jobs can be attributed to the confidence and discipline which participation in the course gave.</P>
    <P>This quote, from a participant in the Limerick class, sums up the personal benefits he has gained from the course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> I no longer feel unemployed.  My confidence is being restored and my self-esteem has risen.  I have become more relaxed and I have a much more positive outlook on life.  I can keep pace with my children's education and help them when I can.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that a scheme on these lines is worthwhile and I am glad that we have been able to set aside the necessary resources to plan the continuation of this scheme next year.  I hope to be announcing details of this in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another scheme that I am particularly interested in is the part time job allowance scheme which allows unemployed persons to work up to 24 hours a week and still retain a basic income maintenance payment from my Department. This scheme operates in 17 different centres throughout the country.  The Government have provided for the expansion of this scheme in 1988 and I expect to be announcing details in the near future.</P>
    <P>The question of the abuse of social welfare schemes has been the subject of extensive media coverage in recent times. I am aware that there are areas of the social welfare system which are vulnerable to the risk of fraud.  This is inevitable considering the enormous scale of the social welfare system.  About £7 million is paid out every day.</P>
    <P>We all accept that the vast majority of those claiming benefit are entitled to their payments and it is my responsibility to see that these legitimate claimants are provided with a speedy, accessible service, while at the same time ensuring that the service is not easily abused.  This year special measures were directed towards suspect claims so that we could get best use out of our resources.  The following are some examples of our successes in detecting abuse in the first half of the year: of 4,600 claimants called for special control interviews to review their entitlement to unemployment payments, 1,100 left the register, 600 of them voluntarily. Of 3,500 unemployment claims investigated by our special investigation unit following allegations by members of the <Col N="871" /> public of working and drawing the dole, 1,062 were disallowed.  Of 9,000 inquiries sent out to employers to check if the claimant was working or on holiday leave while claiming disability benefit, 700 cases of possible abuse were revealed.  Of 60,000 disability benefit claimants referred to a medical referee 14,000 had their claims ended because they were found capable of work (12,000) or voluntarily ceased to claim.  As a result of PRSI surveys of employers, arrears of £2.3 million have been reported to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Due to the success of these measures the Government have decided to pursue an intensive campaign against fraud and abuse.  I am taking a number of initiatives which will bring a new focus of attention on employers, and I will be seeking specific sanctions against employers who collude in social welfare abuse.</P>
    <P>I will be focusing special attention on industries which we have found to be prone to social welfare fraud and abuse. These will include the security and building industries.  I will also be insisting that where State and semi-State bodies or local authorities use commercial firms, they ensure that the employees of those firms are all registered and paid up for social welfare.  I want to ensure that operatives on the ground are also in the books for PRSI.</P>
    <P>My Department have power to instittute court proceedings against employers who fail to co-operate with or who obstruct social welfare officers in carrying out their investigations.  I will be exercising these powers to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>Where other forms of abuse of social welfare schemes by employers are detected, such as collusion with employees in the fraudulent receipt of sickness and unemployment payments, my Department also have power to institute court proceedings against employers.  I am determined that these powers will be vigorously used.</P>
    <P>There are often technical difficulties in proving that the employers actions, or in many cases omissions, contributed to the <Col N="872" /> frauds.  I am arranging that these loopholes will be examined so that they can be closed off and that employers who are not operating the full PRSI system will not escape the consequences.</P>
    <P>A number of changes to individual schemes are being made to help achieve better targeting of resources.  In adopting these measures, the Government are conscious of the need to ensure that existing claimants are not adversely affected and, consequently any changes will only apply to new claimants from specified dates.</P>
    <P>In the disability benefit area, two changes are being made, which are aimed at lessening potential abuse.  First, claimants of disability benefit who have been in receipt of maternity allowance will be required to wait three days before entitlement to disability benefit commences.  This is already the case in relation to people who have been in employment.  Secondly, the number of paid contributions required for continued entitlement to disability benefit after 12 months will be increased from 208 to 260, with effect from January, 1988.  This measure is designed to ensure that only those who have five years paid contributions will be entitled to long-term disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In April, 1981, I introduced a new maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.  The old general maternity allowance scheme was continued for those who did not qualify immediately under the new scheme.  Two changes are now being made to the old scheme.  From January 1988 entitlement under the old general scheme will be restricted to those women who have at least 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year.  This measure is designed to ensure that only women who have a recent attachment to the labour force will qualify for this benefit in future. Women in employment will still be entitled to the allowance on the same basis as heretofore.  Pay-related benefit, which is paid as a supplement to maternity allowance is being discontinued under the old scheme as and from April, 1988.  Women in employment will not be affected by this measure. <Col N="873" /> Measures are also being taken to rationalise certain features of the social welfare system and to bring aspects of the system up to date.  One area which is in particular need of rationalisation is that of means testing for social assistance schemes.  I would expect proposals in this area to be ready early in 1988.</P>
    <P>I am also taking a number of measures in the area of supplementary welfare allowances to rationalise and update the present arrangements.  I have already taken steps to rationalise the footwear scheme which operates under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I am also examining the area of payments towards rent and mortgage under the scheme.  At present people applying for rent supplements are required as a minimum to meet the first £1.50 of rent payments. This limit has applied since 1977 and clearly needs to be updated.  The Government have decided therefore that the limit should now be raised to £3. This increase is considerably less than the increase in the CPI over the period since 1977.  Furthermore the increase will only apply to new claimants for rent supplement and existing recipients will not be affected.  The necessary regulations to give effect to the increase will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Another area where a review is being undertaken is the area of credited contributions under the social insurance system.  Credits are awarded at present in a very wide variety of circumstances and can be a significant factor in determining entitlement to benefit.  On the other hand the number of paid contributions required to qualify for payments can be quite low.  The review which is being carried out will examine the whole relationship between paid and credited contributions under the social insurance system to remove anomalies and achieve a degree of rationalisation in this area.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at areas of the system where there is duplication in entitlements. Apart from special circumstances it has always been a generally accepted principle that a person should not be entitled to receive more than one benefit <Col N="874" /> or pension at the same time.  There are at present a number of areas where overlaps of this kind can occur and these are being examined to see where changes should be made.  Already the Government have decided that the present practice whereby a working widow who is not liable to pay PRSI, can receive in addition to her widow's pension, disability benefit at half rate if she goes out sick, should be discontinued.  A similar overlap can occur as between widow's pension and unemployment benefit but unemployment benefit is of limited duration and the same considerations do not apply in that case. Accordingly, the payment of half rate unemployment benefit with widow's pension will continue.  The ending of the overlap between widow's pension and disability benefit and of any other overlaps which may be identified, will only affect new claimants and existing claimants will not be affected.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have a wide variety of schemes catering for a wide variety of needs if they are not delivered to the client quickly, efficiently and with due regard to his or her dignity and rights.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that we are well on the way to developing a whole system, particularly the strategy of localisation. A key element of that strategy is the facility which I have called the one stop shop.  The object is to provide a comprehensive service to social welfare clients by bringing together the personnel and agencies involved to meet all the needs of the client quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner at the one location.</P>
    <P>In addition I have recently introduced a nation-wide scheme for the payment of unemployment assistance without an immediate means test to certain categories of claimants.  This frees the community welfare officer and the social welfare officer for those cases that need investigation.</P>
    <P>Central to all of these developments is the continuing development of technology within my Department.  We are developing and extending our computer network to meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>The only major area of work not serviced <Col N="875" /> by computer is the unemployment benefit and assistance payments system in the employment exchanges.  The extension of computerisation to employment exchanges is a major task and one to which I will be devoting considerable resources in the future.</P>
    <P>Another recent development which I would like to mention and which broke new ground for localised services was the introduction in the Cork Employment Exchange of a remote entry facility for medical certificates.  As a result disability benefit claimants in the Cork area can have their medical certificates keyed into the computer system without the need to send them to headquarters.  This, of course, greatly increases efficiency locally and cuts out delays and queries.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of policy in the social welfare area will be to make the system more effective and more efficient.  My approach and that of the Government in the context of the Estimates campaign has been to ensure that the less well off are protected, to direct resources where they are most needed, to spread the burden of financing the system in the fairest way possible, to make the schemes more flexible in addressing the needs of clients, to improve efficiency in the delivery of services, to reduce the scope for abusing the schemes and to pursue those responsible for abusing them.  I believe that the measures which have been taken represent a significant step towards a social welfare system which is in tune with the needs of our society today.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to make it very clear that in providing £1.46 billion in these Estimates and a total of £2.64 billion when the income from PRSI is taken into consideration, the Government are maintaining all of our schemes and all of our systems.  Indeed we are extending some of our schemes and at a time when in other countries these schemes are often contracting and being reduced.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, I believe that these Estimates and the package that has been prepared by the Government truly reflect a caring <Col N="876" /> approach on the part of the Government, an approach whereby the real positions and incomes of those on social welfare are being protected at this particularly difficult time.</P>
    <P>In the course of the pre-budget discussions and eventually in the budget it will be our objective to target our resources in favour of those who are in greatest need within the full social welfare system.  I am sure Deputies will recognise the need to do that.  I hope that when we have considered the various possibilities in that direction they will be happy with the direction we are taking in strengthening particularly those people at the lowest level in our system.</P>
    <P>We have a great challenge at this time because we do not have readily available the additional resources we might like to have.  It is very easy to say we should have this extra scheme or that extra scheme, but it is quite an achievement just to maintain our schemes and to maintain the support which the elderly and unemployed have had in recent years and which in the plan for national recovery is guaranteed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We have some major undertakings. We are bringing in the PRSI system for the self-employed which is a major undertaking involving much time and work as does the transfer of disability benefit.  The Department is one that has a particularly high standard among its civil servants.  I would like to give due credit to them at this time in connection with these Estimates.  Their efficiency has been quite breathtaking.  Their standard is of the very highest level for the public service or any other service.  I am very glad that the beneficiaries of social welfare have serving them civil servants who are so dedicated, so competent and capable, so effective and efficient.</P>
    <P>We all have a great deal more to do.  I believe that once we have managed to computerise the employment exchanges, a task which we have already begun in Dublin, we will become considerably more efficient.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House the steps which have been taken by the Government. In noting the Estimates in total I <Col N="877" /> would ask the House to note particularly how strongly and how carefully those in greatest need have been protected by the Government at this difficult time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, first, should be congratulated on getting the Estimates out in such good time.  The public servants who worked so hard during the summer should be congratulated on the work they have done in this regard.  That is the last word of congratulations that this Estimate will get from The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>These Estimates were a tremendous shock to everybody, even those who were expecting very severe cuts.  They are an attack on the living standards of workers and of the unemployed, an attack on the standards of education and health of the very people who have paid their taxes for these services.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment seems to enjoy implementing enormous cuts because he comes in beaming with new cuts every day and serves them up to his master.  There was a magnificient £92 million cut in the Department of the Environment which indicates a determination to privatise practically all the local authority services, with a consequent rundown of standards and increases in costs to the public.  Perhaps the greatest indictment of the Estimates is the cut of £300,000 or 23 per cent in the miserable allocation to the antipoverty programmes at a time of rapidly growing poverty.</P>
      <P>The main argument used to justify this latest attack on the living standards of workers and the unemployed is the need to create the right environment for business investment.  Put bluntly, this means telling the capitalists that they can make bigger profits and pay less taxes.  Trying to coax the rich to put their money to work is a waste of time.  They prefer to put their money into bank accounts in the Isle of Man and their investments are confined to the crude manifestations of wealth and affluence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our capitalists have got hundreds of millions of pounds in grants and subsidies over the last couple of decades, and what <Col N="878" /> have we to show for it?  We are the only industrial country in the world with hardly any domestically owned international trading companies.  They grabbed the money and lined their pockets during the good times &mdash; but when the going got tough, the rich got going.</P>
    <P>The savage cuts announced last week expose the bankruptcy of Irish capitalism and of the parties that represent it &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  The current crisis in the public finances reflects the failure of the Irish private sector to industrialise this economy, to create wealth and to keep the economy going.  We have seen it all before.</P>
    <P>In the last five years of the fifties nearly half a million men and women left Ireland convinced that it was doomed and unwilling to suffer any further torments that the Irish capitalists and their political mouthpieces might devise for those who remained behind.  The fifties were also years of savage cuts in public expenditure with the poor bearing the brunt of the savagery.</P>
    <P>It took the initiative of a few civil servants to stop the rot.  By opening up the economy to international capital they threw a lifeline to Irish capitalism and saved the necks of that crop of conservative politicians in those days.  American capital, swollen by wartime expansion and hungry for fresh outlets ran right through this open door.  As Irish workers organised to win better wages and conditions, many foreign companies opted for softer targets in the sweatshops of South Korea and Taiwan, exposing once again the failure of our Irish capitalists to industrialise the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>No cost was spared as Government after Government tried to &ldquo;grow&rdquo; their own native industrialists.  Our baby capitalists were housed in expensively furnished State nurseries, kept warm with taxpayers' money, nourished on a generous diet of hand-outs and protected by a very close relationship with both parents, the Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments.  But as soon as they took their first steps into the harsh world of <Col N="879" /> competitive capitalism they fell into the arms of the liquidator or they took the first plane to Switzerland or the Bahamas with their workers' PRSI contributions in their brief cases.  They left behind them a trail of debt and misery unpaid taxes and the longest dole queues in Europe. This was Irish private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Blame for the present crisis in the public finances must be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of those who, despite costly pampering and support, failed to deliver the goods.  Let us make no mistake about it.  If the goods had been delivered in terms of gross national product and jobs there would be no financial crisis.  The high ratio of debt to gross national product is caused by the low levels of growth in gross national product and by the high levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our gross domestic product is only 64 per cent of the European average.  We will not get the growth required by relying on a plethora of small Irish companies or on the half dozen big Irish companies who invest their profits abroad.  Neither can we cut our way out of the crisis.  That approach failed in the fifties and it has failed everywhere every time it has been tried.  The Workers' Party have no objection to cutting grants for farmers to build beef and butter mountains.  We cannot afford it and the workers of Europe cannot afford it but we do object to dismantling the scientific services that could put agriculture on the road to creating thousands of jobs in the food processing industry.  We would not object if the hand-outs to private companies were abolished thus saving a billion pounds but gutting the agencies involved in job creation is irresponsible and shortsighted.</P>
    <P>The sweeping cuts in education, health and local services are savage in their extent and criminal in their intent.  It is a political crime to make those who can least afford it bear the brunt of the price that must be paid for bad government by Fianna Fáil and the Coalition over the past couple of decades.  It is particularly vicious because, once again, those who <Col N="880" /> can afford it, those who have done well out of the so-called recession, are getting off scot-free.</P>
    <P>For workers and their families, for the unemployed, for the poor and the sick to have to suffer for the crimes of the whiz kids must make some members on the Fianna Fáil benches cringe in their seats. They know there is a better way but they will not grasp the nettle.  They have not got the guts to tell the stockbrokers, the cheap labour bosses, the Stock Exchange playboys and the fly-by-night entrepreneurs, the tax dodgers, the beef and butter barons, the bankers, the nominee account holders and the yuppie economists that they will not do their bidding, that they will not toe the line of financial rectitude, when it means that those who have to tighten their belts are those with nothing.</P>
    <P>They are stupidly competing with the yuppies' own parties, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael, for the allegiance of the fat cat 10 per cent of the population who are used to dictating the economic policies of the State.  They are heeding their well-heeled articulate clamour for savage measures that will protect their class, and they are ignoring the silent suffering of those who believed their promises last February.  They are living dangerously when they listen to those who put their cheques in their election bank account and ignore those who put their votes in the ballot box.  It is not the job of The Workers' Party to remind them of the populist roots of their founders, but it is our job to make sure they pay the price for turning their backs on those who put their trust in their pledges not to hurt the old, the weak and the sick. They should not confuse the chorus of approval from the IFA, the CII, and the FUE with the mandate they got to stop the worst excesses of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition they replaced.</P>
    <P>Pandering to the monetarists may guarantee them a majority in this House, but it will not spare them the wrath of the people they deceived when, sooner or later, they will have to face the music. With the support of Fine Gael and the PDs they can halve the number of nappies <Col N="881" /> for incontinent victims of spina bifida; they can squeeze another half a dozen children into overcrowded classrooms and they can double the length of working class queues for life and death operations, but can they look the people who voted for them straight in the eye and tell them that they did not lie through their teeth? The politics of the stroke have served them well in the past, but it is a long road that has no bend.  Opposing monetarism at an election and inflicting it on the people within six months is one stroke too many.</P>
    <P>Instead of cutting a way out of the crisis, the country must be allowed to produce its way to prosperity.  A production plan as envisaged by The Workers' Party and on the scale required to do the job involves bold and courageous decisions.  It is based on the kind of vision that built four sugar factories in Carlow, Mallow, Thurles and Tuam and put them into production within a year of the decision to let a State company do the job where private enterprise had failed.  Private enterprise has failed the Irish people now and only those blinded by an unshakeable faith in capitalist dogma cannot see the writing on the wall. The Workers' Party are not advocating the nationalisation of private industry because there is little there worth nationalising, that is, apart from the banks, of course.  That is why the shareowning class want to get their hands on State companies like Irish Life which took in over £500 million in 1986.  They want the ESB, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and Irish Life on the Stock Exchange so they can make a quick killing and then stand idly by while £500 million perhaps is wiped off their value overnight.  They do not care that the result of their greedy profit hunting and gambling with the people's wealth leads to their victims standing shivering at the end of the dole queue.</P>
    <P>We are not advocating that more money be spent trying to lure private investment into productive enterprise, wealth generation and job creation.  To put any more trust in a system under which the other day £33,000 million could be wiped <Col N="882" /> off the value of companies on the Stock Exchange, including newly privatised State companies within a few minutes of opening, is just unforgiveable.  Present and future generations will not forgive those who do it.  It runs in the teeth of all the evidence and is in direct conflict with our experience to date.  We do not believe in pouring good money after bad.  Pragmatism rather than ideology demands that we change direction.  The Workers' Party have been arguing for this change of policy for the past 15 years.  We find the Labour Party's preoccupation with welfare economics well intentioned but totally inadequate to the task that confronts us.  It is not sufficient to talk about redistribution of wealth.  Socialists must address the fundamental question of how best to create wealth.  Production is our priority.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, when the Fianna Fáil Government which then included PD super-monetarists like Deputies O'Malley, Molloy and O'Donoghue, went on their &ldquo;borrowing for spending' spree, we warned about the havoc that would result from throwing more money at the private sector in the vain hope that jobs would be created and the economy developed. Our warnings fell on deaf ears and the capitalists had a ball.  Since then the chickens have come home to roost and the monetarists in Fianna Fáil and the super-monetarists in Fine Gael and the PDs agree that services to the public, that is, essential services, must be savaged in order to rectify their collective blunders. The only difference now between a monetarist and a super-monetarist is that the supers want a wage freeze as well as the savage cuts.</P>
    <P>Throughout the capitalist world, but especially in the United States and Britain, conservative politicians, New Right economists and the most reactionary elements of the ruling class are making a determined assault on the trade union movement.  This attack, which is aimed at weakening or destroying trade unions, is an essential part of the capitalist strategy for rolling back the reforms achieved by workers through their unions.  Again the argument used to justify <Col N="883" /> this latest offensive against workers' rights is the need to create a better and freer environment for business investment. Put bluntly, this means that the bosses want to increase their profits by weakening the ability of workers to resist exploitation.  While there is nothing new in this approach, it has been given a new lease of life by mass unemployment.  The misery of unemployment for millions of workers is seen as an opportunity for bigger profits for thousands of employers.</P>
    <P>The trade unions therefore are to be congratulated on squeezing some small concessions out of the Government.  Sniping at the ICTU by those who are often described as the political wing of the unions seems to be motivated more by political begrudgery and opportunism than by any proven concern for workers and the unemployed.  I am sure that the unions have no illusions about the ease with which Fianna Fáil could do another U-turn on their commitments, especially on their targets for job creation.  I want to put it on the record that The Workers' Party will not let a day go past without calling on Fianna Fáil to account, in terms of their jobs promises, both inside and outside this House.  We will want to know when the jobs are coming, where they are being created and how they are to be financed.  I would make an earnest appeal to the Labour Party leadership to stop squabbling with the unions and to join us in this campaign to make Fianna Fáil deliver on their promises.</P>
    <P>While we welcome Fianna Fáil's concession to the ICTU to lift the restriction on commercial State companies, something which we have advocated for a long time, we consider this an idle gesture unless the State sector is given the finance necessary to undertake the job of industrialising the country.  Central to The Workers' Party strategy for economic growth is a massive programme of industrialisation initiated and directed by the State with our successful State companies in the driving seat.  We want a key role for the State in developing large indigenous <Col N="884" /> companies capable of trading internationally. We see the Sugar Company and Erin Foods leading an industrial revolution in the food processing sector. The new State forestry company must pioneer a profitable wood and timber industry.  Telecom Éireann, CARA, the IIRS and others must ensure that the technological revolution does not pass us by.  Airmotive, Bord na Móna, the ESB and the engineering division of the Sugar Company must be allowed to put Irish engineering on the world map. Of course, this will cost money but we will not be throwing money at the economy and hoping against hope that the profit hunters will create jobs instead of fat profits for themselves.  We are demanding that the Government use the State companies as a direct instrument of economic policy and industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Much of the money needed can be got from the tax dodgers, the well-heeled whiz kids who move money around like confetti at a Smurfit wedding.  Some people have feathered their nests out of this recession and it is high time a few of their feathers were ruffled.  The money is out there: look at the cars, look at the mansions, look at the gear, look at the life-styles, look at the black hole merchants, look at the ostentatious displays of wealth and privilege by those who demand that the poor and the weak should suffer so that they can live in the style to which they have become accustomed. We all know that there are plenty of people in this country who do not have to think twice about spending twice as much on one might out as an unemployed family have to live on for a week.  The PDs are the only people who have to move into Ballymun for a week to find this out.</P>
    <P>The infant mortality rate among the offspring of unskilled manual workers is three times higher than among those of middle class professional parents according to Dr. Joseph Robbins, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health.  He said that a report due to be published shortly will show that in 1984 the death rate for young babies in the higher professional class was 5.42 per 1,000 births <Col N="885" /> compared with 18.55 per 1,000 births among unskilled workers.  I am quite sure that the death rate per 1,000 births among unemployed people in 1987 is much higher than that.</P>
    <P>Since May of this year as a result of the Taoiseach's cutback policies pre-natal care which was provided by the Coombe Hospital to health clinics in the Dublin West constituency have had to be cut off. This of course will drive up the death rate of babies and mothers in working class areas.  I have not heard a squeak from SPUC, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, about this scandal. They are more concerned with when life begins than with how life is lived.  In this they are similar to the American evangelists and fundamentalists who were referred to by Declan Kiberd in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday which was headed &ldquo;New Deal gives way to Raw Deal&rdquo;.  He quoted the historian Robert McElvaine as saying in relation to the American Government: &ldquo;This Government's concern for life begins at conception and ends at birth&rdquo;.  Our Government's concern does not even go that far.</P>
    <P>Let me say the unspeakable truth in the midst of the present consensus across the three capitalist parties for financial rectitude. I want to challenge the present &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; that there must be no more borrowing.  If it is necessary for industrialisation to borrow money, so be it. Money spent on a serious and disciplined plan for industrialisation, firmly controlled and directed by the State in the interests of the people, is money well spent.  It is ten times better than money lying idle in the banks, while the economy slides deeper and deeper into recession, but this time let the State and not the banks dictate the terms.</P>
    <P>Borrowing money to throw at the private sector in an indiscriminate fashion is a criminal act.  Squeezing the poor to create the right environment for business is a foolish and futile policy which has failed in the past and is bound to fail again.  The increased output and employment that would result from a bold and radical industrialisation plan would <Col N="886" /> quickly sort out the national debt.  If the present policies are to be continued no amount of cutting, however savage, will tackle the underlying cause of the crisis. An industrialisation programme, spearheaded by our State companies, constitutes the first and most important step on the road to prosperity and a secure future for all our people.</P>
    <P>We have no confidence in this Government. Therefore we will be supporting the vote of no confidence in them.  We believe they are in fact confidence tricksters who got to power on working class votes got by false pretences.  I hope the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is not another confidence trick.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments contained in that document we will be monitoring very closely is that of maintaining the present value of social welfare payments.  I did not hear all of the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare so he may have referred to the matter I am about to mention.  In particular we will be monitoring the Government's statement that they intend to maintain the present value of social welfare payments.  We expect that this means a commitment to maintain the present cushion payment of up to £20 per week, in some cases, against the effects of the implementation of the provisions of the equality legislation introduced by the Coalition Government this time last year.  The maintenance of the value of social welfare payments involves the continuation of this cushion payment. Unless the Minister for Social Welfare said so today, as far as we are aware there has not been any commitment so far in this regard but we will know within the next few weeks.  We will be monitoring that matter carefully to ascertain how sincere are the Government in the commitments outlined in their <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The budget will be the next occasion afforded us to ascertain any such clear commitment on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Their elimination of £3.7 million for national youth services in their Estimates, when viewed along with the remarks of the Minister for Foreign <Col N="887" /> Affairs in regard to emigration, constitutes a clear indication of where this Government stand in relation to youth. They have eliminated totally any Exchequer funding for national youth services along with up to 200 full-time personnel involved in youth activities throughout the country.  The Government expect that youth services be maintained out of a lottery.  That is no commitment on the part of any Government. Certainly it does not constitute a commitment to our young people.  Indeed it clearly indicates that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was right when he said that our young people are all leaving this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá na Meastacháin i gcóir mo Roinne &mdash; Turasóireachta agus Iompair &mdash; ar leathnach 52 de Leabhar na Meastachán i gcomhair Seirbhisí Poiblí (Leagan Coimrithe) atá á phlé againn inniu.

      <P>The Estimates for my Department are set out in Vote No. 39 page 52 of this document.  Important though the sectors of tourism and transport are, I feel that discussion of our development plans for them must be seen against the broader canvas of the national economy.  I intend to so structure my contribution today.</P>
      <P>In the case of my Department there are some radical policy changes underlining these Estimates.  This is also true of most other Departments.  To understand why we had to make such radical changes in policy it is useful to look back over the past few years at what has happened in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sought to solve the unemployment problem by massive increases in all components of Government expenditure. This left us, on assuming office, with the gravest crisis in the public finances in the history of this State.  Not only were <Col N="888" /> previous policies irresponsible but they were also grossly ineffective.  As a result we have witnessed over the past five years a doubling of unemployment, little economic growth and a progressive undermining of the productive capacity of our economy.  We could not, and indeed we should not, continue to pursue such policies, which have been an abject failure.</P>
    <P>We have been depicted by some commentators as Yeroshas experimenting with the ship of State.  I can assure this House that there will be no monkey business from this Government.  We have carefully surveyed the panel of policy measures which are available to us to get some momentum back into this economy. We have a fully integrated, consistent and fully articulated set of macro and micro economic policies which will provide economic growth and new jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>I will not comment in detail on our macro economic policies.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have already dealt with these on numerous occasions. The House knows that these policies have been well received and have generated in business, financial communities and the general public, both nationally and internationally, a new confidence in the management of our nation's affairs.</P>
    <P>We have begun to and will continue to restore competitiveness to our economy. Competitiveness is a very important factor in the development of tourism. This is the key to sustainable wealth and employment creation in an economy as open as ours which depends on the revenues from foreign trade to give us the resources to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years industrialists have been consistently seeking a substantial reduction in domestic interest rates.  Our policy initiatives have delivered these.  Even in those fluid times on stock exchanges I hope that will continue to be the case.  The previous uncertainty and lack of confidence about domestic economic policy led to a large increase in speculative flows across the exchanges. However, with the renewal of confidence which our policies have achieved these <Col N="889" /> have now ceased.  We have also succeeded in bringing inflation rates down to levels below those in our competitor countries through our imaginative macro economic policies.</P>
    <P>We have now created an environment of certainty and confidence in which our trading sectors can plan and flourish. Having established such a favourable environment we must take full advantage of it by ensuring that those sectors where we can compete successfully in international markets are developed to achieve their full potential for employment creation and economic growth.  I have responsibility for two such sectors, namely tourism and transport.  I can assure this House that our policies in both areas will make a full contribution to the national drive for employment and wealth creation to which this Government is committed.</P>
    <P>Let me first of all start with the tourism sector.  A major consultancy report prepared by Stokes Kennedy Crowley/Peat Marwick for the Irish Hotels Federation concluded that it was feasible to double the real value of tourism in six to seven years with a consequential increase in employment of 40,000.  This finding has been endorsed by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.  It is also accepted by this Government &mdash; which has adopted a much more modest target increase of 25,000 jobs for the industry over the next five years.</P>
    <P>We shall not achieve this target by sitting back and waiting for things to happen.  We will have to go out and work hard for an increase in our market share of the international tourism market.  The complacency which has built up in many sectors of the industry, including Bord Failte, must be swept away.  New policies have and will continue to be introduced to ensure that we get a full share of the very buoyant world tourism market which as I have told the House several times already, will be the biggest industry in the world by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The problems we face are obvious.  The objectives are clear.  I have spelled them out time and again.  We need - I might reiterate - good quality products, a competitive <Col N="890" /> position which at least matches our market rivals &mdash; and at times excels them &mdash; and more specific marketing, promotion and sales techniques.  The mix of policy measures to achieve these objectives and the weightings given to each, will undoubtedly cause much debate.  This is both welcome and healthy.</P>
    <P>From our viewpoint the solution to our problems does not lie in throwing sums of Government money at the sector, either directly or through Bord Failte.  In line with expenditure cuts elsewhere, Bord Failte's current allocation has been cut under subhead B1 by £4.2 million.  This does not mean a reduction in marketing expenditure.  I have specifically instructed the board to ensure that marketing expenditure is not cut.  Furthermore, I am determined to ensure that marketing is much more effective than in the past.  The deficiencies identified by Price Waterhouse in this area must be quickly remedied.</P>
    <P>A key element in our strategy for generating a substantial increase in tourist numbers is our policy on access transport costs.  The scepticism which many commentators both inside and outside this House expressed concerning the effectiveness of this policy has been disproved by returns to date for 1987.  In the first eight months of this year, there was an increase of 182,000 overseas visitors compared with the corresponding period of 1986.  For the year as a whole Bord Fáilte expect that the increase in total visitor numbers will be well over 300,000 or more than 70 per cent of the revised target I set in our crash programme for tourism in May of this year.  I would like to place on the record of this House that the increase for 1987 will be four to five times what was originally forecast for tourist numbers when we took office.</P>
    <P>More competitive access transport was a key recommendation in the Price Waterhouse report which was published recently.  The report also endorsed the views which I have consistently expressed since I took office on the quality and range of products we need and on how these should be marketed.  We have <Col N="891" /> already taken some initiatives in these areas and I shall announce more in the five year development programme for the tourism industry which I shall publish within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the second major sector for which I have responsibility, namely transport.  The role of the State in the transport sector is twofold. First, it must regulate the sector in a way which will contribute to an improvement in overall national competitiveness and in the drive for job and wealth creation. Secondly, it must ensure that the semi-State bodies operating in the sector give full value for public money.</P>
    <P>In devising a framework for the regulation of the sector our first priority, taking account of the pressures on the public finances, is to ensure the optimal use of existing resources and infrastructure. We are also determined to create an environment in which both public and private sector operators can earn an adequate return on capital invested both as a reward for risk-taking and to finance the continuous increments in investment needed to maintain the competitiveness of the industry.</P>
    <P>The semi-State bodies are the major operators in the transport sector.  Given the limited time at my disposal, I cannot cover the activities of all of them in much detail.  In view of the fact that the major expenditure item in my Vote is for CIE, I feel I should give you full details on the background to the Estimates provision for this very important company or group of companies.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recall that in the course of the debate on the 1987 Estimate for my Department in June last I explained that decisions taken by our predecessors in Government in relation to the State contribution to CIE in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 meant that State indebtedness to CIE at the end of 1987 would be in excess of £45 million. This consisted of about £34 million in relation to arrears of DART interest and about £11 million in relation to CIE's general operations.  I made it clear that the Government were not in a position <Col N="892" /> to make good the shortfall of any part of it in 1987 and I promised to review the situation in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>This review coincided with the preparation of the Department's Estimates for 1988.  In view of the state of the Exchequer's finances, it quickly became clear that there was no possibility of the Exchequer meeting CIE's 1988 total requirements, including the £45 million due in respect of subvention.  In allocating £113.605 million for 1988, the Government treated CIE as generously as was possible in view of the very difficult general economic climate.  That figure represents an improvement of £6.184 million on 1987.  It shows the extent to which CIE are dependent on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The borrowings incurred to finance the deferred subvention have put pressure on the CIE statutory borrowing limits and they are now in urgent need of revision. I have sought Government approval for amending the legislation in relation to the board's borrowings and to the position with regard to the deferred subvention.  I expect to have the Bill before the House early next month.</P>
    <P>The board's 1988 capital allocation, which is non-voted, is £15.3 million.  It is designed to allow the board to continue to invest in rolling stock, buses, signalling and communications, Rosslare Harbour, and items covered by the board's normal capital programme.  The allocation takes account of policy in relation to the overall State sector capital programme and the requirements of CIE to meet relevant transport market needs.</P>
    <P>The 1987 accounts will record the performance of the reorganised CIE with their three new subsidiaries, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, which started trading in February this year.  The recent progress reports on the CIE activities indicate that revenues and expenditures in recent months are not in line with budget.  This does not augur well for the outturn for this year. I know that the chairman, board and management are taking all possible measures to try to improve the situation.  The downturn puts additional pressures on <Col N="893" /> the CIE organisation as a whole to reduce costs and improve productivity.</P>
    <P>Disruptions to services which are not justified antagonise the general public on whom the CIE workforce is completely dependent for its livelihood, whether through revenues earned in respect of CIE services or through contributions made to CIE via taxes.  I asked the House to note already how great those contributions are.  These activities give CIE workers and the whole organisation in general an image which they certainly do not deserve.  The success of CIE depends on CIE employees.  I believe that they are capable of making an ongoing valuable contribution to the national transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>I would now like to draw Members' attention to the fact that there is a provision of £165,000 for traffic management schemes in my Department's Estimate for 1988.  This will enable the reconstituted Dublin Transportation Task Force to continue certain work of the Dublin Transport Authority in the area of traffic management in Dublin.  The task force will assume, on a non-statutory basis, some of the functions of the Authority in this area and the introduction of further bus priority measures.</P>
    <P>The decision to wind up the Dublin Transport Authority was taken as part of the Government's overall strategy to reduce public expenditure and I shall be introducing shortly legislation to provide for the winding up of the Authority by the end of 1987.  The legislation being prepared will provide for the transfer to other statutory bodies, in most cases the Garda, of the traffic management functions, which were vested in the DTA and which are now being transferred to the task force.</P>
    <P>One of the priority functions assigned to the DTA was to make recommendations on the transport infrastructure options for the Dublin area and, in particular, to advise on whether the public transport needs of the areas to the west of the city should be met by rail, road or busway.  The capital cost of providing a city centre underground and electrified lines to Tallaght, Clondalkin <Col N="894" /> and other areas is curently estimated at approximately £460 million, of which the underground could cost approximately £190 million.  The construction of a Dublin transportation centre, mooted for the Temple Bar area, would add substantially to those costs.  Having regard to the present serious state of the public finances, the Government decided that no further consideration should be given to these proposals.  As a consequence, I have instructed the chairman of CIE to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area, involving only bus-based options or diesel services on existing rail lines.  This decision largely obviates the need for the assessment of infrastructure options which the DTA had been asked to carry out.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of access transport, I would now like to give the House an outline of recent developments in this area.  On 22 May last I met the board of the B &amp; I and conveyed to them the Government's extreme concern and dissatisfaction that, notwithstanding equity injections totalling £25 million since February 1986, the company were forecasting losses for 1987 which would be more than double the 1986 loss of £6.8 million.  I told them that this situation was totally unacceptable to the Government and directed them to submit to me as soon as possible a plan of action for implementation in the autumn, aimed at restoring the company to viability.  I also informed the board of the Government's decision to make available to the B &amp; I additional equity from the Exchequer of up to £8 million in the period to end October 1987 to give the company time to formulate the plan of action.  I have at all times stressed in discussions with the board and representatives of the B &amp; I unions, whom I have also met, the need for an agreed plan of action.  Negotiations on the proposed plan have been proceeding over the past few months between B &amp; I and representatives of the company's unions.  I am expecting to receive proposals shortly &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;&mdash; from the board of the B &amp; I.  As I indicated to the House last week, it is my earnest hope that the process <Col N="895" /> I initiated last May will produce proposals for a viable B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that the sale of Irish Continental Line, the former Irish Shipping Limited subsidiary, has now been formally completed.  I was delighted that this important link between Ireland and the Continent has remained in Irish hands.  I understand that the new board of the company plans not only to continue existing services but to also expand operations.  This is a welcome development not only from the access transport and tourism point of view but also because ICL is a significant employer of Irish seagoing personnel.  I wish the company well.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that in May last I announced a new low air fares strategy aimed at increasing tourist numbers.  The campaign towards lower air fares is continuing. Aer Lingus have already anounced reduced fares from the Continent for next year, particularly from France and Germany.  Innovative fares from the United Kingdom have also been arranged and Aer Lingus are planning attractive promotional fares from the United States.  Ryanair are also finalising contracts for next year in respect of charter traffic from the Continent, particularly France and Germany &mdash; two countries which we must target in the special marketing target procedure I have already mentioned &mdash; and the packages they are putting together should also prove attractive.  That market is very important for development for the future because we have been losing ground there.  We cannot afford to be complacent about those markets.  These moves by Aer Lingus and Ryanair should help to increase still further tourist numbers, particularly from the Continent.  As I said, there is no cause for complacency in this area.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present reviewing charter policy, particularly in respect of inbound charters.  The review is almost completed and I hope to announce in the coming weeks innovative measures to help in the promotion of inbound charter operations.  In accordance with pleas I <Col N="896" /> have made on several occasions, every good citizen should encourage tourists to visit this country and every good tour operator and travel agent should share that philosophy as well.  They are licensed by my Department and although for the most part we think of them in terms of bringing people out of the country there is an obligation on them to think in terms of taking people in.</P>
    <P>My efforts in the fares and charters area must be considered against the background of the package of measures on the liberalisation of European air transport which was almost agreed by the European Council of Transport Ministers in June last but which was not adopted because of a dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over the status of Gibraltar Airport.  This package of measures provides for greater flexibility in air fares, increased access opportunities including valuable fifth freedom rights and less rigid rules on capacity sharing.  I regret that in the current issue of <i>El Pais Semanal</i> I read that not much progress has been made in the discussions between Spain and the United Kingdom.  I am still optimistic enough to hope that before the year's end &mdash; possibly at the December meeting of the Council of Ministers &mdash; we will have an agreed package.  The passing of the Single European Act is relevant in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was most disappointed at the setback created by the Gibraltar issue.  It would have helped to eliminate many of the current difficulties which are holding back the development of our tourism and air transport industries.  I am hopeful, however, that the obstacles to progress can be removed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I move that this Estimate be noted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's speech.  As a former Minister for Education I am amazed he could come into this House so calmly. There can seldom, if ever, have been such a collection of rumours, uncertainty and confusion about a set of Estimates as we have seen over this summer concerning the education area.  Even today, <Col N="897" /> with the abridged Book of Estimates before us, there is still confusion and great concern about precisely what they mean.  When I show what is happening, I hope it will alert all Members of this House to the great harm which is threatened to the education system, particularly at primary level, which I hope can be averted even at this late hour.</P>
      <P>One thing, however, that emerges as certain, from the Estimates is the unprecedented attack on our primary schools. We know that the Minister was unable to carry through on any of her promises made in the last four years, that she misled wilfully the education world during her four cynical years in Opposition and that she, and her party, have a deep conservative fear of independent thinking on reform of our education system.  What is new is the element of panic and the U-turn since the Government took office.</P>
      <P>When I spoke in June in the debate on the Estimates I quoted the Minister at length on each of the areas in which she had cut back then.  I will resist the temptation to do so today but I will use one quotation to illustrate my point.  On 8 April, 1987, a few short months ago, the Minister said in the House:</P>
      <P>I propose to give a particular priority to primary education. The primary focus of any education authority or any education department must be on the first level.</P>
      <P>Later on the same day she said, as Minister:</P>
      <P>I am not a woman of empty promises.</P>
      <P>Those quotations are taken from columns 1935 and 1936 of the Official Report of 8 April 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now see a cut on paper of £42 million in the primary sector, the biggest cut in Education, but behind that figure lies a wealth of unanswered questions which I expect the Minister for Education, or the Minister for Finance, to answer in this debate and not later.  I note that there is neither a Minister nor a <Col N="898" /> Government representative present in the Chamber; that is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>It seems that £33 million is gone from primary teachers' pay but since about £30 million of that is accounted for by paying the January salary in this December &mdash; an accident of the calendar &mdash; we are left supposedly contemplating a cut of about £3 million.  However, under the terms of the teachers' special pay awards made in February 1986 by the previous Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil wanted to pay £110 million extra &mdash; an award which we felt was reasonable, teachers are due a pay increase on 1 December 1987, another on 1 July 1988 plus an <i>ex gratia</i> £5 million in January 1988.  Those pay rises must be included in the round figure for pay of £324 million for primary teachers for 1988, a cut on paper of £33 million.  The implications of these figures are that somewhere between £12 million and £20 million at least for primary teachers' pay is being cut in 1988.  The figure could be higher but how exactly is that amount to be found?  That accident of the juxtaposition of a weekend and bank holiday bringing one month's salary into 1987 makes all the figures in the Estimate unreliable in the pay area and shows a smaller figure in 1988 which, of course, will be greatly increased in 1989 when a full years salary will have to be paid.  Will there be more massive cuts in Education to pay for that?  However, at the moment I am more concerned with what the real reduction is for 1988 and what the policy decisions are to find the money.  There should be no delay in those announcements.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the money is to be found by a massive disimprovement in the pupil-teacher ratio, increasing class sizes at primary level right across the board and hitting the larger schools particularly. Schools with more than eight teachers will lose their non-teaching principal who will be required to go back to the classroom leaving the school without guidance, care and direction.  The Department may also be counting on a fall in numbers at primary level from September 1988 and on teachers availing of the redundancy package in order to bludgeon down the number actually <Col N="899" /> teaching thereby making our primary classrooms the most crowded and chaotic in the Western world.  One can understand older teachers faced with a classroom of 50-plus students opting for redundancy.  Those decisions emanate from a Minister who said this year that she proposed to give a particular priority to primary education and that she was not a woman of empty promises.  What a priority she has given to primary education; what a disastrous failure this is.</P>
    <P>Already teachers realise the enormity of what is being done to their schools and parents are waking up to the implications for their children, particularly younger children.  The addition of three children at each level of the appointments schedule, taken with the removal of the non-teaching principal spells the end of contact between child and teacher in thousands of primary classrooms across the country.  The downstream effect as the child goes to second level where the rates have been worsened, particularly in the vocational schools in disadvantaged areas, will educationally be a nightmare. There is no point in talking about reviewing the primary curriculum; the only review possible would be a course in crowd control and protection against noise for child and teacher alike.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the chaos and confusion in education that I have been told in the last hour or so by sources outside the House that the new schedules will operate from 1 January, that there will be large scale sacking of temporary teachers, and attempts to reorganise every school.  This will take place in two months time while the Minister hides, refuses to consult or deal with the education world as she should have done by holding a press conference on the day the Estimates were announced.  The Minister repeated over and again on radio and television in the last week that she is a different person now than when she was in Opposition.  Is she also saying that she is a different person to the person who made so many promises in April?  The mind boggles at that kind of insulting rhetoric.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> Parents, teachers and managers all need to know precisely how much damage will be done, how much real money will be saved and how many more children are to be stuffed into our classrooms.  The answers must be given in this House.  Will 1,000 teachers be taken away or will the figure be 2,000 or somewhere in between?  The implications for this school year at primary level are horrifying.  Let us look at this in another context.  Last week the Government undertook to increase the pay of everybody paid out of the public purse at a cost of hundreds of millions over the next few years.  It is clear to me that as the talks went on and the millions were clocked up the knives got sharper and sharper at the Cabinet table.  Did it not strike any of those people that it was, to put it mildly, grotesque that the start for small children in the educational experience should be sacrificed in order to pay increases to the likes of us, to senior gardaí, those in the Civil Service or the teachers themselves?</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that the teachers, and the unions, consider this a fair bargain and I am sure that parents do not, either. The bewildered children who will squeeze themselves into the classrooms to try to learn through the bedlam will not know until it is too late what deal was done in 1987 about their future because a Government needed to conclude a pay deal called, God help us, national recovery. I appeal to the Government to undo this frightful decision and restore this cut in the budget in the new year.  I appeal to the unions concerned in the pay deal to go back to the negotiating table with the Government and restore their credibility by finding this money for the sake of the children of the country.  They should find it out of pay.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another cut in the Estimate and, in this context, the subject of Carysfort College.  The Estimates cut a further £1 million out of the training colleges support.  Will the Minister come into the House this week and admit that not only were she and all her Fianna Fáil colleagues quite cynically misleading the staff and students of <Col N="901" /> Carysfort College when she so self-righteously took up their cause but that she has refused to put into operation the plans drawn up and agreed by the former Minister, Deputy Cooney, with Sister Regina for the future of the college? Once again it is an area where the Minister cold-bloodedly misused her position in Opposition.  I expect an answer to this question and a full explanation of the Estimate cut of £1 million on trainng colleges to be given to the House this week.  Is the Minister planning the closure of more colleges because her cuts in the number of primary teachers means that there will be no employment?  Let her tell the House which colleges they are and what her plans are for Carysfort.</P>
    <P>Another major area which demands immediate answers is the £6.5 million cut in school transport.  Anybody dealing with that area knows that this implies not only further increases on a massive scale in charges but also far-reaching changes in eligibility right across rural Ireland. In plain language, the parents and the youngsters need to know now if they will have a bus in January, if so, how far they will need to walk to get to it and how much it will cost.  Maybe the Minister will amaze us all and announce a complete new transport plan which will avoid hardship. Since she denounced small charges all during 1983, if there was any consistency we would see some good ideas for reducing charges.  However, it would be foolish to expect that.  What I do expect &mdash; and the parents in rural areas rightly expect &mdash; is the Minister to come out of hiding, tell them the worst and let them plan how they will cope with it if they can.</P>
    <P>Turning to second level, I will quote from the pay deal announced last Friday in this stylishly printed booklet which has &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; a section on education on page 14 which says:</P>
    <P>The Government will ensure that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The most dramatic cut at second-level is the worsening of the vocational, community <Col N="902" /> and comprehensive school pupil-teacher ratio.  The Minister knows, and has often spoken ardently about it in the House, that the disadvantaged child at second level is the special care of the vocational sector, that these schools are non-selective, that they include technical subjects, that they fulfil a range of community functions, all of which have been used by this Minister on previous occasions to justify a slightly less unfavourable pupil-teacher ratio in the vocational schools as opposed to the other selective schools.  What kind of double talk is it to make such solemn statements on a Friday and the following week to turn around and betray the disadvantaged?</P>
    <P>I take no pleasure whatsoever in making this speech because it is with great personal sadness that I listed the cuts in education amounting, we are told, to £86 million but it must be something of that order because the Minister and the Government have not come clean about the hidden pay elements.  Taken with the destructive attitude to curriculum reform and the blind cut off of all building plans, the whole package represents a failure of the Minister to understand the needs of a bright, young population whose education should be their most precious asset and her extraordinary collapse at Estimates discussions when she betrayed all those people who had been led to expect so much from her.  It is part of my responsibility as Opposition spokesperson to list those cuts and what they mean since the Government have so far refused to do so.</P>
    <P>As well as the massive attack on primary, vocational and school transport which I have already listed, the cuts show that computerisation of the examination system and the results has been finally abandoned.  It would have saved not only time, hassle and all the inefficiencies of the present system but money as well. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government who refuse to save money and at the same time to increase efficiency at a time when the country faces such difficulties.  The allowance in the Estimates for research and curriculum <Col N="903" /> reform have of course been decimated. The assistance to schools for the running costs at primary and second level has either been frozen or reduced.  Which is it?  The Minister has not said.  I expect her to come into the House and spell it out this week.</P>
    <P>Vocational committees are threatened with abolition and are also losing resources that they had last year.  There is no national plan for regionalisation, no commitment to making a genuinely locally administered first level, second level or adult education provision.  There is simply axing without any thought of vocational committees.</P>
    <P>Third level fees will rise by a multiple of inflation without any plan for genuine reform and rationalisation of courses at all our third level institutions.  Plans and discussion documents for reform in all these areas are in the Minister's Department and have been brought to a very advanced point through discussions with educational interests but there is no sign of a commitment to their implementation. There are panic stricken cuts in all these areas.  There will be no further building at third level.  The disadvantaged area of Tallaght who had a dream of an RTC for their young population will not see it come true.  The dreams of places like Castlebar and Thurles for new RTCs have also been shattered as well as those of any university which wanted to expand to deal with the enormous increase in third level numbers.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned all the cuts but I have given a fairly good selection.  Fianna Fáil have emerged at last in their true colours as a deeply conservative, backward looking party who will attack the weak and deal with the strong for the sake of peace and power.  Today I published my party's Private Members' Bill to establish the Curriculum and Examinations Board in statutory form.  The whole recent episode of the abolition of the interim board and the signalling of a return to full Civil Service and Ministerial control of every aspect of education is, unfortunately, typical of the Minister's <Col N="904" /> approach which has depressed and continues to depress the educational world intensely.  I will have a lot more to say on that subject when I introduce the Bill to the House and I hope for support from all parties who want to see progress, reform and democracy in educational decision-making. For the moment I am asking the Minister and the Government in the face of this very bad news for every primary classroom to reconsider between now and the budget this disastrous attack on primary schools.  I am specifically asking the relevant Ministers who drew up that pay deal and the unions who agreed to it to modify its terms so as to remove the burden of adult pay increases from the shoulders of little children.  I assure the Minister for Education and the Government that if they do this I will not be shouting &ldquo;U-turn&rdquo; or &ldquo;climb-down&rdquo;. There is a general, sober realisation of the job that has to be done and certainly no one appreciates it more than I do. That is why I am not demanding any more than one change in these disastrous Estimates.  I am asking that there be no disimprovement in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level so that school principals in large schools can continue their essential development and administrative role.</P>
    <P>Since the Government have created so much confusion about the figures involved, it is impossible to say with accuracy &mdash; because they have not given us the figures &mdash; how much exactly we are talking about but the price we are asking children to pay is too high.  It is too much to ask of this generation of small children that they should bear this burden.  I remind the House and the Minister once again of her statement in the Dáil on 8 April:</P>
    <P>It is my intention to give special priority to the needs of primary education, I am not a woman of empty promises.</P>
    <P>How could any Cabinet member remain in office having made such a statement if she cannot carry it through?  It is clear, in the absence of any sense of direction or set of principles regarding the development of education in this Minister's term <Col N="905" /> of office, that the work of policy development will be more and more a function of this House and specifically a function of Opposition spokespeople.</P>
    <P>The vacuum of thinking in several crucial areas is a tragedy, a vacuum which must be filled.  For example, language learning, so vital as Europe enters its crucial post-SEA phase and comes close to real unity with all that implies for mobility and employment, third level reform and rationalisation to meet the challenge of the nineties and beyond, curriculum reform allied to new assessment and examination procedures so that young people develop themselves for the real world and, above all, measures to protect and strengthen the primary sector and in particular its disadvantaged children, will form a principal part of my work on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>These Estimates, show a particularly severe attack on education.  They are a complete reversal of the attitude adopted by the Minister in this House in recent years and by her, her party and the Taoiseach in the general election this year and are in total a sad blow to a fine system which has been one of Ireland's proudest boasts.  I am personally deeply shocked that this Minister has shown such weakness in the face of the onslaught by her Taoiseach and Minister for Finance on the education area.  To give any gleam of hope to the fine people who work in the system and the parents and students who are so affected by it, the Minister must come to this House, give frank and clear answers to all my questions and put a clear plan before the country, as I did, of where education is going under her direction, first of all, however, she must go back to Cabinet and to the unions and plead for the cause of our primary school children.  That is her first and immediate responsibility and I say sincerely that I hope I will be congratulating her when we come to speak on the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> The 1988 Estimates may perhaps be portrayed by some as an important crossroads for our national <Col N="906" /> economy.  Personally, I do not entirely subscribe to this view because I believe the really important crossroads was the point at which this Government took up office and at which they decided without hesitation that the right road was not the soft option route.  We chose and have since followed the difficult but correct path towards eventual rectitude and ultimate economic growth and prosperity. The 1988 Estimates are but another step along that self same way.</P>
      <P>Of course it behoves every significant national body or grouping to recognise the situation as it really is, to accept the hard choice that has to be made and to make, each in their own unique way, realistic and constructive contributions towards regeneration and economic and social advancement.  The Government and the social partners have given that recognition and acceptance of the situation. They have set out a positive and purposeful plan in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Together they have pointed the way forward and, difficult though the journey may be, each special interest group must be prepared to do their part in a mutually supportive manner to achieve broad headway and benefit for all in the long run.</P>
      <P>The current crisis in the economy did not arrive suddenly or without warning. Over a long period of years we as a people had allowed our demand for Government services to creep gradually ahead of our willingness, indeed our ability, to pay.  To see how far things have drifted off course, it is useful to look back into our own recent economic history.  Any objective comparison between our situation today and the situation which obtained a mere ten or 20 years ago can only lead one to conclude that radical corrective action was and is still required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty years ago, in 1967, the total amount of Government spending under the heading of supply services was approximately £248 million.  Then by 1977 the amount spent by Government on supply services amounted to almost £2,000 million.  Total Government spending, including capital and central fund services, became equal to about 46 per <Col N="907" /> cent of GNP.  This compares with a figure of only 29 per cent in 1967.  In comparing these two figures, many people would justifiably feel that such an increase in spending was justified because of the previous inadequacy of the social services provided.</P>
    <P>However, the increase in public expenditure did not stop when it reached 46 per cent of GNP, a level perhaps which could probably have been sustained in the long run.  Government spending continued to rise and rise.  By 1981 it reached a level equal to almost 60 per cent of GNP, a level which could only be sustained by borrowing on a massive scale. Between the early eighties and the coming to office of this Government, the national debt doubled as a result of the maintenance of public spending at this unsustainable level.  It does not require an advanced education in the science of economics to realise that one cannot go on borrowing at an increasing rate for an indefinite period of time.  The Government could not go on spending money which simply was not there to spend.  All of the voices which are raised in opposition to our present strategy are ignoring this one central and inescapable point. Excessive borrowing went on too long. Someone had to do more than just shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I remember during this critical period which I have just described the constant note of concern about the state of the economy.  I also recollect that among the more fundamental questions which were being asked was one about the art and feasibility of government itself.  Posed in the context of liberalism, the expectations and demands for rewards and benefits without corresponding effort it asked, &ldquo;Is it any longer possible to govern?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have answered that question.  We have taken on a task that is anything but easy and we are diligently pursuing a policy of correctly focused, firm and fair government.  We do not relish the burden of implementing a series of severe economic measures but no one can allege that we have been anything but responsible in <Col N="908" /> our approach or that we have shirked from doing what is essential for economic survival.</P>
    <P>To any one who is critical about the thrust of Government action I would say, &ldquo;imagine the circumstances had we not done what we have done since taking up office.&rdquo;  There would be a borrowing spiral at an accelerating rate, high capital outflows, high interest rates rising still higher.  The upward push in the level of taxation would have increased, investment already impeded would have been further discouraged.  The recession and the level of depression would have deepened and an undermining of international confidence would have undermined our economic freedom, perhaps even our sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Against that background it is a pleasure to realise that the present situation is very different and very considerably better. The focus of Government policy is secure growth in the medium and long term.  We fully realise that this policy entails short term costs.  Nevertheless, there is already good news and progress to report.  We see that progress in financial targets being met, public expenditure appropriately curtailed, funds being directed towards areas with maximum growth potential, borrowing now well under control, interest rates significantly reduced, inflation at a very modest level, exports improving and our balance of payments position likewise becoming more favourable.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are not at the end of the road and hard decisions still have to be made.  However, there are few who would deny that the economic environment has improved considerably &mdash; through better economic management by the Government &mdash; and that there is now a far greater air of confidence than there was as we moved into 1987.  We now have an environment which is becoming increasingly favourable for investment and growth and the message which is coming through from the majority of the public is one of support for the policies which the Government are pursuing.  Perhaps the applied medicine is working and the average citizen is more concerned <Col N="909" /> about the cure than any temporary bitter taste.</P>
    <P>In relation to Estimate cuts, the Government are not pursuing a reduction in Government spending as an end in itself and in glorious isolation from the consequences.  The control in Government spending is a crucial element in its broad economic plan.  It is an essential ingredient for reducing the previously unacceptable level of dependance on borrowing, improving the environment for investment, thereby creating employment, and ultimately breaking the vicious circle of high Government spending, high interest rates and a high level of taxation. I have already referred in general terms to the benefits which have already flowed from the policies which are being pursued. To give some more specific examples I will just refer to two: first, the reduced cost of personal borrowing &mdash; a fair indicator is the fact that the prime overdraft rate of the major retail banks has fallen by up to 4¾ percentage points and second, far greater price stability. The current inflation rate of about 3 per cent is the lowest for 20 years.</P>
    <P>One factor I want to stress as regards the reductions in Government spending is that we have at all stages striven to be fair and logical in the application of cuts. We have firmly adhered to sound economic and social principles and we have set our priorities with due regard for both greatest need and the opportunities for greatest growth.  A glance at the 1988 Abridged Estimates volume and Summary Capital Programme will provide evidence of Government concern to ensure that all State agencies would contribute their share to provide the economies necessary in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>My Department is of course no exception. The Estimate for Defence for 1988 is for a sum of £253 million, that is 3 per cent down on the corresponding allocation for 1987 &mdash; not excessive in the present financial climate.  It is important, however, that I reassure the House and the general public that this tightening of the financial belt in 1988 does not in any way lessen security preparedness or the capabilities of the Defence Forces.  The <Col N="910" /> amount of money allocated has been carefully considered and will be adequate to meet essential requirements.  Notwithstanding the reduction, the Defence Forces will receive almost as much in the way of financial resources as they did last year.  With sensible management, it will be possible to meet all important commitments both at home and internationally. As regards the remuneration of Defence Forces personnel, any financial constraints applied will not prevent them from being treated fairly in a manner which is fully consistent with the pay pattern developments outlined in the recently published <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, I have recently initiated a review of all significant aspects of structure, organisation, deployment, manpower, equipment and infrastructural requirements of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Civil Defence.  I intend that this review will not be just a cost cutting exercise but will be a positive fundamental analysis which will develop the most realistic cost effective defence arrangements.  This should enable my Department and the Defence Forces to make their unique contribution to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> over the next few years.  A major part of the 1988 Estimates, as in previous years, provides for pay and allowances.  The amount involved is £2,776,000 or 79 per cent of the net total.  The corresponding figure for 1987 is £203,182,000 or 78 per cent of the net total.  The non-pay items amount to £60 million.  In 1987 the figure was £65,958,000.  The 1988 appropriation-in-aid figures show a slight decrease of £530,000 over that for 1987. The Estimate for 1988 is based on an average strength of 1,590 officers, 40 cadets and 11,600 other ranks, a total of 13,230 in the Permanent Defence Forces. I have ensured that the provision in 1988 for pay and allowances is such that the pay levels of personnel in the Defence Forces are protected.</P>
    <P>Parallel with these measures which ensure maintenance of pay rates and the strength of numbers in the Defence <Col N="911" /> Forces necessary for operation and duties, a saving of £2.4 million has been achieved on pay subhead for 1988.  Further savings of about £5 million have been effected by curtailing expenditure on stores and equipment and by cutting the provision for travel and subsistence.  The non-pay categories of expenditure amount to £65,958,00 for 1987 and are estimated at £60,573,000 for 1988. Expenditure of defence equipment has been set at £8 million, a £2 million saving on this year's allocation.  Because of the long-established policy of confidentiality under the detail of defensive equipment proposals and purchases, the House will appreciate that I cannot be too explicit in this area.  I can assure the House however that all essential supplies will continue to be available to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I might mention that provision has been made in the defensive equipment allocation for 1988 for a quantity of new rifles to replace the current FN models.  I expect to have a contract placed for these rifles before the end of this year.  This is an indication of my resolve that the provision of modern facilities for our Defence Forces should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that this financial debate regarding the 1988 Estimates is taking place at a time when the eyes of the world are wide open with surprise and concern about the happenings during the last few days in the financial markets across the globe, shades of Wall Street, 1929, when it was said that anyone booking a room in one of those skyscraper hotels might be asked whether it was for sleeping in or for jumping from.  I ask myself what all this has to do with the 1988 Estimates.  The behaviour on money markets might engage the greatest intellectuals in heated arguments. It is a topic on which millions of words have already been penned and spoken.  I have little to add to the wealth of wisdom on this subject.  But I was struck by a remark of one of our journalistic commentators on such matters when he was asked about the way in <Col N="912" /> which money markets have been behaving during the past few days.  He replied to the effect that it was like a flock of sheep following their leader.  As to whether there were shepherds to be followed, he was rather non-commital.  His analogy reminds me that in any time of crisis, in any time when confidence is severely shaken, there is a risk of behaving like sheep, perhaps walking along a route that leads right to the slaughter house.  At such critical times a restoration of confidence and the provision of firm intelligent leadership are of paramount importance.  Those who keep their heads, stand firm, and who when they move, move carefully but confidently along the right route, are the ones who will lead us past any threatening crisis.  That is the policy of this Government and of its leadership. We are on the right track, the forward track and we are not going to deviate either to the right or to the left. I see no reason for being timorous, fainthearted or put off by any relatively minor necessary hardships.  With Defence as my portfolio, I know from the annals of relatively recent defence history the examples of countries severely damaged by the onslaught of war which have come through severe levels of hardship and have picked up the pieces of broken economies to become again economically strong and occupy positions among the wealthiest nations on earth.</P>
    <P>We are proud of our past in other ways and have good reason to be so.  We have many records of achievement to be proud of, some in almost every corner of the globe.  With will, application and the right leadership which we have and which this Government will continue to have, there is no reason that economic prosperity should not be an attainable goal.  The 1988 Estimates signposted well in advance of this occasion are part of the Government's blueprint which will lead us to that goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the need to stabilise our debt, I seriously question the gross disproportion of the cuts in so far as they affect the Vote for Agriculture and Food.  How can a <Col N="913" /> Government which in the national plan stated that the expansion of the agricultural food industry was the central element of the Government's economic policy justify the £33 million reduction in this Vote, which at 18 per cent is six times the overall average decrease?  No explanation whatever has been forthcoming to explain the logic of this approach which is in direct contradiction to the stated objective in the national plan and incomprehensible in the context of the need to develop our main productive sector and safeguard family farm incomes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the distribution of the reduced Vote is totally disproportionate in the context of the amount of money made available for services to farmers and the industry as against the virtual total exemption of the administrative superstructure from any cuts?  These administrative costs for the next year take up nearly half the net Vote.  This approach will result in an emasculation of the service to farmers and the food industry while fully protecting the position of those administering the Vote.</P>
      <P>Clearly, there is insufficient recognition of the contribution of agriculture to our economy and of the appallingly low level of farm incomes.  Obviously, this lack of recognition is shared by the Government and it is obvious both in the proportion of total funds allocated to agriculture and in the distribution of those funds which are allocated.  It is now absolutely clear that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is either unaware of the facts or is unable to convince his Cabinet colleagues of them.  Furthermore, in accepting the departmental view of the distribution of the net Estimate he is simply a pawn in the administrative superstructure within his Department.  This week and ineffectual performance calls into question the competence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to hold a portfolio of such importance to so many of our people and to the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the Estimates in broad terms and taking into account the decisions taken in the national plan, it is <Col N="914" /> now very obvious that the Government have embarked on a mistaken strategy. It makes no sense whatever to agree increases in the salaries sector at a cost of £200 million to the public purse while at the same time withdrawing support from the productive sectors of the economy. Clearly, the Government have traded these increases for jobs and services. This approach is of no benefit to the economy and will have many detrimental effects in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In countries like Holland which have successfully come to terms with their problems in the public finances an exactly opposite approach was taken.  In Holland there was a cut in public sector pay of 3 per cent and it was only by pursuing this course of action that the Dutch were able to come to grips with their problem.  Are we any different?  I have spoken to many in the public sector in the past week and it is clear that many of those involved would much prefer a slightly reduced income rather than having the jobs of themselves and their colleagues put at risk.  Effectively what the Government have done is put a halter around our necks, the full choking effects of which will become more and more apparent over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on Tuesday that the national plan had a strong developmental dimension, that it identified those areas of the economy which offered the best opportunities for growth and development. He pointed out that these are also areas with the greatest potential for job creation.  He went on:</P>
    <P>The Government will be concentrating on these over the next three years to see what further initiatives can be taken to accelerate their growth and expansion.</P>
    <P>When expressing these aspirations, he totally neglected to mention the means by which these aspirations would be implemented and financed.  In fact, the necessary funds have effectively been pre-empted by the moneys required to fund the national wage agreement.  This contradictory approach will ensure that the most productive sectors of the economy, <Col N="915" /> the full mobilisation of which could form the basis of our economic recovery, will be starved of the necessary resources to fuel that recovery.  The result of this approach is already obvious in the overall net reduction of £33 million in the Vote for Agriculture and Food for 1988.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepts the Government's approach on pay and that there is any justification for such a grossly disproportionate reduction in the Agriculture Vote, how can the Minister for Agriculture and Food or his Government justify the distribution of that Vote?  Under the heading of General Administration, covering salaries, offices and other expenses, the total allocated comes to £66.5 million.  Since, in fact, the 1988 allocations in the Estimates for the Public Service have been prepared on the basis of pay rates in operation on 1 October 1987, they do not take into account the proposed increases for 1988 and therefore the outturn for administrative costs will be even higher.  However, even on the basis of the figures before us very serious questions must be asked and answers demanded.  I am now putting these questions and demanding answers. How can the Minister justify the fact that the Estimates provide for 45 per cent of the net Vote to be spent on general administration?  How can he justify having over 4,000 people in the Department to administer that much reduced Vote?  We need to know the basis on which there is a need for almost 2,000 personnel in the general services grade within the Department, all the more so now in the context of the overall cut of £33 million in the Vote.</P>
    <P>What has become of the 91 people who worked with the Land Commission, who went on promotion at an average of about £20,000 a year to the Farm Tax Office and who are now back in the Department without any work to do because the Government abolished the Farm Tax Office, which was doing very good work. Will the Minister confirm or deny that these people have no work to do, do not even have to report for duty and, in the case of some, have had the phones in <Col N="916" /> their offices disconnected?  How can the Minister preside over an administrative situation which permits such practices to continue while at the same time reducing the very necessary moneys needed at coalface for those providing services and support for farmers and the agricultural and food industry?  How can the Minister justify such enormous and disproportionate cuts in the Exchequer funding for the new research, education and advisory body, a new merged body, which for convenience I shall refer to as &ldquo;AFTCOT&rdquo; until such time as it has been formally and officially christened by the Minister.  How can he justify a reduced funding of over £20 million for that body instead of £35 million while at the same time the administrative positions for his Department have been so totally protected? This is perhaps the most outrageously disproportionate imbalance in the entire Vote if not in the entire Estimates.</P>
    <P>There is a 44 per cent reduction in the budget for &ldquo;AFTCOT&rdquo; and this must be compared with no savings whatsoever in administrative costs.  There is in the Book of Estimates a reference to 2 per cent savings in salaries, but this will be more than compensated for by the fact that there will be additional moneys available to cover the 1988 salary increases.  The Minister in his press release yesterday stated that there will be the release of some 200 staff who are surplus to the Department's requirements and that this is provided for in the Estimates.  This proposed reduction in numbers at 4.7 per cent surplus staff compares with the proposed reduction of numbers at &ldquo;AFTCOT&rdquo; of over 45 per cent.  The proportion proposed in this area which is giving service to farmers and the industry is over ten times that proposed for the Department and over three times that proposed for the general Public Service. This gross disproportion is now seen more and more as a national scandal.</P>
    <P>If we are to increase agricultural production and maintain farm incomes there is an absolute need to improve efficiency and quality.  That approach requires an emphasis on education, advice, training, <Col N="917" /> research and development which the new merged advisory and research body could provide if it is established on a sensible basis and not strangled at birth, which is what this Government and Minister are proposing.  Effectively, what the Minister has now done is to establish a financial straitjacket for this new body.  It will mean fewer services to farmers, more charges and the abandonment of those farmers least able to afford services. Maintenance of incomes in rural areas will inevitably be adversely affected by this inexplicable approach.  Furthermore, the disastrous affects on the economy will become apparent in a short time.</P>
    <P>I accept that we need a basic administrative infrastructure but there must be justice and equity in whatever measures are taken which will affect those at the coalface and those involved in administration. I say that those two basic requirements are not present or underpinning these decisions.  There is no more justice or equity in this approach than can be found in any of the worst decisions made by any Government in any country in the world.  Clearly, this foolish and misguided approach will impact adversely on farm incomes.  Despite the difficulties at present there are areas where output can expand and there are possibilities to impact positively on farm incomes.  To do this we need to encourage efficiency, cost control, good financial management, top quality and effective marketing but all these need the benefit of advice, research and support at national level.</P>
    <P>It is now very obvious that there was no planning whatever behind the decision to merge the AFT and ACOT.  In fact, this was another U-turn on the part of Fianna Fáil some of whose members solemnly assured the staff in these bodies last year that no such merger would take place under a Fianna Fáil administration. However, there have been so many U-turns that I will not dwell on that. Clearly, as someone who is in favour of the merger, what is required to establish a lean, effective and efficient body is a substantial degree of planning.  I accept entirely that that approach would result in <Col N="918" /> substantial savings but what have we now?</P>
    <P>At this stage it is obvious that the staff in both organisations are shell shocked and the Minister is unable to provide direction or guidelines as to how he proposes to establish an effective organisation on the basis of the moneys now allocated in the Estimates.  Clearly, the Government have put the cart before the horse.  They have now made the decision based on the financial straitjacket and at this stage the Minister is running around like a headless chicken seeking to imply that he has some broad secret strategy, so far unannounced, <i>in pectore,</i> as it were, to enable the merger to be effectively implemented.  Let me say to the Minister and to the Government that apart from the 150,000 farmers in the country there are also 2,200 employees in ACOT and the AFT who have more than a passing interest in being allowed a glimpse of the thoughts of the Minister on this subject at this stage.</P>
    <P>For my part I say that the whole aproach has been wrong.  The planning should have come first.  An assessment of the necessary resources in terms of personnel and finance should have been made and provided.  It is now too late to adopt this sensible and rational approach but there are still some ways in which the position can be improved.  I have three specific proposals to make.  First, since there is an utterly disproportionate share of funding going for general administration within the Department, this amount should be reduced.  Of the sum of £66.5 million under subhead A for general administration a sum of the order of £7.5 million should be transferred from subhead A to subhead B by way of an increased grant to the new body.  Second, and additionally, the entire farm development service of the Department and all funding presently applying to it should also be transferred to the new body from the Department.  Third, the proposal to establish An Bord Glas should be scrapped and the funding of £168,000 in the Estimate should also be transferred to the new body with the full responsibility for that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> I have already clearly expressed my views in relation to efficiency which would result from the transfer of the farm development service to AFTCOT.  In relation to An Bord Glas I take for my authority the words of the Taoiseach, strangely enough.  I listened to him speak in this House yesterday when he said: &ldquo;There are simply too many State agencies and authorities each with their own burden of administrative overheads&rdquo;.  He subsequently said: &ldquo;We simply have not got the resources to support this elaborate superstructure of agencies&rdquo;.  How can anybody who speaks in these terms justify the formation of a new body which clearly has not got the resources to make any effective impact in the area?  In any event it is clear that the amount of general expenses provided would hardly be sufficient to cover the expenses of a separate autonomous body.  It is also clear that they will have to rely on the infrastructure of the new farm body such as it will be to provide support for this fledgling body. The idea on paper may have seemed wise but obviously no planning went into it either.  The right approach would be to merge that body also into the new body.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed merger and the paltry Exchequer funding now available for the new body the following questions arise in respect of which clear and unequivocal answers are needed from the Minister.  Does the Minister accept that the way to increase farm incomes is to increase production, if possible, and to improve efficiency and quality? How can this be done without an adequate support service providing education, training, advice and research?  Is it the Minister's approach that the vast majority of farmers are now to be abandoned to their own devices and left without support?  Is it correct that AFT and ACOT were both asked last June to prepare normal budgets providing for a 10 per cent reduction in expenditure?  If so, what is the reason for the change in direction and what planning has been provided in relation to that?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> On the basis that over 1,000 redundancies will be required in the AFT and ACOT and on the basis that at most about 350 voluntary redundancies will be achieved, what are the proposals to bring the figure up to 1,000 in the light of the Government's oft-stated commitment to the principle that there will be no compulsory redundancies?  What proposal has the Minister to make as regards the pensions of those made redundant?  Are these to be paid also out of the funding now provided?  If we examine the figures, redundancy for 1,000, which is the figure proposed, will cost in the order of £17.5 million.  This presumably is going to be part of the money provided through the funny money arrangement yet to be announced with the Central Bank, but let us leave that aside.  That is not the end of the cost.  What is to become of the annual pensions?  Who is going to pay for those and where is the money going to come from?  A rough calculation taking into account the age structure and the terms of service of those employed by AFTCOT would suggest that the cost of such pensions would be of the order of £7 million to £7.5 million a year.  Where is the money going to come from to pay for those pensions?</P>
    <P>How do the Government justify, in the light of the present hype on both training and research and development, establishing the lowest budget for same in the whole of Europe?  The proportion now provided from Exchequer funds works out at 0.73 per cent of gross agricultural output.  No other country in Europe spends anywhere near as low as this figure.  In comparison, the Dutch will be spending next year 16 times that proportion in the research area.  How can our farmers and food industry generally be expected to compete in that market on level terms with that kind of support and funding?  Even if one takes the Department's own figures for research and testing &mdash; again looking at the Estimates &mdash; we find that a reduction of 10 per cent has been provided in relation to that figure within the Department.  How <Col N="921" /> does the Minister justify the disproportionate adjustment of that amount as opposed to the figures I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>These are some of the questions that must be raised and answered in the light of the approach now adopted by the Government.  Clearly the approach adopted establishes without doubt that there is no recognition as far as this Government are concerned of the contribution of agriculture to our economy. Are this Government aware that agriculture and the food industry earn nearly 46 per cent of foreign exchange when raw material imports are taken into account? Are they aware that this major and important figure as far as the country is concerned is based on an Exchequer contribution of 2 per cent only?  Are the Government aware of the huge employment content in the agricultural and food area totalling over 200,000?  Is that employment now to be put at risk?  There are already approximately 12,000 per annum leaving the land.  It is very clear to me that the approach adopted by this Government will accelerate that trend.</P>
    <P>What is the present attitude of the Government in relation to farm income? Is the Minister not aware that 71 per cent of all farms produce an income of less than £5,000, that almost three-quarters of farms produce an income of less than £5,000.  Contrary to what has been stated in other fora, that figure includes all grants and subsidies received by those farmers.  Does he not accept that there is a continuing need for support, advice and an effort at least to maintain, if not improve, that figure?</P>
    <P>The only overall conclusion we can come to is that the Minister has accepted feather-bedding in his own Department at the cost of the Irish farmer, of the agricultural and food industry in general and at an appalling cost in terms of jobs of those actively engaged in ACOT and AFT supporting both the farmer and the industry.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Estimate about which questions must be raised but time will not permit me to go into them in detail.  For instance, where is the provision <Col N="922" /> for the beef cow suckler scheme? There is already considerable uncertainty about this scheme.  In the Minister's announcement at the end of last month he referred to an Exchequer contribution of £1 million.  I can find no provision for that sum in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that I consider the increase in the national herd as being the national priority.  I welcomed the Minister's announcement even though I felt that the measures proposed were insufficient. It now appears the scheme may not get off the ground at all.  It is clear that the meat plants are getting cold feet about it and, at best, the banks are lukewarm. AIB have offered 2 per cent.  The other financial institutions have not confirmed equivalent support for the scheme.  I gather the ACC have indicated they will be involved only if the interest allowed is added to their grant by the Minister for Finance.  Similarly, no arrangement has been made in relation to the farmer contribution.  The Minister urgently needs to make a statement in relation to this scheme, confirming full and detailed implementation provisions. In particular &mdash; I want to pinpoint this &mdash; where is the Exchequer contribution promised?  I suppose it is becoming so common nowadays to refer to U-turns and broken promises there is a rather resigned reaction on the part of those who were taken in by the promises given in relation to disadvantaged areas.  The reclassification of those areas is not to be proceeded with and no provision is being made therefore.  In fact, the reduction in the off-farm income limits of eligibility effectively reduce the amounts being made available in these poorer parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Again, there was much talk on the part of this Government about the importance of marketing.  Yet we find that the allocation to CBF is being cut in half as part of a policy decision to phase out the whole lot over the next couple of years.  That is hardly in line with the statements made by the Government about the importance of marketing.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the provision for overseas <Col N="923" /> aid has been cut to the minimum.  It really is scraping the bottom of the barrel to literally take the bread out of the mouths of the poor and hungry of the Third World.  It is clear the Government do not attach any importance to the agriculture and food area.  It is also clear, in the context of the Vote, that the Minister has totally abandoned the farmers, the industry and has copper-fastened the position of those involved in his Department.</P>
    <P>So many questions remain outstanding one would need long hours to tease out all the implications of this Estimate.  I regard it as a disaster as far as the agricultural sector and the development of the food industry are concerned.  Indeed, it is a disaster for those in the support, advisory and research services whose jobs are now needlessly put at risk.  I have pointed out the way this can be avoided, the way in which the necessary support services can effectively be continued. This is not being done by the Government. I believe this will prove to have been an absolutely disastrous decision as far as the country generally is concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are also some legal aspects I have not time to go into.  I wonder has the Minister checked some of the legal provisions in relation to the 1958 Act to allow the Agricultural Institute such staff as is necessary for the performance of its functions?  There is an even more interesting section in the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act of 1977, section 48, the implications of which need to be teased out.  There are also questions to be raised in relation to the position of places like Johnstown Castle which has been mentioned as being for the hammer.  There are three Acts relating to Johnstown Castle.  I wonder have they been examined?  In fact one might well ask: has there been any policy at all prepared in relation to the proposed merger, or are we going to cut out whole sections of the advisory service on the ground?  If that is the approach of the Government I say it is wrong.  I am advancing serious, constructive proposals <Col N="924" /> as to how it may be put right.  I believe that the total amount allocated is too small for the agricultural area but even within the Agricultural Vote even at this late stage the position can be retrieved.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the present Government to seriously consider the constructive proposals I have advanced so that that can be done.  If that approach is adopted, then we can largely avoid the ill-effects of the present hasty and ill-conceived decisions of the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate affords to reiterate the Government's approach to the grave financial problems obtaining and to hear the views of the Opposition on their alternative proposals which, despite all the talk of the past week or so, I have not yet heard articulated.  That is not surprising as I think they, too, agree that urgent, remedial action is required to solve the nation's finances.  If so, and if the consensus of the Dáil is clear, then that consensus will help to enlist public support for the Government's budgetary strategy.  In that regard I am disappointed but not surprised at the Labour Party's negative stance, as portrayed in their amendment to the Government motion. The leading members of the Labour Party know quite well from their experience in Government that there is no other way forward than that proposed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Estimates we are discussing are not an isolated event but form part of the Government's strategy for restoring growth in the economy.  Last Friday the Fianna Fáil Party in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set out the principles for management of the public finances which we said we would adopt when elected to Government.  We said that Government expenditure would be contained, that the current budget deficit would be reduced progressively, that the growth of national debt as a percentage of GNP would be reversed, interest rates lowered and that every effort would be made to re-establish confidence in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> The recently announced <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> constitutes another step in the Government's programme to achieve consensus with the major sectors in the country, as most, if not all realise, that the drift in the public finances must be corrected now.  The urgent need for this consensus was echoed in the report of the National Economic and Social Council entitled <i>Strategy for Development</i> which, in plain language, pointed out that, as a country, we could not continue to add £2 billion a year to the national debt.  The tragedy is that the Coalition Government wasted four and a half years thinking about the problem without doing anything positive about it.  They only succeeded in making matters worse by doubling the national debt by £12 billion to £24 billion.  Had they taken the necessary corrective measures over those four and a half years then the drastic action we must now take in Government would not be so severe.  In those four and a half years the public had become accustomed to accepting that adding £2 billion to the national debt annually was normal.  It is not and we must get that message across.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine any normal household or business adding comparably large amounts to their borrowing because they would soon be in trouble with their bank managers.  Likewise, the Government must cry halt now.  This Government, unlike their predecessors are not afraid to take the necessary action to restore stability to the public finances while, at the same time, protecting those depending on social welfare payments and identifying and encouraging those areas of the economy that have the capacity for growth.  It is easy at this time to be pessimistic but it is also a time for courage to overcome our difficulties and improve our future prospects.</P>

      <P>I am amazed by the attitude of the two main political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, to our proposal to abolish ministerial pensions for serving Members of the Oireachtas.  They have washed their hands of the issue. They both agree that the contentious issue of Members of this House receiving a salary and a pension while still serving as TDs should be referred to another committee.  They say it is important that they are not seen as the arbiters.  Yet both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are prepared to be arbiters of pay, pensions and social welfare entitlements for every other member of the community.  That is not <Col N="927" /> good enough.  Leadership on this and every other issue should come from this House.  We stated in our election manifesto last February under the heading &ldquo;Leading by Example&rdquo; that politicians must lead by example if they expect people to accept the tough decisions necessary to make this country great. How apt that paragraph is in the context of the Estimates debate.  The Government proudly boast of spending cuts amounting to £485 million.</P>
      <P>If I am amazed by the public posturing of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in relation to our Bill I am deeply disappointed by the attitude adopted by the press and media generally to the announcement by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Des O'Malley, and by the chairman of our Parliamentary Party, Deputy Bobby Molloy, that they are giving up £8,840.80 and £7,119.84 respectively.  Their decision, which is unprecedented among politicians in this House, did not merit a mention on the main RTE News that night.  The debate on this Bill got four paragraphs in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
      <P>I, more than any other politician in the Dáil, know that TDs frequently turn on the media when they are in trouble.  I have a lot of experience of that.  I found over the years that TDs of all parties like to make a scapegoat of the press.  Most of the time it is not justified.  It is with some reluctance, therefore, that I criticise the media coverage of the move by Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Molloy and this party to change ministerial pensions and remove an anomaly which is a great cause of public disillusionment with politics and politicians.  The new £40,000 State car bought by the Taoiseach received about the same media coverage and was looked at with the same interest as the decision by two politicians in this party to forego more than one-third of their salaries in order to bring pressure to bear on this House to change the law on ministerial pensions and get support for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was criticised during the last Dáil session for tabling a question asking for <Col N="928" /> details of the expenses paid to Members of Seanad Éireann.  It was as if I had offended the cosy club in Leinster House. This party believe that, along with the abolition of ministerial pensions, the Seanad should be closed down.  It is of some interest to me that a number of Senators receive more in expenses than in their actual salary.  Deputy De Rossa tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on the day we were due to move this Bill last week.  We saw from the answer that the only people Fine Gael put forward to oppose our Bill, namely, Deputies Michael Noonan and Jim Mitchell, receive ministerial pensions of £6,256.80 each on top of their Dáil salaries. Why was this not pointed out when these two Deputies spoke to oppose the abolition of their pensions?  The other main opponent of our Bill, the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, is well on the way to storing up a ministerial pension of over £6,000 at this stage.</P>
    <P>I know from having been a political journalist that the media have been crying out for years for politicians to lead by example.  If Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy had not given up their pensions the media and members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would be ready to pounce and say they will not put their money where their mouth is.  The exact opposite has happened and it is a rare development in Irish politics.  The Progressive Democrats told the electorate in their manifesto last February that politicians must lead by example if they are to expect people to accept the tough decisions which are necessary.  We proposed the abolition of ministerial pensions for sitting TDs, members of the European Parliament, members of the Judiciary and the President.  This is exactly what we are now doing.  We, unlike the Government party, are acting in accordance with our mandate.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael clubbed together to change the rules for Private Members' motions last June when we were ready to introduce this Bill to the House.  They stopped it.  Now we are belatedly introducing the Bill and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still stopping it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> The purpose of the Bill is to end the payment of ministerial and Oireachtas pensions to the holders of certain offices and to sitting Members of the Oireachtas. These pensions are payable under the provisions of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Acts, 1938 to 1983, and under the provisions of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts, 1938 to 1983.  The Bill makes sitting Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament, the President of Ireland, serving members of the Judiciary, both domestic and European, the Attorney General, the Master of the High Court and members of the Commission of the European Communities ineligible to receive pensions while holding such office.</P>
    <P>Our Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill was first published on 2 July last year.  Within weeks of its publication and the controversy on ministerial pensions which the Bill created, the President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery, gave up his ministerial pension.  I recognise that the office of President is above politics.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to offend the office of President but his action in voluntarily giving up his ministerial pension after the Progressive Democrats published this Bill last year, the President, Dr. Hillery, has made a major contribution to this debate, I commend him for that as I am sure do the people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should not be based on the generosity of high-minded people like the President, Dr. Hillery, and Deputies O'Malley and Molloy in giving up their ministerial pensions.  It is an attempt to change the law.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Members to show by their vote next Wednesday night that they <Col N="931" /> agree this anomaly should be removed from the law.  We are not asking them to give up their pensions.  We are asking them to change the system of payment for Members of this House so that political experience is rewarded in the same way as people are normally paid in any other profession in this country.  They do not receive pensions as well as salaries. People receive pensions when they retire.</P>
    <P>We decided that the abolition of ministerial pensions should be the first ever Private Members' motion of the Progressive Democrats in this House.  We are prepared to lead by example.  I call on Members of other parties to support us in removing the anomaly of ministerial pensions from the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>As one in receipt of the allowance, pension, gratuity, or whatever one cares to call it, it behoves me to speak in this debate and to justify the present arrangement.  Because of my position I could be accused of speaking from self-interest.  Self-interest is not necessarily something to be ashamed of, particularly when the self-interest is supported by a case that is objectively valid, by arguments that have stood the test of time and which are based on a report which is some 50 years old.  I refer of course to the Shanley report of 1937 which is the basis for the present arrangement for paying Ministers in office and when they leave office.</P>
      <P>I find it puzzling, to say the least, that the proponents of this Bill, so far as I can ascertain from the record of last week's debate and having listened to Deputy Kennedy this evening, have made no reference to the Shanley report.  One would have thought that the Progressive Democrats in moving a Bill and advancing arguments to support the change they seek, would have gone to the source, the Shanley report, analysed it, and, if possible, contraverted its premises and conclusions. It is quite remarkable that they have not done so.  I cannot conceive that they have not read it because they are a very thorough party in their operations.</P>

      <P>Let that go by the board. The reasons behind the setting up of the Shanley Commission, the arguments put forward in the Shanley report and the conclusions drawn from those arguments have not been adverted to or contraverted in this debate, and the arguments which were made 50 years ago are as relevant today as they were then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported at column 302 of the Official Report for 14 October, 1987, Deputy Colley posed the rhetorical question: why have we devised the system we have?  She followed that with another question and a statement.  The import of the two latter statements is that we <Col N="933" /> devised the system we have because politicians wanted to reward themselves. That is totally incorrect.  The system we have was the result of the report and recommendations of the Shanley Commission. It is totally inadequate in a controversial emotional matter such as this that that rhetorical question should have been answered in that fashion and that the source should have been ignored.  I think the reason we have not had comprehensive arguments on the source is because the Progressive Democrats are unable to contravert those arguments. They cannot rebut them because they are as relevant and as convincing today as they were when they were first published.</P>
    <P>One has to look behind the Shanley report and identify the basic objective of that commission.  It is quite clear that their basic objective was to protect the integrity of high office in this State.  It was pointed out that if persons have to serve in high office in Government, while there is no legal requirement there is an absolute convention that they cut themselves off from their previous employment or vocation.  That is only proper because obviously there would be potential for a conflict of interests if that rule were not strictly enforced.  This was to ensure that there would be no conflict of interest, that the office would be beyond suspicion and that the integrity of government would be beyond reproach.  That is a principle of cardinal importance in a democracy, and a principle we must ensure is protected.  It was to protect that principle that the Shanley Commission were set up &mdash; to ensure that people who would take high office would not be prejudiced by taking such office and that they would not be dissuaded from taking office through fear of being financially prejudiced.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if one takes office and cuts oneself off from one's previous occupation or employment for an indefinite time, which might be a substantial number of years, there is obviously great difficulty, and in some cases an impossibility, in resuming where one left off. Commercial and professional life does not stand still.  It is a constant race and <Col N="934" /> if one leaves that race it is practically impossible to resume it on the same terms as when one left.  Contacts are lost, knowledge has gone rusty and there are changes in procedures and practices.  It is impossible for someone to resume in exactly the same position as when he left that employment to take office.  Consequently, it is only common justice that a person who serves the State by assuming office should be protected against the financial consequences that will inevitably follow when that person leaves office.  That consideration motivated the Shanley Commission to decide a proper level of remuneration for those serving and a proper compensation for them when they had to give up office.  The Shanley Commission considered the possibility of increasing ministerial remuneration to such a level that the holders of office could provide for their future on their termination of office but they decided against that. Instead, they decided to recommend the payment of a pension or gratuity.</P>
    <P>If we did not have this protection and people went into office knowing that their term in office was necessarily temporary, to be ended on the change of Government after a short, medium or long term, and that there was no financial buffer for the time they would leave office &mdash; in the ordinary run of things such persons could be expected to have domestic responsibilities &mdash; there would be a danger that in looking ahead and considering whether they would be able to deal with those responsibilities after leaving office they would be forced to adopt stances or be put in an invidious position that might conflict with the need to be totally and absolutely independent in the running of their office.  They might seek out commercial contacts in the course of their office that might be useful afterwards if this protection did not exist.</P>
    <P>In my view there are very strong reasons for the original Shanley recommendations, that people cutting themselves off from their previous employment or occupation and unable to go back in at the same level &mdash; they may not be able to go back in at all &mdash; should <Col N="935" /> be protected when they leave office.  If that was not the position, in spite of the attractiveness of office, I am satisfied that many people would have refused office in the past 50 years or so to the detriment of the political life of the country.</P>
    <P>It is important that office should be open to all and not just those of independent means who might wish to indulge in politics as a hobby or something of that kind.  That was one of the considerations referred to in the Shanley report.  I would like to have heard those considerations debated in the House.  I would like to have heard what the Progressive Democrats have to say on what I consider to be very real and strong arguments.</P>
    <P>In making a case for the Bill, Deputy Colley relied on her statement that it was wrong that a person should have two incomes from the same source in respect of the same or similar employment.  The kernel of her objection is that the ministerial allowance, pension or gratuity, is received by the same person who is also receiving a Deputy's allowance in respect of the same or similar employment.  Of course, it is not the same or similar employment because being a Deputy is vastly different to being a Minister and Deputy.  There is the world of a difference between the two. Indeed, if one were to look at that argument and reverse it, one could say that it was wrong for the same person, to wit the Minister, to be drawing two incomes from the same source in respect of the same or similar employment.  It is equally an argument for not paying Ministers a salary and I cannot see that it has any logic or justification.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, as reported in the Official Report, Deputy Colley said that the idea in introducing the Bill was to right a wrong, to correct an injustice. I presume that the wrong she has in mind is a wrong to taxpayers' generally or an injustice to taxpayers.  But I cannot see, if there should be such a wrong to the taxpayers, that the way to correct it is to do a wrong and an injustice to a person who gave up his or her occupation <Col N="936" /> to serve his or her country in Government, as is being proposed.  There is a lack of logic there.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a large element of envy or resentment behind the fact that former Ministers are paid an allowance on top of their Dáil salary.  Deputy Kennedy touched on this in the course of her contribution.  It is a human characteristic, perhaps found in a more virulent form here, to be envious of other people; the &ldquo;why should he have more than I&rdquo; syndrome.  It is a reflection of that that has inspired this Bill.  It is a good wicket to be on politically, it is a piece of opportunism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a piece of ill-defined emotionalism because from what I have read and heard of the debate &mdash; I will wait for the remainder of the contributions &mdash; no cogent or logical reasons have been put forward for a change.  I have heard statements to the effect that there is public cynicism about this, that people resent and object to this.  We have heard that people are asking: &ldquo;Why should he have an allowance when he has a Dáil salary?&rdquo; I can well understand people putting forward those points of view but they are not good arguments for changing what has stood the test for 50 years, something that was devised on the basis of carefully analysed premises and had a conclusion drawn that was irresistible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Bill serves the public interest one whit.  It may serve the political fortunes of the Progressive Democrats, or so they may think, but I cannot see that it serves the political interest of the country.  In my view it is a mean proposal reflecting an element and an attitude in our society that we would be better off without.  There is the further point of view that when people went into office they did so on the basis of a certain financial arrangement given to them by the law of the land.  I wonder how this proposal, in the unlikely event of its being passed, would stand up constitutionally because I consider that I have a property right in the allowance that has been <Col N="937" /> granted to me on the basis of the arguments in the Shanley report.  I am satisfied because of the attitude of the Government that I will not have to test the point constitutionally but it is one that should have been adverted to by those who are making the case for change.  The arguments in the Shanley report are as valid today as they were in 1937 when they were published.  I have not read anything so far that shakes them in the slightest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points about the whole question of pensions.  At the outset I should like to state that the main thrust of the Bill is Labour Party policy and has been for many years.  Therefore, we will be supporting the measure.  I should like to mention something that might be of interest to Deputy Kennedy.  Most Deputies before they are elected to this House spend a long time in industry or the services. Some Members of the Progressive Democrats have gone through the same system.  A Deputy who comes here after working in industry, the services or in the press, and spends three or five years here loses all entitlements to a pension, including the 20 or 30 years spent in industry or the services.  That is a big anomaly which should be dealt with. It means effectively that if a Member of this House or the Seanad having spent 20 or 30 years working in industry or the services, is elected to either House and serves even one term of office they do not qualify for a pension under the existing regulations of the Dáil or Seanad.  They do not qualify for unemployment benefit, old age pension or any of the other social welfare benefits to which they have contributed for maybe 20 or 30 years.  This is something which should also be looked at because it appears that politicians, as Deputy Kennedy rightly said, should lead but should do so in a manner which ensures fair play for all sections of the community, including Members of the Dáil and Seanad who have given a life-time <Col N="938" /> of service on the political scene. Many of them have to work very long hours in most cases for seven days a week. In this case there is an anomaly but there are many others that should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle that if a serving Minister completes his term of office the pension entitlement should be rightfully paid to him or her.  However, it should be paid after the term of office has been completed and this is the point where, generally speaking, most of the public and certainly the majority of the Members of this House also agree.  When a Minister completes a term of office he has rightfully earned an additional payment for which he has worked hard.  That is the crunch point.</P>
      <P>Two years ago I moved such a resolution on behalf of the Labour Party but it was turned down by a committee of this House.  The reasons given then are those which have been advanced during the course of this debate. Deputy Taylor and I were outvoted by something like 20 votes to two on that committee.</P>
      <P>The other question I should like to ask is if it is possible to implement the provisions of the Bill.  I dealt with pensions for many years at national level in a number of industries and I do not know of any circumstance where a change in a pension entitlement can, be retrospectively dated by legislation.  I have grave doubts as to whether the effects of this Bill can eliminate an existing pension entitlement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nice to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that for a number of reasons.  My understanding of pension entitlement, particularly in regard to widows and orphans, is that you cannot by law eliminate such entitlement.  Under existing legislation and under this Bill the right of a wife's entitlement to widow's pension is laid down.  I have also grave doubts as to whether life cover can be eliminated.  I do not know whether our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats have gone into the legalities of this situation but I should like to see clear-cut <Col N="939" /> evidence that it is possible.  It would be better for any person who has served in either House of the Oireachtas who feels they can afford to give away any entitlement they have earned to give it to some suitable charity in their constituency. There are plenty of people in my constituency who would be very happy to have disbursed among them a pension entitlement which I did not wish to have. I am sure that applies equally to any other constituency.  That would be less complicated than what we are proposing here.  We should concentrate on the main thrust of the Bill in so far as the entitlement should be added after the Member has served the term of office whether by retirement, loss of seat or some other reason.</P>
      <P>I should also like to remind the House that we are talking about the wrong subject. We do not have our priorities right. This is an important and emotive issue but what about two thirds of all workers in industry and services who have no pension entitlement?  It would be better if we combined our efforts, on an all party basis, to get at least minimum pensions applied to those men and women who work in shops, stores and factories in industry and the services and who do not have a pension after the completion of a lifetime of work, especially as those people are providing the bulk of the finance required to pay even the pensions of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers promised new Bills, Green Papers, White Papers and so on in regard to pensions but, so far, no Government or party have been brave enough to put such a Bill before the House.  We should be correcting the main anomaly which is that the vast bulk of people have no pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to mention that during my term of office as a senior trade union official, I was party to a number of national agreements and understandings from 1969, most of which provided for an understanding that such pensions would be introduced.  However, no <Col N="940" /> Government during all that time provided for a pension based on the content of any of the national agreements.  I should also like to make the point &mdash; that should be publicly stated &mdash; that a TD's pension after seven years is approximately £75 per week.  On that basis and because of the fact that that TD would not be entitled to unemployment or disability benefit or, on a means test, to unemployment assistance he would have approximately £75 a week to keep him or her and a family.</P>
    <P>Thousands of workers who have served in the Army, the Garda Síochána, as teachers and public servants and, of course, redundant workers after their retirement or redundancy, are entitled to seek, secure and be paid in full time employment.  Many of those pensioners, for example, officers, NCOs and men of the Army secured employment last year, some of them in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Could this Bill be used as the thin end of the wedge to get at all of those people who have retired or been made redundant in employment and in the public service in general?  I would like an assurance from our colleagues in the PDs that this is not the intention of the Bill.  I appreciate that it is specific in that it refers to a particular category but I hope that it will not open the door to attack those people I have referred to, who because of premature retirement found it necessary because of low rates of pension to take up alternative employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  It is important that that point be put on public record because since this debate commenced unease has arisen among people who have given loyal service to the categories I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Labour Party support the main thrust of the Bill on the basis I have outlined.  I believe the intention of our colleagues in the PDs is to correct an anomaly but in so doing we must be careful that we do not raise a number of others.  We should be thinking about <Col N="941" /> correcting a large number of anomalies which apply to those of us who have to work on a full-time basis for the people of our constituencies and of the country and have no business or profession to fall back on but rely exclusively on the salaries we get here to keep ourselves and our families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an opportunity this morning of listening to the Prime Minister of Australia addressing us.  That was a great honour indeed.  One of the things he thought necessary to emphasise was that it was a great honour to address a House of Parliament, especially a House of Parliament elected on a democratic system.  He went on to say that in this wide world there are only about 20 truly democratic parliaments.  It follows that if it is a great honour to be a Member of such a parliament every citizen of the country concerned should have the right to sit in this House subject only to two conditions: (1) that he is prepared to serve the people as an elected parliamentary representative and (2) that he is elected by a constituency provided, of course, that he fulfils the other legal requirements.</P>
      <P>It follows that if a person is to be elected to this House or any other democratic parliament it should be open to every citizen of the State who should not be inhibited or prevented from that through fear that if he were to do so he would suffer a large financial loss.  He should be adequately remunerated.  I have never come across legislation or a controversy that was started and conducted under such a smokescreen or in such apparent ignorance.  Many people in this country believe that Members of this House are drawing Ministers' salaries and Ministers' pensions at the same time. That is widely believed all over the country.</P>

      <P>I will come to that in a minute or two.  I do not intend to be personal, but I have a job to restrain myself and I hope I am not interrupted too much.  The next belief that is held is that this is a pension scheme that was suddenly and recently introduced by the back door, that it was being practised only by modern-day politicians, and that it is an evil that has only now been discovered. People give the impression that if they had known about it sometime earlier they would have killed it.  That is not correct.  As Deputy Anne Colley said, it was here before her time.  It was introduced by an Act in 1938.  I was a politician in 1938, having made my first contribution to the democratic system the previous year.  I remained an unpaid politician from 1938 until 1961 when I entered the House of the Oireachtas with Deputy Molloy and others.  I am not moaning about it but I would like to put on the record that, like many people who came in that way, I spent a great deal of time and a good deal of money in the political machine organising, canvassing and running a political party between 1938 and 1961 when I became a Member of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over that time I have seen very little evidence of wealthy politicians. Some people believe there was an influx of them into the Dáil in the last election. I do not know whether there was, but I have seen very little evidence of wealth accumulated by politicians in that time.  I saw a good deal of evidence of neglected families.  I saw some evidence of destitute wives.  I saw shattered businesses and run down farms, all because people chose to serve in this Dáil and in the democratic system.  It is true, as Deputy Colley said, that this pension scheme was here before her time.  It was introduced in 1938 under the administration of Deputy Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, a man complimented here this morning again by the <Col N="943" /> Prime Minister of Australia.  During all the years that he was there this scheme was availed of by a number of Taoisigh, either when they were in opposition or when they resigned and left the House, and nobody said they did not have the right to take it.  The scheme has been availed of by many Ministers whose parties were thrown out of office or who found themselves out of Ministerial office for other reasons, and nobody blamed them for taking it.  I am not impressed by the fact the Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley have decided to forego their pensions as from 1 January next, I understand. They intend to take Christmas out of it.  I am not impressed by that.  They are two able Deputies.  They were two able Ministers.  They were two men of considerable influence in the Fianna Fáil Party.  They held strong views in the Fianna Fáil Party.  They held views of such strength that they refused Ministerial office in that party rather than serve under a leadership of which they did not approve.  Many people admired them for that, but I cannot believe that during all those years neither of those Deputies was aware of the Ministerial pension scheme.  Both of them drew their pensions.  I would have been far more impressed if these Deputies had fought within the Fianna Fáil Party over this pension scheme or had campaigned to have it revoked and if necessary had withdrawn from the party if they were overruled.</P>
    <P>Many people admire the Progressive Democrats.  People admire them on the grounds that they are honest, or because they bring a breath of fresh air to Irish politics.  However, Deputy O'Malley has gone down considerably in my estimation for seeking votes on this mean little political gimmick.  That is what it is.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned since I came into this House this evening that politicians are not the only people to draw pensions and salaries from the State at the same time.  I emphasise that. Members of the Army draw pensions and salaries in excess of their pension at the same time.  The Garda Síochána also do <Col N="944" /> so.  Any Government profession with such a scheme avails of it and this has been encouraged now by the offer of redundancy.  I cannot help noticing that when this line of argument is mentioned the members of the Progressive Democrats get annoyed and irritable.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats have not included all civil servants in their Bill, or members of the Army and the Garda Síochána.  Why is <Col N="945" /> that?  People do not like politicians.  It has become very popular here to jibe at politicians and attack them without any regard for the fact that such action undermines the democratic system but there is no danger of them attacking the Army, the Garda Síochána or the civil servants, because there are no votes there.  Deputy Molloy is one of the people in whose reaction one can see the greatest resentment when one mentions the Army. There is a big military garrison in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to round off this part of it by saying that it is beyond doubt that this is a political gimmick, an attack on politicians because there are votes in that.  They are steering clear of the Garda barracks and the Army barracks and all the rest.  If the Deputy wants to put down an amendment to the Bill it is very easy, by way of another section, to include all the other people I have been talking about.</P>
      <P>The argument is made that the job of a TD and the job of a Minister are the same job.  That is not so. They are as different as chalk and cheese.  They are different in the type of work they do. They are different in the authority they have.  They are different in the powers they exercise and, above all, they are different in their conditions of employment. There is nothing in the terms of employment of a TD that says he shall not engage in any other work.  He is quite at liberty to engage in any other work he likes and he is not asked how much time he devotes to his political activity and how much time he devotes to his private work.  In the case of a Minister, not alone must he devote his full time and attention to his ministerial duties, which would mean that he would work from nine to five or whatever hours one likes, but he is forbidden, he is not permitted, to engage in any other business even at 10 o'clock at night, even when he has done a day's work as Minister, even on his half day if he has one.  He is precluded from engaging in any other business.  That makes it clear beyond doubt that there is a difference, and a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Progressive Democrats did not even go to the trouble of including people in receipt of other pensions, Government pensions for being TDs. They did not even have a go at Deputy <Col N="947" /> MacGiolla who is in receipt, as I understand it, of a pension paid by electricity consumers all over this country, rich and poor.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney drew attention to the fact that the Constitution might enter into this.  We would not have to go as far as the Constitution. One cannot retrospectively take away from somebody a right that he has led to believe for 20 years he was entitled to enjoy.  I honestly believe that this Bill would not stand up in court if it were passed.  I do not believe it should pass through this House.</P>
      <P>There are many people opposing this Bill. Seeing that they have no objection to Deputies being paid proper salaries and to Ministers getting their proper remuneration, if the Progressive Democrats succeed in withdrawing these pensions, as sure as day follows night there will be a revision of all parliamentary allowances and the net result will be that they will all be substantially increased. That is on record, and now wait and see if I am right or wrong.  Then, I want to know, will Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley refuse to take the increases or will all their colleagues refuse to take them.  I do not think that they will.  They will have their hands out.  The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats have one thing in common as far as these pensions are concerned.  Neither is likely to be drawing any of them or to be bothered with them for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, for two reasons in particular.  First, it is the first Bill which the Progressive Democrats have put before this House in Private Members' time and as such is an important Bill in the development of this party. Secondly, and most importantly, I welcome this opportunity to join in the debate tonight because of the nature of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill is without doubt one of the most important Bills introduced into this House in recent years.  It is also one of the most simple.  It is one of the most important because it deals with and relates to us, the politicians &mdash; not the man in the street, not the Garda, the Army, the teachers or the civil servants, but us politicians.  It is one of the most important because it asks questions of us politicians which must compel us all, as groups and individuals, to consider our position and decide how we want ourselves to develop and to relate to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is one of the most simple and least complicated Bills because it asks that vital question in an extremely uncomplicated and straightforward manner, a manner which can lead to no confusion, no claims, indecision and no excuses.  The question is straightforward and demands a clear and straightforward response.  The success of this Bill will have very significant effects.  On its own it will not radically transform the national bank balances or provide employment for the scandalously high numbers of people who cannot get work.  It will not even do much to reduce the ratio of debt to GNP &mdash; this magical 5 per cent mark. However, it will have significant effects. In purely financial terms, the savings to the Exchequer if this Bill is passed will amount to between £200,000 and £300,000.  That is not a vast sum of money when compared with the figures which roll off bankers' and politicians' lips when discussing our national debt.  Nevertheless, it is not an inconsiderable amount of money.  For instance, it would go a long way towards preserving some of the <Col N="953" /> smaller agencies and services with whose finance this Government have decided to pay off our national debt.  It would go a long way to ensuring that the NSSB would stay open and that the Ombudsman would not have to see his resources dwindling to the present token level. Much more importantly, however, the passing of the Bill will send out a clear signal to the people we politicians lay claim to serve that we are determined not only to clean up the economy but to clean up our own act, too.  Let us be quite clear about it &mdash; there is much cleaning up to be done.</P>
    <P>There is much more at stake in this Bill than mere money, as my colleague, Deputy Colley, has said recently.  It is blatantly obvious to me and, equally I am sure to my 165 colleagues in this House whom I would have thought would be here listening to this debate tonight, that there is growing disillusionment with politicians.  This frightening fact is undeniable, despite the fact that we can gather in little groups and bemoan how we are misunderstood, how the public do not understand the work we have to do and the hours that we have to keep, or whatever. Such bemoaning does nothing for the situation.  The public see, rightly, that politicians have a specific job to do: their job is to govern the country, to ensure that it, and more importantly its people, reach their full potential, that they are able to get the maximum enjoyment and satisfaction out of their lives.  By any of these measures the public can see that the politicians have failed in their job, that they have done a very bad job.  If one is in doubt, one need only look at the unemployment, hardship, homelessness, hunger and poverty all around.  Perhaps people would prefer to look at the rich, the successful emigrating from our shores.  They are happy with their lives; they have the politicians working for them.  Is it any wonder that there is disillusionment, cynicism and bitterness?</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for political reform.  The Bill before us is just one attempt to begin that reform.  We in the Progressive Democrats have made many suggestions and set out proposals as to <Col N="954" /> how this can be achieved.  We have proposed the abolition of the Seanad.  It must now be obvious that despite the grand plans for that House it has become little more than an expensive plaything.  This country cannot afford, on the basis of finance and efficiency, to have two inefficient meeting places when what is needed is one modern, professional body which could provide the services the country needs.</P>
    <P>We have also proposed a sharp reduction in the number of TDs.  The country is obviously not benefiting from the diversity of knowledge and experience which might be expected from 166 people discussing its problems.  The only justification for such a high figure is to provide a messenger service here for the public.  That should not be the task of Dáil Deputies.  Dáil Deputies should be the formulators of national economic and social policy.  We should face up to that task.  We should cut the number of Deputies and ensure they are not used as messenger boys.  Then we could increase both the powers and resources of, for example, the Ombudsman so that people could still have the potential to redress their grievances.  This party have long advocated reducing the number of Ministers of State from 15 to seven.  Having 15 Ministers of State amounts to little more than jobs for the boys and adds to the cynicism which the country has towards politicians.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill has a very close relationship to all these proposals.  It is a significant move to stop the rot in Irish politics, to face up to our own shortcomings and begin to put our House in order.  Politicians are often heard lecturing others on how they want to see this country changed around.  They want to see it become more efficient, less bureaucratic, more modern and more businesslike and they wish to see more value for money.  We must listen to their calls and we must reform ourselves.  That is what this Bill is about.  It is the beginning of what will hopefully be substantial change and reform which will ensure that the House from which this country is governed will improve and will be seen <Col N="955" /> to have improved by the people of the country.  It is vitally important that the people see an improvement in the running of this House and it is vitally important that their faith in the ability and sincerity of politicians be restored once again.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself, is both straightforward and simple.  I must admit I am disappointed that there has not been a consensus of support behind us.  All the Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill seeks to do is to prohibit the payment of pensions under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Acts, 1938 to 1983, and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Office Acts, 1938 to 1983, to the holders of certain offices in the State, notably Deputies, MEPs and serving members of the Judiciary.  This Bill does not propose to forbid the payment of these pensions forever, only while the recipients are still employed in certain offices of the State. It is ludicrous to pay these pensions and it is a sad reflection on the state of our parliamentary institutions.  This is not meant to deny, however, that everything is fine in these institutions.  Sadly, that is not the case and we in the Progressive Democrats are aware of that fact and agree that reforms will have to include the whole area also.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, however, to use this argument as a smokescreen to avoid the issue represented by this Bill.  The issue is simple: should serving Members of the Dáil and other offices collect pensions from a job which they did as a consequence of their role as Deputies?  We hold that they should not and that that is symptomatic of the general degeneration of Irish politics.  This has been allowed to persist for too long and we are convinced that there must be reform in this area immediately.  These same feelings were found time and again among the general public throughout the country by representatives of this and I am sure other parties both during and since the last general election.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am particularly pleased and proud to see that both Deputies Bobby Molloy and Desmond O'Malley <Col N="956" /> had the courage and honesty to follow their convictions and relinquish their ministerial pensions no matter what happens to this Bill.  That cannot have been an easy decision for either of those men. It is a sign of their commitment to reform of this House and to politics in this country that they are prepared to undertake that sacrifice and I applaud them for doing so.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not easy to applaud the reaction of other parties to this Bill. This is all the more disappointing when we consider that this Bill is not controversial or party political; if anything it has a strong moral argument supporting it.  The other parties in this House have reacted to our proposals as if they were some kind of hot potato, juggling it from hand to hand and then throwing it away as quickly as possible.  The parties who have supported the Bill, and we are grateful for their support, have been somewhat less than enthusiastic.  The parties who have decided not to support it have offered weak and irrelevant excuses. Fianna Fáil have tried to portray this Bill as casting dark questions over previous recipients of the pensions.  They also suggested that the pensions system has served this country well for 50 years and, therefore, that we should not alter it. They are very wrong indeed.</P>
    <P>This Bill in no way casts a question mark over the previous recipients of these pensions: it merely asserts that the system is flawed and needs to be changed.  Secondly, I dispute their claim that the present system has served this country well for 50 years.  If anything, I would argue that the system has served only the politicians well.  It has served this country badly and needs to be changed.  Fine Gael, on the other hand, have suggested that the whole matter of ministerial pensions should be taken out of the hands of politicians and given to yet another committee to decide upon.  I was appalled to hear that suggestion and I was even more appalled to hear it was based on the fact that politicians were too close to the issue to be able to make a good decision.  It is precisely because we are so close to this issue that we are able to <Col N="957" /> make a good decision.  Politicians sit in this Chamber or in their offices in Government Buildings and constantly make decisions on matters about which they can only ever hope to have limited knowledge.  While that is unfortunate, it is inevitable that day in and day out we will make decisions which will affect individuals, families and committees.  We make decisions regarding jobs in industries, fishermen at sea, the unemployed, on social welfare from a vantage point of distance.  Now we have the opportunity to make a decision about something on which we know virtually all there is to know but someone has shouted &ldquo;stop, we cannot do anything about this as we know too much about it.&rdquo;  That is unacceptable. If it were not so dithering, it would be funny.</P>

It sets out to perpetuate a feeling within the community that most of us in this House are over-paid, lazy and indifferent.  The fact of the matter is that most of us in here are worse paid than higher executive officers in the public service and work three times as hard, in insecure employment, for that benefit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that I have 20 minutes.  I should say I intend to share some of my time with Deputy Mary Harney who is also in the constituency.  I think Deputies Flood and Seán Walsh will also be participating, partly in the Minister's time.</P>
      <P>I want to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me the opportunity of raising this most important matter on the Adjournment this evening. It concerns the Kiltalown development project in west Tallaght, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to outline briefly to the House what is the situation obtaining in that <Col N="959" /> part of west Tallaght.  This is an area developed almost in its entirety by local authorities.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council went in there, constructed houses over the last ten years and have provided little or nothing else. The unemployment situation obtaining in west Tallaght bears no relationship even to other hard-hit areas.  The appalling truth of the situation is that there is an approximation of some 70 per cent of the people of this area without employment. There is a feeling of hopelessness, of depression that has to be seen to be believed and that can be felt tangibly when one visits the area.  That is a sad prospect to have to contemplate but a remarkable thing occurred there.</P>
    <P>A group of local people from these local authority estates emerged from that situation, came together to form a committee which they call the Kiltalown development project.  They did this for the purpose of helping themselves, of organising employment to utilise the skills of the unemployed who live in that area, from their own resources and knowledge. They came together and approached every available agency.  They approached Dublin County Council, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour, the Environment and Industry and Commerce. They have made remarkable progress on this project.  They have secured a premises from Dublin County Council. I must acknowledge the appreciation that Dublin County Council showed of what was being endeavoured by the people of the area.  They gave voluntarily, without charge, to this project committee the outhouse buildings and stable buildings of the former mansion in the area called Kiltalown House together with a degree of surrounding area so that these could be repaired and sectioned off to provide units where skilled but unemployed people from the area could come in and set up useful productive work for the purposes of coming off the dole.  That was donated to this committee by Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The committee then sought basic assistance to develop the project, to roof <Col N="960" /> these buildings, wall them off, to provide doors and so on.  They did an enormous amount of work.  They have provided drawings and plans.  They provided a whole manifesto, a whole booklet outlining what they were about, covering the areas in which they would work.  They costed their enterprise very carefully and the total estimate was £70,000 &mdash; not £700,000, not the £25 million that Mr. Larry Goodman has had approval for. No, for this project they required merely £70,000.  They sought that funding from all the Government agencies, from Government Ministers, from this Government who one would have thought over the years had such grandiose ideas to help people to do their own thing.</P>

      <P>How was it not done when the Labour Party boys were in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State may hear me out.  This project was devised since the change of Government.  I can assure the Minister of State that the Labour Party, in Government, would have had no difficulty in making £70,000 available for this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications were received from the people of the area, very many from people with ideas of what they would do in these units given the opportunity.  The committee sat down, vetted the applications and ascertained who these people were.  I and some other Deputies representing the constituency have met many of these people who want to set up in these units.  They are remarkable people. I am confident that these people could come off the dole and set up as viable manufactures there.  More than that, many of them have said that they would bring in apprentices, young school leavers, from the area and train them in their skills.  I might mention just a few of the works intended which have been examined carefully by the committee and found to be viable.  For example, one man would set up doing graphics, framing and designs and posters; another man <Col N="961" /> could work with steel; another would manufacture non-ferrous products, another would manufacture ornamental gates and railings and in fact did so for one of the local schools: what a magnificent and fine job he made of them. Another man would make ornamental lamps and lamp standards.  Another would carry out bicycle repairs and engage in electrical works, another in light engineering and components therefor, another would produce an historic newspaper, another would do security and services and another, arts and crafts and picture framing.  These are just a number of the projects found to be viable.</P>
    <P>This is not something that would cost money in the short or medium term.  If provided through one Government agency or Minister &mdash; the £70,000 would take these people off the dole.  That is the object of the exercise.  I do not come here to seek to charge this Government with extra money.  On the contrary, I seek to give these people a chance, through their own efforts, through self-help, to come off the dole and save the State money.  They do not want to be unemployed.  They have researched the market.  They have ascertained that they can sell their wares and products if they are provided with an initial premises and set up there at a nominal rent.  Then, when they get underway, they would hope to pay a more moderate rent &mdash; which they would be capable of doing &mdash; to the committee running this centre.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that if just those 22 viable projects, which have been examined and approved so far, were got off the ground, 140 people would come off the dole in the west Tallaght area &mdash; taking on helpers, apprentices and so on.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, the social welfare payments alone saved would soon surpass the £70,000, which is all it would cost initially.  I sometimes wonder where is our sense in this country when we see native working people who &mdash; without training, education in university or in technical schools &mdash; are prepared to help themselves in one of the most deprived areas of the country.  They had <Col N="962" /> that hope and enthusiasm to come together, devise this project, bring it to Government asking for a miserable £70,000.  The Taoiseach says he will refer it to his Ministers for earnest consideration. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, said it was a positive step and he thought the YEA would fund it.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, said he had no money and could not help.  The Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, said he would arrange for the YEA to put up £13,000 if the other £57,000 was raised locally.  How can one imagine £57,000 being raised in an area of local authority housing where 70 per cent of the people are unemployed and in many cases have no bread on the table?  The mind boggles at that kind of suggestion.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to men like Paddy Gannon and Jim Lovett who are the mainstays of this project and the driving force behind it, with the aid of a very able committee. Why can we not give them a positive response?  I know they are not Japanese, Americans or Germans.  They are just Dublin working people but they are prepared to provide 140 jobs.  How many millions would the IDA be prepared to hand out to Japanese, Germans, Americans or Italians to provide 140 jobs in one of the most depressed areas in the country?  Yet we deny these people.  It is an outrage and a disgrace.  It is a reflection on the Government and on all of us that we cannot help them.</P>
    <P>We had a conference with the IDA in recent days and they seem anxious to help.  They have had land in Tallaght for some ten years which they had hoped to develop.  They are about to spend £50,000 on fencing the land because they have left it in such a disgraceful condition that it has been an eyesore all these years. They have £50,000 to fence their land but they cannot provide £70,000 for a viable project to take 140 local people off the dole.  I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Ger Connolly, for many years and I have great respect and admiration for him.  I do not know if he has been involved in this matter until now but <Col N="963" /> knowing him I hope he will agree that £70,000 is a bargain to provide 140 jobs. I hope he will give to the people of west Tallaght enthusiasm and encouragement and a spark of hope and light.  They themselves have set up and organised this project. I am not looking for political kudos or to score points off anybody.  I am asking purely and simply for hope for the people of west Tallaght.  They have devised this scheme themselves and I am asking the Minister to give them the green light to go ahead.  They will show what can be done.  They will train apprentices and provide a community focus.</P>
    <P>They have magnificant plans for that centre if they are given the chance.  They have people prepared to come in on a voluntary basis to train youngsters and give advice on how to handle bank accounts and to carry on business activities such as buying, selling and marketing. The whole project is fine honed and they have prepared a substantial booklet on it.  How many people could produce such a booklet coming as they do from a depressed area?  The booklet has been circulated to semi-State bodies and Government Departments.  The Minister knows it is right and that it makes sense.  I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing.  Give us these 140 jobs and this miserable £70,000.  Never mind the fencing.  We got on without £50,000 worth of fencing for ten years and we can manage without it for a bit longer.  There is a good deal more I could say but I have agreed to give some of my time to other Deputies representing the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to lend my voice in support of Deputy Taylor and the provision of this much needed enterprise centre in what he has described as a very depressed area.  When people look to this House many of them see in it a political system that is basically unfair and very unjust, particularly to the less well off and under-privileged members of our society. Rarely is a speech made by a Government Minister, particularly in these times of cutbacks, that does not contain a <Col N="964" /> phrase claiming that the Government will look after the interests of the less well off and the disadvantaged.  If we really believe that, these are the very people we should go overboard in trying to help. This case involves people who are unemployed and who want to help themselves. They want some dignity and work.  They do not want to waste away in their homes but want to provide opportunities and to give example.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has referred to the response these people have received from various Government agencies and Departments.  It took them months to get near a Minister.  He told them he thought it was a good idea and looked great. Words are easy but subsequently they were told they would have to raise £57,000 themselves in order to get £13,000 from the State.</P>
      <P>Earlier this evening and last week we were discussing a ministerial pensions Bill.  The introduction of that legislation would save £250,000 each year by stopping the payment of pensions to serving Members of the Oireachtas.  The money saved would enable us to help this group and others like it several times over.  Yet we choose not to do that.  There are many people who have been able to get from Government Departments and the IDA money they could easily have raised in the banks or on the Stock Exchange. They have security and a long economic and business history.  These people have only to make a telephone call, write a letter or come to a meeting and they can get millions.  Recently in Japan I met many of our fine representatives working on behalf of the IDA, trying to find somebody there who would come to this country and establish a business.  Such people can get money very easily but when it comes to our most disadvantaged people we never seem to want to know.  We satisfy ourselves with the tired old rhetoric that they must have a proven record and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people in these areas are turning away from the established political parties because they see in this House and around the country the established political parties kicking them <Col N="965" /> in the teeth and keeping them down constantly? If we really mean business we should show these people that their efforts will be recognised, that they are the kind of people we need to support to build up this country and provide opportunities. They are the kind of people who should get the support of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We all know that even in these difficult times £70,000 is chickenfeed.  Any junior Minister could make a decision any day of the week, without consulting anyone, to approve £70,000.  These people have a premises; they simply want to renovate it.  They have the land and the people, 70 per cent of whom are unemployed.  They live in an area without even basic facilities. Tallaght &mdash; west Tallaght in particular &mdash; was to be the promised land, the great new town in the suburbs of Dublin.  People were supposed to rush there because of all the opportunities and facilities that were to be provided.  What is happening?  We have the IDA spending £50,000 on fencing off their lands while these hard-working people cannot get even £70,000 to put this operation in hand.  It is a disgrace and I hope the Minister will be able to give some hope. If he wants to, he can say that this £70,000 will be made available immediately to these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>From the contributions of the two previous speakers one would inevitably be drawn to the conclusion that no help has been given to this organisation by the State agencies.  I want to put on record that this project has reached the present stage through the involvement of State agencies, and in particular through AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  Over the past two years the Youth Employment Agency employed an enterprise worker whose <Col N="966" /> name, Jim Lovett, has been mentioned already.  He has done tremendous work to develop this project.  AnCO have assisted on numerous occasions by visiting the site and by assisting the promoters in drawing up plans and designs, at the expense of AnCO I might add.  Together, these two agencies have assisted the West Tallaght Community Council in bringing this project to its present stage.</P>
      <P>The project is not without its complications for Dublin County Council, the local authority of which Deputy Harney, Deputy Taylor, Deputy Walsh and I are members, have not yet completed their part.  They have not signed over the lease to this group which I understand from my work with them is a very inhibiting factor in their efforts to raise finance from other organisations that are well disposed to helping west Tallaght financially.  In our role on Dublin County Council the four of us have the job of trying to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion.  I want to pay tribute to the Youth Employment Agency who came out to west Tallaght on several occasions and recently spent a full day working with this group and helping to bring the project to the present stage.</P>
      <P>Of course we look to the Government and the Government agencies for any additional help we can get for west Tallaght. Deputy Taylor mentioned the contribution from the amenity grants which could have been used to help this project, but the amenity grant system has been used very effectively in this parish. Recently he confirmed the funding of a new community centre for which planning permission has been submitted. Through this scheme this area will receive a grant of £50,000.  That scheme has played a role in this parish and I congratulate the Minister because in other areas facing similar difficulties he was forced to change his plans but he kept faith with the people of west Tallaght and they appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues which must be clarified but if the local authorities, Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation, work together with State agencies we <Col N="967" /> can bring this project to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>I support the work of Mr. Lovett and Mr. Gannon.  I support the project fully while appreciating the problems involved.  Deputy Flood has put the record straight about the help received to date.  During my time as chairman of the Belgard Committe of Dublin County Council, we made a house available.  I would be only too happy to provide any support which would bring this project to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make this a political matter, but when I was on the Opposition benches I raised many matters.  I did not hear Deputy Taylor speak very much about west Tallaght during the four and a half years the Coalition were in office and when members of his party, including the Tánaiste were responsible for various Departments.  Possibly he could have done a great deal more for the people of Tallaght at that time.  Nevertheless, I admire the way in which he raised this matter this evening and I fully support that move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister who has an important engagement in Limerick. I understand why this subject has been raised on the Adjournment.  The Government are conscious of the problems facing areas like Tallaght and wish to increase employment in the area.  For the past two years there has been a COMTEC project in Tallaght under the <Col N="968" /> auspices of the Minister for Labour, the purpose of which is to get the community and the State agencies working together in the interests of the local area and to ensure that Tallaght gets its rightful share of the national resources for the unemployed and the under-privileged.  When we took office my Department were very sympathetically disposed towards this area and a grant of £50,000 was given.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that we have a commitment to this area.  I want to assure Deputies that I will ask the Minister for Labour to have a special look at this matter.  I will also ask the IDA and my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to help because I appreciate the way Deputies have put forward their case.  I will be fair and see what I can do. I will take this matter up personally and pursue it with my colleagues and the other agencies.  I will also be asking the officials in various departments to look at this matter as sympathetically as possible.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of organisations and local communities working together and I will do everything I can to help people help themselves.  I am in favour of encouraging such co-operation. I will start working on this matter immediately and I will do everything I can to bring it to a very satisfactory conclusion. These four Deputies have worked very hard for the people in the area and that is appreciated by all.</P>

      <P>One of the main objectives of the Sanitary Services Programme is to prevent and abate water pollution.  Over the last six years, approximately £227 million has been spent on providing new and improved sewage treatment systems as compared with £78 million spent in the previous six years.  This is indicative of the importance and the high priority given to schemes of this kind.  I intend to ensure that such schemes continue to attract the high priority they deserve and that public health considerations are satisfactorily catered for in their design.</P>
      <P>Following the recent review of water quality in our rivers and lakes, I have asked each local authority to identify pollution stretches in their areas and to formulate programmes to deal with them. These programmes will form the basis of future plans to deal effectively with water pollution.</P>

The Tallaght project was not included among those for which fresh allocations were <Col N="824" /> subsequently made.  This decision was inescapable having regard to the following facts:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the estimated cost of the project being planned by Dublin County Council had increased from £2.5 million to some £6.0 million,</P>

      <P>On 28 January, 1987 grants totalling £10 million were allocated to local authorities for county road strengthening on the basis of domestic water charges collected in each area.

Road grant allocations generally were subsequently withdrawn as part of a general review of financial provisions for 1987 made in the context of the budget of 31 March.</P>
      <P>Because of my concern at the decline in the standard of county roads in recent years I increased the original provision for county road strengthening for 1987 by £5 million to £15 million.  The provision of £15 million was allocated on the basis of the county road mileage in each county, which I consider to be a more appropriate basis for the allocation.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the Government's official policy towards emigration.</P>
      <P>The Government regard the current wave of emigration as representing a very serious national loss.  It is a loss both in immediate terms for the family, friends and community of those who chose to emigrate and in the longer term for the country as a whole.  The Government is most concerned at this development and is determined to do all in its power to alleviate the more immediate problems for our emigrants and to remove the basic causes of emigration in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is approaching the most urgent aspects of the problem on three levels.  In the first instance, it is making available through the National Manpower Service, which is responsible for implementing procedures governing the free movement of workers within the European Community and which has offices nationwide, information about <Col N="833" /> working conditions abroad to those who wish to consider emigration as an alternative to seeking work in this country. Such information is geared both to alerting our citizens to problems they may face when they emigrate and to how best they may overcome them.  Those who are considered to be inadequately prepared for conditions abroad are actively discouraged from travelling.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Government has welcomed moves for legislative reform in the United States.  In this context I would remind the Deputy of the visit of the Taoiseach and myself to Washington in March and of my two recent visits to the United States.  During these visits I had extensive discussions with groups in the immigration area and with prominent Irish American politicians.  I am hopeful that the proposals for reform &mdash; in particular the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill &mdash; will be adopted and will help alleviate the problems facing many of our citizens in the United States.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Government is providing active assistance and advice to our emigrants via our diplomatic missions.  I would refer in particular, in this context, to the Dion Committee which is based at our London Embassy and on which Irish immigrant groups in Britain are represented. This Government is providing funding of the order of £250,000 this year for the operation of this committee.</P>
    <P>Very recently I announced measures to improve the services provided by our consulates general in the United States. These involve the organisation of regular meetings of groups interested in the emigration issue, the appointment of an officer of the Consulate General in New York to deal on a full time basis with immigration matters and the extension of the Consulate General's advisory services.</P>
    <P>As far as the longer term is concerned, I would refer to the provisions of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which identifies the &ldquo;intensification of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis&rdquo; as one of its chief priorities. <Col N="834" /> The Government believes that the improved climate brought about by its fiscal and monetary policies which have already achieved significant results will stimulate investment confidence and greater economic activity, maintain existing employment and create new employment. Only when the economy provides jobs for all our citizens who wish to work in this country will we be able to contain emigration and the problems it brings in its train.</P>

The law centres at Aston House and Tallaght are not in a position to take on new clients at present except for emergency cases, for example where there is a risk of violence against a spouse or children.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 18 June 1987, columns 2629-31 of the Official Report, I am aware that due to the present severe constraints on public expenditure, the Legal Aid Board is forced to introduce restrictions from time to time in taking on new clients.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit in respect of a claim from 21 September 1987 to 3 October 1987 at the weekly rate of £42.30, the maximum rate appropriate to a single man.  He also claimed an increase in benefit for a child dependant but due to uncertainty about the composition of the claimant's household, inquiries were necessary to establish the question of his entitlement to an increase for the child.</P>
      <P>The Department is now satisfied that the person concerned is qualified for an increase in respect of the child and an appropriate adjustment cheque has been issued to him.  He was paid the increase at half the normal rate as the child's mother had also been paid an increase for the child at the half rate during the period in question.  Further inquiries are necessary in regard to an earlier claim period, from 17 August 1987 to 29 August 1987, and the person concerned will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>I only recently named the members of An Foras Áiseanna Saothair and they will hold their appointments from 1 January 1988.  In the circumstances it is far too <Col N="848" /> early to indicate the likely staffing requirements of FÁS in 1988.</P>

      <P>The present staffing of Mooncoin girls' national school in County Kilkenny comprises six teachers, for which there are six classrooms including the cookery classroom.  A recent review of pupil numbers attending the school disclosed a trend of falling enrolments. In the circumstances, and because of mounting pressures on my Department's 1988 capital provision and of other competing priorities, it is unlikely that approval to commence work on the proposed extension to the school can be issued in the immediate future.</P>
