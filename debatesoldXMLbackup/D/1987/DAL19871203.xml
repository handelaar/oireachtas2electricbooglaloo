    <P>SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Section 2 of this Act shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months from the commencement of this Act unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Government to adhere to our request to have a review of the operation of section 2 of this Bill after a period of 12 months has elapsed.  Much has been said over the last few days and indeed, on Second Stage, regarding the possibility of having difficulties with the operation of this legislation.  I do not know at this stage what will happen because there are a lot of question marks around a lot of things contained in this Bill.  For that reason it would be wise of us, as a Parliament, to insert this provision so that we can have the opportunity after a period of 12 months to review the Bill's operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that this will work exceptionally well.  If so I will be only too delighted to co-operate and see that the Bill be renewed.  On the other hand it <Col N="708" /> may be that there are difficulties that none of us have foreseen at this point. What we propose would be an extremely worthwhile exercise and I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett, in the name of Fine Gael, is one which is worthy of support.  It would be a desirable feature of the legislation that in the period suggested, 12 months, we would have the opportunity available to this House to review the operation of the legislation.  I do not fully accept the bona fides as to why the Fine Gael Party would like to review it in 12 months time.  I have my suspicions that if they had their way they would dismantle this legislation, brick by brick for all its worth in 12 months' time or less, if they got half the opportunity. Nonetheless the principle is a good one. It is one we should support and it is one which the Government have indicated they will be actively undertaking.  I see no reason, given the way in which this House has contributed to the debate on the whole question of extradition, we should not have the opportunity at the expiration of 12 months to review it.  We have heard some far-fetched suggestions that because one person might challenge the proceedings we could have a situation in 12 months where there would be no extradition at all within this State of persons wanted for crimes abroad.  I do not hold to that view.  In each case it would be up to the individual concerned to challenge the procedures and to carry the consequences of having to wait in custody, or elsewhere, on strict bail until such matters are determined.  Simply because one person challenges the procedures of the Act it does not mean that the Act and its provisions would not be implemented.  A review procedure would be very worthwhile and would involve this House, 12 months down the road, in a debate of similar proportions.  I do not think anyone has suffered from the debate we have had in the last day or two, if anything we have benefited from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted, though somewhat amazed, to see this amendment.  I am even more delighted to understand, as we were given to understand last night, that the Government propose to accept it.  Section 2, as suggested in this amendment, will go out of existence 12 months from the passing of the Act, unless separate resolutions are passed by each House keeping it in existence which, presumably, is not really intended by those who have dreamed this up.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is virtually the Act.  The remainder of the Bill is of no consequence whatever.  Section 1 is only a definition. Section 3 allows the Minister for Justice to make certain rules if and when Britain ratify the convention on extradition which she may or may not do at some time in the future.  Therefore, section 3 may never arise.  Section 4 merely allows for a substitute to exercise the powers of the Attorney General if he is sick or away.  Section 5 means nothing.  It simply means that the Attorney General tells the Government in January how many people were or were not extradited in the previous year, which they probably know anyway.  Section 6 is the short title. Therefore, section 2 is the Bill.  What is proposed here is that, in effect, the Bill should cease to have effect after 12 months.  This Bill was introduced, and this section in particular, to provide safeguards against all kinds of awful situations that were supposed to exist in Britain and Northern Ireland for people who might be extradited from here and tried.  There are difficulties for certain types of people, certain types of crimes. One does not deny that.  There is a certain apprehension in relation to a limited number of crimes, but if these safeguards are needed, why are they needed only for 12 months?  If the situation is as serious and as difficult as we are led to believe, then such safeguards as are brought in should be brought in for all time.  The situation will not change in 12 months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, if one looks at what is likely to happen, it is quite conceivable that <Col N="710" /> nobody will be extradited from here either to Britain or Northern Ireland in the next 12 months for the simple reason that the first person who is brought up under the legislation, as it will be if this Bill is passed, will challenge it.  He will challenge it initially in the District Court; he will then exercise his right to challenge it in the High Court if an extradition order is made against him, where he has 14 days in which to do so.  The High Court will, as they would in cases of this kind, take several months in order to hear the matter, come to a decision and give judgment on it.  It will be a very important case because it will be the first case under this section.  Whoever loses that case will appeal it to the Supreme Court.  One would be something of an optimist to say that all that procedure will be completed and out of the way in 12 months.  Therefore the likelihood is that nobody would actually be extradited under this Bill during 12 months and the Bill, in effect, will fall after that time.</P>
    <P>What safeguard is there in that situation? This underlines that fact that the whole purpose of this Bill is not really to give safeguards to anybody at all.  The whole purpose is to get over the political difficulty the Government have with their own backbenchers and, allied to that, to get over the political difficulty which the Fine Gael Party have in their present state of paralysis and terror that for some reason there might be a general election in the near future.</P>

      <P>The combination of having to get over the problem posed by the 57 backbenchers expressing their views and the difficulties of Fine Gael in party and electoral terms, has led, as often happens in these matters, to an ideal compromise, which is this amendment. It suits both sides.  We are going through the motions of producing legislation which will act as a safeguard.  It actually will not.  It will not arise and will virtually die the death in 12 months time. It will have safeguarded nobody; it will <Col N="711" /> have really no effect; it will have generated during that 12-month period a great deal of litigation, of argument, of heat, but the whole thing will pass away. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as a result of the passing of the Bill with this extraordinary amendment in it, will have got over the difficulties that each of them in their own respective ways face at present.</P>
      <P>It is incredible to bring in a Bill and then for the main Opposition party to propose and the Government to accept an amendment which does away with the Bill, in effect, in 12 months time.  It underlines and proves, if anybody needed proof, the reality of what we are doing here in these three or four days of this debate, that is, getting people over the hump, going through the motions of appearing to be concerned about these matters but doing things which will, in effect and in practice, cause the extradition system out of this country in the next 12 months to collapse in that time. Not having operated for 12 months, it will not be in existence after that.  Is it not extraordinary and unwise if it is proposed to abolish this Bill in effect after 12 months to bring it in at all?  That is a reasonable question.  If these kinds of safeguards are needed, they are needed for all time.  They are not needed for 12 months.</P>

      <P>It is coming out in the open and nailing your colours to the mast rather than going through this charade that is being played out here at present.  In his Second Stage speech last Friday, the Taoiseach gave the figures for the number of extraditions that have taken place from here to Britain and Northern Ireland since the passing of the 1965 Act.  The figure is just short of 900, which is perhaps very much greater than many people might have expected.  I should like to see a breakdown of that figure, because I should think that the number of extraditions in respect of terrorist-type offences, as they are now known, with which we are, ostensibly, primarily dealing here &mdash; although in fact we are covering everything &mdash; would be only about 5 per cent at most of that figure of around 900.  We are entitled to consider the position of the 95 per cent who are extradited or sought to be extradited for things other than terrorist-type offences.  The number is quite significant. The position of people potentially in that difficulty has not been considered at all in the course of this relatively lengthy <Col N="713" /> debate.  If they are to be entitled to safeguards, why is their right to these being abolished after 12 months?</P>
      <P>This amendment is a crucial one.  First, it totally emasculates the Bill and does away with the safeguards which it is supposed to bring in.  More important than just what it does in relation to the legal position under the Bill, it demonstrates the political posturing and attitudes going on here and why there is this meeting of minds for quite different reasons but which just happens to suit both the internal problem in Fianna Fáil and the supervening difficulty of a paralysed fear of an election in Fine Gael.</P>

I do not think the Government have any confidence that it will not.  They virtually agreed last night, in all but saying it formally, that the President should refer this Bill, if it is passed, to the Supreme Court under Article 26 because they have no confidence at all in its constitutionality. If it is not constitutional &mdash; and the Bill, in effect, is section 2 &mdash; the Bill should not be passed.  If we have to compromise just short of not passing section 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Just look at thir statements. Yesterday, Deputy Barrett said that they do not see the need for this legislation.  The Fine Gael Party spokesman on Justice, Deputy Barrett, for whom I have great respect and who I have known for many years, said that they do not see the need for this legislation. Yet they did not vote against it on Second Stage.  That shows the approach of the Fine Gael Party to this matter. They do not want the legislation and they are not interested in safeguards.  As far as they are concerned, if a request comes from Britain they say just send him off and let the British deal with him under their trial systems, such as they are.  That is the position of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the amendment.  That is directly referable to the amendment.  They just want to send him off and say that they do not see any need for this legislation.  That is a fair enough position to take up, but if you do take it up, vote against the Bill.  The amendment which they have tabled is all right as far as it goes.  The matter will die, very likely, after one year.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's position? The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice both made very lengthy speeches in the course of a prolonged Second Stage debate and on Committee Stage they argued with great intensity, force and determination as to how certain they are and how convinced they are that this is the way to deal with the matter, that they have devised with great care, thought and examination using all of the resources available to the Government what they think is the correct and proper approach and the correct procedure in applying safeguards in extradition cases.</P>
      <P>They have proposed this arrangement. They stand over it and argue for it with force, notwithstanding all the probing, the examinations, the votes and the testing. They stand over it with great conviction and force.  It is fair enough that they should do that but if they are that convinced and that sure that this is the correct and proper way, why then do they accept an amendment that will very likely lead to the fall of the Bill, because that is what it would amount to, in 12 months time?  That is a strange response from the Government who have that degree of conviction that they are doing the right thing and have looked at all the possible options on this very difficult and tricky issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have thought that, if that was their position, their response would have been that it is nonsense to suggest, as Fine Gael have done, that the Government have conducted a detailed examination of such an important matter through the Attorney General and all the law officers, and having received the advice and expertise of the Civil Service, that there should be a rehash of this Bill <Col N="716" /> in 12 months time both in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  They should say that they could not accept that because they know they are doing the right thing and they have no doubts about this measure.  I wonder do they have doubts about this measure or any doubts about what they are doing.  Either they have or they have not.</P>
    <P>If they have doubts about it they should not have introduced it and if they have no doubts about it they should not accept the Fine Gael amendment.  Both cannot be right.  An explanation is called for and that is what I mean, a Cheann Comhairle, when I say that there have been antics, gyrations and manipulations behind the scenes of this issue.  An explanation is called for.  We say that safeguards are necessary but not those proposed in this Bill.  If as was signalled, the Government accept this amendment all I can say is that the doubts we have about this Bill are well-founded and the Government have some measure of doubt about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure what Deputy Taylor is getting at.  From the start of this debate I have made it absolutely clear that, as far as the Government are concerned, these new arrangements would be on trial for 12 months.  That is a perfectly sensible approach.  We are satisfied that what we are doing is right and that we are striking the right balance between the rights of the citizen and safeguards, on the one hand, and the workability of extradition on the other.</P>
      <P>It is sensible and right to look at this matter in 12 months time to see exactly how the new arrangements are working and whether we should take a new view of them.  I want to point out to Deputy Taylor that in my Second Stage speech I enunciated that view point very clearly and very specifically.  I said that, if the arrangements are not adhered to, I know the Dáil and the people would expect me to come back and set the arrangements aside.  That is exactly what I said in my Second Stage speech and that is exactly what I am saying now.  That decision on our part applies from both aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, if the arrangements <Col N="717" /> are not working satisfactorily, if there is not scrupulous regard for what is in the legislation and if the arrangements are not operated fairly both in the letter and in the spirit, then this House should look at the arrangements again and take a view of them.  On the other hand, if it transpires that the new arrangement are unnecessarily cumbersome and are not working satisfactorily, we should also have a second look at them.  All of the people I speak to who support what the Government are doing and who support the balance we are trying to achieve are also very anxious that we should give this additional assurance.  We should give an assurance that we will look at the working of the Bill and the arrangements after 12 months to see whether anything more is required, or whether any changes should be made.</P>
    <P>That is directly related to the other proposal in the Bill which has fairly widespread support in the House, that is, that the workings of the new arrangements should be strictly monitored and carefully categorised and that the Government should report to the House on exactly what has happened.  I cannot see how anybody could quarrel with the conjunction of those two principles.  On the one hand, we will monitor the workings of the arrangement and report to the House on them and, if any problems or difficulties arise either on the safeguards side or on the workability side then we will have another look at the matter in this House in 12 months time.  The way to make sure the House looks at it in 12 months time is to do exactly what is proposed in the Fine Gael amendment or an amendment we will put down on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows who has experience of these matters and the way this House works, if there is not such a mandatory provision compelling the House to do something about legislation after a certain period nothing will be done about it.  The fact that we have in this legislation some provision of this kind compels us all in 12 months time to take note of the situation, to look at the <Col N="718" /> arrangements, see if they have been scrupulously adhered to in the spirit and the letter and if they are working satisfactorily in so far as extradition is concerned and on the basis of that take a decision about the legislation.  I cannot see how any honest, democratic parliamentarian can take exception to that proposal.</P>

I suggest to Deputy Barrett and to the House that if this amendment is withdrawn on Committee Stage we will bring forward what I hope will be a satisfactory amendment which will be in line with the principle here but will apply to the whole Act and it will have from our point of view a more satisfactory form of drafting.  The principle is totally unassailable.  Everybody knows that extradition is of fundamental importance from every point of view to civil rights and the protection of our citizens. In my Second Stage speech I said extradition is one of the legal weapons which enables us to fight terrorism.  Therefore, we are making important changes in the legislation and simple, parliamentary common sense would suggest that we do something along the lines suggested in Deputy Barrett's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for accepting the spirit of our amendment. It is quite acceptable to us that this matter be left over to Report Stage.  I would like to deal with one or two comments by previous speakers.  Deputy Taylor was accurate when he said I had said I saw no need for this legislation, but he left out an important part.  I also said I saw there was need for safeguards and the party on whose behalf I am speaking see a need for safeguards.  We said that those safeguards are in place at present by way of an administrative arrangement <Col N="719" /> but we questioned why those safeguards were not operating.  We said also we saw no difficulty about enshrining those safeguards that are there at present in legislation if that is possible.  That, in effect, is being attempted here.</P>
      <P>We disagree and have question marks about the operation of section 2 of this legislation, but it is perfectly reasonable and understandable that on Committee Stage an Opposition party should seek to have a Bill amended.  We have attempted to do that.  We have circulated constructive amendments in order to generate debate on one occasion and on others to have adequate changes made that we regard as essential safeguards.  I am prepared, and I think any reasonable person would be prepared, to accept that there may be a different point of view from the one I hold.  If after 12 months I am proved wrong I hope I will be able to say I was wrong and that it is working well.  On the other hand, we would be quite entitled, if after 12 months we find it has not been working, to say, &ldquo;We told you so.  You should never have proceeded.&rdquo; That is a halfway stand on an issue of this nature and for that reason I am pleased to hear the Taoiseach say he is prepared to accept the spirit of this amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Non-statutory. I know there is another view in the House which would demand statutory safeguards.  I have heard eminent legal people inside and outside the House arguing on the relative merits of those safeguards being vested in the DPP or the Attorney General, an arrangement along the lines of the extradition treaty with the US or a full-blown <i>prima facie</i> provision.  I have not really a strong opinion on the merits or demerits of any of those arrangements but that which makes extradition more difficult would be opposed by our party.</P>
      <P>However, it comes down to this.  If as this Bill operates when it becomes law people who clearly should have been extradited are evading justice that is not satisfactory.  That is why we have put forward this amendment and that is why we are so pleased the Taoiseach has accepted it.  I think none of us with a theory on the effects of these provisions will know whether they will act in the manner in which they are purported to act until the measure has been in operation for some time.  The idea that we will see how it operates and then the Bill will lapse unless reactivated by a positive motion in this House is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some gibing about Fine Gael's position on this against the background of a promised or threatened general election.  It would be very bad for this country if this Dáil was to fall on the matter of extradition.  I am prepared to fight an election any day on unemployment, emigration, the economy and other matters, but the passions that would be released on an election which purported to be about extradition, at least in the early stage of the campaign, would be bad for our country and would <Col N="721" /> have particularly adverse affects on the Anglo-Irish Agreement</P>
    <P>The Extradition Act, 1987, arose out of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Taoiseach who had initially opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement has now come around to working the Anglo-Irish Agreement as best he can.  If the 1987 Act had not come into effect on Monday night, that would have dealt a devastating blow to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and would have undermined the confidence of many people in Northern Ireland in the bona fides of the government in working the Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is a major move towards improving relationships between the two Governments that the Taoiseach decided, somewhat belatedly, that the 1987 Act would come into operation on Monday night and would not be inhibited.  We are now in a position where the Taoiseach and his Government can work for the full implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement over the next 12 months. That would have been questionable if this Act worked in a manner which brought about a situation where people who should clearly be extradited to the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland were evading justice and hiding behind the purported safeguards of this Act.</P>
    <P>If the Act does not inhibit extradition in that way, I think the way is clear for the effective working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which I consider to be so important.  This mechanism, accepted by the Taoiseach, in the Act which will enable this House to allow the Act to lapse if it does not work as it is intended to work is a very effective mechanism for getting over the difficulties which might arise in the next 12 months in the working of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Agreement has done a number of things.  I believe that the Unionist population in Northern Ireland traditionally had two vetos.  First, they had a veto over British policy in Northern Ireland and, secondly, they had a veto by their very existence over the unity of this country. The Anglo-Irish Agreement has removed the first veto and the Taoiseach should now work through the Anglo-Irish <Col N="722" /> Agreement towards a devolved Government in Northern Ireland and a restoration of peace and prosperity in that community.  The second veto remains and it remains by the very existence of the large population in Northern Ireland who do not want to participate in a United Ireland.  That remains the position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think it is worth making these remarks because our attitude to this Bill is influenced in a major way by the possible effect it could have on the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I would like to ask Deputies on my right to appreciate that fact.  The former Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, played a major role in negotiating that Agreement.  The former Attorney General, John Rogers, played a major role in the implementation of the Agreement over the first 12 months of its operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's party had their origins in a large way in the Anglo-Irish Agreement because the significant break with the Taoiseach's party occurred against the background of Anglo-Irish relations.  The issue for us here is far larger than the set of safeguards which the Taoiseach is trying to put into the law on extradition in this country.  We should reflect on what I have said in the House and we should stop the gibing about who is afraid of the electorate and who is not. That is not the issue so far as we are concerned.  I am very glad the Taoiseach has accommodated our views and is taking this amendment on board.</P>

      <P>I want to speak against the section as amended.  I am happy to have the opportunity to do so and, in fact, it is the only opportunity I have had to date to speak on any matters relating to this Bill because unfortunately the time constraints involved are such that it is not possible for Deputies who are interested to make contributions.  There are a number of things I would like to say about this Bill.</P>
      <P>When the Whips met last week to discuss the timing arrangements for the taking of this Bill I sought to have the Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill taken next week because I felt the House would need some time after Second Stage to reflect and consider the kind of amendments that would be appropriate. Deputy Howlin, for the Labour Party, agreed to this but because of the support for the Government proposal by the Fine Gael Party that was not possible. Last night when we sat down to reconsider the arrangements I suggested again that the Report Stage might be put back until next week.  I am sorry we did not agree to that because this morning we have seen already some change of heart by the Government who are prepared after 12 months to allow this section effectively to go out of operation until a motion to the contrary is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we had left the matter until next week perhaps it could have been agreed that the whole Bill could go out of effect and we might have been able to start drafting a more appropriate Bill to meet the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> This section is the fundamental matter involved because it gives specific powers to stop or not to stop the extradition of citizens to Northern Ireland and Britain. There are a number of things I would like to say about this.  The unilateral decision by this country, which is now a party to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to proceed down this road is very dangerous, indeed. That decision in itself has caused enormous problems in Anglo-Irish relations. The comments we have heard from British politicians over the past few days re-enforce my view that irreparable damage has been done to that Agreement.</P>
    <P>We are in a unique position &mdash; a position we were not in until two years ago. We now have an Anglo-Irish framework whereby the Government of this country, representing the people of this country and the Nationalists in Northern Ireland, and the Government of Britain, representing for the time being the majority in Northern Ireland, can sit together in a political structure and work out their differences. It is tragic that safeguards of this kind, or whatever kind, could not have been agreed within that Anglo-Irish forum.  When Deputy Blaney was told the 1987 Extradition Act would wither away he said: &ldquo;In my view we are allowing the Anglo-Irish Agreement, unfortunately to wither away.&rdquo;  Unless the two Governments are prepared to negotiate and discuss with each other through that Anglo-Irish Conference, there is absolutely no point in pretending that we have an Anglo-Irish Agreement that is effective and working.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of this legislation in the circumstances in which it was brought forward and the manner in which it was brought forward and the background against which it came about in the first instance &mdash; the fact that we sought in the first place to try to insult the British Ambassador and implied that he was doing all kinds of strange things &mdash; have all led to difficulties.  It is regrettable that we are now in a situation where things are so bad that we are trying for PR reasons &mdash; and in particular the Fine Gael Party &mdash; to find some way out, hoping <Col N="725" /> that in 12 months time the thing will fade away, that there will be no motion before the House, that people will not bother, just as there was no motion before the House as we ran up to 1 December.</P>
    <P>We all know that 12 months is a long time in politics; six weeks is a long time in politics.  Six weeks ago we would not have thought of considering this Bill; I do not think we would have ratified the 1987 Act but circumstances changed and a lot of people changed their minds.  I have no doubt that circumstances will change again.  If our courts make certain decisions in regard to warrants for extradition under this legislation after tomorrow afternoon people may change their minds again.  We seem to form our attitude to such matters on the basis of one episode or another and I do not think that is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>According to the Fine Gael amendment this section will cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months unless a resolution to the contrary has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In other words, as Deputy O'Malley said, the provisions in the Bill will collapse because they all hinge on that section. The Taoiseach told us that he made it clear last week that that would be the case.  The Taoiseach did not make that clear.  In the course of his contribution the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>This legislation will provide that in future the Attorney General will have a statutory obligation to prepare and submit to the Government an annual report on the operation of extradition arrangements and the cases that have taken place under these arrangements in the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough but the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>I also wish to make it clear that should it emerge after a period of 12 months that these arrangements are not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition is fully justified can evade the law, the Government will bring forward revised proposals to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> To say &ldquo;if the arrangements are not working satisfactorily after 12 months&rdquo; is very different from saying that automatically this provision will go out of operation after 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to it.  The Deputy should quote my speech fully.  I said on either side or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept on either side or the other, that if it is too free and people are being sent forward who should not be extradited or that if it is too restrictive the Taoiseach will bring forward proposals in 12 months but that type of review of legislation is very different from accepting an amendment and writing into the legislation a provision that allows a section to fall and go out of operation in 12 months time.  They are two separate matters.  As a result of the House accepting the Fine Gael amendment we are saying that the Bill stands for 12 months. I am not a lawyer but having spent a week listening to lawyers from all parties I have come to the conclusion that the one thing they have in common is that they all differ.  Fianna Fáil lawyers or lawyers who are members of Fine Gael, Labour or the Progressive Democrats all differ on this issue and that view seems to change from day to day.  However, one thing they all have in common, with the exception of Deputy Kelly, is the belief that this issue will be found by the courts to be unconstitutional. At best some of them feel that its constitutionality is so dubious that they would not put their money either way. Obviously, the person not being extradited will not challenge this issue in the court, he or she will be happy enough, but the person whose extradition is proceeding will challenge the legislation and while that challenge is underway &mdash; it could take 12 months or two years and tie up many people in the litigation process &mdash; there will be no extradition from this country to Britain or Northern Ireland.  As Deputy O'Malley said, if the Bill is found unconstitutional Part III will fall with it because the two are tied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we so crazy in the House that we are prepared to take a chance, to have a <Col N="727" /> period of 12 or 18 months, or even six months, when there will not be effective extradition between this country and Northern Ireland and Britain?  If that is the case is it any wonder that people in Northern Ireland throw untrue allegations at us that hurt.  What can we expect if we are prepared, having heard all the legal advice available to us, to have no extradition from this country to Britain or Northern Ireland for an unspecified period of time?  It is dangerous and irresponsible and it would be wrong of Members to abstain in the vote on this section later on the basis that a trivial amendment will be written into the Bill later on.  Let us not pretend that, on the one hand, we want extradition that is workable and then behind the scenes to write in provisions for PR purposes, so that we can go out and sell them as safeguards or protections.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provision in section 2 about the lapse of time.  That provision states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(bbb) by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of the offence specified in the warrant or the conviction of the person named or described therein of that offence, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to deliver him up under section 47, or&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>However, in accepting the Fine Gael amendment last night a further clause will be added, &ldquo;any other exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (b), line 19, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and other exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What are &ldquo;other exceptional circumstances?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that five or ten years from now the people who were involved in the atrocity in Enniskillen will, by virtue of &ldquo;other exceptional circumstances&rdquo; or the lapse of time be allowed to escape extradition?  More appropriately, will the people who placed the bombs in Dublin in 1974 because the event occurred 13 years ago and because of &ldquo;other exceptional circumstances&rdquo; remain in Northern Ireland or Great Britain?  It is wrong to support an amendment that permits that.  If an atrocity is committed and people are wanted for serious crimes it is not good enough that by virtue of a lapse of time and other exceptional circumstances &mdash; I do not care what they are &mdash; they should be allowed to escape.</P>
      <P>Is the provision being written into the Bill so that we can serve some people in a political way, so that we can say that &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; are okay because an event occurred ten or 15 years ago and they need not worry?  It was highly irresponsible of the House to fail to vote for the Progressive Democrats' amendment to delete that section from the Bill and to make the position worse by adding the Fine Gael proposal.  I fail to understand why a party who seem so committed to the whole principle of extradition, to making it as workable and as easy as possible, should seek to introduce an amendment like amendment No. 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My few friends left in the Fianna Fáil Party tell me that 57 Deputies and Senators spoke about this issue and I understand that most of them did not want the 1987 Act to be implemented on 1 December.  It seems extraordinary how those people can be silenced by this <Col N="729" /> rather irrelevant Bill.  It is either unconstitutional if, as Deputy Birmingham and others say, it is giving certain judicial powers to the Attorney General or it is no safeguard at all if it is merely an administrative matter, as was proposed last year by way of administrative arrangements.  At least then nobody pretended that there were any great safeguards. I wonder how so many people can be silenced by the Bill but what is more extraordinary is that the people who bought the principle on the basis that there were safeguards can remain silent when told it will go out of operation in 12 months time.  Where are they now? Where is Deputy O'Dea and all the other Deputies who were so vociferous over the past few months?  Many of them do not support the idea of extradition &mdash; in some way if you are involved in the cause you should not be extradited.  It is extraordinary that this section which will cease to be in operation 12 months from now &mdash; and that is an amendment proposed by Fine Gael which the Government are quite happy to accept &mdash; should not have any opposition from within the Fianna Fáil Party whose Deputies were responsible for this Bill being introduced.</P>
    <P>This section is the kernel of the Bill. People who believe the Bill is constitutionally dubious, as Deputy Birmingham and others have said, or who believe it is inappropriate that the Attorney General for whatever reason should not be given these powers &mdash; I might add we have been served very well by our Attorney General: it is nothing to do with the people involved, it is to do with the Office &mdash; or people who believe that safeguards are so vital and this is a marvellous safeguard which will go out of operation in 12 months, represent 90 per cent of the Deputies in this House. If all these forces combine, which they are obliged to do if they believe these things, then obviously this section will not stand.  If this section does not stand, there is not much point in having this Bill because all the other sections are either incidental to this section or so accidental to this section that they do not really matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I hope the Opposition parties who have made such a song and dance about giving these powers to the Attorney General in particular &mdash; the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Independents &mdash; will be here in force when we are voting in the next few minutes to defeat this section.  We should not let this go into our legislation.  The responsibility will be on our heads if this section proves to be unworkable, as I believe it will.  It will be unworkable from the point of view of the safeguards and from the extradition point of view.  On both counts we have a responsibility to defeat this section and that is why we are opposing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first <Col N="732" /> opportunity I have had to contribute to this debate.  I have very definite views on two aspects of this Bill.  First, I regard this as a very important Bill.  It is important in this age of rapid travel and, having regard to the particular circumstances of this island, we should have extradition available because nobody wants to have our jurisdiction a haven for serious criminals. Secondly, I believe that there should be adequate safeguards for suspected persons who are threatened with extradition.</P>
      <P>I do not believe section 2 is satisfactory. I do not have very much time at my disposal but I do not think I could summarise the Bill, or this particular section, better than by using the words of an eminent senior counsel, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, who said in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press:</i></P>
      <P>This legislation is experimental but it is worth a try.  If it does not prove satisfactory then something else can be tried.</P>
      <P>That sort of thing is entirely unsatisfactory when we are dealing with something as serious as extradition.</P>
      <P>I do not believe section 2 is satisfactory because I do not accept it is proper to leave the decision whether a person is to be extradited to the Attorney General.  I want to make it perfectly clear that when I am speaking about the Attorney General I am not speaking about an individual. I am speaking about the constitutional Office of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is not, in my opinion, an independent Office. He is appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  Therefore, he is a political appointee, so are judges but they have fixity of tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also stated in Article 30 that the Attorney General shall not be a member of the Government, the Attorney General may at any time resign from the Office by placing his resignation in the hands of the Taoiseach for submission to the President.  The Taoiseach may, for reasons which to him seem sufficient, request the resignation of the Attorney General and if the Attorney General does not give him his resignation, he may <Col N="733" /> then terminate his appointment by advising the President to terminate it.</P>
    <P>We are asking an office holder who is appointed by the Taoiseach of the day, and who can be removed from office by the said Taoiseach without giving any reasons, to perform judicial functions. For the purposes of my argument let us presume that if section 2 is constitutional &mdash; I do not think it is &mdash; then the Attorney General is not a suitable person to ask to adjudicate on this.  I am not referring to any individual holder of that office but if we cannot discuss the office without being accused of being personal, we cannot conduct a reasonable debate in the House.  It is well known &mdash; and has been accepted down through the years &mdash; that unless the holder of Office of Attorney General falls foul of the Government of the day, he is usually offered one of the highest posts in the land, a judgeship, on a permanent basis.  That is something we cannot put out of our minds, I do not have to labour it further.  He is not an independent person, he is a political appointee and it is wrong that the freedom of a person should be in the hands of such a political appointee.</P>
    <P>Maybe it is a case of fools rushing in where angels fear to tread, but I am convinced that the proposal is not constitutional and that it will be held to be unconstitutional to authorise the Attorney General to sift the evidence, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence and to give him the right to issue a direction that a person should not be extradited.  If he does not give any direction, the failure to do so is a finding by him that there is an intention to prosecute and that there is sufficient evidence to warrant that intention.  That is a judicial finding and, in order to make up one's mind whether it is a judicial function, one must bear in mind that three Acts are involved, the 1965 Act which introduced the court proceedings, the 1987 Act which dealt with political offences and the Bill now before the House.  The court must have regard to each and every one of those statutory Acts when considering whether a person is being legally extradited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> One of the most important matters to be decided is whether there is an intention to prosecute and, more important still, whether there is evidence to ground such an intention to prosecute.  Whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant that is the one thing that is being taken away from the courts and handed over to a non-judicial person because, whatever else the Attorney General is, he is not a judge.</P>

      <P>We in The Workers' Party, at the conclusion of the debate on section 2, are very disappointed with the response of the Government to our representations. We sought to advance a case for an improvement in the scheme the Government were advancing.  We made the point that the feature of proceedings in open court with the opportunity of persons to be heard, the important right of a person to argue and to make representations, was absent in their scheme.  We accepted that the vote on that aspect of the debate went against us and our further proposal in regard to a judge of the High Court again with the active duty of intervening in the process &mdash; which has not yet been resolved to our satisfaction &mdash; a judicial person, with the element of independence about which we were so concerned through the debate, was rejected.  For the benefit of Deputy McDowell &mdash; who is not here &mdash; I should like to state that we made all our points and that, although we lost the first round, <Col N="735" /> we still supported the Progressive Democrats. It is a pity that the Progressive Democrats could not discuss the prospect of second preference with us, perhaps in relation to a High Court judge or the notion of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We were prepared to go that distance to see if an agreement could be arrived at in the House because our job here is to try to find at least some common ground on which we can agree.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposed by the Government &mdash; even if our amendments were not successful &mdash; would have been given very serious consideration but what really changed our mind to the extent that we will oppose section 2 was the unbelievable and unholy alliance founded between the Government and Fine Gael. The most sinister move in all this is the proposals embodied in amendment No. 14, to take away from the courts any function whatsoever of review, even of the limited scheme of the Attorney General proposed by the Fianna Fáil Government. The suggestion by the Government that they would give fair consideration to that provision and bring in, in collusion with Fine Gael on Report Stage, something that would accommodate the two parties, is sinister.</P>
      <P>I address myself to those members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were told that the Attorney General's scheme contained an element of safeguard which would be looked at, protected, reviewed and examined by the courts.  Their understanding was that whatever the Attorney General did would be available for discussion, review and comment by the courts when eventually the person sought would be brought there for extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Taoiseach is seeking to do in collusion with Fine Gael is to take out of their scheme, with all its imperfections, any notion of judicial review, any notion of judicial concern about what might not or might be done by the Attorney General.  The Taoiseach is cleverly doing this behind the backs of his own party members who are not here to listen to him.  I am addressing those <Col N="736" /> members now and I urge them to sit down with the Taoiseach before Report Stage and ask him what exactly he is doing in collusion with Fine Gael.  In the view of The Workers' Party they are seeking to set at nought the whole notion that what is being proposed in this Bill will offer any safeguard to persons who might be sought for extradition purposes.  For that reason The Workers' Party are exceptionally concerned and are not prepared to support this section.</P>

      <P>While we in the Labour Party may comment on what appears to be collusion between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in this debate, we differ from The Workers' Party in that we will not let that factor alone affect our decision on this Bill.  We look at the merits of the Bill to see if it will provide what we regard as bottom line safeguards.</P>
      <P>In the long debates taking place here we have tended to overlook the context of what happened on 1 December.  The Extradition Act, 1987, was passed quite a long time ago and its coming into operation was deferred until 1 December 1987.  We should recall why.  That was an unusual circumstance for a particular purpose.  I would refer back to a speech by Deputy Dukes who was then Minister for Justice on 4 December 1986 as reported at column 1379 of the Official Report when he referred to the fact that the coming into operation of the Extradition Bill was being delayed for almost a year and said that this was subject to certain things being done and to certain things happening in that year.  Deputy Dukes said that was why he was leaving open the possibility of the coming into operation of that Act at all.</P>
      <P>One of the things he said was that it would depend on</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> ... seeking measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of underlining the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>At column 1381 Deputy Dukes said:</P>
    <P>What has been achieved or foreshadowed so far in these areas does not measure up to the level envisaged when the Hillsborough communique was issued but the Government are firmly of the view that we can now have a reasonable expectation of satisfactory progress over the next six months.</P>
    <P>We should consider whether these expectations about the British side have come to pass.  They have not.  Therefore, the context in which that delay in the coming into operation of the 1987 Act comes into question.  It is interesting that further on in the same column Deputy Dukes referred to a quote from the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, when he said:</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, was quoted recently as having said that one would have thought that the appropriate way of dealing with this matter would be to postpone legislation on extradition until the necessary progress had been fully achieved.</P>

      <P>True, but it is on the Dáil record.  Extradition depends on trust between two countries.  If there is trust between the two countries all sorts of things may be possible; all sorts of administrative procedures may be possible and very little may be required for extradition. Does that degree of trust exist here as to the administration of justice in <Col N="738" /> the UK and in Northern Ireland?  That is the nub of the matter.  If the answer is yes all sorts of considerations would be possible and procedures would be satisfactory all round, but it is fair to say that that degree of trust does not exist. Consequently, statutory procedures with an adequate degree of safeguard are required.  That requires the sort of set up envisaged by the Labour Party amendment. Our proposal has not been accepted and in those circumstances we will oppose section 2 as amended.</P>

The first and most substantial difference is that we now have the agreement of the House to the fact that this entire Bill will lapse in 12 months time.  We have been concerned lest what are intended as safeguards would represent unrealistic obstacles, perhaps insuperable obstacles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome that and regard it as a major step forward.  In some measure our concerns about the Attorney General have been met in so far as it will now be an offence to make representations and seek to influence the actions of the Attorney General in deciding whether or not to issue a direction. That is a Fine Gael amendment to this section.  We are pleased too that its workability and flexibility has been improved by the willingness of the Government to accept our amendment that the decision by the Attorney General can be revoked if fresh information comes to light.  For those reasons the section is significantly improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take pleasure in the extent to which Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats find it necessary to disagree <Col N="739" /> with each other in this House.  However, the performance of the Progressive Democrats on this issue has been highly irresponsible.  They were a party formed, they said, because of their concern for the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Last year time after time they sought to insert into the Bill provisions which would have made the Bill absolutely unworkable. They did that because they were hijacked by a number of their back-room advisers, some of whom were on an ego trip.  They have maintained that irresponsibility in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>It is with particular regret that I single out for mention the contribution of Deputy Harney, a Deputy for whom I normally have the highest respect.  The remarks made by Deputy Harney with regard to the lapse in time section of this Bill are mischievous.  The danger in them is that they can be picked up elsewhere and misrepresented by people who wish this House, this Government and this legal system no good.  It is not the case, as Deputy Harney suggested, that people who committed attrocities at Enniskillen or in other places will be able to say: &ldquo;I have been at liberty for a number of years; you cannot extradite me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section as it was first introduced required the court to have regard to all of the circumstances, and what circumstances would be more relevant than the gravity of the offence?  The effect of the Fine Gael amendment was to put beyond doubt that a lapse of time alone would not be sufficient to justify the court refusing extradition.  There would have to be some additional factor, some additional extraordinary circumstance, to warrant that.  We welcome the decision of the Government to accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the section, in large measure, reflects a decision of the former Chief Justice, Mr. T.F. O'Higgins, when he dealt with circumstances in which a group of people escaped from the Maze at the same time.  Some were picked up, pre-McGlinchey and, when their extradition was sought, the court said they could not be extradited because the <Col N="740" /> offence was political.  Others were picked up after the McGlinchey case and might otherwise have been extradited.  The court said: it would be unfair to extradite you and to treat some of you differently from the others.  That seems to me to be an eminently reasonable position and one to which I would have thought the section would give effect.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment makes it quite clear that lapse of time, of itself, would not be sufficient.  I regret very much that Deputy Harney should have intervened in the way she did because I cannot but believe that there will be people who will go through these debates and who will find in those remarks, particularly in that intervention, the opportunity for considerable mischief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Birmingham said with regard to the unbelievable, most reckless, statement made by Deputy Harney on the lapse of time safeguard.  It is quite obvious to everybody who listened that she completely misunderstands what is in the section because, if she did understand it, there is no way whatsoever she would have said what she said.  We will probably hear more about that statement.  I fear it will be used against us, that it will be used by those who, for their own reasons, want to belittle what we are trying to do in this House and State in regard to maintaining and improving our security position in the State.  I fear they will try to use it to belittle our efforts in what we are doing under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that again this morning Deputy Desmond O'Malley took it upon himself, the second day in a row, to try to say that the Anglo-Irish Conference is not working.  Nothing is further from the truth.  I thought I had cleared that up totally for Deputy O'Malley yesterday afternoon when I read for him part of a statement made by Mr. Tom King, the <Col N="741" /> Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, during the course of an address he made in Oxford University in recent times.  It is a pity that such recklessness is the order of the day for the Progressive Democrats. I say that with deep regret.  I bear in mind as well an interview given by Deputy Desmond O'Malley, as Leader of that party, on BBC 2 &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; at the beginning of last week when, in casual throw-away remarks that were petulant and petty, he belittled the efforts of this country in doing what this country is committed to do, that is to fight terrorism in every way possible.  I regret that very deeply.  Since that interview I have read reports of what was said.  If Deputy O'Malley's aim is to feature in the British tabloids, then so be it, let him be known for that.</P>
    <P>This section makes provision for four separate matters.  Its principal effect is to provide for a new safeguard in Part III which deals with extradition to Britain and Northern Ireland, under which the Attorney General is empowered to direct that warrants shall not be endorsed for execution in the State.  Briefly, the new procedure which is provided for will &mdash; subject to an exception mentioned later &mdash; mean that each time a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence is submitted to the Garda Commissioner for backing by the British police or the RUC that warrant will be referred to the Attorney General before being endorsed by the Garda Commissioner under section 43 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>In the case of each warrant the Attorney General will consider two matters: first, whether there is a clear intention to prosecute or continue a prosecution for the offence specified in the warrant and, second, whether that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The exception I have mentioned arises <Col N="742" /> where a judicial authority in the relevant jurisdiction has already ordered the person concerned to stand trial following examination of the evidence.  In all cases, apart from those covered by the exceptions to which I have referred, the Attorney General will direct the Garda Commissioner not to endorse a warrant for execution unless he is of opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  Where such a warrant is given no further action will be taken on foot of the warrant in this jurisdiction.  The Attorney General will also have power to revoke a direction. That power will enable him to take account of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>In addition to this change the section also makes provision for a new ground on which the High Court may order the release of a person arrested under Part III of the 1965 Act, under section 52 of that Act.  That would arise where, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to order the delivery up of the person concerned by reason of the lapse of time since the offence was allegedly committed or the person convicted and other exceptional circumstances.  The section provides for certain procedural questions in relation to the proof of certain matters in proceedings.</P>
    <P>Finally, the section provides that the new procedure and amendments referred to will have effect only in respect of warrants which have not been endorsed before the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 7 to 12, to delete subsection (4), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The general provisions contained in section 3 are acceptable and are useful safeguards that should be incorporated in this Bill.  We have no argument with that at all.  Our amendment is really in relation to the procedural business of bringing an order into effect.  Our amendment deals with section 3 (4).  It proposes the passing of a resolution before an order comes into effect.  The Bill as it is drafted is negative in a sense that, as I understand it, has never been utilised or achieved in the history of the Dáil, except once where a motion in the negative sense was brought in and acted upon by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put forward in the best traditions of parliamentary debate which are there to facilitate Opposition involvement in legislation.  That principle has already been accepted by Fine Gael in their amendment No. 16 and by the Government who have agreed that it will be brought in on Report Stage by way of an amendment in the terms that our amendment is now seeking in respect of section 3.  The Taoiseach said that the amendment he would bring in on Report Stage in respect of that section would be <Col N="746" /> in line with the principles in the amendment in the name of Deputy Sean Barrett. The House is agreed that we should be actively involved and concerned with the workings of this important legislation. For that reason I ask the Government to be consistent in their approach and incorporate the same working approach to the orders that may or may not be made by the Minister at any time in respect of section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is exceptionally important. Everyone seems to think that because section 2 is here that is the whole cornerstone of the Bill.  This section allows the Minister with &mdash; and this is important &mdash; such adaptations and modifications as he sees fit, to introduce the rule of specialty and the rule of non-extradition to a third country in relation to a request for extradition between Britain and Ireland. Those are important principles; they should be there in our arrangements with Britain.  The Minister is empowered by the section by order to introduce them in the general terms laid down, with the conditions attached to them or, under Part II of the Bill with regard to our relations with other countries, with such adaptations and modifications as he thinks fit.  It is envisaged that we could have an adapted or modified rule of specialty with regard to Britain or an adapted or modified rule with regard to extradition or non-extradition to third countries. The Minister has a very active function under Part II in relation to both of these rules because he can give consent, in certain circumstances, to the non-applicability of the specialty rule or to the extradition to a third country.  He has an active role not just in the introduction of orders but also in the working of the rules themselves if and when they are introduced.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Dáil be concerned in the modification, adaptation, and workings of these principles in the context of this Bill.  The principle of our involvement as a House has already been underlined by the Taoiseach's remarks in response to amendment No. 16 in the name of Fine Gael.  Despite the plea of Deputy Harney on the last vote to all the <Col N="747" /> other parties in the House to muster their forces in support, the Progressive Democrats were singularly missing, with Deputy McDowell who was here lecturing us last evening not back to support her opposition to section 2.  I ask that this time there would be all-party agreement and that perhaps, without a vote, the Minister would agree to this very simple but very important amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put a question to the Minister on this issue.  In general terms the view of Deputy McCartan that there should be maximum parliamentary involvement is reasonable and I hope the Government will be able to go some way towards meeting it.  My question arises from the remarks made by the Taoiseach on Second Stage when he explained in the course of his speech that there would be some time delay before there is corresponding legislation in Britain and that there will be bilateral arrangements in place in the meantime. He said:</P>
      <P>In addition, until such time as the Minister's order is made, there will be an administrative arrangement with the British authorities, which will ensure that additional charges of a political nature will not be brought after extradition and that the specialty principle will be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My question is really one of language, and relates to the understanding that charges of a political nature will not be brought.  We do not extradite for political offences or offences connected with a political offence, we extradite, by reason of the decisions of our courts and now of the Act that came into force earlier this week, for terrorist offences.  I ask the Minister to clarify in what sense are the words &ldquo;political nature&rdquo; used in that sentence? I specifically want to put the following point.  Let us take the most extreme example we can, let us suppose someone is extradited for the Darkley massacre and that after extradition, information comes to light which would cause the British authorities to want to <Col N="748" /> change the person extradited for, let us say, the Enniskillen atrocity, I want an assurance from the Minister that the reference to political nature would not preclude the additional charges being preferred.  It is only a question of language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to change section 3 (4) of the Bill which deals with the laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas of an order made by the Minister for Justice applying the provisions of the 1965 Act dealing with specialty and re-extradition to Part III cases. As section 3 (4) stands, such an order is subject to a negative resolution passed by either House within 21 days after the order is laid.  The proposed amendment would instead make it necessary that there be an affirmative resolution of both Houses approving of the order before it is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1987 Extradition Act contains two provisions which provide for an affirmative order procedure.  Section 10 of that Act makes an order by the Government applying the provisions of the Act to countries which are not parties to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses. Section 7 of the 1987 Act also makes the making of an order under section 4 of the Extradition Act, 1965, applying Part II of that Act to a country to which it did not apply previously subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses.  In both of those instances the making of the orders in question would involve a major new departure in policy with regard to extradition in so far as it would involve an extension of the scope of the extradition arrangements which had already been approved by the Oireachtas.  The proposal in section 3 of the present Bill is not on the same footing at all.  What is involved here is simply an extension, with necessary modifications, of rules as to specialty and re-extradition which have already been approved by the Oireachtas for Part II cases and whose extension to Part III cases is now being provided for by statute by the Oireachtas.  The provisions <Col N="749" /> on speciality and re-extradition which are contained in Part II are in the form which is generally accepted internationally and that is provided for in the Convention on Extradition.  It would be an excessive exercise of parliamentary control if the making of an order extending these existing statutory provisions in one part of the Act to the other part of the Act were to be made subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>There may be some concern about the extent of the adaptations and modifications which might be considered necessary or expedient by the Minister when making an order under section 3. These adaptations and modifications will have to take account of the differences in terminology between Parts II and III. They would also have to take account of the different documentation which is required to support an extradition request under Parts II and III.  Also under Part III it may be appropriate to provide for a shorter period than 45 days during which a person is immune from prosecution for another offence following his final discharge for the offence for which he was extradited.  The period of 45 days which was referred to in Part II of the 1965 Act is derived from the European Convention on Extradition, whereas for the purposes of a similar provision in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, the corresponding period is seven days. It is adaptations and modifications of this kind that are at issue in section 3 of the Bill.  If we were to depart radically from the provisions of sections 20, 39 etc. of the 1965 Act when making an order under section 3, we would run the serious risk that this would be held by the court to be <i>ultra vires</i>.  In any event, it is not as if section 3 (4) of the Bill as it stands does not allow for parliamentary control.  The procedure is there for a negative resolution being passed if either House is unhappy with the provision made in an order made by the Minister.  I am satisfied that this provides a sufficient safeguard. I do not, therefore propose to accept this amendment.  However, section 3 (4) of the Bill, as it stands, refers merely to 21 days, instead of 21 sitting days and I will <Col N="750" /> bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to change it to refer to 21 sitting days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The Minister shall soon as may be after 1 January, 1989 and in each succeeding year thereafter furnish a written report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the proceeding year of Part III of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief.  Having listened to the contributions made by the Taoiseach and other speakers, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  I believe the amendment is sound in terms of what we are trying to do in the course of this debate.  We are trying to ensure there is <Col N="751" /> accountability in relation to the safeguards we are inserting into the Extradition Act.  I think we have to look beyond the situation that will exist 12 months hence.  A discussion took place this morning on an amendment in the name of Deputy Seán Barrett for a review in 12 months time and the Government took it on board.  I ask the Minister, given the nature of this amendment, to consider it and indicate to the House that he would come back to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amendment, as worded, would be a strengthening of the Bill.  I would be hard pushed to see why the Government would have any fundamental objection to it because throughout the debate on Second and Committee Stages many speakers have referred to the efforts being made to instal safeguards and to ensure that they are such that they will stand the test of time.  We all have various reservations as to the strength, the legality, the constitutionality or otherwise of these safeguards but what is important, irrespective of whether this Bill is tested before the Supreme Court in the coming months &mdash; and I believe it will &mdash; is that we look beyond that, whether we are back in this House seeking to clarify the legislation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he was trying to get the right balance between the efforts of the Government of the day to curb terrorism and to ensure that terrorism is not tolerated either in this island or in neighbouring islands.  It is also part of our responsibility to ensure that this House has the opportunity to review the Act not just after 12 months, because it is reasonable to assume that for the first 12 months of the operation of this Act there will be constant monitoring of the Act and actions taken in the courts for the first 12 months.  Human nature being what it is, it is also reasonable to assure that with the passage of time the vigilance and the interest by the general membership of this House in this Act might not maintain the same level as we will see for the first 12 months.</P>
    <P>We are putting forward amendment <Col N="752" /> No. 18 which would give the House and the Minister for Justice an opportunity to submit a written report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operations of the Act in the preceding year.  That would give this House an opportunity to monitor on a constant and revolving basis the workings of this Act.  There could be an orderly monitoring of the Act rather than motions coming before this House to set aside any aspects of the Act, or otherwise. Throughout the contributions from all sides of this House there has been a great deal of emphasis and stress on providing safeguards and monitoring those safeguards.  Even though there are weaknesses as far as I am concerned in the actual mechanics of supervising or backing of warrants in relation to the Attorney General's office, it now looks likely that the Government will persist and get their way in relation to the mechanics of this Bill irrespective of one's views in relation to that.  Mine are that it is neither adequate nor the best safeguard. I would have wished them to have gone further.  They have obviously made up their minds.</P>
    <P>In relation to the safeguards, minimalist as I feel they are, the fact that they have enormous complexities, weaknesses and difficulties has to be set aside at a certain stage and we must ensure that we are in a position to review and monitor the operations of the Extradition Acts. This amendment is a reasonable one and I ask the Minister to accept it because it would provide both Houses of the Oireachtas with an opportunity to monitor a very serious matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputies who put forward these amendments are all requiring a written report to be made to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended by this Bill. As indicated by the Taoiseach in the course of his speech on Second Stage of the Extradition Bill, the Government fully intend to keep the operation of this legislation under constant review.  If within 12 months of its operation it is proving to be unsatisfactory, for one <Col N="753" /> reason or another, the matter will be brought urgently before the Dáil for consideration as to how it might be remedied. The amendments which are before us in relation to the production of an annual report to the Oireachtas on the operation of this legislation are, to a significant extent, in keeping with the spirit of the Taoiseach's undertaking in this area.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, disposed to accept them in principle but I would ask the indulgence of the proposers to enable us to put together an appropriately worded composite amendment which would meet their wishes in relation to this legislation and be more fully in keeping with the requirements of the legal draftsmen.  I ask, therefore, if the proposer of the amendments would be prepared to withdraw them on the basis of my undertaking to come forward on Report Stage.  I am not prepared to accept amendments Nos. 22 or 23, both of which seek to impose a time limit for consideration by both Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the reports which will be made to them by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 22, in the name of The Workers' Party, I welcome the Minister's indication that he accepts the principles embodied in the three amendments, two in the name of the Labour Party and one in the name of The Workers' Party, the position is that The Workers' Party amendment goes a little further.  I would like clarification from the Minister before we depart from them because one of the features of our amendment is that the report shall be considered by each House of the Oireachtas.  We state in our amendment &ldquo;within 14 sitting days&rdquo;.  I have no objection to that being extended or some other formula being devised that would accommodate the proper workings of this slow, and often unbelievably slow, House but I want clarification from the Minister that he is in agreement with the principle that the Houses at some stage, within a reasonable period, will consider the report of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 in the name of the Labour Party asks that the report be laid <Col N="754" /> on the table of Dáil Éireann.  That does not go far enough.  We are mindful of the report of the Ombudsman which was circulated to the Members a month and a half ago expressing very serious concern about the operation of that office by reason of Government cutbacks, lack of staffing, lack of facilities to the extent that the office of the Ombudsman had become unworkable.  It was unable to meet any of the huge workload imposed on it in the previous 12 months, or there-abouts. Despite many efforts by Members of the House to have the report of the Ombudsman debated, no time was made available either by the Government or the Opposition parties for such a debate.  It is a very limited achievement simply to have a report prepared and laid on the table of the House.  Unless there is a specific rule written in that the House should consider the report we believe it will have very little practical effect.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to have available to us a report on the review and workings of the Bill.  I hope the Minister does not give me the answer which he gave in relation to our last amendment that it amounts to excessive use of parliamentary procedures.  I do not go along with that.  This House is here to be used to the greatest possible extent.  There are many complaints &mdash; and I have often heard them coming from the now empty benches of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; that we do not use the House fully.  We wonder where they are now.  They are probably gone looking for Deputy McDowell to come back and lecture us.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that this is incredibly important legislation.  We are all agreed on the principle that it is important that as a House of Parliament we should be involved in its workability and future.  I am extremely anxious that the report of the Attorney General will not simply be circulated, left sitting on a shelf and available for individual consideration, but will be in this House to be debated within whatever period is appropriately decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a full time TD I welcome the Minister's response.  The Labour Party amendment, No. 19, suffices for what is required here in that if the written report is furnished to the Houses of the Oireachtas there are procedures and Standing Orders in relation to the running of the affairs of this House and urgent matters can be dealt with either by way of bringing in a motion for Private Members' time or by acting under Standing Order No. 30.  There are adequate opportunities.  What is important is that the report be furnished to the Members of the House who will have the opportunity of considering it in detail and be in a position to form judgments.  There is no doubt that there will be many people outside this House who will be very interested in considering the details of the report which will be furnished and a certain length of time would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is obviously not particularly worried in relation to the 14 days, as long as there is a discussion.  I believe that there is ample opportunity under the rules of the House in relation to parties that have rights in this House to have such a discussion.  I can assure Deputy McCartan that that discussion would take place, certainly as far as I am concerned.  The procedures are there and what is important is that the report be furnished and furnished on an annual basis.  That would put an obligation on all persons involved in this procedure and there would be many people, in the Garda Síochána, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, concerned.  The report would be furnished, would be studied in detail and considered by this House.  I am happy <Col N="756" /> with the Minister's acceptance of the general tenor of the amendment and we can at this stage withdraw the amendment and proceed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I take some exception to the case put forward by Deputy McCartan in relation to the compulsory imposition on this House of the consideration of the report. While I am not too experienced with the procedures of the House, I am aware that the method of laying reports before the House, giving the House an option to take them up, is the generally preferred practice of the House.  It succeeds time and again in legislation.  I see no reason for a departure from the preferred practice of the House in any proposed reporting procedure with regard to this Bill.  The House at all times should be governed by democratic motivation.  For the legislators at this stage to tie the hands of the <Col N="757" /> House in relation to a set of circumstances which might prevail in 12 months' time or at any subsequent reporting stage would be detrimental to the democratic basis of this House.  I should like to think that that democratic basis would be preserved by whatever composite amendments the Minister may bring in and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they should incorporate that optional facility the House has always enjoyed.  I am always impressed by the manner in which this House responds to the democratic concerns of the day.  For that purpose, I should think that the Minister is taking a quite adequate and appropriate approach.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind what was said by Deputy Spring and having regard to the fact that the Bill is due to expire after 12 months unless both Houses pass a resolution to the contrary before then, Deputy McCartan, I am sure, will be satisfied to know that there will be an ample chance to have a debate in the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to have that in the first year, depending on what happens on Report Stage.  I consider the annual basis important.  I take the points that are being made but, despite the best procedure and will in the House, let me instance a very important Bill, a report relating to the Ombudsman's Office, which has not been in any way ventilated or discussed in this House since its publication.  That is a cause of concern to The Workers' Party.  It is clearly a very important matter with which this House should be concerned but, because of a disinclination or whatever, the rules and procedures are not adequate for such a <Col N="758" /> matter to be discussed should elements of the Opposition want to discuss it.</P>
      <P>For that reason I would ask the Minister to indicate whether he considers it an important aspect of the principles with which he is agreeable that the House should, in view of the very particular attention we are giving to this whole area of extradition, have ample opportunity to discuss it.  We have all agreed that this is extraordinary legislation, that it is an extraordinarily important area of the law and that it is important that there would be parliamentary involvement as much as possible.  It appears that within 12 months we shall have a major debate on how the Bill has worked within the next 12 months.  Deputy O'Malley made the point earlier that it just does not end there.  It will be, after 12 months, a permanent piece of our legislation.  I would be happy and anxious to see that we would not just have a debate at the end of 12 months, but on an annual basis thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 14, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seek in this first amendment to delete from page 2, line 14 the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; which <Col N="763" /> would in effect force the Attorney General to give a direction for a warrant to be endorsed.  The manner in which this section of the Bill is phrased is such that we have a triple negative so convoluted that it is almost impossible to understand what the Attorney General is supposed to do.  Our amendment seeks to force the Attorney General to give a directive that a warrant shall be endorsed rather than forcing a warrant to be endorsed if the Attorney General does not give such a direction.  In other words, we are seeking to give the Attorney General a positive power in relation to the endorsing of warrants.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment, apart from making more clear what we are trying to do, would be to force the Attorney General to see all such warrants.  No warrant could be endorsed for execution unless the Attorney General had so directed.  He would have to have seen and examined the warrant and the sufficiency of evidence.  I think this is a far more postitve safeguard than what currently exists in the Bill as amended in Committee.  There was a great deal of dispute on Committee Stage of this Bill as to whether the Attorney General is compelled even to see all the warrants. The amendment to that effect proposed by Deputy Blaney last evening was withdrawn because the Government said they would look at it on Report Stage. However, I see no amendment from the Government that would compel the Attorney General to examine all the warrants. The effect of our amendment, if accepted, would be to have to require that where an extradition was to proceed and a warrant was to be endorsed in the extradition of a citizen from this country, the Attorney General would have to have directed that that warrant be endorsed. Therefore, he would obviously have to have examined the sufficiency of evidence. It is a safeguard that currently does not exist in this Bill.  Although the Bill is to go out of date in 12 months' time it is well that we have a Bill, limited and unworkable though it may be, and <Col N="764" /> we should try to improve it now on this Report Stage and make it as practical and positive as possible.  I ask the Government to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  Throughout this debate we have been talking about the fact that a fine line must be drawn and a careful balance must be struck between our anxiety to ensure safeguards and our determination to provide a workable system of extradition.  The effect of this amendment would be to move that line, to shift the balance against effective extradition. In those circumstances it is quite unacceptable to us.</P>
      <P>I have to repeat that I find it extraordinary that a party who have made such play of the fact that they are so committed to the Anglo-Irish process should once again, even at this late stage of the debate, seek to make extradition more difficult.  We have been concerned throughout the debate lest even the quite limited measures that are contemplated should have the effect of impeding effective extradition.  We think we have made some progress in the changes we have secured on the Committee Stage and we are not going to see the ground we have gained set at naught by this amendment. We oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am utterly at a loss to know what Fine Gael are doing in the debate on this Bill, point for point, time and again, unless they have one single objective and that is in no way to cause the slightest suggestion that whatever might happen in this House would interrupt their lazy occupancy of the benches they have lounged about in here since February this year.  Throughout the debate relating to this proposal the Government have made it absolutely clear that in their interpretation of the section as it is, the Attorney General has, will and must have an active role and be involved in every application that comes before the courts.  We asked the Government to consider making an explicit provision in the Bill.  Deputy Blaney withdrew his amendment on the basis <Col N="765" /> that they would look at it.  He has put back his amendment because the Government have not put forward an amendment of theirs that might suit us. The PDs' amendment because of the removal of the single word &ldquo;not&rdquo; will make the matter clear, certainly to my satisfaction.  It will have absolutely no effect beyond satisfying us that what the Government say is there by implication will then with no shadow of doubt be there explicitly.</P>
      <P>What do the people over here say in response to it.  That is something that will not have a lot of effect on the workings of the section as now being interpreted as something that is going to make extradition more difficult and consequently must be opposed.  It is the height of cynicism. I am at a loss to know what twists and turns Fine Gael are going to take in their efforts to see that this Government are not discommoded in any way or dislodged from their current position.</P>
      <P>The debate on this Bill is about safeguards. We are trying to improve measures very correctly brought before this House by the Government to safeguard the position of an innocent person.  We are all appalled by Enniskillen and all the other atrocities and we are all anxious to see that a person who is rightly wanted in another country for a crime he or she may rightly, wrongly, or whatever way, have commited is sent there, but let us address ourselves to what, we are talking about in the Bill, that is, introducing a working system that will safeguard the position of persons who are innocent and deserve the protection of our laws.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael should get off the high horse of law and order and disregard for the position of a person who might innocently be caught up in this procedure and look at what we are trying to do in this House which is to introduce an effective piece of legislation that offers a degree of safeguard. Amendment No. 1 makes no difference, good, bad or the other, on the workings of extradition and ill becomes any member of Fine Gael or anyone in this House to stand up and suggest otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have wished that the institution of the Attorney General would not have been involved in the extradition procedure here.  The House has determined that the Attorney General is to be involved in that procedure and, therefore, it behoves us to make it as clear and as simple an operation as possible.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 do not change the basic thrust of the Bill or any of the basic measures.  They revert the negative-positive situation in such a way that it makes it more obvious, more clear and more straightforward.  The amendments do not change the principle of the measure in any way and consequently we support them.  We suggest for ease of operation of the Bill, such as it is, that these amendments should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very deliberately framed as it is. The purpose is to ensure that the Attorney General need not certify to court if it is not necessary.  We are happy that the Attorney General must see and examine all warrants but need only notify to court if he is of the opinion that it is necessary.  The effect of the amendments would be to remove the obligation that rests on the Attorney General under section 44B as it stands to give a direction where he is not of the opinion that there is a clear intention to proceed and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  The Government consider it vital that there should be a clear statutory duty on the Attorney General to give a direction in every case where he is not of such an opinion.  Furthermore, section 44B as it stands clearly imports a requirement that every warrant which is received by the Garda Commissioner must be referred to the Attorney General.  As the provision stands, if all warrants are not referred to the Attorney General the duty which the section imposes on the Attorney General to give a direction unless he is of opinion etc., would not be fulfilled.  For these reasons I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the reasons the Minister read out and he could say exactly the opposite with the same conviction.  They were not reasons at all.  The Government have to justify the way in which section 44A, 44B and 44C are drafted.  I do not have to justify it and Members of the House do not have to justify it.  The normal procedure is if someone is going to certify something to allow something to happen that is what you say.  You say the Attorney General or anybody else will certify if he is of opinion that such and such is the case. However, for almost devious legal reasons &mdash; I am not necessarily saying in this instance for devious political reasons &mdash; everything is stood on its head.  When I first read this I thought it was a case of double negatives but then I realised that it was not because double negatives would cancel one another out.  This is a case of treble negatives.  The Minister said &ldquo;The Attorney General is required to give a direction when he is not of the opinion ...&rdquo; the obvious thing is to give it when he is of the opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way legislation has always been drafted here and in other countries. It is the way that makes common sense. In legal terms at least, there is some surreptitious kind of semi-hidden reason for putting it in this obscure way and standing normal English and procedure on its head.  That lies in the fact that the Government do not want the certificate to be given out in a case where somebody is brought forward.  They want a non-certificate to exist and they hope in that way to prevent the court reviewing a non-certificate as opposed to a certificate because it is more difficult for either the defendant concerned, or the court to whom he might go, to inquire into the propriety or otherwise of a non-existent thing rather than an existent thing.  That problem could be got over very simply by taking out the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and turning it around and saying &ldquo;The Attorney General will give a certificate if he is of opinion ...&rdquo;.  The consequential word is that it may be given &ldquo;if&rdquo; rather than shall be given &ldquo;unless&rdquo; because the word <Col N="768" />&ldquo;unless&rdquo; is, of course, the third part of the negative.</P>
    <P>I read this many times before I understood what was going on here.  It was very difficult to see what, in the name of God, was going on.  It is a warped way of doing things.  It is done to try to bring across the administrative aspect of this as opposed to the judicial aspect in order to cod people into thinking that the examination of this matter by the Attorney General is not a judicial act.</P>
    <P>I think I can say with confidence that the courts will always look, in the case of convoluted drafting of this kind, at what is the real intention.  They are not going to be put off by the words being turned around backwards and everything being done backwards.  They are going to look at what is the real intention.  They will construe this as if it were properly drafted rather than drafted in this treble negative fashion, and they will assess what its real significance is in terms of judicial or administrative activity.  I do not think the Government really achieve anything by turning everything around on its head in the strange peculiar way that they do.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said in support of what is here could equally be said if he left out the negatives and changed them to positives in favour of the ordinary commonsense way of doing things.  He made absolutely no argument whatever that it should be this way.  If he were going to argue why it is this way and why he wants to keep it this way, he would have said: &ldquo;We want to try to conceal the real meaning of what we are at, we want to make it administrative, we are insisting on administrative actions and we are staying away from the judicial domain.&rdquo;  This is the basic dilemma the Government have in this regard in this Bill.  If, as they say, it is only administrative and it is, therefore, a kind of rubber stamp arrangement, there is no safeguard in it. On the other hand, if there is a safeguard it has to be a judicial determination.  If it is a judicial determination, as the Government well know, they are in all kinds of difficulties because it will be queried very heavily constitutionally.</P>
    <P>Putting it the way Deputy Harney and <Col N="769" /> I propose it is the normal way.  What the Minister is doing is abnormal and ridiculous.  Putting it our way puts an obligation on the Attorney General to look at the warrant.  It puts an obligation on the Garda authorities, and others, who wish to execute it to submit it to him. If it is drafted the way I suggest, with the words &ldquo;not&rdquo; and &ldquo;unless&rdquo; deleted it has to be given to him because he has to positively give a certificate or a direction but in the way the Minister has drafted this provision it does not have to be given to him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Deputy Kelly argue that it would be flying in the face of what is intended and might in itself be unconstitutional if in any case it was not submitted to him, but who is ever going to know?  If the Government want the Attorney General, as they claim, to look at these why not put in a provision that he has to look at them?  He is under no obligation to look at them and the Garda authorities are under no obligation to submit them to him.  There is a presumption in section 44C that not alone was this direction not given but that it was not required to be given.  In other words, there is a presumption that has to be rebutted by the defendant that the Attorney General was not even required to look at it and give a direction.</P>
    <P>That is ridiculous and I am afraid that the courts will have to spend a lot of time and words asking why this almost perverted form of drafting is in the Bill. That problem would be overcome by two very simple amendments: taking the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; out of section 44A and the word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; out of section 44B.  We would be back to normal if those negatives were taken out.  I do not think anybody can complain about that.  It makes commonsense and ensures that the safeguard <Col N="770" /> will operate.  The Attorney General will have to look at all warrants because they cannot be endorsed unless he has approved of their endorsement, rather than having it as it is now when nobody need ever know whether the case was submitted to him and when there is no statutory obligation on the Commissioner, or anybody else, to submit it to him.  That is farcical if the whole thing is being brought in as a safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that if Deputy O'Malley's argument about this is correct &mdash; it is true that the Bill does not specifically require this in words, though the implication is clear enough &mdash; and there is no necessity to give the Attorney General an opportunity to look at one of these warrants, the same seems to be true of the Minister who is referred to in section 44 (1) of the 1965 Act.  I agree that it is hard to deal with these three different measures abreast.  Section 44 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A warrant shall not be endorsed for execution under this part if the Minister or the High Court, on the question being referred to the court by the Minister, directs....</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything which requires that the warrant should ever be submitted to a Minister.  If the argument is that it is possible to leave the Attorney General out of the case altogether and, so to speak, hoodwink him into thinking there is no such thing as a warrant travelling around the place, it equally applies to the Minister.  If there is an imperfection in regard to the Attorney General in the Bill, it equally applies to the Minister.</P>

      <P>With regard to community and comprehensive schools the total 1988 non-pay budget for these schools represents an increase on the 1987 allocation. It represents a decrease on the 1987 allocation for vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The 1988 figures for vocational schools can, however, be subject to alteration depending on the level of own resources which VECs can generate in 1988 and also on the credit-deficit position as at 31 December 1987.  The latter position will not be known until after 31 January 1988 at which stage the VECs are obliged to furnish their 1987 annual accounts to the Department.  Any credits are taken into account in finalising the non-pay allocations for VECs in 1988 and it is intended to issue budgets to VECs early in 1988 after the 1987 out-turn figures are available to the Department.</P>

      <P>The non-pay provision for the running of community and comprehensive schools for 1988 totals £4.555 million which represents an increase of £55,000 on the 1987 provision. It will arise in both ways, with an increased <i>per capita</i> student population within the community and comprehensive schools.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to do so but with regard to community and comprehensive schools there is still a considerable amount of detailed analysis of individual schools requirement in the preparation of the budgets, which will be completed as soon as possible.  It is my wish and, indeed, the wish of my Department that we would be able to allocate individual budgets to VECs, community and comprehensive schools prior to the end of the year.  However, I do not know if we can do that because, particularly with regard to VECs, we are awaiting the out-turn for each city and county VEC. They have a final date by which they must submit that to the Department and individual VEC allocations will depend on that.  The fact that the Book of Estimates has been printed earlier will, no doubt, enable us to give these allocations to the schools and committees much earlier than heretofore.</P>

      <P>The cost of heating national schools is one of the expenses which the capitation grant is intended to cover.  Boards of management are required to supplement the State grant as necessary with funds from local sources, equal to at least 25 per cent of the State grant.</P>

    <P>The level of heating is dealt with in departmental Circular 21/79, which was issued in 1979 following discussions with <Col N="776" /> management and teacher representatives.

In relation to the Minister's statement that no school has indicated to her that there are difficulties as to the level of heating, is it not a fact that representative organisations in the vocational sector have asked her to specify the minimum levels of heat and that she said that it was a matter for the individual boards?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information but I think that that matter will be left to individual boards of management to decide.  It would be difficult to say to each of the 3,400 primary schools what portion of their capitation grant should be devoted to heating, because it would depend on the size of the school, the type of heating in the school and the size of the classrooms and so on.  The boards of management would have freedom in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education is she will amend legislation to enable third level grants to be recouped to local authorities in the same years that they are paid to applicants, as the delay is causing financial difficulties for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, do not preclude recoupment of moneys to local authorities in the same year that they are paid to applicants. Accordingly, amending legislation as suggested by the Deputy would not be required to give effect to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the higher education grants scheme in 1968, however, payments have been made to the local authorities on the basis of recouping them as early as possible in the following year for the previous financial year's expenditure on higher education grants.</P>
      <P>To move to a current year basis of recoupment would require a 100 per cent increase in the first year in the provision of higher education grants.  In view of existing resource constraints I am not at present in a position to fund such an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely aware that all local authorities are strapped for cash and to expect them to carry an added burden of, in our case in Kildare, £350,000 per year is hardly fair, <Col N="779" /> seeing that they are only acting as agents for the Department of Education and that the Minister and the Government probably have some means available to them to raise these funds.  All it would need would be for the Government to double the money for one year and then pay within the year the grants paid by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a most desirable way to do it but to do so at one fell swoop would require a 100 per cent sum in one year in a once off allocation. The pressures and constraints on Exchequer resources mean that this proposal and other proposals with significant expenditure implications would be difficult to implement.  Clause 7 of the higher education grant scheme provides that grants payable by local authorities shall be issued to students as early as possible in each term of the academic year.  Prompt payment of higher education grants to eligible students is a matter for the local authorities who are statutorily entrusted with administering the scheme.  I am sympathetic to what Deputy Power is saying because all of us who have been involved in local authorities know of the pressures with regard to this issue.  We are faced with the dilemma, if we take up that proposal, of the need to find in one year the 100 per cent necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>To get over the one fell swoop difficulty, seeing that the grants are usually paid in two instalments, will the Minister consider that she, too, might allow herself a two year programme of action to catch up on the arrears, and phase the process in over a two or three year period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As a compromise might the Minister reimburse the local authorities the full cost of administering <Col N="780" /> the scheme and the cost of serving the debt they entered into in order to administer the scheme?  This would not require raising £100 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department have dealt with an application from the authorities of St. John's Girls' national school, Ballybrack, County Dublin for a grant towards the cost of certain improvements to the school building, which comprises eight classrooms and a general purposes area.  The structure is a system-built one, dating from the seventies.  Following complaints about the condition of the building the school was authorised on 27 February last to engage an engineer to report on the structure.  The conclusions of the engineer, a copy of whose report was furnished to my Department, were that the building was in reasonably sound condition but that certain improvements were required.  Following consultation with their own professional advisers, my Department on 17 November last sanctioned a grant towards the cost of <Col N="781" /> carrying out works to the roof and panelling of the school building.  A grant had earlier been sanctioned towards the cost of improvements which the school authorities themselves had carried out by way of interim measures while the main investigations were in hands.  It is understood that preparations are now in hands locally to have the work the subject of the later grant carried out.</P>
      <P>I am unable to comment on the Deputy's reference to the manner of treatment of the school authorities and the local clergy.

While the Minister might say that Circular 20/87 did not specifically give instructions to walking principals that they had to go back teaching, the obvious thing was going to be that walking principals would have to go back teaching or otherwise posts could be suppressed.

We realise it is located in a severely disadvantaged area and my Department are most anxious to proceed with the construction of the school.

Is the Minister aware of the serious noise hazard on that side of Parnell Square and of the serious fire hazard that existed in that old building where some years ago part of the upper floor of the building next door collapsed along with some of the school?

For 1988 it is intended to organise a similar type of promotion.  Consideration is being given at present to the most suitable time for such a promotion.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question Deputy, but I am prepared to speak on it.  In Ireland, the compulsory age for starting school is six.  The pupils have the right to come to school from the age of four years, and more than half of the pupils in that age category come to school.  The answer to the question you <Col N="801" /> asked on whether I can guarantee the school entry age is, no.  In this world I cannot guarantee anything, but I am of the opinion that raising the school entry age, without at the same time providing for statutory pre-school education as is the case in Europe, would be difficult. However I might add that the primary school arrangements whereby four year olds may go to school is ideal and very suitable.  The Deputy has asked for a guarantee which I cannot give.  I would be less than honest if I were to do so.  All matters relating to education are constantly under review, as are all other Government Departments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education in view of the new guidelines for class sizes announced on 26 November 1987 and the deferring of any implementation of Circular 20/87 until September 1988 the reduction in savings at primary level estimated to follow from these changes; and the way in which she intends to find the shortfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Circular 20/87 announced changes to the arrangements governing the staffing of national schools which provided that posts would be discontinued from 31 December 1987 where schools did not comply with the criteria set out in the new schedules governing the retention of staff for the four consecutive quarters ending on 31 December 1987.  Under the terms of the Rules for National Schools, eligible teachers whose posts are discontinued in such cases may opt for <Col N="802" /> inclusion on a diocesan or other approved panel to enable them to secure appointment to alternative posts in national schools, and they continue to serve with pay in their original schools while awaiting redeployment.  As the bulk of vacancies in schools occur when teachers leave at the end of the school year, the measures announced in the circular were costed on the basis that teachers on the panel would not be redeployed to other schools until September 1988 and that there would be no major impact on the staffing of schools until the end of the 1978-88 school year.  Accordingly, deferring the implementation of the circular until after June 1988 does not materially affect the calculations in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
      <P>I have announced the establishment of a Primary Quota Review Committee which will examine cases where particular difficulties are caused by the implementation of the circular.  It may emerge following the recommendations of this committee that in cases certain posts may be retained which would otherwise be discontinued, and that as a result an element of the savings anticipated in 1988 may not be realised.  However it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the work of the committee by attempting to quantify in advance the likely number of such posts and the cost of retaining them in schools.</P>

      <P>My final question is divided into two small parts.  (1) I want to ask the Minister if she will now include the National Parents' Council in any review of the primary system or in any quota review committee, both of which have been announced in recent days by the Minister?  (2) I wish to ask whether the Minister considers it a sound educational policy to have decisions about class sizes being made on an arbitrary basis with the assistance of representation from political parties, instead of the normal scheduled arrangements where schools know exactly where they stand?</P>

With regard to the second part of the question on political parties, the only circular which has issued to schools is Circular 20/87, which will be deferred until the end of June.  As my earlier answer to Deputy Hussey made plain, the savings or the amounts of money to be so found under that heading in the primary school sector were already dependant upon very minimal changes coming in before the start of the school year in September 1988.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the question I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 26 November concerning the guidelines for the implementation of Circular 20/87.  The Statement is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, in my Estimates speech on Education in the Dáil on 22 October last I spoke of the need to bring all second level schools on to the one pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Hussey, when she was Minister, asked vocational education committees to move between the pupil-teacher ratio bands of 17 and 19 and to reach the band of 19 as quickly as they could within an allocated timescale.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Guidelines for the Implementation of Circular 20/87.</P>
      <P>Primary Quota Review Committee</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, wishes to confirm that she is engaged in carrying out a major review of the primary school sector of education, including the establishment of a Primary Quota Review Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the committee will be <Col N="806" /> to see how, within the limits of expenditure laid down in the 1988 Book of Estimates, the best possible arrangement can be made in the deployment of teachers, the size of classes and the organisation of our primary schools generally. In particular, the committee will concentrate on any difficulties which may arise in certain schools following the issue of Circular 20/87 where the implementation of the circular would create unacceptably large classes.</P>
    <P>Two representatives of the School Managers' Association and two representatives from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation will be invited to act on the committee, together with two officials from the Department.</P>
    <P>Guidelines</P>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of the committee, to act under the following guidelines: (1) problems will be examined on a school by school and class by class basis; (2) the average class size will be in the low thirties.  The maximum size of any class will not exceed forty.  Where, because of exceptional circumstances, it is impossible to adhere to this limit, the permission of the review committee and the Minister would be required; (3) the effects on schools of population changes will be taken into account; (4) special consideration will be given to schools in disadvantaged areas; (5) special consideration will be given to the remedial needs of schools; (6) existing remedial posts will not be affected by the changes under Circular 20/87, nor will special posts in disadvantaged areas; and (7) class sizes must be appropriate to the actual size of the classroom.  Sanction for the retention of teaching posts will rest with the Minister.</P>
    <P>General</P>
    <P>The principal teachers will be expected under the general direction of the board of management to reorganise class sizes. Individual classes should not in any circumstances be substantially larger than the average in the school.</P>
    <P>In order to give the review committee an adequate opportunity to carry out a thorough examination, no changes under <Col N="807" /> Circular 20/87 will take place before the end of the school year June 1988.</P>
    <P>The voluntary redundancy-early retirement circular setting out the conditions under which teachers may opt for voluntary redundancy will issue within a few days.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Education</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on education is estimated at £1,184 million in 1988.  Of this, £420 million relates to primary education. Over 80 per cent of expenditure is on pay and pensions.</P>
    <P>Any costs which may arise from the work of the Quota Review Committee will be compensated for within the limits laid down in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware and agrees with the fact that her Department have always considered vocational schools to be a very special case, because of the kind of work they do.  I would like to ask the Minister, in view of her statement that it would be a good thing to have all second level schools at the same pupil-teacher ratio, what proportion of secondary schools offer senior engineering, building construction, mechanical drawing as part of their work with second level students?  A very small number of these schools do so; therefore it is impossible for the vocational schools to operate under this new pupil-teacher ratio without dropping some of these subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the answer to hand but I gave it in my speech on the Estimates in October and I am willing to furnish it to the Deputy.  I am conscious that one has to be precise but I do remember at the time being quite amazed and quite pleased that the number of secondary schools offering building construction, civil engineering, home economics, technical drawing and woodwork &mdash; all of the practical subjects &mdash; had greatly increased.  In many instances there were as many secondary schools offering these subjects as there were vocational schools.  It is a great <Col N="808" /> measure of the sense of maturity of both sectors of post primary education that the vocational schools are now offering the full range of practical and academic subjects. In a similar vein the secondary schools, in many instances, are offering a full range of the practical as well as the academic subjects.  The precise information for which the Deputy has asked I have, but not with me, and I will furnish it to her.</P>

If so, in what manner has she communicated her decision?  Has it been conveyed to schools by way of an official circular carrying with it the stamp of the Department of Education, or has the news been brought to different schools by way of personal letter from the local Fianna Fáil TD who happens to be in <Col N="809" /> that constituency?

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;directs&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;; all such warrants shall be forwarded to the Attorney General in the first instance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to read into the record how the section if amended would read:</P>
      <P>44A.&mdash;A warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence under the law of a place in relation to which this Part applies shall not be endorsed for execution under this Part if the Attorney General so directs; all such warrants shall be forwarded to the Attorney General in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> I withdrew this amendment on Committee Stage after the Minister had indicated that he was disposed to accept it and to provide for the amendment on Report Stage.  As it turns out it does not appear, on examination, that it has any appeal for the Minister and no words have been added that would approximate to the words in the amendment.  I am rather surprised but not all that disappointed &mdash; or should I put it the other way; disappointed but not all that surprised &mdash; because I have a feeling, and I think it is the feeling of many Members who participated in this debate over the past few days, that the more vaguely the Attorney General is identified in this judicial role &mdash; which undoubtedly it is, because on his opinion will depend whether a person may or may not be extradited &mdash; the better from the Minister's point of view.</P>
    <P>I fear that the grand coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had some words on this matter since last night, or they may have had words earlier, and reckoned that vagueness is a necessary part of this performance under the name of a Bill which will become an Act.  The Bill we are discussing will become an Act in whatever words are agreed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  On this the last possible occasion to have a word in the ear of the House, and in particular the Government, may I say that the performance in regard to the whole matter of extradition, including the coming into force of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, at midnight last Monday is nothing but a charade, that has been staged in this House for whose benefit I am not quite sure.  If anybody is fooled into thinking that what is contained in the Bill is an alleviation of or is in substitution for the betrayal of allowing the 1987 Act to come into force, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned they will have a rude awakening the first time they offer themselves to the country.  It is extraordinary that the offer was made that if any part of this Bill was defeated, or the Bill itself was defeated, there would be an election. What purpose that was intended to serve, <Col N="847" /> I do not know.  It was made once and not pursued, nor was it confirmed by the Taoiseach when I politely asked him to confirm the commitment that he would go to the country if any part of the Bill was beaten.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it was not necessary because the passage of the Bill was fully assured before we came to discuss it in this charade that we are going through. It would not be beaten because the grand alliance, the grand coalition, the covert coalition of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, has ensured that there can be no majority for anything other than what they have agreed.  It could be laughable but it is so serious that one cannot laugh at it.  We must remember that this time last year Fianna Fáil were very concerned about the measure the then Government were putting through, namely, the 1987 Act.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, since it is being held by the Government, the Minister and by other speakers, indeed, that all warrants will go to the Attorney General, if that is so, though not stated clearly in any part of this Bill or in the Act of 1965, why the reluctance to put it into the Bill?  Is there any harm that can be done in making it clear that warrants must in the first instance go to the Attorney General and not be relying upon what might be precedents, practice, convention, or the expected thing to be done?  If Fine Gael can extricate themselves from the grand coalition, perhaps they might muster <Col N="848" /> enough support today to put this harmless amendment through, unless it is deliberately being kept out to maintain the vagueness that surrounds the whole performance of the Attorney General, lest naming him, identifying him, giving him an absolute role of law from this House would endanger still further the constitutionality of a Bill which undoubtedly is extremely shaky, to say the least, without being any expert on the matter.</P>
      <P>Accept it if you will, but at the end of the day I shall be voting against it, or if there is not a vote I shall be recording my dissent from this Bill, part of a charade, which is handing over our people to the jurisdiction of the Six Counties and Great Britain where they cannot and will not get a fair trial.  I defy anybody in this House to prove otherwise on the record of those institutions, particularly over the past 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the names of Deputies Blaney and Gregory, as I did on Committee Stage.  I do so in the belief that the Government have indicated all along that their interpretation of the Bill &mdash; and they look to Deputy Kelly of the Fine Gael side as the source of their inspiration in regard to that view &mdash; is that the Bill by implication requires an active involvement by the Attorney General.  That being so, as the point has been made to them, what is wrong with allaying the reservations of those of us in this section of the House by simply writing it in and saying that what we say is there by strong implication is there explicitly by the acceptance of this amendment?  We certainly understood from the comments of the Minister on Committee Stage that he was inclined to meet us on this matter and to look at it at this stage.  Nothing that the Minister has put down by way of amendment on Report Stage indicates that he is inclined to co-operate at this point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position can be gleaned from the response of the Government to amendment No. 1 which was advanced here. The Government in collusion with Fine Gael want, as much as possible, to keep <Col N="849" /> a degree of vagueness in the legislation, and more particularly want to not actively involve the Attorney General as far as is practicably possible.  When the suggestion was put forward to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; as suggested in amendment No. 1 so that the Attorney General had to make a certification in respect of each application, the Minister's response was to keep the Attorney General out as much as possible and not involve him where it was not necessary.</P>
    <P>If one brings that line of thinking further, then I presume that it will give us the basis upon which the Government will now tell us that they are not prepared to support Deputy Blaney's amendment because not to support the amendment is to leave the Bill in the position where many of us draw the implication, or make the deduction, that there is nothing that positively lays an obligation on the commissioner of the Garda Síochána or any other person to consult with or to divert the warrants to the Office of the Attorney General.  There is nothing in the Bill that makes it obligatory or incumbent upon the Attorney General to seek out such warrants and make his views on them known.  The way the presumptions are structured in the Bill, when the person and the warrant appear in the District Court and there is no endorsement upon it, the presumptions work to presume that there is no necessity for consultation with, or action from, the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In the course of what, I suppose, was about the best that Deputy Cooney of the Fine Gael Party could do to try to mirror or mimic the erudite remarks of his colleague, Deputy Kelly, on Committee Stage, it appears that on listening to the comments being made by some Deputies in the House at that time he began to get worried on this point.  We can recall the question across the floor from that Deputy asking the Government to tell us how and where.  By the time the Minister had the opportunity to reply, the Deputy had remarkably found something in section 43 of the 1965 Act that might have helped him.  Before we knew it, the Minister had taken on board the upside <Col N="850" /> down view of Deputy Cooney as the answer to the issue later in the debate.  If it is not collusion, there is a certain degree of tennis playing going on between the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael sides.</P>

They have argued all along that the section by strong implication requires the active, constant involvement of the Attorney General but, for some reason or other, they are not prepared to make a very simple declaration to that effect as proposed in this amendment.  I must pursue some of the reasons for this, to try to understand the deviousness involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is important from the point of view of The Workers' Party.  I want again to make the point that I made over a half an hour of The Workers' Party time previously.  This point is perhaps the most important, most crucial measure outstanding in the short time of one hour that is left to us to decide ultimately on this legislation which will <Col N="851" /> be part of our law for however long.  This is probably the one most worrying point left outstanding in the minds, certainly, of The Workers' Party.  I have no doubt the same applies with regard to Deputy Blaney and I am sure many other Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to dwell on this because strong indications were given to us by the Government on Committee Stage that they would give it fair consideration.  We have not yet heard from the Minister, so in putting down what otherwise is a very sensible amendment we have to anticipate and glean from what has gone before as to what type of response we are going to get.  The spurious explanation given by Deputy Cooney in that there was something in section 43 of the 1965 Act which could help us was one of the reasons advanced but there is nothing in that section which would suggest that the Attorney General must or should be involved in the process of considering warrants as and from the passing of this Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Government say everything is so definite, what is wrong in doing nothing more than clearing up any residue of doubt which may be in peoples' minds about it by inserting a simple line of explicit declaration, as included in this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated yesterday that we would look again at the substance of the amendment to see if any useful purpose would be served by providing specifically that warrants be submitted to the Attorney General.  I indicated in my contribution yesterday the reasons we believe the existing statutory framework of Part III adequately deals with the point raised in the amendment and having considered the matter again I remain convinced that section 2, when read with section 63 of the 1965 Act, will require the Garda Commissioner to refer all warrants covered by the Bill to the Attorney General before any such warrant is endorsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, during the course of my contribution <Col N="852" /> on Second Stage I said that the section requires that all warrants should be submitted by the Garda Commissioner to the Attorney General for his consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed sections 44A and 44B, which section 2 inserts into the 1965 Act, have been carefully drafted to ensure that the Attorney General will be required to form an opinion one way or the other in the case of all warrants to which the Bill relates.  Section 44A says that such a warrant shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs and section 44B says that &ldquo;a direction of the Attorney General ... shall be given unless the Attorney General... is of opinion&rdquo;.  This clearly places the Attorney General under a duty to form an opinion in relation to each warrant under the Bill.  It is only if he is of opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute that he is entitled to decide not to give a direction.</P>
      <P>To enable the Attorney General to fulfil this duty it will be necessary for the Garda Commissioner to refer every warrant covered by the Bill to the Attorney General.  The Garda Commissioner of course will be obliged to do this in view of his clear statutory requirements on the matter.  The duty of the commissioner under section 43 of the 1965 Act to endorse a warrant is subject to the provisions of Part III of that Act and the new sections 44A and 44B will be included in Part III.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel uncomfortable when I listen to talk about making extradition <Col N="855" /> more difficult or more easy and of putting obstacles in the way of extradition.  With respect that is the wrong approach to take on this issue.  Extradition is appropriate in certain circumstances where we know that the correct person is being extradited, where we know he will get a fair trial and where we know that reasonable basic safeguards would be provided.  That ought to be the thrust of the House in securing the best possible measure towards that end.</P>
      <P>So far as this amendment is concerned I disagree with the views expressed by my colleague, Deputy McCartan, as regards the requirement or obligation to have all warrants referred to the Attorney General. Having studied the Bill with great care I initially took the view, although others may disagree with me and they obviously do, even before I heard it confirmed in the Minister's speech on Second Stage, that there was an obligation to have all warrants referred to the Attorney General.  Perhaps, it is an arguable point but having said that, and having regard to the fact that that point has been conceded and agreed to, not once but many times, both by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, as there appears to be some doubt in peoples' minds and because it is not clear either in the 1965 Act or in the new Bill &mdash; although it is fairly well clear in my view that that is a requirement &mdash; for the life of me I cannot understand the objection at this stage, when we are still at the formative process of this Bill, to making the matter clear beyond any reasonable doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what was required was a new Bill, to start off a whole legislative process, I might say it was not worth the ticket or the effort but because we are at the formative stage and have the chance to make the matter clear beyond yea or nay through the addition of a few miserable words into the Bill on what we all agree is or ought to be the position, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice what are we arguing about, have we not agreed that that is to be the position?  If it is 95 per cent clear anyway that that is <Col N="856" /> the position, and I say that it is, so what? For the sake of the extra 5 per cent and in the interests of sheer clarity, just to confirm doubly for no extra effort, why not simply let us do it and agree to it beyond yea or nay?</P>

      <P>The Bill envisages that every application for extradition will find its way to the Attorney General. Equally, and in this I disagree with Deputy Barrett, Deputy McCartan is right.  There is no statutory obligation for every warrant to find its way to the Attorney General's office.  I welcome that.  Consistently throughout this debate I have taken the position that I want nothing included that would represent an unreasonable impediment to extradition. <Col N="857" /> It is not appropriate that a person whose extradition is sought should be in a position to assert that there had been a failure to comply with a statutory requirement to provide a warrant.  I agree with Deputy McCartan that there is obligation to send this to the Attorney General but, unlike Deputy McCartan, I take comfort from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say as one of the few lay people left in this Chamber other than perhaps the Press Gallery, I become more confused the longer I stay.  Deputy McCartan, who is a lawyer of one kind, a solicitor, Deputy Birmingham who is a barrister and Deputy McDowell who is a barrister all tell us it is not obvious that these warrants would have to go before the Attorney General.  If there is so much doubt among the legal profession, those who will be representing people whose extradition is sought and defending their cases and so on, then surely it is reasonable, as Deputy Taylor said, that we should make it clear and write this amendment into the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the reason it is not necessary to write it in is that you do not write in what is not necessary.  It seems to me you do not write the obvious into legislation.  All kinds of jargon and legal words that mean very little to the ordinary lay person and sometimes have very little effect on ordinary people's lives, including people who come before the courts, are all written in in long, glorified paragraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody is being extradited and the Attorney General under the provisions of this Bill has not stopped that person's extradition it may well be that he has not seen the warrant, it has not come before him.  I understand there is no provision in this legislation to summon the Attorney General or have the Attorney General brought to court to explain whether he has seen the warant or has examined the evidence and established whether there is a sufficient case.  The ordinary citizen who may well be the subject of extradition proceedings under these provisions might never know whether his warrant <Col N="858" /> and case were examined at all by the Attorney General.  This legislation has been sold to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party as a great safeguard. When they hear this debate and realise that the Attorney General may not see all the warrants and may not have to see all the warrants they may wonder whether this is a safeguard.</P>
    <P>This legislation will go out of law 12 months from now unless we pass resolutions of the House.  It is unlikely that we will do so because the storm will be over and some other problem will occupy our simple minds.  Fine Gael had agreed to this procedure and the Government seem quite happy to accept that in 12 months time this legislation will go out and there will be no need for safeguards or whatever.  It is extraordinary when we are trying today to bring in the final Stages of this Bill that we would not write into it a provision that would require the Attorney General to see all the warrants, given the doubt that has arisen among the legal people in this House.  Three of them say they believe the Attorney Genral does not have to see all the warrants. Surely that is unusual.  Three people from three different parties, all of who are practitioners of the law, each of who believes the Attorney General does not have to see the warrants, surely are sufficient for the Taoiseach and the Government to recognise what would appear to be a very obvious defect in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that it will not in any way hinder the Bill if the intention is that the Attorney General should see all the warrants?  Will it not help the case, expedite our proceedings and make people a little happier if the Atorney General will have to examine all the warrants and establish there is sufficient case?  Deputy Taylor makes his suggestion believing that the Attorney General will see all the warrants but he accepts that, given the doubt, it is much better to write the provision into the Bill so that this doubt exists no longer.</P>

      <P>We are having this debate on extradition in the Dáil this <Col N="859" /> week not because of the need for safeguards to be introduced at this time.  If safeguards are needed surely they were needed 22 years ago in 1965 when the Extradition Act was brought in to cover so-called ordinary criminals.  Non-legal persons can have great difficulty in comprehending what is going on here this week.  I believe everybody should be equal in the eyes of the law, but apparently we have one set of legal rules and regulations for so-called ordinary criminals who have been extradited from this country in the past 22 years without too much fuss or too many debates in this House about them while they were fitted up with evidence from the police force and elsewhere.  Police forces have been known to fit up people with evidence when they had difficulty in proving cases. I have not read too many books or newspaper articles about those people who are extradited.  Is there one set of laws for people who are accused of being terrorists &mdash; and are terrorists who plant bombs and perhaps shoot people &mdash; and another set of rules for ordinary people who are criminals?  Surely they are Irish citizens too.  Surely we should be worried about such people.  As a social democrat I would find it very repugnant to have one set of rules for so-called terrorists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There seems to be one set of rules for the other speakers in this House and a set for me as well.  I listened to rubbish for the past three days about everything under the sun.  It had no relevance to the debate and it was allowed to continue.  I am addressing my remarks very much to the point of this debate and my time is being spent on this silly argument, so far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>As I said my role as a public representative of socialists would be diminished if there was a miscarriage of justice in this country or anywhere else. Unfortunately, there are miscarriages of justice in Britain and Ireland every day of the week but we do not get too worked up here about them.  As everybody knows justice in Ireland is far from being impeccable. If it is a case that safeguards are needed in this respect for suspected political terrorists, surely they became necessary when the Supreme Court effectively changed the rules of the game by redefining the meaning of the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; or at least when Dominic McGlinchey was extradited with the speed of light some time back.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that now. Surely I am allowed to give some background information on the Bill.  I do not know what you are getting so upset about if my time is only four minutes.  I want to pick up where I left off.  Such a need should have been obvious to the Dáil last year when it approved of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. What has happened since those events to make the present rush for safeguards so necessary?  Has there been a wave of extraditions widely regarded as dubious, spurious or unwarranted?  No. What has happened is that Fianna Fáil have tied themselves in a knot with a so-called rebellion, carefully fostered by their leaders, which went wrong for reasons outside their control.  Fianna Fáil are now working their way out of this difficulty and in essence that is what this debate is all about.  Not for the first time Fine Gael have allowed Fianna Fáil to set the terms of the debate and by allowing the Second Stage of the Bill to go through on Tuesday they have gone along with the charade and humbug being played out in the Dáil this week.</P>
      <P>I am especially opposed to the section of the Bill which we are now talking about which makes each individual extradition a political issue because of the powers given to the Attorney General.  I would have preferred to let the European Convention operate for a while before reviewing it and then to have considered whether or not safeguards were needed and, if so, what kind of safeguards.  I would have preferred that approach.  This Bill is principally concerned with internal Fianna Fáil politics and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have strong reservations about the <Col N="862" /> role proposed for the Attorney General as it is wrong in principle.  To consider its practical consequences in politics I have only to imagine Fianna Fáil in Opposition when it suits their representatives to wrap a green flag around themselves when the Attorney General of another party endorses the extradition of some Republican terrorist.  By allowing the Second Stage through, however, the main Opposition party would appear to have had their bluff called effectively by the Taoiseach. The plethora of safeguards proposed in the Dáil this week &mdash; apart from the fact that they lend credibility to a bogus piece of Fianna Fáil politicking &mdash; represent in this context a pointless game of political musical chairs.</P>

When this amendment and the other amendments that are left are disposed of we will have reached the conclusion of the Bill.  It will be well on its way to becoming an Act, subject to signature by the President and the silence of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that by prognosis some weeks ago this business was designed for a purpose.  This Bill is a two-legged offering.  Extradition in all its various forms is one leg.  I am so confused that I do not really know what the Bill is all about and I do not think the people who put it before us really believe they know what it is about.  I challenge the assertion that the drafting of the Bill was carefully done.  Perhaps it was very carefully <Col N="864" /> done but I have heard it said that it was been very badly done.  Perhaps that was deliberate.  On top of that I wonder if the Attorney General advised in favour of the Bill in the form that it was drafted. I suggest that it has not really got the hallmark of an Attorney General of note, such as the present Attorney General is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A direction of the Attorney General under this section may be revoked by the Attorney General at any time if he becomes of the opinion referred to in section 44B.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments arise from an amendment in the name of Deputy Seán Barrett made yesterday on Committee Stage. That amendment was intended to enable the Attorney General to revoke a direction made under the proposed section 44A.  In accepting the amendment yesterday the Taoiseach indicated that he saw considerable merit in the proposal and had no difficulty with it in principle. The amendment was accepted subject to further consideration of the text.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is being substituted for the amendment made yesterday.  The principle is exactly the same in that it allows the Attorney General to revoke a direction that may have been given under section 44A.  It may happen that the Attorney General would give a direction under that section but that subsequently circumstances would change.  More information might become available, for example, and the Attorney General would then be in a position to form the opinion required by section 44B, that is, that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that that intention is founded on sufficient evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment has been redrafted to follow the existing text of section 2 more closely.  We also believe that the provision is most appropriate to section 44A rather than being included by way of a new subsection to section 2. Amendments Nos. 6 and 8 arise from amendment No. 3.  In making provision for the Attorney General to revoke a direction previously given, it is also desirable that the provisions of the proposal for the proposed new section 44C and the proposed new subsection (3) of section <Col N="867" /> 55 which deal with proof in court proceedings of matters related to the giving of directions are also applied to the revocation or direction.  That is the purpose and effect of these amendments.</P>

      <P>We are pleased the Government accepted our amendment on Committee Stage and we have no trouble in accepting the amendments submitted on Report Stage.  It is wise that this course was taken because it will save a lot of trouble in the future if the Attorney General is in the position where he will not be endorsing a warrant because of a lack of information which subsequently might come to hand.  Without this amendment the original warrant would be rendered useless and we would have to go through the whole process again.  For that reason, we have no problem supporting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the thrust of the amendment and what it implies to be unsatisfactory and somewhat dangerous. A warrant arrives in this country to extradite a person to the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland and certain information, documents and evidence are provided. They are examined by the Attorney General so that he can form an opinion within the provisions of section 44A, B, C and D.  That is the position the Bill adopts.  It is not the greatest, but we are faced with it.  As I said, the Attorney General examines the material and has before him a request to extradite the person concerned.  Having conducted his examination, he may come to the conclusion that there is no case for him to extradite this person.  Therefore, he gives a direction that the warrant is not to be backed.  That is clear and understandable. In my opinion that should be the end of the matter as far as that warrant is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a claiming country seeks to extradite a person and sends a warrant, documents and evidence, either what they are sending is adequate or it is not.  If the Attorney General, the officer on whom the Government rely to give a fair, reasonable and adequate decision and to be a <Col N="868" /> safeguard, decides that the material is not adequate, he must refuse to extradite that person.  What the Minister is saying in this amendment is that the matter can be put in abeyance indefinitely.  I see no time limit set here.  The warrant could be held for a year or a few years.  Is there any time limit?  I do not see one.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, for all anybody would know &mdash; I do not say it would happen but people might suspect that it would &mdash; there could be communications between the Irish and British Attorneys General. The Irish Attorney General might say if more information were sent he would see things through for him.  There could be all kinds of behind the scenes, surreptitious exchanges of material going on.  It could be quite an appreciable period from the time the warrant arrives until eventually the Attorney General changes his mind and accepts that additional material had been gleaned to put the matter in order. Justice should not be carried out in that way.  The courts or judges do not operate in that way; cases are prepared, you go into court and the case is decided.  If a person is found not guilty the prosecution do not try to get more evidence which would bring the person back into court. If he is acquitted, that is it.</P>
    <P>It may be that additional material may be acquired &mdash; that is understandable and I do not object to it &mdash; but that is a matter for a new warrant.  If they are going on a new set of circumstances and if new material comes to hand from the prosecuting authorities in the UK let them send a fresh warrant based on new material.  Let them do it in an efficient, proper manner, something at which they have not excelled up to now from what one reads.  If they want to extradite people they will have to do these things very carefully and in a proper manner. To have it continued on an indefinite basis is not reasonable, just or equitable.</P>

      <P>Section 3 is a perfectly reasonable provision but I should like to remind Deputy Cowen that the Minister is introducing a completely new element here which I am sure will not find favour with Deputy Cowen.  It will now be openended so that the warrant will stay with the commissioner or the Irish Attorney General awaiting the gleaning of further material.  If what they send from the UK is not adequate they should send the warrant back to the Attorney General over there telling him that it does not warrant extraditing the person.  They should also tell him that if he wishes to resubmit later, he should prepare a fresh warrant for examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In matters relating to criminal or quasi-criminal cases two principles should apply.  There should be certainty of proceedings and finality to proceedings.  They are two of the time honoured fundamentals which we seek in all matters relating to the liberty of a person.  It is quite clear from amendment No. 12 tabled in the name of the Minister, accepting the principle of non-interference with the Attorney General and non-proper communication to the Office of the Attorney General in relation to these matters, that the Government concede a situation where a person will be aware that his or her liberty is under discussion at that level.  There will not always be an element of surprise, that the first the person will know about these procedures is when the officer comes with a warrant to bring him or her before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remembering that we are legislating for the innocent person who may be caught up in all these proceedings should be the guiding position from which we work.  We should not lose sight of what we are talking about here simply because atrocities are committed and because we want to make sure that the terrorist responsible lands in the court of another jurisdiction at all costs.  We all want these <Col N="870" /> people to stand trial and to be punished accordingly but the way we approach the whole question of criminal law is that it is better to let the innocent go than to catch them unnecessarily in the net of our investigations.  That is the whole point that has been underscored time and time again by our Supreme Court in interpreting the constitutional requirements of our laws, to ensure that an innocent person is not unnecessarily caught up in it.  It is not a satisfactory arrangement that our law is left in a situation where a citizen or otherwise of this country is sitting in their home wondering when the Attorney General will make a decision, when the matter will draw to a conclusion so that the person can get on with the ordinary course of life knowing that, for the time being, the matter has been determined. For that reason, the law requires in these matters certainty and finality but this amendment denies both and this legislation should be opposed.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan said we must be concerned to legislate to protect the innocent and that is undoubtedly correct.  We must be concerned, too, to legislate for those Irish citizens whose lives, liberty and bodily integrity is put at risk.  In respect of those Irish citizens &mdash; in many cases who have been the victims of a campaign of genocide &mdash; we have a constitutional obligation to do everything practical to vindicate their lives and liberty. One of the ways in which we do that is by seeing there is in place an effective system of extradition which will operate against those who seek to murder, maim or kidnap them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is involved here is a simple amendment which is designed to ensure that the process of extradition runs smoothly. Deputy McCartan spoke about the fact that in criminal law there should be certainty and finality.  Of course, when it comes to a final adjudication that is so but what we are concerned about here is not even a preliminary investigation but a procedure that will take place even before the question of criminal investigation arises and <Col N="871" /> before the judicial screening that takes place in our court arises.  In those circumstances, it would be quite ridiculous to suggest that if information comes to hand while the matter is being considered by the Attorney General everyone should have to go back to the beginning.  That would make absolutely no sense.  What is involved here is the introduction of an element additional to what has worked perfectly satisfactorily since 1965.  If it is the case that an Attorney General, having first formed the view that there was not sufficient evidence, is then provided with additional evidence which leads him to believe that extradition should proceed, the extradition should proceed as expeditiously as possible and there should be no obligation to start the entire process again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment comes ill from the Minister at a stage after he had refused to countenance an amendment which I had already tabled dealing with the evidence which would be available to the Attorney General at the time of his coming to the opinion to direct the endorsement of a warrant, that was that such evidence is in existence at the date the Attorney General forms such an opinion.  I was fobbed off by the Minister on the basis that no other evidence would be considered except what he had on hands.  The amendment was rejected on that spurious ground and now the reverse is coming in, to the effect that once the warrant is there and if there is insufficient evidence on which to form an opinion then if any evidence becomes available at any time thereafter the same warrant <Col N="872" /> can be operated again and again.  This is a time bomb in so far as any suspect is concerned and can only be regarded as an effort to further harass, hassle and intimidate citizens of our country who have gone through the process of being sent for under our extradition laws by our lords and masters across the Channel. Even though they had not produced enough evidence at that time, the Attorney General can change his mind thereafter and activate the very thing he had directed should not be activated on a previous occasion.  It is scandalous and it is a telling example of the kowtowing, craven, creeping manner in which we are laying ourselves at the feet of Maggie Thatcher and company at this time.</P>

      <P>The evidence Deputy Blaney is talking about is evidence prior to the endorsement of the warrant.  The point I made on Second Stage and on Committee Stage is that that warrant has no validity in this jurisdiction until it is endorsed by the Garda Commissioner. All pre-endorsements of warrants should be accommodated if the Attorney General is to exercise his statutory functions properly as intended by the legislation before us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Griffin has given me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of aid to the Third World under the UNICEF Emergency Fund.  May I suggest that the Deputy be given eight minutes to make his case and the Minister four minutes to reply?  That is the best we can do in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me this opportunity, on my fifth request, to raise the subject matter of my Private Notice Question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the grave warning contained in the UNICEF Report published recently, if aid is to be effective, it must start immediately and continue unabated for 12 months; and in order to avoid death and the mass migration of starving peoples, especially in Ethiopia, if the Minister would now inform the House if it is his intention to make <Col N="876" /> an immediate response to the UNICEF Emergency Fund; furthermore, whether he would impress on his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the absolute need to restore to 1986 levels the grant-in-aid to the World Food Programme.</P>
    <P>That is the subject matter of the debate on the Adjournment.  I regret that it has taken so long to bring it to this House because it is a very urgent and critical area.  Reports have emanated from Ethiopia where, we are reliably informed, as we speak people are dying and there are six million people in need of urgent assistance, one million of whom are children. I regret that there has been a reduction in the ODA assistance in the Estimates for 1988.  There has been a reduction of £11 million, from £43 million to £32 million and this has affected in particular the disaster area fund and the world food programme which gives aid to Ethiopia. I hope the Minister present will bring to the notice of the Cabinet and necessity and the need to restore these two funds, at least to their 1986 levels.</P>
    <P>Recently we received a report from the representatives of UNICEF in Ethiopia and they asked us to impress on the Government and on the people of Ireland the absolute need for immediate action. Every day people are dying of starvation and any delay whatsoever will cause untold hardship and death.  There is nothing more urgent than a dying Ethiopian mother with a babe at her breast. That is real urgency.  As I have said, I regret that it took so long to bring this matter to the House.  Nevertheless I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring it to the attention of the Minister, the Government and the Irish people.  The Irish people have continually responded very favourably and charitably to the needs of the Third World.</P>
    <P>Three years ago Bob Geldof organised a fund to which the Irish people contributed £7 million.  More recently, in Trócaire's lenten appeal this year, people contributed another £2.8 million.  The Government have the moral backing and support of the Irish people in this matter. <Col N="877" /> Perhaps it is a throw-back to our own historical past and famine days that strikes a sympathetic and charitable chord in the Irish subconsciousness that they wish to give to the deserving poor of the Third World.</P>
    <P>In a poll conducted last year 83 per cent of the Irish people indicated that, despite our own economic position, recession and difficulties, they would still like the Government to continue to give, and to increase if possible, aid to the Third World.  That is the main thrust of my purpose this evening &mdash; to urge immediate action on this matter.  I hope that, if there are any moneys left in the 1987 Estimates, from no matter what Vote or section in the International Co-operation Vote, the Minister will see to it that it is immediately transferred to aid for Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>We have been told that on account of the drought and the civil war in that country innocent people are in a terrible plight and are living in terrible conditions. I urge the Minister to convey to the Cabinet the absolute necessity of ensuring that funds are made available to the many relief agencies working in Ethiopia, from Trócaire to UNICEF and many other splendid bodies.  He will have the satisfaction of knowing he is doing so with the full support of the Irish people who have contributed to that cause down through the years.  Various personnel go to that country as teachers, religious people of all denominations and lay volunteers. Not only are they prepared to give money but they are also prepared to give their lives working for this cause, to alleviate famine and to bring help to those in need.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I hope the response from the Minister will be a positive one and that we will see action immediately put in train to give as much financial support as possible to Ethiopia.  There is a great urgency about this matter.  It would be pointless to bring aid tomorrow to a person who is dying today.  That would be of no assistance whatsoever to <Col N="878" /> him.  Immediate action should be taken to give aid to Ethiopia and that is the kernel of the discussion this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Griffin for bringing this matter to the attention of the House, I share his concern.</P>
      <P>Contributions to the world food programme are pledged every two years by countries who are members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  As a member country of the FAO, Ireland pledged a sum of £2.953 million for the two years 1987 and 1988.  This sum was promised at the 12th World Food Programme Pledging Conference in New York in March 1986 &mdash; the amount to be paid in two instalments of £1.453 million in 1987 and £1.5 million in 1988.  One-third of our contribution is paid in cash to cover administrative and freight costs and the balance is spent on commodities made available to the world food programme.</P>
      <P>Our cash contribution for 1987 of £483,000 has been paid to the world food programme and 1,400 tonnes of skim milk powder at a total cost of £871,000 have been supplied to the world food programme projects in Vietnam, Angola, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Arrangements are being made to supply a further 174 tonnes of skim milk powder to Nicaragua in the near future.  Ireland has thus fulfilled to the letter its pledge to the world food programme for 1987 both in cash and commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards 1988, we all know that firm steps have had to be taken to reduce public expenditure and, in common with all official expenditure, spending on overseas aid has had to be looked at.  Unfortunately and regrettably our projected expenditure of £1.5 million on our pledge to the world food programme has had to be cancelled.  Of course, the world food programme has not been singled out.  In fact, the withdrawal of the world food programme contribution is part of the overall reduction which was found to be necessary in official development assistance in 1988.  Overall ODA has been <Col N="879" /> reduced by 26 per cent to £32 million for 1988.</P>
    <P>The aid distributed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the form of bi-lateral assistance that is, help given directly by this country to third world countries, has also been reduced.  I may add that in any case where we have entered into binding agreements to furnish aid, as, for instance, under an EC regulation, we will of course honour our commitments.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance which we provide to Third World countries is still standing and, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, we in Ireland have never been found wanting in our assistance to <Col N="880" /> our less well off neighbours in other countries. Our strategy in Government is to get the economy in order so that we will be in a position to give more generous and more favourable aid when finances allow.  I will certainly be seeking to ensure that that is done.  The decision to withdraw aid from under-developed countries has been a most difficult one but the state of our public finances is now such that very hard decisions have had to be taken.</P>

Teachers placed on the panel will have the opportunity to be deployed to fillable vacancies created by the teachers who leave the service in large numbers at the end of each school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am implementing a voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme for teachers which will create additional vacancies in schools and these vacancies will be filled, where appropriate, by the redeployment of teachers on the panel.

      <P>By referring to the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) for 1988 the Deputy will see that the capital budget for second-level schools in 1988 is £21 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated this allocation is sufficient only to meet expenditure arising in 1988 on: (i) projects where building has already commenced or been completed; (ii) professional services and equipment or property acquisitions already authorised and (iii) minor and emergency capital works such as provision of temporary prefabricated buildings and urgent repairs to roofs.  The number of projects at (i) and (ii) above on which expenditure could arise in 1988 was in excess of 370 as of 28 October, 1987 which are also the projects which relate to parts (b) and (c) of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to authorise the compilation of the information sought by the Deputy in those parts of his question as it would require an inordinate amount of staff time.</P>

      <P>I am establishing a Primary Quota Review Committee which will examine cases where the implementation of the revisions in the staffing arrangements for national schools announced in Circular 20/87 would create unacceptably large classes.  These cases will be examined on a school by school and class by class basis taking into account the needs of the school and the existing staffing and accommodation.  Among the guidelines <Col N="816" /> for the operation of the committee are that class sizes must be appropriate to the actual size of the classroom.  It would be open to the committee to recommend, <i>inter alia</i>, a reorganisation of classes or the retention of a teaching post which would otherwise be discontinued.</P>
      <P>With regard to post-primary schools the matter of the organisational arrangements in the schools is one for consideration by the school authorities.  I do not accept the implication in the question that the implementation of the new staffing regulations will result in undue difficulty in school organisation.</P>

      <P>The greater use of inner city primary schools for the relief of overcrowding in other primary schools is to be encouraged where this is considered <Col N="817" /> feasible.  However, where the distance involved is such as to require the use of transport by the pupils, there may be difficulty in getting agreement locally to such measure.</P>
      <P>At present there exists a high degree of mobility on the part of pupils in the greater Dublin city area in their attendance at second level schools.  Factors such as ease of access, whether by public or private transport, parental loyalty to a particular school and the reputation of a school are some of the influences which determine the school to which parents choose to send their children.</P>
      <P>The statistical evidence available to my Department indicates that more than 30 per cent of pupils attending second level schools in the inner city area came from the outer suburban areas.  My Department acknowledges this trend and, indeed, takes it into account when considering the provision of additional second level school accommodation in expanding suburban areas.</P>
      <P>I would also wish to point out to the Deputy that the amount of second level accommodation in the inner city has been falling in line with the decline in the number of inner city children seeking second level education.  In 1988 this trend will continue with the relocation of one inner city school in the suburbs and the closure of another.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, I am satisfied that no additional measures are required at present to encourage the greater use of second level schools in the inner city by children from the outer suburban areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Circular 20/87, which revises the staffing arrangements in national schools, is not being withdrawn as the changes to the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools and their consequent affect on teacher numbers form an essential part of the Government's strategy to contain public spending.  However, where the implementation of the circular would create unacceptably large classes, the particular circumstances of the school will be examined by a Primary Quota Review Committee on a class by class basis, taking into account the needs of the school and the existing staffing and accommodation, with the general aim of ensuring that the maximum class size does not exceed 40 except in exceptional circumstances.  It would be open to the committee to recommend a re-organisation of classes or a reallocation of teaching duties, that classes should be allowed exceed the above limit in particular cases or that, in exceptional circumstances, a teaching post should be retained which would otherwise have been discontinued under the terms of the circular.</P>
      <P>In order to give the review committee an adequate opportunity to carry out a thorough examination no changes under Circular 20/87 will take place before the end of June 1988.  This means that teachers whose posts are being discontinued under the terms of the circular will remain in their present schools until the end of June 1988 and those eligible for redeployment through the panel system will not move to other schools until September 1988.</P>

I have also announced that remedial posts, special concessionary posts in disadvantaged areas, and posts in special education will not be affected, and that other special arrangements will enable teachers who do not have panel rights to be retained in their posts until the end of the school-year.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret to me that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation has withdrawn from participation in the Primary Curriculum Review Body.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is my intention that the review body would continue with its work and furnish its report to me in due course. In addition to the representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the review body includes representatives from other educational interests and also persons nominated by myself for the qualifications they bring to the task, together with professional advisers from my Department.  I am confident that there is sufficient breadth of knowledge and experience among the membership of this review body to accomplish its task with distinction.</P>
      <P>I understand that, to date, the review body has met twice, on 19 October and 16 November 1987.</P>

    <P>A number of proposals for grant assistance are being considered by my Department at present and I anticipate that decisions regarding allocations in these cases will be made shortly.

Application forms for this purpose will be available from my Department's Youth Section as soon as the conditions of the scheme are finalised.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I announced the formation and terms of reference of the National Curriculum Council on 2 November 1987.  As I have said earlier in reply to another question, I regret that the teachers' unions have declined to nominate representatives to the council.  Nevertheless, it is my intention that the council will set about its task immediately and report to me in due course.  The council will have representatives from other educational interests and also persons nominated by me for the qualifications they bring to the task, together with advisers from my Department.  I am confident therefore that the council will contain a sufficient breadth of knowledge and experience <Col N="834" /> among its membership to accomplish its task with distinction.</P>
      <P>I propose to launch the council on Tuesday, December 8, 1987, during which I will also give details of its membership.</P>

      <P>Membership of the international community at present includes more than 160 states.  Of this number, Ireland maintains diplomatic relations, either on a resident or non-resident basis, with 66 states.  Resident embassies, normally headed by ambassadors, are at present maintained in 29 countries.  In the case of the remaining 37 countries with which Ireland maintains diplomatic relations, these relations are conducted by means of the concurrent accreditation of ambassadors from elsewhere to the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>The 66 countries with which Ireland maintains diplomatic relations are listed in annex I.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland maintains permanent representations or missions to a number of international organisations. These are the European Community in Brussels and the United Nations in New York and Geneva.  Ireland also maintains, through the embassy in Paris, permanent delegations to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).  A non-resident permanent representative is accredited to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in conjunction with its Bilateral Aid Programme, at present maintains development co-operation offices in Lesotho (classified as a consulate general), Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consulates-general (in the charge of <Col N="835" /> career officers) are maintained in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consulates in 34 countries, <Col N="836" /> staffed by honorary consuls or honorary consuls general providing consular services in 40 cities.  A list of these offices is given in annex 2.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the couple in question are assessable to tax under section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, on the basis of their aggregated income.</P>
      <P>Assessments which had been issued for 1985-86 and 1986-87 were appealed by the taxpayer who specified that tax was not payable for either year.  The assessments were cancelled and the Inspector of Taxes has no record of demands for income tax issuing for the years in question. The Inspector of Taxes, in fact, has no record of demands for income tax having been issued for any year prior to 1987-88.</P>
      <P>Regrettably due to an error on the part of the inspector, demands for income tax for 1987-88 were incorrectly issued to the taxpayer.  The matter has now been rectified and it is unlikely that further demands will be issued to the taxpayer in the foreseeable future.  The inspector will communicate directly with the taxpayer in the matter.</P>

      <P>The reason the off-farm income limit under the 1988 disadvantaged areas schemes is being reduced from £6,400 to £5,200 is to ensure that within the constraints of available resources the rates of headage grants are maintained and payments channelled to those most in need, that is farmers with no off-farm incomes or very low off-farm incomes.  A similar approach was adopted by the previous Government in 1983 when the off-farm income limit at that stage was reduced from £5,415 to £3,500.</P>
