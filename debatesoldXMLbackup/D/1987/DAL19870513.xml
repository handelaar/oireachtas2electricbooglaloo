      <P>As I indicated yesterday on the Order of Business, I gave notice that I intended to raise this morning in accordance with Standing Order 30 the <Col N="1682" /> request to move the Adjournment of this House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest which requires our consideration. I would like to inform the House of the motion I submitted to you, which I believe is in accordance with Standing Order 30, and which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>That this House believes that essential health services are now at serious risk, to such an extent that a total collapse of vital services to the sick and elderly cannot be ruled out.  This House views with concern the arbitrary decisions which are being imposed by the Government on health boards and other agencies by the size of their financial allocations and believes that these decisions cannot be sustained without serious danger to the health and wellbeing of our citizens.  Accordingly, this House calls on the Government to take the following steps immediately:</P>
      <P>(a)  to review the financial allocations for health boards and other agencies, to ensure that they have enough resources in 1987 to maintain services and employment at their present levels;</P>
      <P>(b)  to bring forward a rational plan for the control of health expenditure over a period of years, consistent with the objective of maintaining services and protecting employment;</P>
      <P>(c)  to enter into discussions with all interested groups with a view to the implementation of such a plan;</P>
      <P>(d)  to rescind the iniquitous charges for basic services which bear most heavily on those who can least afford to pay.</P>
      <P>That is the motion I served on you yesterday and I am now asking if the Taoiseach will comply with my request and give time in this House, either late this evening or tommorrow, so that this motion can be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wrote to you asking for time for an emergency debate because of the deepening crisis in the health services which is leading to thousands of jobs being lost, ward and hospital closures, driving out of our psychiatric hospitals some of the long term patients, and the possibility of a series of suicides &mdash; and I got that information from a number of people in senior positions in the psychiatric services.  I am also asking you to accede to my request&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order.  I received notice of these matters from Deputy Spring and Deputy Allen in accordance with the terms of Standing Order 30.  I have considered them in the light of the criteria which the informal committee on Dáil reform and procedures recommended and which are being followed by the Chair.  One of the criteria is that the matter must be one which has arisen suddenly.  The 1987 Exchequer provision for non-capital expenditure on the health services was announced in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 31 March last and the health boards were notified of their allocations on 2 April last.  In the circumstances, I find the matters raised do not comply with the aforementioned criterion.  Accordingly, the motions are not in my view ones contemplated by the Standing Order in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to question your ruling but one area where I differ from you is that I consider the implications of the Budget Statement of the allocations to the health boards are only now becoming known.  This must be obvious to every Member of this House because it is obvious to every member of the public since approximately 3,500 jobs are about to be lost in the health area.  In compliance with your ruling, Sir, which I have to accept, I again ask the Taoiseach if he will make time available either late this evening or tomorrow because this is a matter that should be discussed in this House.  I am aware the Taoiseach may <Col N="1684" /> have his own problems later this morning, but I believe this House should discuss these matters which are fundamental to the preservation of our health services.  I formally ask the Taoiseach if he will make time available to discuss the provision of health services to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest at your decision.  The thousands of workers in the health services who are losing their jobs will think your decision a very strange one and I believe it will give the impression in the country that this House is becoming irrelevant.  I ask the Taoiseach not to hide behind his office, or behind your decision, and to allow Government time to discuss this ever deepening crisis.  The implications of the Budget Statement are only now becoming apparent, as Deputy Spring said.</P>

    <Title>Statements. - Incident at Emyvale, County Monaghan.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go into the details of what happened <Col N="1696" /> at Emyvale, County Monaghan on the evening of Monday last there are two points I want to make clear.  There is a long and hallowed tradition in our country of respect for the dead irrespective of who they are or the circumstances in which they died.  Funerals are traditionally dignified occasions where the feelings of grieving relatives are treated with the utmost regard and sympathy.  In common with the rest of us &mdash; after all, we are all part of one and the same community &mdash; the members of the Garda Síochána know and are aware of and accept that tradition of respect for the dead and for funerals.</P>
      <P>The gardaí exist for a very specific purpose, to uphold the law of the land.  That is their duty, a duty they swear to fulfil without fear or favour when they are inducted into the Garda Síochána.  They cannot and must not be expected to turn a blind eye or use discretion where a serious breach of the law is involved.  Let there be no mistake about it, the presence of masked men in paramilitary uniforms discharging firearms in any part of our territory is, no matter what the circumstances, a serious offence.</P>
      <P>The incidents that occurred on Monday evening related to the funeral of the late James Lynagh.  We have another worthy tradition of speaking no ill of the dead and I shall respect that, too.  I do not propose to say anything of what he was, or what he may have done, or the manner of his death.  The simple fact is that on Monday he was dead and as an initial stage of his funeral his body had to be conveyed from Craigavon Hospital to his home.  It was obvious to everybody this would not be a normal funeral, that an exceptionally large crowd could be expected to be in attendance and also that there was the possibility that some form of paramilitary demonstration would take place in breach of the law. This placed the gardaí in a most unenviable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the possibility of an unlawful demonstration were to be completely ruled out, gardaí would have to be in attendance in such numbers and so close to the <Col N="1697" /> centre of things that their presence could be regarded as, at best, insensitive and, at worst, as provocative and overbearing. The other alternatives was for the gardaí to respect the dignity that belongs to all funerals, to facilitate the easy passage of the funeral along the route it was to follow and to maintain a discreet presence, to monitor what was happening and to prevent, as far as possible, any unlawful activity from taking place.  On the basis of the professional judgment of the senior Garda officers who met to consider the matter, this was the action decided upon and this is what Monday evening's Garda operation was designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>The funeral, as expected, was a particularly large one, accompanied by a big number of cars.  On its way from the Border to Monaghan it had to pass through Emyvale which is approximately five miles from the Border.  As arranged, the gardaí were present in discreet numbers, some in uniform and some detectives in plain clothes.  At Emyvale the funeral paused, ostensibly to allow the coffin to be carried through the village. When the hearse stopped, cars from the following cortege blocked the road by parking three abreast across it.  The coffin was removed from the hearse and was shouldered by six men in relays through the village, flanked on both sides by walking men and women wearing masks and dark glasses.  When this procession reached the end of the village the cortege stopped and immediately the crowd, estimated to be in the region of 700, tightened in close around it and linked arms. At this, three men, in battle dress and black balaclavas and carrying what appeared to be high powered rifles quickly emerged from a nearby laneway. They lined up at the side of the coffin and fired some single shots followed by a burst of shots before retreating through the crowd, which broke into cheers, facilitated the retreat of the gunmen and obstructed the gardaí who were close at hand from pursuing them.</P>
    <P>Two Garda detectives who were manning a car patrolling a side road observed the same gunmen who had been followed <Col N="1698" /> by uniformed gardaí.  The detectives' car was observed by the crowd to be blocking the road and preventing the gunmen's escape.  The crowd surrounded the car in which one of the detectives were sitting and proceeded to heave it over a two foot high wall to drop it about four feet lower than the road into a stream about five feet wide and eight feet deep.  It must be borne in mind that at this stage the life of the garda inside the car was in considerable danger.  Apart from any other injury he might sustain, the engine of the car was running so there was a real danger that the car would go on fire.</P>
    <P>The detective who remained outside the car called on the crowd to stop their attack on the car with his colleague inside.  As the crowd ignored his call and in view of the imminent danger to his colleague, he then fired six or seven bursts of automatic fire from his submachine gun over the heads of the crowd. The detective who was in the car, which landed on its roof, succeeded in extricating himself by breaking out through the rear car window.  As he emerged from the car he, with two other uniformed gardaí who had been pushed into the stream, was showered with stones by the violently aggressive crowed.  The detective who had fired the earlier shots at this stage drew his hand gun and fired one further shot over the heads of the crowd in an effort to make them disperse and to save his colleagues and himself from possible serious injury.  The crowd then withdrew, the gunmen having by this time made good their escape.  A uniformed sergeant and garda sustained some injuries which are not thought to be of a serious nature.  They and the detective who was in the overturned car suffered a degree of shock.  The entire incident, dramatic and violent as it was, took no more than a matter of minutes.</P>
    <P>I have to exercise great restraint and caution in commencing on the incidents I have just described, as I understand there is every possibility that at least some of those responsible for the outrageous behaviour towards the Garda, as well as the other matters, will be brought before <Col N="1699" /> the courts and I am anxious that no comment of mine might even appear to be prejudicial to those who will face criminal charges arising out of these events.  I ask all other Deputies to exercise similar restraint for the very same reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for Justice for making this statement this morning.  He refers to the traditional respect for the dead in this country and certainly I would like to agree with him on that.  I am afraid, however, that members of the Provisional IRA have very little respect for the dead.  They use young men while they are alive and when they are dead they abuse their funerals for political purposes. It is outrageous that masked men in paramilitary uniform were on the streets of one of our villages firing shots with automatic weapons.  There is only one legitimate armed force in this State and that is the Irish Army.  We should continue in this House to deplore any attempt by any organisation to usurp the conscience of this State.</P>
      <P>I should like to sympathise with the members of the Garda who were on duty in Emyvale and to commend them for carrying out their duty in very difficult circumstances.  We appreciate the emotional tradition of political funerals in this country.  I can see and appreciate, from what the Minister has said, the difficult position in which the gardaí found themselves.  I should like to compliment them and, in particular, the armed plain clothes garda who, in my opinion, quite rightly decided to use his Uzi submachine gun and his revolver in defence of his colleagues who were under attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of questions which arise and I should like the Minister to deal with them in his reply.  First, how many members of the Garda Síochána were present?  Secondly, was there a deliberate policy to approach the passing of the cortége in a low profile manner, was there a question of watching the cost of the operation, or any question of the gardaí not having the resources at their disposal, without recourse to overtime, <Col N="1700" /> to put sufficient numbers in the street in Emyvale on that occasion?  I should like to ask also who was in charge of the gardaí?  I am not looking for the name of the individual in charge, but I should appreciate if the Minister could inform us of the highest ranking garda present in Emyvale.</P>
    <P>The question of the shooting is very disturbing.  I think there is almost unanimous support in this House for the concept of an unarmed police force.  It is a corollary of that that a small section of the police then have to be armed and have to be prepared to use their arms in special circumstances.  Will the Minister inform the House how many shots were fired?  Will he tell the House how many rounds are normally issued to plainclothes detectives both for their automatic weapons and their hand guns?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister tell the House what is the standard issue of rounds of ammunition to plain clothes gardaí on duty for automatic weapons and hand guns because media reports suggest that the detective involved who was under threat was in the position that his Uzi submachine gun was useless because he ran out of ammunition after a couple of bursts and had to resort to the use of a hand gun?  Will the Minister inform the House of the precise instructions issued to members of the Garda Síochána on the use of guns and of the procedures involved when they fire their weapons?  Will the Minister tell the House the current precise instructions given to members of the force in regard to the discharge of their weapons on occasions like the one under discussion? I appreciate, as the Minister said, that charges may be imminent and I sincerely hope charges will be preferred.  One has to be careful in commenting once there is a question of charges likely to be preferred.</P>

    <P>Most of us get our information by impression from television.  I should like to point to a contrast of impressions <Col N="1701" /> in the news bulletins on the night in question. There seemed to be no use of weaponry by the paramilitaries at funerals in the North but once the camera crew switched to our side of the Border we got a very graphic picture of three men in paramilitary uniforms using automatic weapons.  That creates an extremely bad impression and provides a propaganda opportunity for those who do not have the interests of the country at heart and who will use an incident like this to suggest we are not as diligent as we might be in the suppression of the IRA.  I know that the present Government, like the previous Government, are absolutely committed in their opposition to the IRA and I know that the Garda are extremely efficient in the carrying out of their duties but there is a residual impression which remains as a result of an incident like this and that can be used against the reputation of the Garda Síochána and of the country.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that adequate Garda resources will be available at the funeral today?  I appreciate he cannot give the details of the security arrangements which will be put in place by the Garda Síochána but I should like to get an assurance that adequate resources will be available, that adequate numbers of gardaí will be deployed and that, if necessary, the Army will be used as a back-up at today's funeral so that there will not be any repeat of the incidents that occurred at Emyvale.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an associated point in regard to this matter.  I understand the church authorities in Northern Ireland have an agreement with the relatives of those who die in incidents such as the one under discussion that there will be no paramilitary display within church grounds or in the church.  I should like to know if the Minister is in a position to inform us if the church authorities in our part of the country have a similar arrangement.  To return to where the Minister began, in our respect for the dead it is appropriate that that respect should be extended to ensure there is no use of paramilitary paraphernalia or arms on sanctified ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> I should like to thank the Minister for coming before the House this morning to inform us in great detail of what happened. I hope the Minister will be able to answer my questions in the course of his reply to the statements or subsequently. I hope he can give an assurance to the House that adequate resources are available today to ensure there will be no repetition.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on the incidents at Emyvale on Monday evening.  Like many Members one is always very wary about being critical of our Garda Síochána.  They have a very difficult job to do and many members of the force have tragically lost their lives trying to protect the State and its citizens. I can understand what happened at Emyvale but I fail to see why adequate precautions were not taken in advance to ensure there was adequate Garda strength there on the evening in question.</P>
      <P>In that context I should like to ask the Minister if he was in touch with the Garda authorities over the weekend or on Monday to ensure there would be adequate Garda protection on duty on Monday evening in Emyvale.  As the Minister said this morning, this was not a normal funeral.  It was emotive like all such funerals.  One has to have regard for the feelings of the family, relatives and friends of the deceased but one must strike a balance between having regard for the deceased, their relatives and friends, and having an adequate Garda presence to ensure that the law is upheld and the lives of citizens are not put in danger.  One must ensure that the unlawful activities that occurred in Emyvale will not happen again.  This is not the first time we have had a funeral of this type. Since the early seventies there have been a number of such funerals and about four years ago we had a similar episode in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me there are no procedures for the Garda to follow in cases like this.  It appears that it is left to the authorities in districts like Cavan-Monaghan to make a decision as to the <Col N="1703" /> number of Gardaí they will put into a town like Emyvale for such events.  It does not appear that a decision was made at senior Garda level, at Commissioner level, and I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of comments on the episode.  We are all aware that it was widely publicised on television here, in Britain and elsewhere and that an impression was created that the Garda were not prepared for what was likely to happen.  The impression was created that they were completely overwhelmed and were not capable of dealing with the incident.  That has serious consequences for our system of justice, our faith in the Garda Síochána and the operations of the force.  I agree with the Minister that this was no ordinary funeral.  It was well known that Mr. Lynagh was a very prominent member of the Provisional IRA.  The authorities had Saturday, Sunday and Monday to make adequate preparations for the funeral but it appears from newspaper reports that there was not a sergeant in charge on the occasion.  It appears that the gardá adopted a traffic control performance, were controlling the crowd as they would control any crowd going to a concert or GAA match.  At another level they had a surveillance operation mounted at Emyvale to check on who was present and what was going on but they did not seem to be prepared for what might happen or to have sufficient members to deal with the difficulty that arose.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, as Deputy Noonan has, to give us an assurance that there will be adequate gardaí present at this morning's funeral and that they will have available to them all the backup facilities they require.  Emyvale is not a difficult area to patrol.  It is simply a question of patrolling one street.  It is not an area where there are a large number of roads, lay-bys and places that would enable people to escape easily. From my understanding &mdash; I have been there and I know people who are familiar with the area &mdash; it would have been relatively easy for the gardaí to have adopted <Col N="1704" /> a preventative approach to this incident and ensured that no person with firearms would have got through at the various points of entry to the town.  That does not seem to have been the Garda approach; they waited until something happened before they did anything and then their number was so inadequate that they were not capable of dealing adequately with what arose.</P>
    <P>At this event there was a considerable representation of media people.  I would like to refer to comments made by members of the media over the week-end and, in particular, to an article in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> by their security correspondent who describes the people who attend these funerals as Republicans, sympathisers and so on.  It is regrettable that people who support the activities of the Provisional IRA should merit the title, Republican.  As one who lives by and supports the Republican ideal I know many people share my view and feel outraged when people who support the activities of the IRA are given the benefit of being branded &ldquo;Republicans&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that context I am appalled at the insensitive comments made by members of Clare County Council, of Castleblayney Urban District Council, of Tralee Urban District Council and of Leitrim County Council in relation to the killings.  I ask the members of those councils and the parties to which they belong to bear in mind that they have adopted a very one-sided approach to what happened.  They have a very blinkered view of what happened at the weekend.  The weapons found on the IRA men had been used to kill members of the RUC and business people involved in their ordinary everyday business activities. I find it very objectionable, as I know the vast majority of people do, to learn of the remarks made by these local representatives.</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast the remarks made by members of those councils with the situation that arose in Monaghan Urban District Council when members of the council failed to adjourn their <Col N="1705" /> meeting as a mark of sympathy.  I compliment them for taking that decision, I know how difficult it was for them given that Emyvale is in County Monaghan.  It cannot have been very easy for them to take that courageous decision.  They deserve our credit for so doing.  Politicians here should not be afraid to speak out and to stand up when the name of Ireland and the names of fellow Irish people are bandied about by people who have no respect for law and order and human life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the regulations in relation to the use of firearms. The questions he asked were interesting in so far as he is a former Minister for Justice.  I understand that these regulations lay down very specific guidelines as to when firearms can be used.  One of the criteria laid down in such regulations is that firearms must be used only by a member of the force when he feels that his life or the life of a colleague is in danger.  I would like to ask the Minister if these regulations have been looked at during the last couple of years and if he thinks it might be a good idea for the Garda authorities to have another look at these regulations in the light of recent incidents to make sure they are adequate to meet the demands of what is becoming increasingly an ever sophisticated campaign on behalf of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask the Minister if he will give us an assurance that he will ensure, in conjunction with the Garda authorities, that adequate procedures are laid down in future for funerals of this kind.  One hopes that such incidents will not occur again but one can never be sure about this.  Given the number of times incidents like this happened in the early seventies it is time correct procedures were laid down and decisions in relation to Garda operations made at a very senior level so that gardaí do not operate on the basis of, &ldquo;we will take a chance and see what happens&rdquo;, which appears to have been the case at Emyvale.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise what the members of the force on the ground did that night.  It was probably necessary in the circumstances.  It is all too easy for <Col N="1706" /> politicians to undermine the force by criticising constantly what they might and might not do.  A few days ago members of the Garda Síochána were jeered and sneered at by members of Sinn Féin outside a courtroom after an extradition debacle.  I know the difficult circumstances in which many gardaí operate. By being members of the Garda they take risks with their own lives and with the lives of their families.  It ill-becomes any politician in this House to criticise unless one is absolutely sure that there was an abuse of power on Monday night and I am not convinced that there was. The remarks made by the Minister today indicate that the gardaí genuinely felt that the life of one of their colleagues was in danger.  I can understand why they thought that.  I think that situation arose because they did not have sufficient numbers and did not take the precautions one feels were necessary on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in expressing my appreciation to the Minister for making a statement to the House in relation to the events at Emyvale on Monday night.  As the Minister rightly said, the question of funerals is one of very great sensitivity and requires great care as to how they should be approached from a security point of view.  As we know, the Provisional IRA use funerals as a staging arrangement for propaganda.  They use the dead for this purpose.  They have no respect either for the dead or for the living.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the gardaí felt that the life of one of them was in danger. From the events described, some of which were seen on television, quite clearly the life of a garda was put in danger.  Ordinary people would have seen and learned of those events with intense disquiet and with an intense sense of unease that when events like that can be allowed pass off, there is a threat to the security of the State.  We are talking about an armed situation where evil people with guns attack the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which must go forth from Dáil Éireann today is that the Garda <Col N="1707" /> have the full and unequivocal support and confidence of Irish people.  We admire the work they do.  They represent us in their work.  We are behind them and support them in every respect.  It must be shown and appreciated that any attack on the Garda force is an attack on the State, not an attack on an individual garda.  It constitutes nothing less than a threat to the security of this State.  This cannot be tolerated.  The law must be upheld.  We give to our police force our backing and our authority.  We must ensure that the Garda, too, act in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>As I see it, no adequate thought was given to what approach should have been adopted at the Emyvale funeral.  As the Minister said, there are two possible approaches in this kind of situation: one is to take a low profile approach and hope that the funeral will pass off quietly and without difficulty; and the other is to send in an adequate force to control an anticipated situation.  I can appreciate the force of argument and reason that could be applied to either of those alternatives, but neither approach was taken here.</P>
    <P>It appears that we fell between two stools.  We did not keep an unarmed profile presence of the Garda; nor did we go in with a sufficient degree of force to control the situation.  I suppose in the event we got out reasonably well.  The matter could have been worse.  We went in with a very small number of gardaí, without senior officers being present to control and direct them, and I could well visualise a situation where the gardaí could have been disarmed.  As the Minister said, the officer with the machine gun ran out of ammunition and had to resort to the use of a handgun.  Those weapons could have been appropriated and taken away from the gardaí.  That would have been a serious and unacceptable humiliation of the security authorities of the State.  It was a mistake to send in such a small number of gardaí without senior officers in control.</P>
    <P>A decision has to be made in these cases on whether the approach should be heavy or light and that should be followed <Col N="1708" /> through all the way.  We should not be caught in the middle which, quite clearly, is the worst of all options.  This situation will arise from time to time and we should prepare operational plans on how to deal with it, plans adapted to the needs that apply to each case depending on the locality.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that when the gardaí are given a task of this kind they have the full support of Dáil Éireann, the full support and confidence of the people and that the resources of the State are used to back them up.  I believe there is no shortage of Garda and Army resources in that part of our country.  They should be made available when necessary.  It is unacceptable that a member of the Garda in a car with the engine running is attacked by a mob, the car rolled over into a stream and that officer's life put in danger.  Such a possibility should not be countenanced and we should not leave ourselves open to it.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we apply greater forethought and care to these situations and that a humiliation of that nature is not imposed on our Garda Síochána and on ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in saying whether the gardaí were there in too great or too little strength. Only the Garda can decide that.  We have had many examples of these difficult situations in Northern Ireland.  I deplore the attacks on the gardaí which could have resulted in serious injury or loss of life.  Some of those responsible were clearly identifiable in pictures and we support the Minister in whatever efforts can be taken to prosecute them.  The funeral takes place today and we hope that, despite the provocative and irresponsible behaviour of the Provisional IRA, the gardaí will act firmly but with restraint and discipline.  How that is to be done is a matter for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point that the Provisionals are a dangerous, fascist, sectarian, paramilitary group, who thrive on emotional tensions.  We have learned that already in Northern Ireland from a number of funerals during the past few months.  Such emotionally tense areas <Col N="1709" /> should be avoided.  The procedure which is now being adopted in the North at funerals is obviously better.  You wait until later to make your prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The incidents on Monday had their roots in the attack on Loughgall police station by a Provisional gang on Friday last.  It is clear that this gang of eight or nine heavily armed Provisionals set off with a massive bomb in an attempt to do the maximum damage and inflict the maximum casualties on what they expected to be a lightly manned police station.  The ultimate responsibility for the carnage in Loughgall on Friday must rest with the political and military leadership of the Provisionals who sent these young men to their deaths.  It illustrates the obscenity of the ballot box and the Armalite strategy.</P>
    <P>Eight young men were sent out to die to boost the electoral prospects of people like Gerry Adams in West Belfast.  Let there be no doubt that the motivation for the escalation of violence and killings during the past few months, with the expected response of the RUC and the British Army, is to heighten tensions and emotions in the North in order to maximise the Provisional vote in the Westminister elections and to ensure that Adams is re-elected.  They depend on emotional support for their electoral success. They have nothing whatever to offer politically and they would never have achieved electoral support without the slow deaths of ten young men on hunger strikes.  So eight more now die.</P>
    <P>The people who are engaged in this vicious sectarian war against the Protestant people of the North will get no sympathy whatever from me or from The Workers' Party.  It is an insult to all previous generations to link them as if they are Republicans in the same tradition. We support whatever measures are taken by the Minister and the Garda to ensure that these tensions and emotions do not develop in this State.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputies such as Deputy Kemmy and others who might like an opportunity to contribute and let us have their views on this matter are not in a position to do so because of the way business was ordered.  I regret that and I appreciate that Deputy Kemmy would be positive and constructive in what he would have to say in the matter.</P>
      <P>I thank Members of the House for their statements on this very important and very delicate matter.  In particular I thank them for their appreciation of the difficulties faced by the Garda Síochána and for their complimentary remarks on the way the Garda performed.  It was, of course, a very difficult situation for the Garda to cope with and I should like the House to understand clearly that the decision with regard to the approach of the Garda to this issue was made by the Garda Commissioner, having discussed the matter in conference with his deputy commissioners and the assistant commissioner in charge with responsibility for security operations.  It would be wrong to assume from what was said here this morning that this decision was made locally and in isolation.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the case that what has been described as the &ldquo;low profile&rdquo; approach <Col N="1712" /> by the Garda has anything to do with costs or lack of resources being available. These factors did not enter into it in any way whatsoever.  The decision was made by the Garda at the highest level, having regard to their professional experience in matters such as this.  There were some difficulties for the Garda in making their plans for the occasion because up to the last minute they were not sure whether the remains would be brought to Monaghan or Clones.  This did not ease the planning of their operations.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan will be aware that it has never been the practice to give the information he is looking for with regard to numbers on duty at a particular time. Regarding the number of shots fired, I covered that matter in the statement.  The gunmen who came with rifles appear to have fired two shots each initially and then fired a burst of shots.  One can only guess the number of shots fired in a burst; an educated guess would be perhaps four or six shots.  On the question of ammunition for the Uzi machine gun, I gather that between six and eight shots were fired from the Uzi gun.  Deputy Noonan will readily appreciate that perhaps there were other supplies available but not immediately to hand which could not have been used.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious that the detective garda who used the Uzi and his hand gun did so in an effort to save his colleague who was trapped in the overturned car while the engine was running.  He feared that petrol would spill and the whole thing would go up in a blaze.  Apart from his colleague in the car, he and two other colleagues were being stoned ruthlessly by the mob on the bank and he feared they would all be killed.</P>
    <P>I should like Members to appreciate that all this took place in a matter of minutes.  There were other members of the Garda Síochána in the district but they could not get through.  As I said in my statement, the roads were blocked and the crowd in their well-rehearsed tactics closed in tightly.  It was impossible for anybody to come to their assistance <Col N="1713" /> at that time.  With regard to the precise instructions for the use of guns, I do not propose to go into this matter now.  I suggest that we can talk about these instructions at Question Time or on some other occasion.</P>
    <P>It could be said with hindsight that the Garda did not envisage the possibility of any incident in Emyvale.  There were large numbers of gardaí deployed in other areas who were on call, ready to deal with situations that might arise in Monaghan and or Clones.  I suppose it can be said with hindsight that they might have adopted a different approach but, as Deputy Harney said, a delicate balance has to be struck and that is a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda Síochána.  I was advised of what was going on over the weekend but it was purely a Garda decision, as it should be.  The question of how they will approach the problem today is purely a matter for decision by the Garda Commissioner and his top men, exercising their professional judgment.  They have available to them all the resources of the State, including the Army on standby if the Garda feel it is necessary to call them in.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan raised matters concerning the Church authorities and how the paramilitaries are going to respect Church grounds, having <Col N="1714" /> regard to the situation which has developed in Northern Ireland in recent times.  I understand from the Garda Commissioner that he will not have members of the Garda Síochána in Church grounds today.  I have just heard that, by way of information.</P>
      <P>I have covered a number of points raised by Deputy Harney.  It was a decision made at headquarters.  The Garda authorities have to rely on their experience and professionalism in planning for these things.  One never knows exactly what to expect on such occasions. In the past many Members of this House have witnessed situations where we had something like 500 troops on the front lawn of Leinster House in an effort to give the Garda the support they needed. There was genuine belief and fear that this House where we are sitting would be burned to the ground.  These decisions were taken by the Garda, not by Ministers for Justice who are Members of this House.  They have to try to anticipate what is going to happen and to deal with it.  Deputy Taylor was correct when he said the Garda must always have the full support, backing and resources of the State and the people in an effort to ensure that they do what has to be done, and that goes without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, decent ordinary people were incensed and outraged at what they saw on their TV screens on the night in question.  I have spoken to a number of people and they were truly outraged at the way members of the Garda were dealt with.  There is no doubt about that and if the exercise at Emyvale was meant to be a propaganda exercise for the purpose of encouraging recruits into the Provisional IRA the whole thing backfired very heavily on them because 99.99 per cent of the people in this part of the country have the highest respect for the Garda and what they are trying to do, and they support them.  There are times, I suppose, when mistakes can happen and one must be careful of over-reaction.  We must have that balance that we have been talking about, and we must accept that any attack on the Garda Síochána is an attack on the State and cannot be tolerated.  Of <Col N="1715" /> course, occasions arose in the past when gardaí had their weaponry taken from them.  I have no doubt that that possibility is always there and the Garda are very conscious of it.  It is a humiliating experience for the member, the force generally and those they are meant to guard that such should happen, but we can be confident that the Garda are alert to this danger and they are naturally very careful.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is no question of any shortage of resources in dealing with occasions such as this one and the Garda and the Commissioner have available to them today everything and anything needed by them.  I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for his support for the Garda and for his condemnation of the attack on members of the Garda and I know his views will be shared by the Members of this House.  I have no doubt that under very serious provocation the Garda will act firmly and fairly and in a disciplined fashion.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm, ó tharla gurb í seo mo chéad uair labhairt sa Dáil, gur ag labhairt ar an ábhar seo atá mé.  Is Gaeltacht páirt mhór de mo cheanntar agus tá suim agus grá agam don Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus muintir na Gaeltachta ó chaith mé seal i nGaoth Dobhair roinnt blianta ó shin.  Sna caogaidí agus i dtús na seasgaidí bhí an imirce go láidir as na ceanntair Ghealtachta.  Phós a lán acu sa Bhreatain agus cuid sa Mheiriceá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Timpeall fiche bliain ó shin cuireadh tús le tionscail sa Ghealtacht le súil go stopfadh an imirce agus go bhfillfeadh na deoraithe.  Tharla sin: d'fhill a lán abhaile agus fuair siad fostaíocht i monarchana agus in oibreacha eile a bhí bunaithe ag <Col N="1716" /> Gaeltarra Éireann.  Rud maith a bhí ann, cinnte, ach níor chuir sé an feabhas ar staid na Gaeilge a rabhthas ag súil leis. A lán de na daoine a tháinig ar ais bhí siad pósta, agus na páistí a bhí acu ag caint Béarla.  Chuaigh siad chun scoile sa Ghaeltacht, ach in áit iadsan Gaeilge a fhóghlaim, is amhlaidh a d'fhóghlaim páistí na háite Béarla uathu san.  Ba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh cinnte nach dtárlóidh sé arís.  Mar adúirt an tAire, tá sé le feiceáil gur éirigh leis an Údarás ní amháin líon na ndaoine fostaithe a choinneáil cothrom, ó thaobh méadú, le ceithre bliana anuas, am ina raibh líon na ndaoine fostaithe ar fud na tíre ag titim. Is mór an dul chun cinn é sin agus tá moladh mór ag dul chuig an Údarás agus gach duine a raibh páirt aige ann.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid a bheith rédh le níos mó a dhéanamh má táimid i ndairíre faoin Ghaeilge.  Ní leor airgead amháin.  Caithfear féachaint chuige go gcuirfear oibreacha agus seirbhísí ar fáil atá oiriúnach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, in áit a bheith oiriúnach do na tionsclóirí, is é sin le rá, caithfimid smaoineamh ar chumas agus dearcadh mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Mar shampla, tá ag eirí go maith le feirmeoireacht éisc mar gur páirt de shaol traidisiúnta na Gaeltachta an iascaireacht.  Mar sin, tuigeann na hoibrithe atá ag obair ar na feirmeacha seo a gcuid oibre.  Ba cheart dúinn féachaint le scéimeanna eile mar sin a thabhairt isteach, scéimeanna a mbeidh baint acu le turasóireacht agus na hacmhainí eile atá le fáil sa Ghaeltacht in ionad monarchana ard-theicniciúla ina bhfuil an bhainistíocht uilig ón iasacht, agus gan fostaíocht do mhuintir na háite ach na hoibrithe agus gan a fhios acu cad atá ar siúl nó cad é toradh a saothair.</P>
    <P>Tá na Gaeltachtaí scartha ar imeall na tíre gan mórán infrastructure, agus tá sé le tuigbheáil go dtófaidh sé a lán iarrachta agus airgid chun iad a chur ar chothromaíocht leis an gcuid eile den tír. Níl an tÚdarás ar bun ach le seacht mbliana. Rinne siad forbairt mhór sna seacht mbliana sin.  Ach ag forbairt atá siad go fóill, agus ag forbairt a bhéas siad go ceann tamaill eile.  Mar sin tá géarghá len a lán tacaíochta a thabhairt dóibh sna <Col N="1717" /> blianta sin má táimid ag súil le toradh fiúntach san am atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeilge faoi ionsaí san am i láthair ag dhá námhaid &mdash; na meáin chumarsáide agus dífhostaíocht.  Idir na páipéir nuachta, teilifís, raidio agus eile, faigheann an gnáth dhuine sa Ghaeltacht thart ar thrí uair a chloig den Bhéarla gach lá.  Ní thig leis sin gan dochar a dhéanamh.  Ach olc agus mar atá sin, ba mheasa i bhfad an dochar a dhéanfadh an dífhostaíocht, mar dúirt mé cheana.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom agus, tá mé cinnte, leis an mhórchuid de mhuintir na tíre an Ghaeilge agus traidisiúin na Gaeltachta a chaomhnú.  Chruthaigh an tUdarás go dtí seo go bhfuil siad ábalta fostaíocht a chothú agus saol na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt ar mhórán dóigheanna. Tá ag éirí go maith leo, agus má táimid i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeilge agus na Gaeltachtaí, ba cheart dúinn &mdash; agus molaim go ndéanfaimís &mdash; ár dtacaíocht go hiomlán a thabhairt don Bhille seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí a labhair sa díospóireacht, agus táim buíoch díobh mar gheall ar na tuairimí a nocht siad.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis na hurlabhraithe ar fad os na pointí éagsúla a luaigh siad.  Is é an trua nach bhfuil siad anseo; caithfidh sé gur tharla rud éigin nach féidir leo a bheith anseo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Teachta Coughlan ar an gcéad uair dí labhairt sa Dáil.  Is deas an rud é gur i ndíospóireacht na Gaeltachta a thug sí faoi chaint.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim aici sa Ghaeltacht agus go gcluinfimid i bhfad níos mó uaithi san am atá le teacht maidir le cúrsaí Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Féachfaidh mé anois le freagraí a thabhairt ar chuid de na rudaí a hardaíodh sa díospóireacht.  Luaigh an Teachta Kenny cuid de na seirbhísí a bhí le fáil faoi dheontais ón Údarás, seirbhísí le cuidiú le daoine dul chun cinn agus gnóthaí dá gcuid féin a chur chun tosaigh.  Bhí deontais le haghaidh na seirbhísí sin agus aontaím <Col N="1718" /> leis gur chuidigh sé le cuid mhaith postanna a chur ar fáil.  Má bhí duine nó beirt a bhí sásta tabhairt faoi obair a chuir seirbhís ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí, bhuel ba mhór an rud é sin, agus sílim ó tharla go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí scaipthe, go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis na deontais seo agus ba mhaith liomsa a fheiceáil go bhféadfadh an tÚdarás, nuair a bheas airgead níos flúirsí, cuid de na deontais a thabhairt ar ais le haghaidh na seirbhísí sin a chur ar fáil.  Tá srian ar chaiteachas airgid agus fhad is atá an srian sin ar an gcaiteachas is dócha nach mbeidh sé rófhurasta na seirbhísí sin a thabhairt ar ais, ach bheinn ag súil nach bhfuil deireadh leo ar fad.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta feirmeoireacht éisc agus an méid oibre atá á cothú de bharr na hoibre a rinne an tÚdarás, agus gur mhaith leis go mbeadh páirt níos mó ag daoine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta san fhorbairt sin.  Aontaím ar fad leis ansin, agus cé gur breá an rud é comhlachtaí móra a fheiceáil ag teacht isteach ag cur oibre ar siúl sílim go luíonn sé le réasún go mbeadh tábhacht an-mhór san obair a d'fhéadfaí a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta iad féin san fhorbairt seo, go bhféadfaí é a úsáid le cuidiú leo saothrú a fháil a thabharfadh slí mhaireachtála dóibh; idir an dá rud, an saothrú a thiocfadh ón fheirmeoireacht éisc agus ó na geadáin talaimh atá acu go mbeadh an leanúnachas a theastaíoinn le pobal Gaeltachta a choinneáil slán, agus ar an gcaoi sin go mbeadh seans níos fearr leis an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chosaint agua a chaomhnú.  Tá a fhios agam faoi láthair go bhfuil deacrachtaí dlí maidir le ceadúnais a chur ar fáil do dhaoine le dul i mbun fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Tá na rudaí sin fáoi chaibidil i láthair na huaire, agus ceann de na rudaí a bheimid ag súil leo nuair a bheidh Roinn na Mara faoi lánseol ná go mbeifear in ann na cúrsaí sin a chur chun cinn níos tapúla agus nach mbeidh an oiread rannóga Stáit páirteach sna rudaí seo feasta.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta fós an tábhacht atá leis an iascaireacht, an ghnáth iascaireacht a bhfuil taithí againn go léir uirthi, don Ghaeltacht féin.  D'aontaigh mé, ar <Col N="1719" /> ndóigh, leis sin chomh maith.  Go minic bíonn daoine ag caitheamh anuas ar an Stát nach ndéanann siad go leor le tionscal na hiascaireachta a chur chun cinn. Ach nuair a dhéantar mionscrúdú air sin sílim nach fíor é ar fad.  Tá, ó cuireadh an Bord Iascaigh Mhara ar bun, go leor dul chun cinn déanta leis an iascaireacht a chur ar aghaidh agus d'éirigh le cuid mhaith de mhuintir na tíre buntáiste maith a bhaint as sin.  Caithfimid cuimhneamh ar an traidisiún atá thart faoin chósta.  Go minic ní maith le tuismitheoirí a gclann a fheiceáil ag tógáil páirt san obair seo mar go raibh go leor deacrachtaí agus contúirtí ag baint léi san am atá caite.  Sílim nár ghlac daoine leis na deontais chomh mór agus ba cheart dóibh san am atá caite agus gurb shin ceann de na fáthanna nach ndeachaigh forbairt na hiascaireachta chun cinn chomh maith agus ba mhian linn san am atá caite.</P>
    <P>Is breá a fheiceáil anois go bhfuil daoine sásta infheistíocht an-mhór a dhéanamh san iascaireacht, agus tá cúpla duine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta, cuirim i gcás, a bhfuil aithne agam féin orthu a bhfuil infheistíocht mhór á dhéamh acu.  Beidh báid acu ar aon chothrom le báid iascaigh ar bith atá ag teacht chun na tíre seo i mbliana.  Beimid ag súil go mbeidh tuilleadh den rud sin le feiceáil san am atá romhainn.  Cuideoidh sé sin leis na Gaeltachtaí agus tiocfaidh tionscail dá bharr.  Beidh próiseáil éisc agus a leithéid sin ann agus, ar ndóigh, tá sé sin an-tábhachtach dúinn ó thaobh phobal na Gaeltachta agus ó thaobh fostaíochta a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Kenny chomh maith go mba mhaith leis go mbeadh oifigigh de chuid na Gaeltachta lonnaithe ar fud na nGaeltachtaí le bualadh leis na daoine agus le cur in iúl dóibh céard a bhí ar fáil dóibh maidir le deontais agus cuidiú ón Údarás agus ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. Tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ansin agus tá duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i gContae Mhaigh Eo.  Tá na Gaeltachtaí scaipthe ó Thuar Mhic Eadaigh, Acaill, Béal an Mhuirthead agus tá clár leagtha amach dó i gcaoi is go mbeidh sé <Col N="1720" /> in ann bheith i láthair sna Gaeltachtaí sin gach seachtain.  Sin dul chun cinn. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé lán sásúil ach is dul chun cinn é agus beidh an duine seo, nuair a bheas eolas ag na daoine go bhfuil sé le fáil, in ann buaileadh leis agus má tá moltaí ar bith acu nó má tá siad ag iarraidh rud ar bith a chur chun cinn beidh sé in ann a mhíniú dóibh céard atá i gceist, céard iad na deontais atá le fáil agus cén cuidiú a dtig leis an Údarás a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá scileanna ar leith ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go mba cheart cuidiú leo leis na scileanna sin a chur chun cinn. Tá cuid mhaith á dhéanamh ag an Údarás cheana féin le cuidiú leis na cúrsaí sin. B'fhiú do mhuintir an Tí seo cuairt a thabhairt ar an ionad cheardaíochta atá bunaithe acu sa Spidéal, áit a bhfuil foirgnimh lonnaithe a dtig le daoine dul isteach iontu agus a fheiceáil céard iad na céardanna faoi leith atá á gcur chun cinn ag daoine óga a tháinig ansin.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil go leor fostaíochta ann i láthair na huaire ach sílim ó thaobh na turasóireachta de go mbeidh an-tábhacht leis an ionad cheardaíochta seo.  Tig le stráinséirí dul isteach ansin agus a fheiceáil ceard a dtig le haos óg na tíre seo, aos óg na Gaeltachta, a dhéanamh agus cuid den céardaíocht atá le fáil san Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil.  Beidh brabach ag teacht chuig na daoine iad féin agus beidh deis ag na stráinséirí seo sampla den dúchas a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht a fheiceáil agus a thabhairt ar ais leo.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Kenny chomh maith staid na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí agus an brú atá ar an nGaeilge i láthair na huaire agus arís caithfidh mé aontú leis.  Tá deacrachtaí ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí mar go bhfuil siad de shíor faoi ag an teilifís, an raidio agus, mar adúirt an Teachta Coughlan anseo, cúrsaí cumarsáide ar fad.  San am céanna sílim go bhfuil siad ag seasamh an talaimh agus molaim iad i ngeall ar na hiarrachtaí leis an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán.  Tá tábhacht mhór ag baint leis na cúrsaí samhraidh agus is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil muintir na tíre ag iarraidh lán bhuntáiste a bhaint astu.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> Luaigh an Teachta chomh maith an Cairdinéal Ó Fiaich agus sílim go mba chóir dúinn ár mbuíochas a ghlacadh leis anseo sa Dáil i ngeall ar an am a chaith sé anuraidh ag taisteal na nGaeltachtaí ar fad.  Shiúl sé chuile Ghaeltacht, bhuail sé leis na páistí a bhí ar na cúrsaí agus ar ndóigh bhí muintir na Gaeltachta an-sásta an Cairdinéal a fheiceáil sna Gaeltachtaí agus bhí na páistí an-sásta chomh maith. Tá mé cinnte gur thug sé misneach doibh uilig maidir leis an nGaeilge, leis an tábhacht a bhaineann le Gaeilge a labhairt agus leanár gcultúr a chosaint agus a chaomhnú. Is breá an rud go raibh an Cairdinéal, cé go bhfuil sé gníomhach agus go leor leor le déanamh aige, sásta an oiread sin ama a chaitheamh maidir le cur in iúl do na páistí an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge.  Rud eile de cloisimid go minic ar Raidio na Gaeltachta é agus sin ábhar misnigh chomh maith dúinn an dúthracht atá ann maidir le cúrsaí teangan. Tréaslaímid uilig leis agus ó tharla ag caint mé ar Raidió na Gaeltachta ba mhaith liom tréaslú leosan chomh maith ar an dul chun cinn átá déanta acu agus ar an obair thábhachtach atá á déanamh acu.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Kenny teilifís Ghaeltachta agus bhí sé ag súil go mbeadh rud éigin le rá againn faoi go luath agus luaigh sé an caiteachas a bhí i gceist.  Mar a dúirt mé, táimid ag fanacht ar thuairisc ón gcoiste seo a bunaíodh le fáil amach céard iad na moltaí atá acu ó thaobh cúrsaí teilifíse a chur chun cinn. Is é na smaointe atá agam féin mar gheall air &mdash; agus bhí mé ag caint le cúpla duine a aontaigh liom mar gheall ar seo &mdash; nach mbeadh an oiread sin costais ag baint le teilifís Ghaeltachta dá mbainfimís úsáid as cuid den am atá ag RTE 2 i láthair na huaire.  Mar tús tuigim gur féidir cláracha teilifíse a chur amach ó Ghaillimh, ó Thrá Lí, ó Chorcaí.  Ó Leitir Ceanainn.  Níl mionscrúdú déanta ar na cúrsaí seo ach sílim go bhféadfaí cláracha a chur amach gan mórán costais.  Ar ndóigh is é an rud ar mhaith linn nuair a rachaidh na cursaí sin ar aghaidh ná go mbeadh an bhonn don teilifís sna Gaeltachtaí féin mar a bhí ag Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a thosnaigh Raidió na Gaeltachta tús <Col N="1722" /> an bheag a bhí ann ach tá stiuideóanna lonnaithe anois i ngach Gaeltacht ach, faraor, mo Ghaeltacht féin, Gaeltacht Mhaigh Eo.  Táimid ag súil nach mbeimid ag fanacht rófhada eile le stiuideó a bhunú ansin.  Tosnaíodh le hiarracht a bhí lag go leor ach tá na stiuideóanna seo bunaithe anois ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ar fad ach Gaeltachtaí Mhaigh Eo agus níos mó ama á thabhairt anois do Raidió na Gaeltachta, rud a thaitníonn liom agus an-éisteacht á fháil ag na cláracha ar fud na tíre.  Is é an rud a bheas i gceist againn leis an teilifís go dtosnófar air mar chúrsa píolóiteach, agus nach mbeidh an oiread sin caiteachais i gceist nuair a chuirfear ar bun é.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta Kenny chomh maith cén céatadán den Chrannchur Náisiúnta a bheas le fáil ag an nGaeltacht.  Ní shílim go bhfuil aon chinneadh dearfa déanta go fóill ar na cúrsaí seo.  Ach beimid ag dúil go mbeidh scair mhaith le fáil againn agus sin rud a bheimid ag iarraidh a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Molloy faoin chonspóid agus faoin achrann a bhí san Ghaeltacht agus in Udarás na Gaeltachta le cúpla bliain.  Níl sé i gceist agamsa labhairt faoi na cúrsaí sin.  Tá sé sin caite; sin rud nach mbaineann leis an Rialtas seo agus an fhad is a bhaineann sé liomsa mar Aire agus leis an Rialtas séard a theastaíonn uainn go mbeidh baill Údarás na Gaeltachta, is cuma an iad na baill tofa iad nó na baill a thogh an t-iar-Aire, indeireadh saol an Rialtas atá caite, séard ba mhaith liomsa a fheiceáil go mbeadh na daoine sin ag obair le chéile ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Beidh mise mar Aire Stáit agus, tá mé cinnte, an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas ag iarraidh an oiread tacaíochta agus is féidir a thabhairt dóibh ar fad le cúrsaí a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht. Ní fheicim go bhfuil maitheas ar bith le hachrann mar a tharla leis an iarAire agus níl mise chun a thuilleadh cainte a dhéanamh faoi sin ach amháin a rá go bhfuilimid ag súil go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag dul chun cinn go maith mar a rinne siad leis na blianta atá caite maidir le fostaíocht agus obair a chur ar fáil do <Col N="1723" /> mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ag caint faoin fheilméireacht éisc luaigh an Teachta Molloy an dul chun cinn mór a rinneadh san Ioruaidh agus bhí sé ag moladh go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta páirteach san fheilméireacht éisc.  Rinne mé tagairt dó sin cheana agus arís aontáim leis mar a rinne mé i gcás an Teachta Kenny.  Bhí sé ag rá chomh maith go mba ceart an sample a thug muintir na hIoruaidh a leanúint agus tá sé i gceist ag cuid de bhaill an Údaráis cuairt a thabhairt ar an Ioruaidh arís i mbliana le fáil amach céard atá ar siúl annsin.  Bíonn caint i láthair na huaire faoi dhaoine a théann thar lear agus an caiteachas atá i gceist.  Sílim sa chás seo go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh eolas a fháil a rachaidh chun tairbhe don tír agus don Udarás agus nach ceart bheith ag caitheamh anuas orthu.  Beidh tairbhe le fáil as an turas seo agus sílim gur fiú tabhairt faoi.  Luaigh sé chomh maith an stáisiún taighde atá i gCarna agus an obair atá ar siúl acu agus nach bhfuil mórán airgid le fáil acu.  Is fíor go bhfuil an-obair déanta ag an Ollamh Ó Céide agus Ollscoil na Gaillimhe i dtaighde leis na blianta atá caite gan mórán airgid.  Is é an trua é má theipeann orthu san taighde atá ar siúl ceal airgead. Tá mé cinnte nach dtarlóidh sé sin.  Beidh mise ag súil go mbeidh siad in ann an obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl acu a choinneáil ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Molloy chomh maith an tábhacht atá le turasóireacht sa Ghaeltacht agus aontaimid ar fad leis sin. Sin plean atá ag an Údarás faoi láthair, na hacmhainní nadúrtha a fhorbairt agus caithfear turasóireacht a chur san áireamh nuair atáimid ag caint ar fhorbairt ár n-acmhainní nádúrtha.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil iarratas curtha isteach ag an Údarás chun go mbeidh páirt níos mó acu i dtionscal na turasóireachta.  Ach dá gceapfainn gurbh fhéidir leo cuid mhaith a dhéanamh bheinn i bhfábhar aon chuidiú gur féidir a thabhairt sa cheist seo maidir le tuilleadh cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás.  Ach tá deacrachtaí ann nuair a fheiceann tú go bhfuil boird réigiúnacha i láthair na huaire faoi Bhord Fáilte ag plé leis na cúrsaí seo.  Is é an deacracht atá <Col N="1724" /> ann, má bhíonn an iomarca eagras ar siúl go mbíonn siad ag teacht salach ar a chéile, agus cé go n-aontóinn ar fad leo níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé chomh furasta agus a dhearcann sé cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt dóibh maidir le forbairt na turasóireachta sna Gaeltachtaí ó tharla go bhfuil na boird réigiúnacha ann. Tá an méid seo ann, ar ndóigh, go dtig linn i gcúrsaí tionscail agus mar sin de, mar a luaigh mé faoin aonad ceardaíochta sa Spidéal, thig linn ar an mbealach sin comhshnaidhmiú a dhéanamh idir obair an Údaráis agus obair Bhord Fáilte maidir le turasóireacht a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Coughlan chomh maith an tábhacht atá leis na Gaeltachtaí a chur ar comhchéim le háiteacha eile ó thaobh seirbhísí de.  Aontaímid ar fad leis sin agus, ar ndóigh, má theastaíonn uainn go mbeidh tionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeidh forbairt tionsclaíochta caithfear cúrsaí cumarsáide a fheabhsú agus caithfear bóithre agus a leithéidí sin a chur chun cinn.  Sílim de réir a chéile go bhfuil an dul chun cinn sin ag teacht. Tá cúrsaí teileafóin anois i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhíodh agus tá cuid de na Gaeltachtaí a bhfuil aerstráicí bunaithe iontu, agus baintear úsáid astu seo ó am go ham.  B'fhéidir nach dul chun cinn anmhór é, ach mar sin féin tá feabhas ag teacht de réir a chéile agus beimid ag súil go leanfar leis sin.

Baineann an Ghaeilge linn uilig, agus táimid ar fad aontaithe faoin tábhacht atá leis an Ghaeilge agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Is breá an rud a fheiceáil go bhfuil ár scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge á mbunú ar fud na tíre.

Ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil, faraor, chomh minic agus ba mhaith linn.  Ní bhionn sí le cloisteáil ach amháin nuair a bhíonn díospóireachtaí agus mar sin de ann.  Ní ag caitheamh anuas ar dhuine ar bith atá mé nuair a deirim é seo, mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine a bhfuil deacrachtaí acu le Gaeilge, agus is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil daoine anseo sa Dáil atá ag déanamh iarrachtaí le Gaeilge a fhóghlaim agus le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Níl mé ag iarraidh a bheith ag caitheamh anuas ar dhuine ar bith, mar sílim go millfeadh sé sin an scéal ar fad. Is é an rud atá i gceist agam go mba cheart dúinn ar fad a chur i gcuimhne dúinn féin ó am go ham an tábhacht atá leis an Ghaeilge agus b'fhéidir dea-shampla a thabhairt mar a dúirt mé, agus í a úsáid níos minice anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais agus i dtimpeallacht na Dáil.

        <i>Limerick West):</i> This section defines a day's pay for the purpose of the new pay-related maximum fines in respect of offences against military law.  The exclusion of additional pay and allowances in this section will ensure uniformity of treatment under the law of persons of equal rank and service irrespective of any additional pay because of individual circumstances.  As the Deputy knows, there are basic incremental scales of pay prescribed for all ranks of the Defence Forces which ensure that officers and men of equal rank and service are paid the same basic rates.  There are, however, various additions to basic pay in certain circumstances; for example, professional or trade qualifications and for Border duties, escorts and so on. Apart from the administrative convenience involved, it is considered equitable that any additional payment because of individual circumstances be ignored in the calculation of a day's pay. I should like to give examples of a day's pay at the maximum current rate: a captain receives £39.93, a lieutenant £35.30, a sergeant £27.22, a corporal £24.57 and a private £22.55.</P>
      <P>Under section 120 of the Principal Act, a person who has ceased to be a member of the Defence Forces may be tried and punished for an offence committed while he was a member of the forces provided that his trial commences within three months after leaving the Defence Forces. This section basically deals with interpretation and if the Deputy requires further information I shall be glad to give it to him.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i>: This section updates the level of maximum fines which may be imposed by the District Court for a variety of offences in relation to military affairs and service property.  It provides for increases in the maximum fines which may be imposed on summary conviction in the District Court for offences in relation to military affairs or property under various sections of the Principal Act.  The existing levels of maximum fines were set more than 30 years ago and are very much out-of-date. To compensate for the decline in money values since 1954, generally speaking a tenfold increase is provided in this <Col N="1728" /> section.  However, persons convicted of certain offences may, as an alternative to a relevant fine, be sentenced to imprisonment and a fine or both.  There are 35 offences in relation to military affairs and property which are punishable by the District Court; 34 are listed in this section and the remaining one is covered in section 13.</P>

Failure to attend as a witness before an authorised or commanding officer dealing with an offence against military law is punishable at present by a fine of £5 which it is proposed to increase to £100.  That is more than a tenfold increase because it is a very serious offence.  Interference, etc., with signalling apparatus or navigational aids erected by the Minister and obstruction of an authorised person is punishable at present by a fine of £100 which it is proposed to increase to £1,000.  Making false answers to questions on attestation papers is punishable at present by a fine of £20 which it is proposed to increase to £200.  These are not pay-related fines.

      <P>In respect of the scale of the increases in the fines now indicated, could the Minister indicate the number of offenders who in the normal course of events would merit the maximum fine?  It is a cause of concern that some of the soldiers who are deemed offenders and are before the tribunals could face fines of £1,000.  Given the level of pay in the armed forces, particularly the regular forces, it has to be appreciated that a fine of £1,000 would represent <Col N="1729" /> a very substantial penalty.  Apart from the fact that this Bill is meant to update the legislation which is now some decades old, could the Minister tell us if there are any other reasons why the armed forces feel they need penalties of this severity? Is there any suggestion there is an increase of disorder in the forces?  Do the military personnel in command believe they are losing control of the rank and, for that reason, need the greater sanctions? It would appear that after the imposition of the ignominy of penalty within the forces, the delay in promotion and in the consequent increase in responsibility if one ends up answerable before these tribunals is sufficient to impose the discipline necessary.  Are we to some degree involved in an arithmetic, arbitrary and foolhardy exercise in increasing fines which up to now were in the order of £100 but which from now on will be in the order of £1,000?  What is the view of the Minister in that respect?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would like to remind the Deputy that all the offences covered by this section and by section 13 when we come to them are punishable by the District Court and the persons who would be charged and tried for such offences would be persons not subject to military law.  A person subject to military law who commits one of these offences, for example, incitement to mutiny or encouragement of desertion, would be charged and tried by a court marital under a separate section of the Act with an offence against military law and punished accordingly.  In response to the Deputy's direct question, our records show no prosecutions under any of the sections involved have been instituted in the District Court.</P>

      <P>The maximum fine is going to be £1,000.  I can appreciate it is important to update the fines &mdash; that has happened in many other areas also &mdash; but I presume that before the maximum fine would be imposed a very <Col N="1730" /> serious offence must have been committed. I want the Minister to point out how serious the offence must be before the maximum fine can be imposed.  What would happen if the person is not able to pay the fine, which, as Deputy McCartan pointed out, is quite likely?  There must be a humane approach to this matter and I would like to think that on an occasion such as this we would explore every avenue as it is a very serious matter, admittedly if only for a few soldiers. Nevertheless, it is very important that we are not seen to be too severe <i>vis-à-vis</i> the fines.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Again, I must point out to the Deputy this is not subject to military law but to the District Court.  The fines and the punishments which I have just outlined are the maximum that could be imposed.  The level of fine in any case would be a matter for the discretion of the District Court.  I have given the Deputy some examples of the offences committed which would be subject to the penalties I have outlined. Obviously, all of the offences would not carry the maximum penalty of £1,000 and it is an exaggeration to say that all offences would carry a fine of £1,000.  The amount of the fine would depend on the nature of the offence committed.  The fine for dyeing and conversion of uniforms used to be £10 but it is now going to be increased to £100.  The fine for bringing contempt on the uniform was £20 but this is now going to be increased to £200.  As the Deputy is aware, the district justice would use his discretion in situations such as these.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's earlier reply in regard to the fact that there have been no proceedings of this nature in the past and looking at the range of offences he indicated which seem to deal pre-eminently with military matters, has the Minister considered the desirability of having jurisdiction vested in the District Court to try these types of offences and should they not all be vested within the court marital procedures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Section 3 refers to military law as distinct from section 2 which refers to civilian law.  For the benefit of the House, I would like to state that section 3 provides for increases in the levels of maximum fines which may be imposed for offences against military law and the maximum amounts which an offender may be ordered to pay by way of compensation where compensation is appropriate.  It also provides for the linking of those maximum amounts to the daily rate of pay of the offender.  As I have said, the section provides for increases in the levels of the maximum fines awardable and where such offences occasion any expense, loss, damage or destruction compensation payable on summary conviction of an offence against military law in the case of officers, non-commissioned officers and privates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (b) and (2) (b) provides for similar increases <Col N="1732" /> in the maximum fines awardable and in compensation payable on conviction by court marital.  The current maximum fines awardable and compensation payable which were fixed in 1954 are now of nominal impact and are regarded as ineffective.  It is necessary to increase the present maxima to realistic levels. However, instead of prescribing increased monetary maxima, it is considered preferable that the maximum fines and compensation should be expressed in future in terms of a prescribed number of days' pay.  To this end the intention is that, broadly speaking, the relativity between the Defence Forces pay rates and the maximum fines and compensations which existed in 195455 should be restored and maintained. As the various maximum levels of fines imposible will increase or decrease in accordance with the movement in pay, they will remain at a realistic level and will continue to have a deterrent effect, which is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>It is most undesirable that the unsatisfactory situation that applies now in relation to fines, which has developed over the years since the levels were set, should be allowed to recur.  A seriously unsatisfactory situation arises.  By making the fines pay-related, the necessity for frequent amendments to the Defence Act of 1954 in order to keep fines at a realistic level will be avoided.  The purpose is to update the fines and when I am talking about fines I am talking about maximum fines.  Again, there is discretion within the court marital to impose any level of fine up to the maximum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I cannot disagree with that concept.  It would appear that that is a better system than having to bring in a Bill every so often and keep updating it.  There are a few points related to this section about which I should like to ask the Minister.  I understand that non-commissioned personnel may be charged with an offence under military law.  If they are found guilty on trial by a commanding officer, they can be sentenced to a very severe reprimand and it can be quite serious <Col N="1733" /> from their point of view under that regime.  One could argue that if they appeared before a District Court the fine could be very small.  There could be a great difference in the treatments.  I should like the Minister's view on that aspect.  There is some body of opinion in the ranks that would suggest that they would be much worse off appearing before a commanding officer <i>vis-à-vis</i> their future in the Army and their prospects of promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We are talking now of military offences tried before a commanding officer.  The Deputy is quite right in what he has said. I want to give some examples of the monetary amounts involved and to re-emphasise that the levels of fines are the maxima.  Officers imposing fines will be aware of the maximum figure applicable in each case but will have complete discretion to impose a fine of a lesser amount where this is deemed appropriate to the offence involved.  I am happy that this discretion will be exercised in a humane and sensible manner by the officers concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to fines, we shall take the private soldier as an example.  The maximum he may be fined at present on summary trial is £2.  In 1955 this represented about three days' pay.  The Bill proposes that the fine should be a maximum of three days' pay, or in presentday terms about £67.  The fines will, in practice, be expressed by the awarding authority as specific monetary sums. Taking the private soldier again as an example, the maximum compensation he is at present ordered to pay on summary trial is £10, about two weeks' pay in 1955 terms.  The Bill proposes to increase this to a maximum of nine days' pay, or about £200 in current terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discipline, as the Deputy knows, is essential in the Defence Forces and the system of military law is designed to enforce discipline.  If a soldier does not want summary disposal of a charge, he may opt for a court marital.  He may then appeal to the Courts Marital Appeal Court.  There are many avenues and <Col N="1734" /> many appeals open to him.  It is essential that we have discipline and this comes from the military themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that where there is no monetary penalty a person charged with an offence does not have any right of appeal before a court marital or the commanding officer?  If that is the case, why not?  I should have thought that there would be recourse to some type of appeal, whether inside or outside the Army.  I can see how important discipline is in connection with the Army.</P>

Regarding actual charges brought against them, are these personnel aware of the file that is being built up in the Army by their superiors on a continuing assessment basis?  Where members of the Defence Forces are in bad standing, but unknown to themselves, what is the process by which any &ldquo;black mark&rdquo; is made known to them?

I am told that one of the things that is worse than being hauled before a court marital is to make a complaint, in that those who complain, unlike in civilian life where the child that cries the loudest is fed first, are treated differently.</P>
      <P>In the Army there is a belief that if one complains one hinders one's opportunity of getting promotion.  Will the Minister reassure the House that that is not the case?

I must point out that many complaints are dealt with at company and unit level.  Any officer or man who feels he has a complaint may discuss it with his commanding officer and if the matter is not resolved to the complainant's satisfaction he may seek an interview with his brigade or command OC.

      <P>I would be greatful to receive that information because I am anxious to know how the proceedings work out.  The redress of wrongs was mentioned in the course of the Second Stage debate by the Progressive Democrats who intimated that they intended tabling an amendment on Committee Stage.  However, I do not see any sign either of the amendment or of a member of the Progressive Democrats.  I do not see anything wrong with the system in that it should be possible to make an appeal to the Minister but I would be interested to learn of the outcome of such appeals to the Minister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The number of cases referred to the Minister is very small as is the number of cases where the Minister decides in favour of the complainant.  That can be attributed to the fact that most problems are resolved by his superior officers to the complainant's satisfaction.  Many of them are dealt with at company and unit level and any officer or soldier who feels he has a complaint may discuss it with his commanding officer.  If it is not resolved to his satisfaction he may seek an interview with his brigade or command OC. Most problems are resolved in this manner.  Generally speaking applications to the Minister for redress of wrongs are only resorted to when all other approaches have failed to satisfy the complainant. I should like to emphasise that as far as this matter is concerned the person, officer or soldier, has direct access to the Minister to redress any wrongs or injustices.  That is enshrined in section 114 of the 1954 Act and it is something I highlight on my visits to the different Army barracks.  I will be continuing those visits in the coming months. I make it a point of having a discussion with the officers and men and make it <Col N="1737" /> clear to them that I want to be a Minister who is accessible.  I point out to them that as of right they have access to the Minister for Defence to redress any wrongs.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to point out that the punishments awardable by authorised commanding and subordinate officers are strictly limited by law and fall very far short of the scale of punishments which may be awarded by courts martial.  Any officer or man who is being dealt with summarily and in whose case the officer trying the charge proposes to impose a fine or some other punishment involving monetary loss is entitled to opt for trial by a court martial or, in the case where a private or seaman is being tried by a subordinate officer, to have the case dealt with by his commanding officer.  There are offences which may be disposed of summarily and they are laid out in the 1954 Act, for example, disobedience to a superior, insubordinate behaviour, disorderly conduct, absence without leave, a false statement about leave, drunkenness, obstruction of persons carrying out police duties, unauthorised use of service vehicles and conduct which would not be conductive to good order or discipline. In addition, some offences in relation to custody and enlistment may be dealt with summarily but only after reference to a superior authority who may or may not agree to summary disposition.</P>
      <P>I might add that only junior officers, captain and lower ranks, may be tried summarily and the offences for which they may be tried summarily are not specified.  The authorised officer to whom the case is referred has discretion in each case.  The Deputy will appreciate that the procedure is wide ranging and fair and that justice is done to complaints at all times.</P>

      <P>There are two further questions on which I would like the Minister to enlighten me.  One concerns the question of having a legal representative at the officer's disposal in the event of his being brought before a commanding officer.  Is it possible for him to <Col N="1738" /> have access to a legal representative?  The other question relates to confidential reports in relation to non-commissioned officers.  Do NCOs have an opportunity to be informed about what goes into assessment reports complied by their commanding officers about them and, if not, why do they not know what is happening?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There are no assessments.  With regard to the Deputy's other point in relation to legal representation, in summary convictions this is very informal.  It is not necessary to have the offender legally represented. These are very informal and so far as possible are disposed of.  Of course, the officers can opt for court martial if he so desires and then he can be legally represented.  In the summary conviction we would hope that he would be dealt with in a manner that is acceptable so that justice would be seen to be done to all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain circumstances some members of the force may feel that they were hard done by in relation to a serious matter because they were not allowed to have access to a legal representative.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy probably knows the answer to that as well as I do.  They should not do it because it is contrary to proper order and proper discipline.  It is not acceptable and I suggest that it should not be done. <Col N="1739" /> Military life is totally different from civilian life.  I was going to say the Army live in a different world.  They do not but their approaches to many things are different from ours.  I would not favour political interference or officers or NCOs making representations to politicians.  It is contrary to proper order within military life.  Proper discipline is essential in the Defence Forces and the system of military law is designed to enforce that discipline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked that question I expected the answer I got.  The Garda Representative Body are vociferous on matters relating to employment so far as the Garda are concerned.  In so far as the Army are concerned I would like to hear the Minister's general view on their right to form associations.  We do not have that system here.  I am not advocating it.  It has been mentioned to me that there may well be a case where a soldier has a grievance and, unless it comes up through the ranks, human beings being what they are, he might come up against a blank wall.  I know he has redress to the Minister and that eventually the complaint will reach the Minister's desk.  That is right and proper. Considering the way this has evolved in other walks of life, would the Minister see any opening in the near future for some form of association in which officers could talk about their problems in a more public way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> None whatsoever.  There is internal discipline in the Army.  As I have already pointed out to the House, there are means, ways and measures built into the Defence Acts, in particular the 1954 Act, whereby any wrong that has to be righted can be righted under the machinery available within the Defence Forces.  There is no comparison whatsoever between what the Deputy has just outlined in other bodies and the Defence Forces.  I want to reiterate that the discipline which is essential in the Army could not operate if there were organisations or other bodies <Col N="1740" /> looking after their interests.  This comes from the military and it is accepted by them.  As I said previously officers have direct access to their superior officers and ultimately to the Minister.  I have outlined this right time and time again on visits to various barracks throughout the country.  This right has not been denied by any Minister for Defence in the history of the State.  Any wrongs or injustices have been treated fairly and this has been acceptable to the military.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for making this important statement. From my knowledge the system for the redress of wrongs has worked quite well.  It is important that that should be made known on the floor of the House as the Minister has done and I want to be associated with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to point out that I am not the only one to have said this.  The former Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, emphasised this point during the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  It is important that I should emphasise a view other than my own Deputy Cooney said that the application for the redress of wrongs is submitted to the Minister in such a way that the Minister can make proper and fair decision.  He went on to say that the Minister would, of course, have available to him advice from both the civil and military sides of the Department on any technical consideration involved in any particular case, but that this should not and does not interfere with the independence of the Minister in reaching his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very satisfied that this procedure has worked well and will continue to do so while I am Minister for Defence.  Every decision submitted to the Minister has been dealt with fairly and in a way which is acceptable to all concerned.  Before it reaches the Minister, the redress of wrongs is dealt with by the superior officer.  The Deputy can be assured that no injustice will be done.  We have to be seen to be fair to the officers and men concerned because of the importance of <Col N="1741" /> discipline within the Army.  That discipline applies to superior officers and to the Minister in so far as he must deal fairly and squarely with any matters submitted to him for his consideration.  There must be discipline all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said regarding the availability of this procedure and accessibility to the Minister by all members of the Force is very important.  Does he consider that there is a certain element of contradiction in the notion of a direct line of access to the Minister since the complaint is processed and communicated through the aggrieved person's superior officer? From my limited experience as a practitioner in this area before entering this House, it appears that often the efforts of aggrieved members to seek redress of wrongs can be thwarted by a superior officer, who would identify his interests more closely with the deciding officer against whose decision the aggrieved member is seeking redress and access to the Minister.  I do not wish to denigrate the system, which has an exceptionally important proviso that any member can seek redress to the highest authority within the Armed Forces.  It is an exceptionally democratic procedure, but nevertheless there is and can be a tendency on occasion for the system to work less directly than the Minister has outlined. In many instances the redress of wrongs procedure is resorted to where there has been pettiness on the part of superior officers towards the enlisted man.  It is often an embarrassment that these matter should go as far as the Minister's desk.  When an aggrieved member seeks to embark on this process the inclination is to prevail on the aggrieved member not to pursue it because of the sheer pettiness of the matter.  We in the civilian side of life often lose sight of the confined atmosphere within the Armed Forces and the fact that a very small and petty decision can have profound implications for the enlisted man.  This underlines the importance of ensuring that there are no impediments in the process of appeal to the Minister.  Perhaps <Col N="1742" /> the Minister would consider the question of the line of communication being through the superior officer of the aggrieved person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i>: I can give the Deputy a categoric assurance that direct access to the Minister will not be interfered with in any way.  The aggrieved officer can address his complaint to the Minister but it has to go through the normal channels.  There is absolutely no question of any officer being able to prevent a complaint reaching the Minister.  I give that assurance and if during my term as Minister such an event occurs I will consider it a very serious misdemeanour.</P>
      <P>An important feature of the redress of wrongs procedure is that the test of eligibility of the complaint to be considered under section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954 is what the complainant himself thinks and not what any other person may feel.  If the complainant thinks himself wronged in any matter by his superior or other officer in the case of an officer, or by an officer or other man in the case of a man, then the complainant has a statutory right to make his complaint and have it investigated.  The Act provides that the Minister shall inquire into the complaint and give his directions thereon. Each complaint is thoroughly investigated and all the facts are sent to the Minister, who personally examines each case before giving his decision.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that we should have spent some time discussing this aspect because of the importance of discipline in the Army.  Discipline is a two way operation. The redress of wrongs procedure is an important aspect of discipline and it has been enforced by every Minister for Defence in the history of the State.</P>

It would be unthinkable in principle, but as a matter of prudence if any person was toying with such an idea he would be literally putting his career on <Col N="1743" /> the line.  There is no way there could be interference in that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will be prepared to review it but the Deputy knows full well there is always some overlapping in functions between different Departments and the line must be drawn somewhere. Perhaps it would have been more complete to transfer sea ferries entirely to the Department of the Marine along with other shipping, but as against that the sea ferries have a very important contribution to make to the tourist industry. Therefore, on balance it was decided to leave ferries with the Department of Tourism and Transport, but it can be looked at again.</P>

      <P>As mentioned in this House on previous occasions, parliamentary questions about possible legislation present particular problems for Ministers for Justice because of the very wide range of their responsibilities which cover virtually the entire area of the criminal law and large areas of the civil law.  Accordingly, the range of possible questions about amending legislation is almost unlimited.  Nearly all legislation involves extensive preparatory work and Government approval is also required.  It is not practical to deal with the issues involved between the time a question is put down and the time it is answered in the House.  When Government approval is given for an announcement about legislation to be made, it is <Col N="1748" /> done without delay in the normal course.</P>
      <P>That being said, I will have the matters mentioned in the questions, which involve a number of fundamental issues, examined in due course when other urgent legislative commitments have been disposed of.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that since the introduction of the Courts Act, 1981, which transfers most of the criminal law to the Circuit Court it is necessary in the interests of justice that prosecution would have a right to appeal a decision made by a court in relation to something they are unhappy about?  Will he agree it is unsatisfactory that this court, which is not a court of original jurisdiction and is not established under the Constitution, does not allow people to have that right?  Will he agree further that since this court deals with cases related to rape, manslaughter and so on, this is unsatisfactory?  Will he agree there have been many cases recently where the public were not satisfied that justice was done, that they have no recourse whatever to a second opinion and that in some cases, particularly in relation to the Fr. Molloy case, a decision of one person resulted in an acquittal and there was no further right of appeal? Does he agree this is unsatisfactory and has given rise to much public disquiet?</P>

Would the Minister take a look at correspondence which may be further back on his file in this regard &mdash; which passed between me and the Department under one of his predecessors &mdash; in which it appeared that the Department were willing to introduce amending legislation which would exclude from the possibility of appeal an acquittal by a jury?

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the adequacy of manning levels in the Garda Síochána, indicating his policy on the working of overtime by members of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 4 and Priority Question No. 49 together.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Garda Síochána Vote for overtime this year is £10 million, as compared with expenditure of £13.4 million in 1986.  The 1986 figure reflects a very high level of overtime in the first four months of the year, but a review of overtime expenditure and a general re-appraisal of Garda deployment carried out by the Garda authorities in May of last year resulted in the introduction of changes in the use of resources which brought about a significant reduction in the rate of overtime expenditure over the rest of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this year's overtime allocation, the Garda authorities are monitoring the position very closely and are taking the necessary measures to ensure that all essential policing duties are catered for within the limits of the funds allocated.  I must strongly make the point that the level of overtime provided for in the Garda Vote should not come to be regarded as a valid measure of the total <Col N="1753" /> Garda service available to the community. It should be borne in mind that the vast bulk of Garda duties are performed during ordinary, rostered hours of duty and not on overtime.</P>
    <P>The manning levels in the Garda Síochána must be looked at in the context of a number of considerations.  These include the very substantial increase in the strength of the force which has taken place in recent years, the new and improved technology which has been made available to the force, the welcome signs that the escalation in crime has been at least brought under control and, of course, the limitations imposed by the realities of our present economic situation. Taking all of these matters into account, it is considered that existing Garda manning levels are adequate to meet current requirements.  Of course the matter will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the very high level of overtime payments made last year &mdash; though there appears to be a slight reduction this year &mdash; indicate that the manning levels within the force are adequate?  Would the Minister say whether a cost-benefit analysis has ever been done to determine whether overtime costs are more expensive, or whether it might be more economical to increase recruitment?  Is it the Minister's intention to re-deploy personnel within the public service, within the Department of Justice, to carry out administrative duties, thereby releasing gardaí for patrol and other active duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge I do not think a cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken.  It is something that is important, something that has been brought to my attention in recent times, something to which I have given consideration to ensure that we get a proper return for the moneys involved.  The argument has been advanced publicly that we are not.  This deserves very serious consideration.  With regard to the redeployment of personnel, as I said in my reply, in May of last year, when the <Col N="1754" /> Garda authorities carried out a review of overtime expenditure and a general reappraisal of Garda deployment they introduced some changes with regard to the use of resources which resulted in a worthwhile reduction in the rate of overtime expenditure for the remainder of the year.  Those changes in methods benefit us considerably and they are still in operation.</P>
      <P>The overtime expenditure for the current year is based on improvements in operations brought about last May.  With regard to redeployment of personnel from the Department of Justice, as the Deputy knows, the public service embargo extends to that Department. We have not available to us sufficient personnel but if we had, we could take more gardaí from behind desks and put them on the street.  At present there are 580 members of the force working at desk jobs and it is estimated that at least 180 of those could be replaced by civilian personnel.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No doubt the Minister is aware that the cost of overtime for the Garda Síochána during an election or a referendum is approximately £750,000.  When the Estimate was drawn up there was no intention of having a referendum on the Single European Act.  Will the extra cost of £750,000 in overtime be contained within the Estimate of £10 million or is it the intention of the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to increase this figure by approximately 8 or 9 per cent to cover this cost?  My second question relates also to overtime.  As the Minister is aware, it has been the practice <Col N="1755" /> in Garda stations in Cork, Dublin and Limerick that members of the force parade approximately 20 minutes before commencing roster duty.  This is paid for out of overtime money and is part of the large amount of in-built overtime in the force.  Will the Minister confirm that he has made a decision to end this practice, that there will now be no parade time before duty commences, that there will be no overtime payment for parade time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question there has been always some unexpected event which has a cost factor as far as Garda involvement is concerned.  It happens to be a referendum this year; it could have been something else last year and the year before.  The Garda authorities are very conscious of the fact that the Government have decided that the ceiling of overtime for the present year is £10 million.  There is no way I can tell the Deputy that more money will be available because that cannot be.  With regard to the in-built overtime to which Deputy Noonan referred, a certain percentage of the amount of money available for that overtime is paid to only certain sections of the force for the ten or 15 minutes parading time in Garda stations in urban areas before the gardaí go on duty.  This has been an established practice during the years and before I or anybody in my position make decisions to change that practice as Deputy Noonan should know well, there would have to be consultation with the Garda associations to see what could be done about the matter.  I cannot confirm anything on this for the Deputy at present.</P>

In the same year I initiated the Landlord and Tenant (Group Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, which provides a low cost purchase scheme of existing ground rents on dwelling houses.</P>
      <P>The existing law therefore provides a ready means by which any person can free himself of a ground rent payable on his dwelling house.

      <P>Has the Minister at this stage received the draft Bill that the Justice spokesman when in Opposition, Deputy Michael Woods, prepared with a view to the abolition of ground rents, in particular, ground rents on local authority housing?

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must understand that the two pieces of legislation to which I referred and which came into operation in 1978 have been of considerable benefit to those genuinely interested in buying out their ground rents.  In fairness to my successors in office this scheme, which was initially introduced for a period of five years, was subsequently extended to facilitate members of the public who were anxious to buy out their ground rents.  I do not have any proposals for further legislation on ground rents at present.  I should say for the benefit of the House that up to the end of 1986 51,871 purchase applications under the scheme had been received in the Land Registry, 46,552 vesting certificates had issued to purchasers and there are about 5,300 applications on hands at present.  These figures will clearly show that the schemes introduced in 1978 have been effective and, as I say, I do not have any further proposals at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What is the current backlog in the Land Registry of applicants for the purchase of ground rents?  How long does it take from the date of application to having a vesting certificate issued?  Would the Minister outlined the priority procedures available to people who are selling their houses and want to sell them as freehold property?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the backlog, I am advised the figure is around <Col N="1760" /> 5,300.  The arrears mainly arose from the rush of purchase applications which were lodged in 1983-84 to take advantage of the old fees.  Deputy Noonan will remember that fees were increased somewhat at that time, and rightly so, for the purpose of covering the cost of operating the Land Registry.  As regards the delay in the issuing of vesting vertificates, the delay is two months in consent cases and one year in the case of applications for arbitration.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy McCartan's question, would the Minister assure the House that we would be reading his mind aright if we supposed, first, that the he takes the view that the abolition of ground rents &mdash; their expropriation from their owners &mdash; would be unlawful and unconstitutional, like the expropriation of any other form of property if it is done without compensation and, second, that the Workers' Party suggestion is that that abolition should take the form of an abolition compensated for by the State in ease of private ground rent payers?  There are many other items of social urgency which would have, with any rational man, a far higher priority than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Ministers for Justice have made it clear that existing ground rents can be terminated in one of two ways, by purchase or by confishcation of the ground landlords' property, and that termination without comprehensation to landlords would be unconstitutional. If compensation were to be made from public funds, this would involve a very costly charge on the Exchequer and in my view would be totally unjustifiable.</P>

These courses include driving courses, promotion courses, refresher training courses for recruits and certain specialist training such as training in the use of firearms.  These courses will continue to be held in Templemore.</P>
      <P>I might add that a project team representative of the Office of Public Works, the Garda authorities and my Department have been set up to carry out a detailed feasibility study to determine how best the existing accommodation in Templemore can be improved and developed to the standard required of a modern police training centre catering for all levels of Garda training, from recruit to senior management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of decisions to be made with regard to the facilities at Templemore.  The buildings are old Army barracks dating back to the last century.  As the Deputy will know, they are in very bad repair.  The Walsh report on Garda training has come out very strongly on this issue.  Because of that I have established within the last couple of weeks the type of committee I have just mentioned &mdash; composed of members of my Department, the building section of the Office of Public Works and the Garda authorities &mdash; to advise on how best we can improve the buildings having regard to what is required, and we will see where we are going from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern about the future but it is important that the cloud of uncertainty be lifted from the civilian staff and that their anxiety be dissipated.  Government policy will lead to inevitable closure of the centre.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the pre-election verbal and written commitments of his north Tipperary ministerial colleague to maintain recruitment and training staff in the centre and not to allow any diminution of its role?  The Minister should keep that commitment in mind in whatever review he undertakes.</P>

However, the fire officer has condemned the building and we must do something about it.  We have been advised that the building is totally unsuitable for the purpose for which it is used. If we wish to implement the proposals of the Walsh report and have recruits in training for a much longer period, we will have to face the problem in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>A citizen from a member state of the European Community residing in the State may apply to his local Garda station or, if resident in Dublin, to my Department for an application form for a residence permit.  Completed application forms are returnable to my Department for consideration under the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977.</P>
      <P>The number of residence permits issued in 1985 and 1986 were 157 and 156 respectively.  Statistics are not kept in such a way as to enable me to indicate the number of applicants who applied for residence permits during 1985 and 1986. Perhaps I should also point out that the figures mentioned are not necessarily indicative of the numbers of European Community nationals who have been legally residing in the State since 1985, as such persons can reside here without a permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Residence permits as such are not issued to non-EC aliens.  The latter may <Col N="1770" /> be permitted to remain in the State under the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975 under conditions which the Minister for Justice may attach and there may be frequent extensions of these permissions. Statistics are not kept in such a way as would enable me to indicate the number of non-EC nationals who applied for permission to stay in the State.</P>
    <P>Any alien residing in the State may write to my Department for an application form for naturalisation.  An applicant has to fulfil certain statutory conditions as specified in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.  Routine inquiries are made by my Department to establish if these conditions have been fulfilled.  An explanatory leaflet on naturalisation and citizenship is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that traditionally when an armed back-up was required it was provided by the Defence Forces and that our traditional policy was to have an unarmed Garda force with the exception of the special branch?  In view of the fact that we now more and more frequently see pictures of armed plain clothes gardaí on our streets would the Minister indicate whether there is a change of policy and if not, is it not now time that there should be a fundamental policy review on whether and to what extent our gardaí should be armed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Cooney.  The position in the earlier days, as Deputy Cooney has said, was that the armed back-up facility was practically always provided by the Army but during the last ten to 15 years greater numbers of gardaí have been armed.  I say that with regret as I am sure every Member of this House would.  It is a fact that armed gardaí are appearing more often than heretofore.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>To my knowledge the Army are very much relied on and have to provide armed back-up services to the Garda Síochána.  The Army are used at quite a number of checkpoints, even on a permanent basis.  There may be occasions when checkpoints have to be established as a matter of urgency and without any prior notice.  In such circumstances it may not be possible for Army personnel to be available at that time.  These are operational matters between the Garda Síochána and the Army.</P>

      <P>The Courts (No. 3) Act, 1986 was drafted to deal specifically with defects identified in the summons procedure by the Supreme Court in a judgement last December.  The provisions of the Act take account of the Supreme Court judgement and specific suggestions made by the Supreme Court.  I am assured that these provisions are sound in law and that there is no reason why they should not operate.  I am, however, aware that some district justices have doubts about the new procedures and are not operating them.  It appears that the problem can be resolved only by having the Act tested in the High Court.  I understand that there are a number of test cases awaiting hearing and that it is hoped to have them taken quickly.

He has applied to the High Court for orders <i>a certiori</i> against the Justices concerned.  The cases are expected to come before the High Court very shortly and the Deputy will appreciate that I have no control over the speed with which the High Court will proceed to hear these cases.

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  I appreciate that it is difficult to compile statistics in a country where we do not keep very good statistics in this and other areas.

      <P>With regard to the question, which is essentially a statistical question, I should tell Deputy Harney that the information which she sought in relation to all prisoners released from 1977 to date would cover about 30,000 releases.  This would involve a huge amount of research so the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty.  What was the Deputy's second question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors are taken into consideration.  The wide variation of the length of sentences served is partly explained by the fact that life sentences are mandatory on conviction for non-capital murder.  In deciding on release, account must be taken of the circumstances of the crime.  For example, a distinction could be made between a domestic murder and a murder committed in the course of an armed robbery. One of the factors which must be taken into account at this stage in determining the length of time to be spent in prison by those serving life sentences is the tendency in recent years for the courts to impose longer fixed sentences, such as 17 years in one kidnapping case and 20 years in a recent rape case.  There are a number of factors to be taken into consideration by those who recommend releases to the Minister of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has satisfied himself that the procedure for the issuing of warrants for the extradition of persons from this country to other jurisdictions is adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, from the terms of the question, that the Deputy is referring to the issuing in other jurisdictions of warrants which are sent to this country for execution.  The issuing of such warrants is, of course, a matter for the appropriate authorities in the other jurisdiction concerned and is subject to the law and procedure applicable in that jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> When such a warrant is sent to this country for execution our courts have to be satisfied that extradition may lawfully be granted on foot of that warrant.</P>
    <P>In recent years technical difficulties have been found to exist in relation to warrants sent here from Britain or Northern Ireland.  Within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference practical steps are being taken to enhance co-operation on legal matters, including measures to reduce the risk of technical difficulties in connection with warrants.  This co-operation will be a continuing process in the light of experience and developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been a number of extradition debacles such as the Glenholmes case and, last week, the McIntyre case? It seems that the Garda are arresting and charging those people under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.  I should like to know if the law officers of the State have had detailed discussions with the Garda in relation to the powers they have in regard to the arrest of such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the McIntyre case is a separate question for answer on another day.  With regard to the question about whether there is consultation between the Garda and the law officers on such matters, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it seems to be the case that the Garda are aware that warrants are going to arrive &mdash; obviously, there is some liaison between the issuing authorities in Northern Ireland and Britain and the Garda authorities here &mdash; but until they arrive they decide, rather than waiting for them or applying to a District Justice to get a warrant, to arrest people under wrong provisions?  Will the Minister agree that for technical reasons of that kind extradition proceedings are failing, which is unsatisfactory?  Will he agree that if expert legal advice was available to the Garda Síochána such technicalities would <Col N="1781" /> not arise and people would not be allowed walk free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of instances where technical difficulties arose in regard to the warrants received from Britain and the North.  There were errors and formal defects of one kind or another and because of this a procedure has been in operation for quite some time whereby all warrants received are subject to careful scrutiny and vetting by the Garda or the Attorney General's Office. If any defects are discovered the warrants are returned for correction before they are executed.  There may, on occasion, be hidden defects which it might not be possible to discover in that way, as in the Glenholmes case.  It is because of the difficulties that have arisen about the validity of warrants that discussions have taken place within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference between our Attorney General and the British Attorney General in an effort to ensure that the requirements of Irish law for the validity of warrants received here for execution are understood by the relevant authorities in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> 1.  In page 8, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Notwithstanding current practice, no officer shall be admonished except in the presence of two superior Officers and such admonishment shall not be recorded on the Officer's file for longer than 5 years.</P>
    <P>(b)  In a case of admonishment a defendant shall have the right of reply and representation, if he so wishes.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats feel that the Bill should deal with the question of the admonishment of officers.  There are occasions when an officer, considered to have committed a breach of discipline or some neglect, is deserving of trial by court martial by way of summary proceedings. In such a case the practice is to have him formally admonished by his superior officer.  That is a source of injustice and a procedure of doubtful legality because in practice it amounts to imposing a punishment without the safeguards inherent in a more formal trial. As long as the practice is permitted in this form there is always the possibility that a superior may be tempted in cases where the publicity of a trial would be unwelcome or where the proof to sustain a charge is not sufficient to punish an officer by this means.  The record of the admonishment is placed on the officer's file and there it remains forever like a time bomb.  It is possible that an admonishment for some indiscretion committed as a young lieutenant may be decisive in denying that officer's promotion to a senior appointment in 20 years time.  The Progressive Democrats believe this procedure should be revised so as to make provision for safeguarding against possible injustice.  The record of admonishment or reproof should be given a life of not more than five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> We will deal with the amendment although strictly speaking it does not come within the scope of this section.  Admonishment is not provided <Col N="1838" /> for in the Act.  It is prescribed in paragraph 97 (a) of the Defence Force Regulations A.7 for misconduct or negligence for which the officer concerned has submitted no satisfactory explanation.  When an officer is to be admonished the Adjutant General must first be notified of the circumstances of the case and he may direct that the admonishment be recorded on the officer's record sheet. Any arrangements such as is contemplated in the amendment would be appropriate for consideration in the context of the Defence Force Regulations. It would not be appropriate to include such a provision in the Defence Act. Nevertheless I want to assure the Deputy at this stage that I will have the proposals inherent in his amendment examined and I give him a commitment that I will let him know the outcome.  It is not appropriate to have this amendment included in this legislation or in the Defence Act but it can be prescribed in the Defence Force Regulations.  I will have the contents of what is contemplated in the amendment examined in the context of the Defence Force Regulations but not in the Act.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that admonishment may or may not be recorded at the discretion of the Adjutant-General. Where an admonishment is recorded, an officer may, of course, by his subsequent service and conduct neutralise any effect such a recording may have on his promotion prospects.  I would like to again remind the Deputy and the House that it is open to any officer who thinks himself wronged, either in relation to the giving of the admonishment or the recording of it, to submit an application to the Minister for redress of wrongs under section 114 of the Defence Act.  I referred to this this morning when we discussed the redress of wrongs under section 3.  I explained fully that any officer or NCO has direct access to the Minister who can redress any wrongs.  The Minister is obliged to inquire into the complaint and to give his direction on it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Progressive Democrats' intervention into this discussion.  We missed them badly this morning.  Apparently they missed the beginning of the debate.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider two factors in relation to section 4(b)(8) of the Bill.  Firstly, the notion of dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces is something he should not at this point consider dropping entirely as a concept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept the answer given by the Minister because admonishment on a record is a very old concept; it has been there since before the foundation of the State.  Present-day officers are entitled to better treatment than having black marks on their records for years which may interfere with their promotion prospects.  I would be grateful if the Minister would accept our amendment in relation to this because it is not asking too much of him.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This amendment is not appropriate to the Act but it is very appropriate to the regulations.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister how he has come to the conclusion that the proposed amendment is not appropriate to be included in the Act and that it should only be included in regulations the Minister may make. Surely it is this House who determine whether a matter is appropriate to be included in the Act?  If it is the wish of the House to include this amendment in <Col N="1840" /> order to give a safeguard against the type of situation arising, as mentioned by Deputy Clohessy, then surely this House is the appropriate authority to decide whether it should be included in the Act? I cannot understand how the Minister could rise and base his case about the amendment &mdash; I am not too sure whether he is for or against it &mdash; on the sole plea that it is not appropriate to have it included in the Act.  If the House decides that this amendment should be included in the Act, then it can be made.  Those of us who have had experience in this Department know the effect admonishments of this kind can have on the future promotion and career prospects of officers.  Personal files are kept on each member of the officer corps in the Army and when promotions are under consideration every single detail on those files is taken into consideration.  It is true that an indiscretion carried out when an officer is young remains on his file.  When it is a close call between two people 15 or 20 years later for a promotion a matter such as this should be deemed irrelevant but it is often taken into consideration in determining the matter.  A minor incident committed by an officer in a bar or in an officers mess in some barracks can be recorded and can be a determining factor in whether he is promoted 15 or 20 years later.  I do not think that is just, particularly where one officer is the admonishing person.</P>
      <P>Our amendment merely seeks to ensure that if there is an admonishment it should be done in the presence of two superior officers.  This is a very reasonable proposal.  Unless the Minister can give cogent reasons as to why it is not relevant, the amendment should be accepted.  The argument about appropriateness is not relevant.</P>

As I said there are no provisions to have this amendment included in the Act but I will consider it very carefully under the Defence Force Regulations.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> When the Defence Bill, 1954, was under consideration the question of providing for admonishment was examined.  The line then taken was that it seemed pointless to add &ldquo;admonishment&rdquo; to &ldquo;reprimand&rdquo; and &ldquo;severe reprimand&rdquo;, thus having three degrees of &ldquo;telling off&rdquo;.  There was a more serious objection.  Admonishment relates to an incident of Army life but it is not a punishment as a result of trial by a commanding officer or a court martial.  Many complaints against officers do not come to trial and usually end by the Adjutant-General directing that the officer be admonished.</P>

If, as proposed, a time limit of five years were introduced, a similar argument could be advanced for various other forms of punishment which are laid down.

He must often have occasion to discuss matters of this kind with military personnel on a non-political basis.  It is very much a bone of contention in military circles that admonishment is allowed in the manner in which it is applied.  It is strongly believed that a procedure should be introduced to revise the system and make provision for safeguards against possible injustices.  It is felt in particular that admonishment should not be a life sentence, in other words that it should not stay on a man's file for the whole of his military career.  The two main points in the amendment are that admonishment should be done in the presence of two officers and that it should have a life of five years, not the 12 months to which the Minister referred in his reply.</P>

      <P>We have been here a long time and we know what words mean. The Minister had an indication of the Progressive Democrats' views on this matter through Deputy Clohessy's contribution on Second Stage.  That was some time ago and he has had ample time to consider the matter.  It is a weak argument to say that he will consider it further now.  Surely he must have made up his mind whether he is in favour of what is proposed.  If the Minister is prepared to communicate to the House that he is disposed to make an amendment to the regulations to give effect to this amendment, it might help us to move on in this debate.  Otherwise it is difficult to see how we can make progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provision in section 4 (1) (a) for alternative and additional penalties to be available for punishment of officers, namely, reduction in rank.  However, I wonder if the Minister will consider in this modern time abolishing from the record of punishments dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces under section 4 (1) (d).  As Deputy Molloy said, it is rarely that legislation dealing with regulations within the armed forces comes before the House and probably it will be a long time before we debate anything of this nature again.  The risks are that, if the same period of time elapses as has elapsed since the last such Bill was before the House for discussion, we will be into the next century before the House will be discussing legislation of this nature again.  It is appropriate and timely that we should consider whether there is a need for the provision of dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces.  For any serving soldier, dismissal from the Defence Forces in itself carries shame and ignominy.</P>
      <P>I do not necessarily support the abolition of this notion on the same grounds as Deputy Clohessy does as expressed in his contribution to the House on Second Stage, highlighting the fact that the penalty of death was available to the Minister if needed and that he could not then see the need for such dismissal with ignominy.</P>

      <P>To suggest that the availability of the death penalty is an alternative to discharge with ignominy is hardly good grounds for arguing for the development of liberal policies of punishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (1) (d) the substituted subsection (8) provides that where a person is so dismissed with ignominy he will be disqualified forever from serving the State again in any military capacity. Probably that goes without saying as a matter of practicality.  However, I am concerned about paragraph (b) in that substituted subsection which suggests that the person dismissed would not be entitled to act or serve in any civil capacity during the period of seven years beginning on the date of his dismissal. The principle must be stressed here that penalties within Aemy life should be confind to Army life.  It is unfair to provide for two penalties for someone who is dismissed from the armed forces with or without ignominy who clearly as a serving member has suffered the greatest penalty. It is unfair to follow into the resumed civilian life of that member so that he or she is substantially disadvantaged in pursuing a career.  Again as a matter of practicality, the likelihood of a person in the position envisaged by the section applying on the one hand for State employment and on the other hand being considered suitable is small.  I wonder if there is any need for this provision at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, having been discharged from the armed forces, could well turn their hand to an academic career or to some other very useful training or qualification, and that has not been unusual. <Col N="1847" /> I am sure the Minister will agree there are many instances of people sent from the Defence Forces who have taken up very useful careers in civilian life.  I am not satisfied that the proviso in subsection (9) allowing for Government discretion in the area of removal is satisfactory.  If the position is envisaged, as clearly it is under that proviso, that a person could well be recognised as being capable of making a useful contribution to the civil administration, the Government could well consider employing that person. Does that not really reflect what would happen whether or not you had the provision for disqualification for seven years?  It is in some way reflective of an analogous to the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, when a person convicted of certain offences under that Act is disqualified from holding public office or from being employed by the State for a stated time. However we must come back to the first point.  It is important that the penalty or penalties that can be attracted for a misdemeanour within Army life should be confined to the regime there and it is basically unfair to follow a person into resumed civilian life with the penalties that have been meted out to them as members of the armed forces.  I ask the Minister to take those two matters in hand in the final stags of this Bill and to tidy it in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reduction in rank, as I stated on Second Stage, makes reasonably good sense but I have discussed the matter with a number of people since then and it seems that in an Army the size of ours it could be argued that a reduction in rank might be as serious a penalty as a person could have levelled against him.  With an Army of 13,000 or 14,000 that is unlikely to be forgotten by anybody.  It is debatable whether it would be seen in the same light as the Minister sees it.  I suppose it is a step forward.  I want to ask the Minister about the length of time a person is prohibited from entering into employment in a civilian capacity after his dismissal <Col N="1848" /> from the Army.  I understand that at the moment a person who has been so dismissed is prohibited from obtaining State employment, in a broad sense.  I want the Minister to comment on that because, if that is so, it is as serious a sentence as one could wish to give whatever the misdemeanour might be.  Whilst the Government have the power to remit part of that seven years sentence in respect of outside employment.  I should also like to know from the Minister the number of cases dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a step in the right direction and seems to be a more humane approach.  I agree with what Deputy McCartan said, that there are occasions on which one could argue that unless there was a very serious offence involved &mdash; when somebody was dismissed from the Army &mdash; not too many hurdles should be placed in the way of their obtaining employment afterwards. The seven years appears to be rather long but, in relation to the existing provision, constitutes a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty of dismissal with ignominy is something that is imposed very rarely only and for the gravest of offences, never for a misdemeanour, as Deputy Connaughton suggested &mdash; he may have used the word technically &mdash; but it is imposed for the gravest of offences only.  As the Minister has indicated, within the last decade, there was one such dismissal only.  That was for murder when an offending member murdered colleagues in the Lebanon. Members will remember that particularly notorious and tragic case.  As this is such a rare punishment it should have the usual consequence of causing the person concerned to be prohibited from State employment.  That is not an unreal consequence to add to that punishment having regard to the extraordinary degree of offence that would merit such punishment in the first instance.  There is the further safeguard here, that should the <Col N="1849" /> penalty be out of proportion to the offence and the consequential disemployment be also out of proportion, the Government can move to cure it by removing the disqualification before the end of the seven years or, indeed, at any time.  It is important that the penalty should remain.  The application of the penalty is being amended in a humane, proper and sensible way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision for the reduction in rank of a commissioned officer, I cannot recall what would be the consequences on the seniority list of the rank to which the officer is demoted?  At what point in that seniority list will he be inserted?  Will he go in at the top of the lower rank or at the bottom of the lower rank?  Obviously his arrival into the lower rank will throw the order of seniority out of gear.  As the Minister possibly knows by now one matter that often comes to him by way of application for redressing wrongs is when the seniority list is ever interfered with, people feel themselves prejudiced by that interference, feel a wrong has been done to them.  Seniority is a very important aspect of the promotion process.  If an officer is reduced in rank &mdash; say the case of a commandant being demoted to captain &mdash; what effect will his arrival into the ranks of the captains have on the captains already in that rank?</P>
      <P>A further point that occurs to me is that if an officer is demoted at a certain age the demotion may be more than just demotion.  It may mean an earlier termination of his career because, if he is demoted to a lower rank, the retiring age for that rank may be much closer to his actual age than the relevant retirement age of the rank from which he was demoted.  I presume that the body imposing the punishment would take that into account and would not add a double penalty.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister on the consequences of the demotion on the seniority list of the lower rank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Not necessarily.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.  The existing disqualification is life-long, as has already been pointed out, in respect of both military and civil employment.  The disqualification for civil employment is being modified, placing a seven year limit on its operation.  I should say also that the Government would have power to lift this part of the disqualification at any time.  It should also be mentioned here that a court martial is never required by law to impose a sentence of dismissal or discharge with ignominy.  Even where a sentence of dismissal or discharge is mandatory, the court may always award such a sentence without ignominy.</P>
      <P>The punishment of reduction in rank, without doubt, is a severe one.  Because of its severity it is likely to be imposed for very serious offences only, such as might otherwise warrant a sentence of dismissal from the Defence Forces.  The existence of a less severe punishment than dismissal but a more severe one than any of the lesser punishments now available, will give courts martial a useful alternative which will have the merit of not depriving the officer concerned of his livelihood.  Over the years experience has shown that many non-commissioned personnel who were sentenced to be reduced in rank, by diligent service and effort have been able to rehabilitate themselves, regaining their previous rank. There is no reason an officer should not be able to do the same.  It is unlikely that the issue will arise very often in the case of officers.  In practice it would be an option available to the appeal court if they saw fit to exercise it in cases where an officer appealed against a sentence of dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might reiterate what I have said, that because of its consequences in relation to <Col N="1851" /> State employment, this sentence is one rarely imposed and then for very serious offences only.  It is something I have considered very carefully in the context of this Bill.  I am satisfied that what is being proposed is reasonable, fair and &mdash; I might add &mdash; has been accepted by the military authorities themselves.  I am prepared to stand over the provisions in this Bill having had consultations with everybody concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to explain to the House how effective he thinks an officer would be in fulfilling his military duties if he were to suffer the penalty of reduction in his commissioned rank?  Is it not true that the Army is built on discipline and respect for senior officers, that the whole morale of its structure is built on that and is rigidly applied?  If, henceforth, an officer who enjoys certain respect from his subordinate officers is himself to be reduced in rank is it not possible that he will become a very ineffective officer?  I have the fear that this step would have an adverse effect on morale within the Army, that it would be detrimental to the general development of loyalty within its ranks, particularly in a small country like ours whose Army is small in numbers.</P>
      <P>I fail to see what level of authority an officer would be able to command over his subordinates if he himself suffered a reduction in rank.  Take the example of a commandant reduced in rank to a captain or even to that of lieutenant &mdash; the Minister has not said it would not be possible for an officer to be demoted back one or two ranks, say a lieutenant-colonel demoted to the rank of lieutenant or of captain &mdash; I cannot see how such an officer could continue to play an effective role and fulfil his duties in our Army.  I would like the Minister's thoughts on that matter to dispel any fears there might be in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1)  In any proceedings before any court-martial or before any other Court established under the Constitution, a certificate purporting to be signed by an officer of the Permanent Defence Force not below the rank of Lieutenant Colonel:</P>
      <P>(a)  to the effect that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force is or was during any period a part of an International United Nations Force, or,</P>
      <P>(b)  to the effect that any officer or man of the Permanent Defence Force is or was during any period a serving member of such a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shall, without proof of the signature thereon, be admissible in evidence and shall be sufficient <Col N="1853" /> evidence without further proof of the facts stated therein, unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section &lsquo;International United Nations Force&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by Section 1 (1) of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>In a recent Lebanon court martial a difficulty arose in relation to providing that the accused was subject to military law. An Irish soldier serving as part of an international United Nations force is deemed, for the purpose of the Defence Acts, to be on active service and therefore subject to military law.  The problem is that there is no way of providing that a UN force is duly constituted for the purpose of being an international United Nations force within the meaning of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed amendment is to permit proof of the status of such a force by a duly signed certificate of a senior officer of the Permanent Defence Forces.  The absence of such a procedure makes it necessary to have evidence of a Government official to prove a Dáil resolution and of a UN official to prove a UN resolution.  This causes delay and expense.</P>

      <P>Irish troops have been serving abroad for nearly 30 years and during that time the need for such a provision arose on one occasion only.

      <P>The purpose of the amendment moved by Deputy Clohessy is to make it possible to prove in Irish courts martial that a person is or was at any given time subject to military law by virtue of being on active service.  The legal difficulty is that lawfully one cannot be on active service in the Irish Defence Forces outside the State unless under some statutory authority and the only statutory authority that exists for such service with a UN force is under the <Col N="1855" /> Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.  Unfortunately, that Act, when it was introduced in the House &mdash; it was the second Bill, which dealth with the same topic, to be introduced in a year &mdash; provided particular circumscribed circumstances in which a contingent could be sent on a peace-keeping role under the aegis of the United Nations.  In that context it was not anticipated that the restrictions, that is, that a certain form of resolution had to be adopted by the United Nations and that this House had to make a certain form of resolution, could in the last analysis provide obstacles to proof that a member of the Permanent Defence Forces was at any given time subject to military law.  If strict proof of the matter is required in any court martial and I have some limited experience of this, the only way it can be proved is by producing to the court martial some admissible evidence of the proceedings of this House and also admissible evidence of the proceedings of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In the trial to which the Minister referred, a United Nations Deputy Secretary General had to be flown from New York to Ireland and brought to the Curragh in great pomp and circumstance and at great expense to the taxpayer to prove the making of a resolution by the relevant council of the UN at the time.  That was a remarkably round-about way of effectively plugging a loophole in a case, one which might not be raised by an accused person, because it was not an issue, unless there was difficulty in proving it.  Likewise, the Secretary of the Government in that case had to go before the same court martial and produce the record of this House in order to prove that the House had authorised the presence of Irish soldiers in a UN contingent in the Lebanon. Such things should not be the matter of controversy between an accused person and the prosecutor in a court martial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Minister is correct in saying it has arisen on one occasion only, it is not safe to conclude it is an entirely rare bird that will not arise again.  The fact that it was brought up on one <Col N="1856" /> occasion and proved in that manner will inevitably occur to some advocate, be he military or civil, appearing before a court martial whenever a similar necessity of proof arises.  Although the conduct of our soldiers abroad is exemplary and there have not been very many courts martial of Irish soldiers held in Ireland to adjudicate on their guilt or innocence in respect of offences committed while abroad, it is not to be assumed there will not be more of these courts martial, although I hope for lesser offences.  In those circumstances the same difficulty of proof arises in each case &mdash; proof of the status of the member of the Permanent Defence Forces is a necessary proof.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to avail of the opportunity presented by the passage of this Bill to amend the law to take what is effectively a technical defence away from an accused person and to take away from the State an expensive onus of proof.  The Minister said he wanted time to consider the matter because there may be legal implications.  We do not want to be unreasonable, but I would like to point out a few things about the legal implications of such a certificate.  First, although it is a necessary proof in some cases, it is not one which is, in general terms, likely to be contested if there is an easily accessible way of proving it. Secondly, the way in which Deputy Clohessy has phrased his amendment means that the certificate will be sufficient evidence without further proof of the facts stated in it, unless the contrary is shown.  That does not mean it could infringe the Constitution by being conclusive evidence.  It is not conclusive.  It only brings the matter beyond the point of requiring further proof unless there is controversy, and sustainable controversy, about it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to amend the Bill in this way because it is evident that at some future stage a person accused of an infringement of military law in Lebanon or while on a United Nations operation will avail of the inconvenience and expense involved to put the State to equal expense or to the much less desirable alternative of saying it is not worth <Col N="1857" /> proving the case against him because it is so insignificant and then dropping the case.  It would be most embarrassing if the State had to make a choice between spending £5,000 or £10,000 to move a United Nations official to this country or letting a man off without proving his guilt. It appears that this clause is a sensible way out of that difficulty.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of this amendment shows that a cetificate will not be given lightly because it will require a lieutenant colonel to be the purported signatory. That, of itself, means these certificates will not be abused or thrown about in courts martial with a degree of carelessness.  This is a serious certificate, but a necessary certificate, unless proof of the contents of the certificate can otherwise be supplied.  I urge the Minister to consider the potential embarrassment he will be saved and the saving that will accrue to the taxpayers if he introduces an amendment of this kind, not out of caution or an unwillingness to face a problem which has occurred only once, but which will occur much more often especially when it is in the interests of the accused members of the Permanent Defence Forces to avail of this legal advice.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial amendment which will improve military law and will make the conduct of court martial more realistic and make the conduct of accused persons more realistic.</P>

I have already stated I am accepting the arguments put forward but the House must appreciate I got this amendment only three hours ago and, in those circumstances, I am not prepared to accept it.  I am having the case seriously examined. I know this only happened once but I am prepared to have an amendment introduced in the Seanad.  I can assure Deputies that the Bill will have to come back to this House for further discussion before the legislation passes into law.  I repeat there is no unwillingness on my <Col N="1858" /> part to accept the argument in the amendment.</P>
      <P>A member of the Permanent Defence Forces is subject to military law at all times.  The point that arose in the case referred to by the Deputy was whether the individual was on active service and thus open to trial by court martial for murder.  This issue arises only in relation to very serious charges such as murder and manslaughter.  It would not be a problem in relation to less serious offences.  I want to help Deputy Clohessy and I ask him to accept that I will have this amendment examined.  I ask him to accept also that since I received his amendment a very short time ago I was not able to come to a decision on it because there may be serious implications.

Other objects have been obstructions in the past and I remember it was very hard to get the aerial to which I referred removed, although it was deemed to be dangerous for aircraft.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15. &mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Principal Act, the Minister shall not promote an Officer unless the Officer has been recommended for promotion by the Chief of Staff.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Up to June 1975 the promotion of an officer by the Minister for Defence depended, <i>inter alia,</i> on being recommended for promotion by the Chief of Staff.  In June 1975 the then Minister. former Deputy Donegan, wished to promote an officer not recommended by the then Chief of Staff, the late General T.D. O'Carroll.  Rather than operate within the law, the then Minister, in order to appoint his own man, changed the law. As a result of the amendment which he introduced, it is now only necessary that the Minister should consider any recommendation made by the Chief of Staff and then promote an officer, notwithstanding the possible objection by the Chief of Staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the amendment of Regulation A15 was introduced, it was bitterly opposed by the Fianna Fáil Opposition and pledges were given that it would be repealed at the earliest opportunity. However, this was never done.  The Progressive Democrats feel that the amendment of the then Minister, former <Col N="1862" /> Deputy Donegan, should now be repealed as it gives the Minister dangerously wide powers in the matter of promotion of officers particularly to senior rank, and introduces political patronage in a profession whose members have sworn allegiance to the State and non-membership of a political party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Defence Force Regulations provide that the Minister may, having considered such recommendations as may be made by the Chief of Staff, promote an officer from one rank to a higher rank.  This wording was introduced by the then Minister, former Deputy Donegan, on 17 June 1975.  Prior to that date and since the coming into operation of the Defence Act, 1954, on 1 January 1955, a Minister exercised his authority on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  Under Defence legislation, the Minister for Defence has, since 1924, been the promoting authority in so far as the promotion of officers is concerned.  Having regard to the position of the Minister and the Government in relation to the Defence Forces, it would not be appropriate to alter the legislation in this respect.  The relevant provision in the Defence Act, 1954, is contained in section 45.  The manner in which he exercises that authority, laid down in a Defence Force Regulation, is a separate matter which does not arise in the context of the consideration of the Bill before the House.  I assure the House that during my term of office promotion procedures will be applied fairly and with regard to the recommendations of the Chief of Staff.  The Minister for Defence is the promoting authority and he will have to have due consideration to the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment proposed by Deputy Clohessy.  We must seize this opportunity to bury once and for all what has come to be known as the Donegan amendment. It was a very unfortunate development in <Col N="1863" /> the policy of promotions in the armed forces that the Minister of the day saw to impose his view contrary to that of the commanding officer or the Chief of Staff of the day.  To the extent that the amendment now being promoted by Deputy Clohessy seeks to confront that matter and notwithstanding the assurances the Minister has given to us today &mdash; and I have no doubt that he means well in what he has said &mdash; it is important that this House puts on the Statute Book a clear affirmation of the principle that the Chief of Staff of the armed forces should always have the important say, if not the veto, on any promotions within the forces under his command.  For that reason this is a worthwhile amendment. I accept that it does not come within the particular order or regime of the Bill as drafted and presented to the House but that is not a fair or valid reason to prohibit the acceptance of any useful amendment which might well come from any quarter of this House.  On this occasion the amendment deserves to be accepted and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
      <P>To the extent that it reflects his earnest intentions, and it does no more than that, in his term as Minister it should present no difficulties either to himself or the Government to append it to the Bill in passing.  To that extent the Minister should take it on board as reflecting not only, as Deputy Clohessy has said, the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party when this matter first arose but also to the extent that it reflects his Government's policy. There is a feeling on all sides of the House at present that it should be put on the Statute Book as a clear declaration that while the ultimate authority is the Minister's Office nonetheless the Minister's Office would reflect and respect the undoubted important position of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces with regard to order, discipline and promotion within the forces under his command.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but if <Col N="1865" /> the matter is entirely governed by regulation, as section 45 effectively says it is, and the Minister has power to promote people only in accordance with regulations and you accord to the Minister the right to make such regulations, you are giving him a free hand. If the former Deputy Donegan in his wisdom in 1975 could introduce regulations which only required him to give consideration to what the Chief of Staff recommended, obviously it would have been open to him &mdash; to amend the regulations so as not to require him to give any consideration to anybody's views on the matter but to exercise his own totally unfettered discretion in relation to promotion. That is the weakness in this procedure. If the regulations the Minister had to make under section 45 had to be approved by this House, this House would have an opportunity to decide yes or no on any particular regulations made by the Minister on how the system of promotions was to be governed.  What the Minister now says is that it is not appropriate to provide in an Act what has heretofore in substance been covered by regulation and what is clearly envisaged in the Act as being the proper subject matter of regulations.  I would go along with him if there was any way of ensuring that a Minister would not decide to change the rules and move the goal posts by bringing in different criteria for promotions.  That is what we object to so strenuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the armed forces are to be free from political interference, it is quite obvious they must be kept free by the law of the State and not by a mere undertaking &mdash; if the Minister will permit me for describing it as such &mdash; given on Committee Stage of an amendment Bill to the Defence Act.  It is not good enough that we have to take the undertaking of a Minister in relation to this matter.  The law of the land used to be as set out in the regulations before the former Deputy Donegan changed them when promotion other than in accordance with the advice of the Chief of Staff was unlawful.  The former Minister then changed the role of the Chief of Staff to a consultative and <Col N="1866" /> advisory one.  While we accept the Minister's bona fides when he says he will regard himself as bound by the Chief of Staff's recommendation and will not go behind it, as far as we are concerned that is not good enough.  The Minister may not always be there as Minister.  What Deputy Clohessy's amendment seeks to do is put into law what was previously set out in regulation but which was cynically changed by a Minister of the day in order to suit his own convenience.  The amendment seeks to put into law the requirement that the views of the Chief of Staff should be abided by and that promotions made by the Minister should be in accordance with and on foot of his advice.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to say that regulations were the proper way to deal with this and statute is not, then the obvious conclusion would be for the Minister to agree to an amendment of section 45 of the Principal Act so as to provide that regulations in relation to the promotion of officers should not have effect unless they are brought before this House and approved by it.  Therefore, the agreement of this House would always be necessary for any particular moving of the goal posts or cynical manoeuvre by any of the Minister's successors, or predecessors as should have been the case.  Of course, there is no such undertaking coming from the Minister today.  He is not saying this is a matter which cannot be changed without the say-so of this House.  We say it should be and unless we can bring in an amendment of the kind now suggested by Deputy Clohessy, the only other way to ensure that another Minister, a successor of the present Minister, will not abuse his position is to deal with the matter by way of requiring that regulations be approved by this House rather than simply being made by a Minister and laid before the House by putting them in the Library where nobody can effectively do anything about them.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of considerable moment.  It is one on which, unlike the other amendments put forward by Deputy Clohessy, the Progressive Democrats take the view that we will not allow it to be simply dealt with on the basis <Col N="1867" /> that this would be considered by the Seanad.  If the Minister really believes in the terms of the undertaking he has given to this House he should have no objection to encapsulating the principle he says he stands by in the law of the land.  If he really believes in it as just a matter which should be dealt with by regulation, the sad fact is that another Minister such as Deputy Donegan could do precisely the same thing in five or ten years' time and there would be no defence to it.  The Army are necessarily politicised by making ministerial discretion stand where heretofore and with perfectly good results there was no such ministerial discretion in the sense that the Chief-of-Staff's advice was something which had to be acted on rather than something which had to be paid regard to.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned this is a point of principle.  It is one on which the Minister's party have publicly beaten their breasts and said they believe in as a point of principle.  If the Minister will not accept this amendment or will not agree to the amendment of section 45 so as to provide that before such regulations can be changed, the approval of this House must be obtained, thereby giving the House a say in such matters, unfortunately we shall have to call a division on the amendment and have the House decide.  We will have to have the Minister's party who said one thing in public before vote in the opposite direction now.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy is now misquoting me.  The Minister is not aware of any disquiet at the operation of the present arrangements. The net effect of the proposed amendment would be to make the Chief-of-Staff the promoting authority, giving up the position of the Government and the Minister for Defence in relation to the command and control of the Defence Forces. The amendment is not acceptable.  I would stress very forcefully that the existing procedures will be applied fairly and always with regard to the recommendation of the Chief-of-Staff.  It might be appropriate to state at this stage that <Col N="1868" /> the question was fully reviewed in 1979 by the then Minister for Defence who was none other than Deputy Robert Molloy.</P>

      <P>I had intended speaking before he said that.  The last person one can expect to want to change the present position is the incumbent Minister.  No Minister will state publicly that he does not trust himself.  That is, in effect, what he would be saying if he were to demand a change in this regulation.  This is a power that he has been given following the change that Minister Donegan made in 1975.</P>
      <P>I am one of those who held the office of Minister for Defence and who had the full responsibility of making decisions in regard to promotions but if the Minister wishes to look up his files he will get confirmation that on no occasion did I make a promotion &mdash; at least none that I can recall here &mdash; without having first considered fully a recommendation from the Chief-of-Staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is too fragile.  It depends on the integrity of the individual who holds the office of Minister.  It has always been the pride of this country that Army personnel gave complete allegiance to the State no matter which party or group of parties were in office. Having sworn non-participation in or membership of any political party on receiving their commission, it was important that throughout their military career <Col N="1869" /> there would never be any necessity for them to curry favour with any political group to ensure success in their military careers.</P>
    <P>Having had my two and a half years' experience in the Department and from what I have heard in discussions since, I am of the opinion that it is a grave mistake to continue with the Donegan amendment. It is important that we should revert to the situation that pertained prior to that.  The Minister is not correct in stating that in some way this would be removing authority from the Government and the Minister.  The Government have the authority to appoint the Chief-of-Staff, the Deputy Chief-of-Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quarter-Master-General. They are the senior commanding officers in the Army.  It is wrong that it should be the decision of the Minister without having to take into account the recommendation of the Chief-of-Staff, that he should decide when a captain becomes a commandant, when a commandant becomes a lieutenant-colonel, when a lieutenant-colonel is promoted to full colonel status and so on with the other ranks.  To preserve the non-politicisation of our military personnel it is essential that we restore the principle that obtained up to the time when Minister Donegan made that change.  We have refrained from referring to the Dáil debates and bringing out the arguments made against that at that time.  We want to keep the debate on a low, sensible and level key and deal with the principle, not play party politics. It is in the interests of the Defence Forces and the personnel serving there that we want to see the position restored.  It is on that basis and that basis alone that we feel it is essential to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this or any Minister will wish to admit that there is need for this change.  He is the person charged with the sole right to make a decision during his term of office.  It is a matter for the House and one which we should face up to.  The opportunity does not arise too often where we can discuss military law and military affairs.  This debate presents that opportunity.  It is important <Col N="1870" /> that the House should avail of this opportunity to restore the position to what it was before the change in June 1975.  For that reason we are putting forward this amendment and wish the House to decide on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a contentious issue.  I have the disadvantage, not shared by some people who have spoken before me, in not having anything to do with the Defence Forces, other than the contacts I have had in the short time since I took on this responsibility of spokesman in this area.  It appears that this special relationship which must exist between the Army and the Minister for Defence of the day has been developed and strengthened in the past ten or 12 years.  I assume that one can read anything one likes into these matters but that various Governments have examined this subject in the past 12 or 13 years and that all seem to have come to the one conclusion, that is, that the Minister for Defence should be the promoting officer. I have to acknowledge that, provided due recognition is given to the status of the Chief of Staff, such decisions are about right.  One could get very emotional about such a topic and whip up a lot of fear but from my limited knowledge of Army personnel, and the Department of Defence, it appears that the arrangement has worked well under various Ministers in the past ten or 12 years.</P>
      <P>One must always keep a sharp lookout to ensure that promotions are in the best interests of the people concerned but Fine Gael feel we should retain the present system.  The fact that several Governments have looked at the system in recent years is an indication that there is no need to change the system at this stage.  We should persevere with it and if we are concerned in years to come, there is no reason why we cannot change the system.  This is an important part of the whole structure of the Army and I assume that this system will be strengthened in the future.  I do not see why it should be changed at the moment.</P>

      <P>A lot has happened since 1979-80.  A lot of decisions were made by Ministers since 1980 which many of us were not very happy about.  There is no reason to believe that an occasion could not arise in the future when, if this type of arrangement is allowed to obtain, the Donegan attitude might again be adopted by the incumbent Minister for Defence. The politicisation of the Irish Army would recommence.  I am not saying the Minister intends to act in that way and I am satisfied that I did not act in that way when I was Minister.  In fact, all the personnel who have occupied the office since former Deputy Donegan acted in a very honourable way in regard to promotions. The State can be happy that it was served in that way by those individuals but I am not satisfied to leave the position open indefinitely.  It is a matter of great importance to my party who, following due consideration, have decided that it is important to revert to the position that obtained before.  I participated in that decision within my party and I am of the opinion, drawing on my experience and the fears I have for the future, that we should adopt the amendment.</P>

      <P>This Bill to impose ACOT charges on farmers represents another milestone in the litany of U-turns of the present Government.  A reading of the earlier debates on this Bill highlights clearly once again the irresponsibility of the attitude of Fianna Fáil in their comments made over their time in Opposition. I will return to that in a moment. What is even worse and must be commented on is that even in this early stage of this Government &mdash; for how long or short we may have them &mdash; it is very clear that they have no commitment to the development of agriculture.  Already there are many straws in the wind to confirm and corroborate that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we have had some cosmetic changes.  We have had a change in the name of the Department, as if this was to mean anything of consequence.  We have had the setting up of An Bord Glas, but here we have had a clear indication of a hasty decision followed by a hasty appointment within 48 hours of members of the board but no steps being taken at operational level to deal with the executive or administrative matters which will be the responsibility of that board.  We have staff in ACOT, An Foras Talúntais and elsewhere who at this stage do not know where they stand.  They do not know whether they are coming or going. If the Government were serious and had a real commitment to doing the job rather than just introducing cosmetic changes these are things would have been done in <Col N="1877" /> a detailed fashion and not left outstanding.</P>
    <P>We had a further change in the appointment of my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, in the food area.  I see him in the House and whether he is here or not any comment I have to make in this area is not related personally to himself.  It is somewhat ludicrous, in the light of the hype and publicity from the present administration about their interest in developing the food sector, to leave my constituency colleague with that appointment and no money.</P>
    <P>A look at the short record of the Government to date reveals that there are certain things they have done.  What have they done?  They have abolished the installation aid.  Indeed, they are so worried about the effects of that decision that some Fianna Fáil supporters around the country, by a process of wink and nod and sometimes open statements, are saying that was a decision of the previous administration.  That is downright dishonest. I am not saying it was said here in this House, but that is one of the things they have done.  That was a very foolish decision indeed, meant, in a gross budget of £360 million, to process savings of £0.5 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The knife was taken to the ACOT budget.  Again I understand the need for restraint in the public sector and public expenditure.  I am not in here pleading to reverse this process, but trimmings had already taken place in the ACOT budget; despite the expressed view of the present administration and their strong interest in agriculture, this budget was cut in the present Estimates.</P>
    <P>In areas of crucial importance in agriculture there has been no constructive thought, no positive proposals, no innovative action of any description.  I am talking in particular about disease eradication. Levies on farmers have been doubled. Yet, despite some very constructive discussions which have taken place, despite a very constructive debate which took place in this House early in April when suggestions were made regarding better management of that system, we have had no change.  It looks as if the <Col N="1878" /> attitude is to let the thing rumble on, haul in double the money from the farmers and leave them out there paying money with no entitlement to any say in the management of the scheme, but that is a matter for a separate debate.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the lack of action in relation to the extension of disadvantaged areas.  We all know what happened in the past to reclassification. Reclassification does not involve the detailed study involved in a full extension. Reclassification involves merely changing the designation with, of course, very significant consequences for those included in the reclassified area.  There is no evidence on the part of the present administration of any anxiety to secure approval from the EC for that reclassification application which was lodged by the last Government.  At this stage my concern is intensified by the statement of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, in Nenagh last Friday as reported in the papers.  If that report is correct it is pretty clear that the Government are sitting on their hands in relation to this application with no intention of ensuring that it will be through in any short time or that the necessary funding to pay the headage grants in those areas will be provided.  It is another very significant straw in the wind which again adds further corroboration to the assertion I made at the outset that there is no commitment by the Government to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much the work of ACOT.  I will not be irresponsible and say that I oppose the charge in principle.  On the other hand, if one looks at the present administration and what they have said on this matter it makes frightening reading.  One wonders about the responsibility of the people involved at all.</P>
    <P>We had a similar Bill before this House in April 1986.  For a history of hypocrisy, cant and humbug, the comments made by Fianna Fáil on that occasion take some beating.  I might quote from the Official Report of Thursday, 10 April 1986, <Col N="1879" /> column 481 as to what the then Fianna Fáil spokesman had to say:</P>
    <P>This Bill will push back the cause of agriculture for many years.  It proposes an unusual and sinister taxation on farmers...</P>
    <P>Further on he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil strongly oppose this Bill and propose that it be refused a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>There are many examples in that speech of that kind of attitude coming from somebody who is now a Member of the Cabinet, producing a Bill in exactly similar terms to that other one.  This highlights the irresponsibility of the party presenting that view at that time.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman's comments included the following, as reported at column 485:</P>
    <P>As I have said, it will only be an elite group of farmers who will now be able to avail of the services of ACOT.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State present to confirm that that will not be so.  I shall return to that point later.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesman's other comments were of a similar kind, with perhaps the following taking the prize:</P>
    <P>Yet it takes this Government who are anti-farmer, anti-agriculture, anti-rural Ireland, to bring in this penal taxation on farmers which strikes at the very core of agricultural development, the basis of agricultural developmment, the advisory services.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the less said about that the better.  But it is important when a party, a major force in this country, present a view like that on a Bill of this nature and then, within a short 12 months period, introduce a similar Bill themselves, that that attitude be explained.  There is a duty and a responsibility on this Government to explain that kind of contradiction, hypocrisy and humbug.</P>
    <P>In regard to ACOT we have approximately £23 million in public funding from <Col N="1880" /> the Exchequer and local authorities &mdash; which I understand makes up approximately 80 per cent of that budget &mdash; placing us in the position that the choice is between cutting back essential services and imposing some charges.  Therefore in principle, I cannot oppose those charges.</P>
    <P>However, there are two major areas of concern.  The first refers to the position of small farmers and other farmers in financial difficulty.  There may be other sectors that are a cause of some concern but the main focus of concern is on those two.  I am worried that provision is not being made to take into account the position obtaining in those two parts of the agricultural sector.  To take the case of small farmers first, there are many farmers with very small holdings doing their best to eke out a living on them.  I do not want to see them being cast to the winds or not being given the benefit of advice. They may not be in a position to pay for advice.  If that is the case I would want a statement from the Government as to their attitude in approving any charge proposed by ACOT <i>vis-á-vis</i> the position of small farmers.  I am thinking of the western seaboard, the generally disadvantaged area, although outside those disadvantaged areas there are holdings that merit the same description.  In replying the Minister might deal with this point.</P>
    <P>The second serious concern is about those farmers in financial difficulties and there are substantial numbers of those.  I suppose the larger the farm the greater will be the financial difficulty encountered. Perhaps the old role of the adviser was confined to operational advice.  I know that in recent years the ACOT adviser has assumed a much wider and very worthy role, that of examining the position of a farmer in a broad way, advising him on how farm plans can be developed so that his finances can be put on an even keel where such is not the case.  I would be very worried about the position of farmers in financial difficulties, farmers who obviously would not be able to afford that kind of advice. Indeed, in many cases, they are the people who most need help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> In replying the Minister might let the House know what is the attitude of the Government in relation to those who are unable to pay.  It may be significant, or may not be, that even though the speech of the present Minister for Agriculture and Food in introducing this Bill is rather similar to the introductory remarks of the then Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, when he introduced the Bill in the lifetime of the last Government, there have been some significant phrases omitted from the present Minister's speech.  I noted in particular that when the then Minister of State introduced the Bill on 10 April 1986 he began his introductory remarks by stressing the provisions of paragraph 2-42 of <i>Building on Reality</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>Farmers who can afford to pay for an advisory service which is tailored to their individual needs will be required to make an appropriate payment for the service.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to emphasise that there was no question of the general body of farmers being charged fees for agricultural services.  He made it very clear that the plan was to restrict charges to an appropriate payment from those who could afford them.  He also mentioned at that time that proposals by ACOT on the matter would be approved only where that requirement had been met.  Is it significant that, in the re-introduction of the Bill by the present Minister, there was no reference whatsoever to the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, no, which meant there was no reference to farmers who can afford to pay.  There was no reference to the general body of farmers being charged, in particular no reference to the fact that there would not be approval by the Minister of a list of charges from ACOT unless the requirements in relation to those unable to pay had been met.  The point I am making is &mdash; this may or may not be significant; it <Col N="1882" /> may have been overlooked &mdash; that I am somewhat concerned, in the light of the other record I outlined earlier, at the lack of commitment to agriculture already demonstrated by the present administration. It is a serious point.  I want to give notice that, unless it is clarified to my satisfaction, I intend putting down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to bring my party into the lobby to oppose this Bill on Second Stage but on behalf of my party I will put down amendments on Committee Stage unless I receive full clarification on that point.  That clarification should include a statement from the Minister as to whether he believes we should have, as it were, two-speed farmers &mdash; those who develop their holdings and who can afford to pay the advisers and those who are left behind the ditch to struggle on their own.  That surely is not the way to develop agriculture.</P>
      <P>ACOT have always taken a strong interest in young farmers.  There is much concern, worry and consternation among the younger generation on the land because of the inability of ACOT at present to develop the educational and training programmes for young farmers. I understand the problems in the public finances but even before I assumed responsibility as Opposition spokesman on Agriculture I always felt that the seeds of future growth lay in the extension, as far as resources permit, of a proper educational and training system for young farmers.  If we look at the money spent on education and training in non-agricultural areas and if we compare the flow of funding to AnCO to that available to ACOT, we can see why reservations are expressed in relation to any cutback in that area.  In so far as resources permit, I would like to see education and training receiving the highest possible priority and from that point of view I am somewhat concerned at the present trends.  I would like an indication from the Government as to their policy; do they believe that, even with tight finances, that area deserves and should get high priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A combination of measures affect young farmers and those who are about to <Col N="1883" /> take over farms.  Installation premiums, which were introduced last year after patient negotiation during a number of years, were abolished and a decision was made not to continue stamp duty exemption for young farmers.  Young farmers have difficulty in securing beet contracts and so on.  That, together with the downgrading of education and training, puts a major damper on young farmers and those interested in promoting their welfare. It requires a policy statement from the Government as to their attitude in this area.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which should be teased out and discussed is the relationship between ACOT and An Foras Talúntais. Have the Government given any thought to this matter or do they see any possibility for better use of scarce resources in the amalgamation of those two bodies? It seems there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for their amalgamation.  I am not long enough in this portfolio to be absolutely definitive to state it as closed party policy.  If savings can be made in administration costs as a result of the amalgamation of the two bodies and if, at the same time, the effective programmes now being run by the two bodies can be run as effectively under the one umbrella, then surely it is obvious that is must at least receive serious consideration and I suggest that the Government do this.  If as a result of deciding to amalgamate the two bodies savings are made, then the kind of things I am talking about, putting more emphasis on education and training, giving more money to the priority areas and the re-introduction of the installation premium, would become quite possible.  It would be more efficient use of State resources and no extra demand would be put on the taxpayers. I know there are other sides to the argument and I do not overlook them but that matter must be given serious consideration and more so as we now have a Government who criticised us for using the scalpel but who are now rushing around with a sledge-hammer and chasing every halfpenny of public expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately it does not, that is the problem.  I do not want to be emotive about this matter but certain Members on the other side of the House before the last election talked about cuts killing.  The scalpel very rarely produces that kind of result.  I will leave it to the imagination as to what the sledge-hammer can do.  In relation to public expenditure, carefully designed cuts are the answer instead of rushing around with the sledge-hammer knocking out entire programmes and entire institutions without any thought whatsoever.  That is one of the reasons the present administration have been subjected to a record amount of criticism in such a short space of time. I am not saying I want to hear the Minister or the Minister of State say that the idea of amalgamation of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais is good one.  All I want to hear them say is that they are prepared to look at it quickly and if it results in a more efficient and cost-effective way of achieving the same or better result then obviously it will have to be put into effect.</P>
      <P>Other aspects need to be considered. When dealing with constituents' farm development problems, I have often wondered about the two-tier system which involves ACOT representatives visiting farmers and discussing certain aspects of the farm modernisation programme while, on the other hand, the farm development service visit the same farmers in relation to the grant.  That opens up an area for discussion.  Does that make sense?  It seems it is a recipe for substantial travelling expenses for those involved.  I cannot see it as being a recipe for anything else.  There may be a legitimate answer to this problem but if it is a recipe for travelling expenses, I suggest that agriculture has greater priorities than that.  I am suggesting that in a time of scare resources it is a system which needs to be looked at, as to whether the dual system in relation to the farm improvement programme is the best and most cost effective way of serving our agricultural community and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> I wish to speak about the farm improvement programme and focus on the dairying sector.  One of the specific statutory functions of ACOT as set down in the 1977 Act is to adopt measures to ensure that those engaged in agriculture are informed of schemes and facilities for the development of agriculture.  My colleagues in this House will be aware of the problem which has arisen under the farm improvement programmes for a number of farmers who have proposals to develop their dairying facilities.  Those farmers were notified after the middle of March that unless they were within their milk quota before the end of March they could not qualify.  I do not blame ACOT for this, though under the Act those engaged in agriculture should be informed of such schemes.  My understanding is that ACOT had not been officially advised about this requirement until the last minute.  It is not good enough that such notice should be given to farmers two weeks before the end of the milk year.  They had been operating quite reasonably on the understanding that such a requirement would be coming in but would apply to the year 1987-88.  I know a number of farmers who took steps to ensure that any surplus milk would be covered by way of additional quotas and so on.  It is not good enough to notify farmers a short number of days before the end of the milk year that they have to remain within their quota for that year. How could they be expected to do that? As I said, my understanding is that ACOT were not at fault because they were not made aware of this requirement.</P>
    <P>I am not looking for a scapegoat on this issue.  What I am looking for is a solution.  I am saying that the Minister of State and his colleagues have a bounden duty to seek a solution to that problem.  I do not want to hear about the red tape in Brussels causing problems in finding a solution.  I have been going to meetings in Brussels long enough to know, like Daniel O'Connell, that the coach-and-four is still around.  I suggest that the <Col N="1886" /> Minister and his officials apply their combined talents and ingenuity to find that coach-and-four to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about ACOT it is like looking through a telescope at the future of farming.  Despite the difficulties facing farmers, there has to be a future for farming.  It may take a more flexible approach or there may be a need for more imaginative ideas.  It may mean that farmers have to be encouraged to change from old approaches and old systems, but one can look at this as an insurmountable problem or a challenge.  I see it as a challenge that has to be overcome.  In overcoming the problem ACOT, operating alone or in a new shape, will have a very important function and a major role to play in directing and advising farmers in the years ahead on how to take advantage of the situation and how to change direction well in advance to take advantage of the circumstances as they arise.</P>
    <P>When reviewing the performance of ACOT, one can see that that body have made a significant contribution to the development of Irish agriculture, but they have an even more important role to play in the years ahead.  It is unfortunate that those remarks had to be made in the context of a Bill providing for charges on farmers, but if the only way a level of services can be achieved is a choice between charges and no services, unfortunately there must be charges.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the point I made earlier about the ability of farmers to pay.  I want to reiterate that point and I seek the necessary assurance to which I referred earlier.  I want to ensure that the small farmer and those in financial difficulties will not be denied services in the years ahead because of their inability to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to publicly congratulate my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, on being appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food and to wish him the best of luck.  I also wish the very best to Deputy O'Keeffe as Opposition spokesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech Deputy <Col N="1887" /> O'Keeffe focused precisely on what this Bill is about &mdash; imposing charges on the agricultural community for agricultural services from ACOT.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to review the work of ACOT, the role they played and the changed circumstances in which Irish agriculture has been competing in the EC since our entry in 1972.  The earlier part of the Deputy's speech, in terms of its political charges, had an air of unreality about it.  Since I came into this House there seems to have been a debate on agriculture, which has been absolutist in its context, one side charging the other of having no commitment to agriculture, or less commitment to agriculture.  I do not believe the farmers will benefit from that sort of debate.  They believe no political party have a commitment to agriculture. A political party with no such commitment would have little or no support nationally, let alone among the farming community.  It is also quite clear that Fianna Fáil have consistently said that the development of agriculture constitutes an essential national interest and we argued that very cogently in Opposition at the time of the super-levy negotiations. That is history now and there is no point in treading on old ground.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that the Government are confronted by a national crisis.  Despite the policies of the last Government &mdash; or maybe because of them &mdash; we have little or no room for manoeuvre in terms of public expenditure. The need to discipline the way we spend taxpayers' money, for whatever plausible or laudable reason, has now become a top priority issue for any responsible Government.  Unless we get the public finances right we can do nothing for the development of agriculture, horticulture or any other facet of national life.  However, we see that as only half the job, in marked contrast to the last Government.  A developmental arm of economic policy was sadly lacking during the tenure of the last Government which has been proved by the figures with which we were confronted on entering Government.  These showed the doubling <Col N="1888" /> of the national debt, an inexorable rise in unemployment and a worsening of the public finances which, in spite of tough talk and the attempt to dictate to our social partners, causing confrontation on all fronts, left us in a national crisis.</P>
    <P>To bring an air of reality to this debate in discussing the pros and cons of charges imposed by ACOT for services previously given free, we must understand that they are a fact of life.  We had well founded reservations in this regard before we assumed office but we must impose charges because there is no alternative. I do not believe any Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture can tell me, a Fianna Fáil Deputy for a midland area that is not disadvantaged and which has a higher ratio of small farmers than many places in Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency, that Fine Gael are supported by the small farming community.  Fianna Fáil have commanded such support over a long number of years and I am able to articulate their needs just as cogently and cohesively as anybody else.  Farmers who require off farm employment to supplement their income, farmers on very small milk quotas and those on marginal land are the majority in my constituency and these charges will hit them hard.</P>
    <P>ACOT were only beginning to take those farmers into account in recent years, having dealt with the full time, progressive farmer with a large acreage and good quality land.  In a survey carried out in my part of the country, it became quite clear that in respect of those small holdings of marginal land, it was only farmers who had taken ACOT advice and that of the agricultural services who were in a position to eke out some sort of a viable living.  Those who did not receive such aid, for whatever reason &mdash; perhaps they were old farmers who were not interested in modernising their holdings &mdash; did not make progress in earning a decent living from agriculture.  There is a problem for that category of farmer.</P>
    <P>I also wish to remind the previous speaker that, in essence, he was talking about a continuation of the policies of the previous Government which brought about a demise in agriculture.  We have <Col N="1889" /> been in Government for two months &mdash; I hope we will be in office a good deal longer &mdash; and I have total confidence in the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his two competent Ministers of State. Given a proper opportunity to familiarise themselves with the position in regard to agriculture, they will utilise and maximise the resources available to them from the Exchequer to give the maximum benefit to the farming community.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the previous speaker fobbed off the establishment of An Bord Glas as a last minute thought emanating from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  He said the board has no money and will not operate properly. I should like to point out that one of the beauties of An Bord Glas, one which should find favour on the Opposition benches, is that that they will not require one penny extra of taxpayers' money to become operational.  It is an example of precisely what he was talking about in terms of ACOT joining An Foras Talúntais. It is a rationalisation of the services available in the horticultural industry, bringing them together and co-ordinating them in such a way as to make some sort of impact on the large amount of imported food.  It is derided by the Opposition who require the public to believe they are constructive.</P>
    <P>The board came into being after 12 or 18 months of serious study and negotiation by the then Opposition spokesman, Deputy Kirk, and it was launched with the full approval of all the vested interests concerned.  It certainly was not a last minute attempt to put forward a new, glossy package.  We had enough of glossy packages in <i>Building on Reality</i> and we do not want to see that kind of PR job any more.  We put forward a specific developmental project which will help the horticultural industry, and those who are best able to decide whether the board will help are in that industry.  It has their full support and participation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy has announced an extension of the gas grid to Dundalk and this is something which the horticultural industry were crying out <Col N="1890" /> for under the tenure of the last Government. This will be of benefit to the many farmers who specialise in horticultural products.  Let us at least be realistic as regards what is involved in Board Glas. Knowing the amount of work which Deputy Kirk put into that project I am not prepared to have it fobbed off by any Opposition spokesman new or old, familiar or unfamiliar with the amount of work which went into that operation.</P>
    <P>Another point made by the Opposition spokesman which I would like to refer to relates to agricultural education.  There is no doubt that successive Governments have failed in their duty to young farmers and have failed to provide the educational framework which is absolutely vital if we are to produce the type of farmer who can subsist, live and expand in what is increasingly becoming a competitive and complex market.  I speak of agriculture in the context of our EC membership, the changes which are taking place in the CAP, the reductions in the guarantee fund and the failure of existing schemes under the guidance fund.  It is important and absolutely essential that agricultural education receives priority.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am quite satisfied that the Deputies who have been given responsibility in this vital area will bring about the decision-making which was so totally lacking under the previous Government. If I may say so, they were an administration who were defeatist in terms of trying to protect our national interests in the EC.  The previous Minister continuously derided the people he was supposed to be representing on public service television.  He said that we should not expect too much even before he got out there.  It is quite obvious we got what we deserved given that he was a man who was not prepared to stand up for his corner even before he got on the plane.</P>
    <P>As I say, that is old ground and there is no point in continually referring back and comparing one Government against another.  Farming is in a state of crisis. When farming finds itself in such a position we can rest assured that our economy will be in a similar position because, as anyone who is involved in agriculture <Col N="1891" /> knows from experience, if economic growth is to take place there is a necessity to take the farming community off their knees.  They were put there, let it be said, to a large extent by the policies of the previous administration and their failure to adapt to the events which were taking place in Europe and their failure to protect our national interests, particularly our milk production.  On that occasion, we were not able to show the reliance we had on milk and the contribution agriculture makes to our wealth and GNP.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need to have a review of agricultural education.  The certificate in farming is a major step forward for ACOT.  It is a well recognised and worthy certificate and one which should become the trade mark of any progressive farmer.  I can say for my own county that attendances at those courses have been practically 100 per cent and great enthusiasm has been shown by the farmers concerned.  Those courses deserve greater support from the State because as has been rightly said the amount of subsidisation in terms of academic education and AnCO training far exceeds what is available to young farmers many of whom come from low income groups.  Agricultural education has to be looked at because if we do not have farmers trained in the modern skills there will be a continuous drift from the land, and we cannot afford that in our present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one point I would like to make in reference to farmers in my own constituency which I think is relevant to this Bill and that is that ACOT have put forward a new scheme in relation to the suckler grant.  My area which should be classified as disadvantaged is not so classified. Rather than arguing over the progress which different Governments have made in terms of reclassification what we should be doing is changing the criteria on which the disadvantaged area scheme is based.  Many of the farmers I represent in the Shannon Valley Basin were far worse off as a result of the weather conditions during the past two years than any <Col N="1892" /> farmer in upland disadvantaged areas.  I am talking about ground which disappeared for four or five months which left farmers in an impossible position. They received little or no response from the last administration and the spokesman for the Opposition has the gall to say we have no commitment to agriculture. If we have none, it leaves the former Minister in a very poor light.  His party got the response they deserved in the recent general election.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suckler grant I understand that the Minister has said that he is not in a position to increase it in the non-disadvantaged areas.  Considering that there is a curtailment of milk production and the super-levy is in place, it is important to remember that a calf from a cow in a dairy herd is as good as a calf from a cow in a beef herd.  It is important that we recognise that the herd owner is being squeezed at present and will continue to be squeezed because of the shortage of calves in our national herd.  They are some of the points that I wish to raise. Despite this measure I believe ACOT will be given the constructive and dynamic role which is vital for the development of agriculture.  In marked contrast to the previous administration there are the personnel in the Department of Agriculture and Food who have the expertise and practical knowledge to bring that development about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate and who have contributed in such a reasonable and constructive way.  I want to remind the House that this measure is precisely the same measure which was introduced by the last administration and which was on Second Stage on the dissolution of the last Dáil.  If there were any prizes going for hypocrisy it would be a close enough contest between the different contributors at various stages the last time this Bill was before this House and on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised in the debate were wide-ranging and frequently went well <Col N="1893" /> beyond the scope of the Bill.  It is fair to say, however, that Deputies from all sides of the House are in general agreement that there should be some contribution from the farming sector towards the relatively high cost of the farm advisory services from which many farmers derive such substantial benefit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of ACOT's programme, which for this year is in the region of £28 million, it is only fair that industry, including the farming industry, should contribute a share to that.  A headline has already been set by a growing number of farming organisations, for instance, in the establishment of scholarship schemes.  I should like to compliment the IFA, the FBD, Kerry Co-op and a large number of others who are involving themselves in this very worthwhile scheme.  I understand that the schemes provided by organisations and co-operatives now contribute 10 per cent towards the cost of agricultural scholarships.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a substantial number of highly developed farms which are giving very good incomes and it is only reasonable, in particular having regard to the present state of the national finances, that a contribution should be made from substantial farmers.  It is appropriate to draw the attention of the House to An Foras Talúntais's farm management survey in 1985 which showed that of the 70,000 full time farmers, 12,810 earned between £10,000 and £15,000 and 14,280 earned over £15,000.  It is estimated that a substantial number of farmers had an average income in the order of £25,000. It is only fair and reasonable, having regard to the benefits which are derived from ACOT and the other farming support agencies that contributions would be made by, in particular, the substantial farmers.</P>
    <P>In many areas of economic activity now we are availing of contributions from people who can afford to pay and who avail of services.  The same should apply in relation to the farming community. Therefore, it is fitting that ACOT should be enabled to obtain a portion of their <Col N="1894" /> resources from the sector they are advising and assisting, particularly to ensure that their programmes can be maintained at an effective level.  In the interests of securing the maximum contribution from agriculture towards the Government Programme for National Recovery, despite comments from various people, I attended a meeting with the leaders of the main farming organisations in the past week and was certainly heartened by their support for the Government's programme and their agreement that it was the right formula&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to get the country back on an even keel again.  It has come across in debates and in particular from my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, that there is concern that small farmers, farmers in disadvantaged areas and those with low incomes, or perhaps some times virtually no incomes, and especially those in severe financial difficulties who have major repayment contributions to make should not be excluded from the services because they cannot afford to pay for them.  I share the concern in this regard. This legislation is enabling legislation which will merely allow ACOT to introduce a system of charges for advisory services.  What type the charges will be and the weighting of the charges as between farmers in different income categories will be at all times a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Food and subject to his approval.  It will be possible for ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food, subject to the Minister's approval, to devise a formula and options for providing advice so that account can be taken of farmers at different levels of income and in different financial situations to allow for a package or a number of packages to be made available to give due consideration and weight to the ability of the particular group of farmers to pay for the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ACOT make available their advice and their best people.  I must pay tribute to them for down through the years <Col N="1895" /> attending, sometimes in dingy, poorly lit and draughty old halls and making available lectures and courses that farmers could attend without payment of any kind.  That, of course, will continue and I would urge farmers to make the best possible use of those courses and seminars.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the consultation with ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food will not focus on the income needs of that organisation solely, but will take full account of the important place of the agricultural industry in the Government's Programme for National Recovery.  Due weight will be given to the role expected of ACOT in helping the industry to make its maximum contribution in terms of output, productivity and economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Of course it would be necessary to introduce legislation to change the roles of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT and having regard to the total number of staff involved and the total reorganisation of both these bodies, it would be unlikely that anything could be organised this year, but the matter is being looked at and is under consideration as to whether a better job could not be done for the industry by the amalgamation of both these bodies.  However, it is too early to come to any conclusions in that regard. In relation to any support services to agriculture or, indeed, any other part of the economic activity, State agencies would want to have regard to the contribution they are making to the development of the industry for which they provide that support.</P>
    <P>Members of the two bodies about which we are talking would want to ask what contribution any particular project would make to the development of the agricultural industry.  It would need to be a positive and action-orientated contribution. In my view both organisations are capable of supplying the dynamism necessary to get agriculture into the higher plain which is required having regard to the changes in the CAP and, in <Col N="1896" /> particular, the changes in intervention arrangements.  I note that the two bodies, ACOT and An Foras Talúntais, are putting greater emphasis on the developmental role they are playing.  They are putting greater emphasis on the processing, marketing and presentation of our farm products.  We have to be aware that in milk and beef alone we export more than £2,000 million worth of such products and, by any standards in the Irish economic milieu, that is a very substantial amount.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

I am sure Members from rural constituencies can understand the invidious position in which a child who is fostered out finds himself in a rural community.  We have often heard the comment: &ldquo;He is boarded out&rdquo;, and when that child goes to school other children ask him how come he has a different name from others in the house.  That child is looked on in a different light by other children in the classroom, is subject to stress and automatically becomes the <Col N="1897" /> subject of attention that would not apply if he or she were properly adopted.  That is why it is important that the legislation before us is passed by the House.  We must ensure that children are not subjected to that type of social scrutiny.  We must understand the stress such a child is subjected to.</P>
      <P>Adopting a legitimate child means more than other speakers have suggested. In my view all aspects of adoption are adequately dealt with in the Bill which is well drafted.  I do not find anything objectionable about it.  The same is true of the views expressed by the Minister. He appears to support the provisions of the Bill and I hope he will be broad-minded enough to accept it.  If he takes issue with some of its provisions he can table an amendment for debate on Committee Stage.  I hope the Bill gets the support of the Minister and all Members.</P>

      <P>Like other Members I am in a dilemma in regard to the Bill because, as I am sure the Minister will agree, it is well intentioned.  The only difference between the Minister and Deputy Shatter is that the Minister feels the Bill may not be properly constructed. I should like to make an appeal to Deputy Shatter to stay his hand for another few weeks to give the Minister an opportunity to bring in a Government sponsored Bill. I am sure the Minister's Bill will have the full support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Shatter on introducing the Bill which deals with a topic which is dear to my heart.  Since I was elected a Member of the House I have been relatively articulate on matters of social concern and I have not been afraid to express my point of view on social issues.  It is in that spirit that I appeal to Deputy Shatter not to put the Bill to a vote of the House this evening.  I do not make that appeal because of a fear that the Government will be defeated.  I do not think I could be accused of that type of politicking.  In my view the Bill should be taken out of the political arena.  It is so important that it should be treated in a non-political <Col N="1898" /> fashion.  My information is that the Minister has given an undertaking to produce his Bill &ldquo;without undue delay&rdquo;.  I understand that commitment will be honoured by the end of the month or, certainly before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers a new departure in the context of adoption.  I agree with the Bill before us in principle but I do not think it is too much to ask Deputy Shatter to await the introduction of the Minister's Bill so as to ensure there is all-party agreement on it.  However, I am not entirely in agreement with section 9 which concerns costs and court fees.  The section, while well intentioned, is too open-ended.  That area should be looked at again by the Minister before he produces his legislation.  At the conclusion of his contribution the Minister said he did not wish to anticipate the contents of his Bill but he was anxious to help Deputy Shatter, and the House, by giving some indication of the options.  He went on to list a number of options, one of which I fundamentally disagree with. I am referring to the suggestion that the health boards should be the applicants in every case.  The people who want to adopt children, and not the health boards, should be the applicants.  I am not in any way diminishing the role of social workers.  The health boards have done a good job with the adoption societies. Adoption is a personal matter and it should be left where it should properly be left.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he is sympathetically disposed to the view which has been expressed that married persons under 18 years of age should, where such exceptional applications might arise, be eligible for adoption.  That requires further consideration even in the light of the Minister's proposed Bill.  The Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter was out of a genuine concern for the people whose problems we are trying to solve and not for any party political advantage.  An important difference between the Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter and that of the previous Government is the provision in section 9 which would empower the High Court to require the adoption <Col N="1899" /> board to meet the legal costs of applicants who take proceedings in these new cases. This section will also charge the adoption board with meeting costs in certain cases arising where adoptive parents may apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with the consent of a natural parent or guardian of a child acceptable under current adoption law.  The Minister says &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; this is a significant new departure from existing practice which he would require time to consider and to consult with others.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine and serious dilemma in relation to this.  The Minister has been in office for a very short period of time. Is it unreasonable to ask that the Minister be allowed to reflect on this very fruitful, very good and very worthwhile debate so as to ensure that perfection is achieved in his proposed Bill?  It is only a matter of weeks.  Deputy Shatter may properly make the point that we take his Bill and when it moves to Committee Stage the Minister may then propose amendments. That is a valid argument and I find very little to disagree with in it.  As one who has made contributions over the years on social issues, I think the wrangle which now appears to be emerging on the Bill is tragic.  Once again, I appeal to the fair-mindedness of Deputy Shatter to ensure that this matter is properly dealt with by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Governments are elected to govern and to legislate.  It may also be argued that the Opposition have a duty, not only to assist in perfecting legislation but to forward legislative proposals of their own.  That is a legitimate and reasonable point of view but I believe it is not sustainable taking account of the fact that the Government were given a mandate and in circumstances where legislation of this nature is so fundamental to the future of so many people on balance, with the full weight of the administration behind their legislation, who is to say that the Government's proposals would not be better advised in the best sense of that word?  The Minister will have the opportunity of studying the very worthwhile contributions made during the course of <Col N="1900" /> this debate and in his wisdom or otherwise he will decide what to propose in his Bill.  That is the merit of this debate and the merit of Deputy Shatter bringing in his Bill at this time.</P>
    <P>For the sake of four or five weeks, is it too much to ask that we draw a legislative breath, that we stand back and look at the contributions made on this Bill so that we may incorporate the best points of this Bill in the Minister's proposed Bill?  I hope, given that opportunity, that the Minister will bring in the Bill.  If I give the English language its proper meaning, I understood <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning to say it would be done without undue delay, perhaps in three or four weeks time but certainly not later than the end of this session.  When those of us who are concerned about this Bill have given the Minister's Bill a Second Reading, perhaps we could come back during the summer recess and meet in Committee to perfect &mdash; if perfection is required &mdash; the Minister's Bill.  Those of us who are genuinely concerned about this Bill would be glad to do that work during our so-called holidays.  Of course, Dáil Deputies never get holidays.  To suggest because the Dáil goes into recess for three and a half months that in some way is a holiday is a rather bad joke.</P>
    <P>With respect to Deputy Shatter, his Bill is not original in its philosophy but it is original in its production and for that we should be very grateful.  The Review Committee on Adoption Services who were responsible for the report were appointed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, in April 1983.  This committee were representative of the health services, the legal profession, adoptive parents and the present Adoption Board.  Their report on the adoption services represents the first comprehensive review of the operations of the adoption system since it was introduced in 1953.  The report deals with all aspects of the existing laws and procedures and contains a number of recommendations which would radically alter the structure of the present system.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the extension of eligibility for adoption to legitimate <Col N="1901" /> children whose parents are alive and the introduction of a legal procedure to permit the dispensation of parental agreement on the placement of a child for adoption in certain narrowly defined circumstances.  This Bill seeks to achieve those recommendations.  The report also recommends the introduction of new procedures to speed up the process of adoption and the replacement of the adoption board by a single adoption court which would function as a specialist branch of the High Court.  This is a matter worthy of consideration.  While I agree that the Minister has to deal specifically with what is now before the House as set out in Deputy Shatter's Bill, nevertheless these are matters which might be contemplated.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the setting of higher standards for adoption agencies and the introduction of a new registration system under the aegis of the Minister for Health.  A majority view of the review committee recommended that children adopted in future should have the right of access to their original birth certificates on reaching 18 years of age. That is another very worthy recommendation. The report acknowledges that the implementation of a proposal to permit the adoption of legitimate children and to allow in some instances for dispensing with parental agreement to placement for adoption may give rise to constitutional difficulties.  The report argues that the constitutionality of any such legislation should be secured in advance by referendum if necessary.  I depart from the committee's view in that regard.  I do not think we should put this matter to a referendum.  People such as Deputy Shatter and Deputy McDowell, on the one hand, and with the Minister with the backing of the Attorney General, on the other hand, should be able to come up with perfect legislation which would not have to be examined constitutionally. I do not think that is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many social issues down through the years in this House and I consider this to be one of the most important.  While I agree with what is <Col N="1902" /> contained in the Bill I feel, nevertheless, it is a matter for Government to introduce legislation as far-reaching as this.  In addition the Minister and his Department might consider also the abandonment of the terms &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;legitimacy&rdquo; in the context of children.  A child is brought into this world without any responsibility on its part.  If two individuals, a man and a woman, produce a child, outside of wedlock, then to designate that child as illegitimate is, in my view, an attack on the child's constitutional rights and on his or her rights as a citizen.  These are matters on which the Minister might contemplate if and when he gets the opportunity to introduce his own Bill.  I strongly suggest to the House, to Deputy Shatter in particular, and to the Fine Gael Party that whilst the thrust of the Bill has great merit and finds cross-party support almost in its totality, nevertheless there are certain frayed edges which could be properly dealt with by the administrative backing of a Government Department led by the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I have the highest regard for my constituency colleague, Deputy David Andrews, who is a veteran of this House.  Therefore it comes as a surprise and indeed as a disappointment to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a Deputy who is, not in years but in experience, a veteran of this House and of the slow process of legislation though this Chamber, and with his interest and his expertise in the laws, should stand here this evening, when we are concluding Second Stage of a Bill, which he admits is well and truly overdue, and say we should draw a breath regarding this legislation.  If we continue to draw breaths at the slow rate at which we are drawing up legislation we will pass into unconsciousness.  Sometimes I believe we have ceased to draw a breath regarding the introduction, implementation and enactment of legislation.  That is why I <Col N="1903" /> welcome what I would like to believe is the first of many Private Members' Bills to hasten the process and progress of legislation through this Chamber, particularly in an area which has been so neglected, restricted, cut off and debated for so long.  It is shameful for us in 1987 that we still have not got a set of fundamental children's rights.</P>
      <P>We pay lip service to the importance of children, to our young generation, to parenthood, to family, the strength of the family, the recognition and nurturing of the family, confidence, self-possession and development within the family.  Yet in 1987, as Deputy Shatter said when introducing this Bill, we are the only country in Europe who actually discriminates not just against illegitimate children &mdash; which we do because of another lengthy delay on the Status of Children Bill &mdash; but, what is well nigh impossible and certainly shameful, against legitimate children.  That is why this Bill is not only important but urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why there is a consensus in the Dáil, and has been since the reform started, on two levels, First, there is a need to introduce and pass legislation because of the backlog.  Second, where there is consensus and general support for the principle of laws and legislation there should be no undue delay.  Third, all of us in this Chamber have a mandate, and have been elected to be legislators, regardless of which side of the House we sit on.  I find it incredible that it should be suggested that only a Government side of the House have the ability, commitment and competence to introduce legislation with a possibility of it being passed.  It is outrageous and it is a denial of the rights of all of us as legislators, regardless of whether we are in Opposition or in Government.  It is a further insult to an already very insulted profession to suggest that competent expert people who, because of an election, find themselves on the other side of the House, should suddenly be denuded of that competence and expertise which enabled them to bring in the legislation when they were on Government side.  It <Col N="1904" /> is a total negation of what we would like our democracy to be in this House and to which all of us pay lip service, that is, that legislators on all sides of the House should be enabled to take part in their full capacity and not be excluded or ignored. That is why I appeal to the Government side tonight, who in their speeches up to now have said that they welcome broadly, and support in particular the introduction of such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter pointed out that his Bill is an amended version of what was a Government Bill, drafted with all the backing and resources which the Government now say that their Bill would need. That is nothing but an excuse for needless, total and dishonest delay.  The Bill has been introduced by a Deputy who is recognised &mdash; both inside and outside this House &mdash; as one of the experts in family law.  His books and judgment are accepted, not just by the legal profession but everywhere as being those of an expert.  On that level there is absolutely no excuse for dismissing or neglecting this legislation.  Let us come to the fundamental point as to why this Bill must go through the House tonight and why the Committee Stage should be introduced as quickly as possible.  It is because this Bill addresses the most vulnerable section of our community, those who cannot, either through age or inexperience, claim rights for themselves. That is why we have a particular and special responsibility towards children over every other section of the community. That is why it is all the more embarrassing and shameful that we have failed them so dismally.</P>
    <P>I wish to make only a few comments on the Bill because it has already been discussed during last week and this week, and I am aware that other speakers wish to speak.  It should be recognised and recorded that the Review Committee on Adoption Services &mdash; which as Deputy Andrews pointed out was set up years ago and is why we have to operate in terms of years and sometimes decades rather than months which is a total disappointment to me &mdash; made the fundamental point, on the need for this Bill, <Col N="1905" /> that eligibility for adoption should not be determined on the basis of the marital status of parents.  It came as a shock to me because, until Deputy Shatter mentioned this point in his speech last week, I was not aware that discriminated against legitimate children and their exclusion from being adopted in this country.  This has led to some children being sent out of the jurisdiction.  We may feel very concerned that our older, educated, experienced adult population have to emigrate, perhaps to return one day, but it is appalling to think that discrimination within our legislation could cause vulnerable children to go outside this jurisdiction to get a natural family upbringing and all the security that offers.  I do not hear anybody on the other side of the House getting hysterical about that.</P>
    <P>We have had submissions and reports from every organisation dealing with children, all urging us to proceed with this legislation.  Not only have we consensus in this House but we have support and consensus outside the House.  There is huge disillusionment at the slow rate at which all legislation regarding children's rights is crawling through these Houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has been extremely careful in drafting this Bill so that it fits within the constitutional restrictions. Even if it is tested in the Supreme Court I hope it will be shown that the constitutional rights of children have a place and a priority which in certain circumstances would supersede that of parents who have neglected them to the extent that they should have given up all natural rights and responsibilities. Deputy Shatter has been careful to make sure that there should be a rigorous examination of each application by the adoption board.  Each application would then have to be tested and authorised by the High Court.  There is no way in which the drafting of this Bill could be described as anything less than careful.  If it were not for the constraints of the Constitution, I am sure Deputy Shatter would prefer to expand it and make it more open and child-centred, which the Constitution certainly is not.  When we have a new <Col N="1906" /> Constitution and perhaps a more progressive attitude, I would like to hope that we would remove the anomaly which disallows widowers from adopting and look at the whole area of caring parents in a single or unmarried state who, because of a particular relationship with a child, should also be allowed to adopt. I am aware, however, that getting this legislation through is the first priority and we can amend and expand it in the future.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of this Bill is to put children first.  Their security and their relationships of love and care with adults they can trust are of prime importance, not the property rights and the marriage rights which have dominated relationships in this country, sometimes to the total destruction of relationships.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome Deputy Shatter's provisions in relation to the important matter of fees and expenses.  All legislation should ensure that people have full access to the courts, regardless of their financial status.  This is especially important when their rights or the rights of their children must be tested.  Formerly this matter was decided at the discretion of the courts and I welcome the provision in this Bill which will enable people to come forward with confidence knowing that they will not become involved in financial difficulties by so doing.  If we want our courts to be open to people regardless of income or status, it is essential that this provision be supported.</P>
    <P>Above everything else I applaud the general considerations at the end of the Bill and the explanatory memorandum which sums up what the Bill is about.  The rights of natural parents will always be supported and protected but there are situations where there is a total breakdown. Every support should be given to prevent this happening, but when it does happen the reality is that children are placed in long term institutional care when there are loving couples desperately anxious to adopt such children. The explantory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>There are, however, a considerable number of children in long term residential or fostercare who have long <Col N="1907" /> since ceased to have any relationship of any nature with their natural parents. The major provisions of this Bill extend to such children the possibility of a secure family life in the home of adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on Deputy Cooney's suggestion last night that, since this Bill is fraught with constitutional difficulties, we might focus on fostering as an alternative to adoption.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn has already pointed out some of the inadequacies of this.  Fostering does not give the legal protection and the security both the child and the parents need.  While fostering in certain circumstances is certainly to be encouraged, basically we need to give the same rights of adoption to all our children, regardless of the marital status of their parents and of legitimacy or illegitimacy. The sooner we get rid of all those discriminations the sooner our children will actually be cherished by the nation and realise that they have the same rights and the same status.  It is intolerable that they do not have that status.  They cannot fight for it themselves since it is pre-determined for them and can distort their development all their lives.</P>
    <P>Once again I appeal to the Government to support this Bill, to give it the consensus it has got from this side, to allow us to bring one Bill regarding children's rights through fast without delaying it for party political reasons or because Private Member's Bills are seen in this House to be less credible than others.  I reject that.  There is not much point in talking about Dáil reform if that is one of the reasons that this Bill is turned down.  If and when we bring this Bill through it will be an encouragement to other legislators on either side of the House to introduce other legislation which has been long delayed.  It will also relieve the burden on the Government. We are all aware of the heavy demands made on Ministers in Government time and the many other demands on their time and energy.  Surely it is practical that the competence and expertise of all sides of the House be used where other <Col N="1908" /> Members of the House might have more time in that area.  If we are to consider this a working House this Bill must be accepted by all sides of the House and go through, otherwise it is a charade to talk of this being a place of legislative reform.</P>
    <P>I appeal tonight across the House that everybody support this Bill and bring it through as fast as possible because it is so long overdue and discrimination against children continues at the most fundamental level.  We have still to bring through this House the Status of Children Bill which has already gone through the Seanad.  It is remarkably good legislation now and its passage through this House should not take too much time because there was a high level debate and a good Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The Minister is here across the floor and I know his commitment to the Children (Care and Protection) Bill which, so long delayed and so necessary, has to go through the whole process in this House again.  We accept what the Minister said, that because of difficulties and amendments that is the way it must be.  I appeal to the Minister in the light of all the legislation outstanding &mdash; there is such a backlog &mdash; to support this legislation and get it through as a first step so that we can get on to the other legislation.  I hope that at the end of all this we can leave this House, proud in the knowledge that we have assured rights for our children which at the moment to our shame and embarrassment we cannot claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Barnes, I am anxious to see some progress in this area. One would not think that the party introducing the Bill were four years in Government recently.  If it was as critical, urgent and as badly needed as we all believe it is, one fails to understand the long, protracted delay in making any progress on that front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health has made the point in this debate that the Government support fully a change in the law to allow the adoption of certain children now ineligible for adoption and that they are determined to bring about such a change no matter how their clearly stated stance <Col N="1909" /> may have been represented in this House since this debate started.  The Government are no less concerned than Deputy Shatter or any other Deputy opposite to allow children the opportunity of a permanent home.  Indeed, I remind the Deputies across the House that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who brought forward what we all agree is limited legislation at present on the Statute Book. However, an important change of this kind in our social legislation surely should be the responsibility primarily of the Government of the day, not of any individual Deputy on the benches opposite even if he has managed to secure the support of his own party.  The Bill, however, will not be stampeded through the House simply to satisfy the whims of Deputy Shatter and some of his colleagues who appear to be as concerned about embarrassing the Government as they are about bringing forward this desirable change.</P>
    <P>The Bill Deputy Desmond circulated was available.  Therefore, it was obvious that there was a Bill prepared by the outgoing Government which would have been a priority for the incoming Government. It would not have taken a great deal of ingenuity to bring the previous Bill in here in Private Members' time but it is not going to be produced overnight. The present Bill and Deputy Desmond's Bill seem to have some serious defects. My colleague, Deputy Andrews, has referred to those.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of this Bill seems extremely open-ended particularly in regard to costs.  Unfortunately, to this House's cost, we all know what the legal bill can be.  When one gives that great, amorphous body down there, the courts, any sort of free hand on costs, be it an inquiry or whatever, we end up with a very substantial cost.  As I read it, anybody making an application to the High Court under this Bill will be able to recoup the full costs.  I was amazed at Deputy Barnes condoning fully that open-ended policy, irrespective of means.  The State is supposed to be able to pay the legal eagles' full costs under Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <P>This section also requires the court to <Col N="1910" /> be satisfied that the application is made in good faith having regard to the best interests of the child.  However, it is most unlikely that a court will decide that any application of this sort is not made in good faith.  The financial implications of section 9 are, therefore, that the Adoption Board would in effect be obliged to meet the costs in all instances.  I find no limitation whatsoever placed on these costs and, of course, they will be payable irrespective of the financial standing of the applicant.  That is unacceptable.  So far as I am aware, this will also be contrary to the established practice in regard to the payment of costs by the State. Under the free legal aid scheme costs are met only where it is clear that the person concerned has not the means to pay the costs of the court proceedings.  The Attorney General operates a more informal scheme which may allow for the recoupment of costs in other cases where the court so recommends but quite clear limitations are set as to what should be payable under any scheme at present in vogue.</P>
    <P>It seems that the type of arrangement envisaged by Deputy Shatter is too open ended and might end up being another goldmine for the legal profession.  As I have said, we have had too many experiences in that area.  I am sure the House will be reluctant to pass any such open-ended legislation and to see any such development, particularly in these difficult times when impositions on the taxpayer are so severe already.</P>
    <P>Another defect I see in this Bill is that the provisions would meet only the costs of persons wishing to secure an adoption order.  There is no provision for the natural parents of the child who might be opposing the making of the order.  That seems to be a major inequity.  I have no doubt that the House will see the merits of not wanting to adopt such an open-ended approach to this crucial legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and the Attorney General are looking very closely at the wording of Deputy Shatter's Bill and that of the previous Government to see if certain provisions need to be strengthened or altered.  I say to <Col N="1911" /> Deputy Barnes that, while I agree with her sentiments, the outgoing Government have left us one major constitutional legacy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Single European Act and that was from the same Attorney General's Office as was used to draft the Bill Deputy Desmond circulated.  Therefore, we should make haste very slowly in that respect.  We are dealing with the fundamental and crucial issue of the transfer of a child from one family to another.  That is a very solemn matter with far-reaching implications and it would be downright irresponsible to take chances with a new law which if subsequently overturned might lead to a child being taken back from the family it had come to accept as its own.  We should not play politics with this type of Bill. In the long term children about whom concern is being expressed here might be the main sufferers of such a defect.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make haste in producing the Government Bill, if possible within the next couple of weeks.  I can assure the House that the Bill now being drafted and scrutinised by the Attorney General will take priority on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>We all believe that the question of adoption is a matter of great urgency.  We must also be careful about the complexities of the interaction between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the courts which, in recent years, has tended to end up in conflict.  For that reason we should leave it to the Minister for Health to effect whatever modifications are necessary to Deputy Shatter's and Deputy Desmond's Bills so that whatever Bill is passed by these Houses will be workable and not be subject to testing in the courts. Perhaps that will happen anyway but we must endeavour to minimise that possibility.</P>
    <P>This is perhaps an unfair and generalised criticism but the legal profession will defend one for murder if one pays. The whole area of legal costs needs great scrutiny.  We should be very careful that we are not opening up a Pandora's box to the legal profession in order to peddle in the misery of adoption.  There must be <Col N="1912" /> restrictions and limitations on such costs. There are people who would willingly meet the legal costs involved in adopting and giving a home to a child.  It is very unfair that the burden of such costs should revert back to the taxpayer.  If the State is to pay the bill it will constitute an enormous burden on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>It is intended that the Government will introduce a Bill in the House within a matter of weeks.  I have pointed out that there are serious defects in section 9 of Deputy Shatter's Bill which need to be teased out or eliminated.  No doubt the Minister is dealing with that. Probably he would have had his Bill before the House had not Deputy Desmond's Bill been seen to be defective by the present Attorney General.  That is what must be put right.  It should be remembered that for four years the party opposite did not find time to introduce a Bill.

      <P>As far as the Chair is concerned there are prescribed rules and regulations to which we must adhere.  Already one representative of the Labour Party has spoken and a representative of the Fine Gael Party will be called on at 8.15 p.m. to conclude. The Chair leaves it to the discretion of the speaker to think of others but there is no obligation on him to do so.  I am calling on Deputy Mervyn Taylor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that this Bill would have been regarded as non-controversial on all sides of the House.  For the life of me I cannot understand the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government, as exemplified by Deputy Lawlor who has just concluded, indicating that the Bill was brought forward for the purpose of embarrassing the Government.  I cannot see wherein lies the embarrassment unless it be in the fact that, for some strange reason, the Government choose to oppose the Bill and are defeated on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly that would be an embarrassment for the Government but an embarrassment brought on themselves by adopting a foolish attitude to the Bill instead of saying to the House and to the public outside, in particular to those people who are anxious to adopt the children covered by the provisions of the <Col N="1914" /> Bill: &ldquo;A measure is being brought forward here; this is a matter on which there is universal agreement; this is not a matter for party politics; rather it is a matter of general social justice; this is a matter on which this country should have brought in laws decades ago; we are happy to go along with it and to assist in its passage.  There may very well be some of its provisions that need to be varied, such as control, legal costs and other matters.  We will be dealing with those on Committee Stage and will be moving sensible amendments to them.&rdquo;  That would be a very sensible attitude for a Government to adopt on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Ought there to be some great divide on a Bill of this nature?  Are we talking about privatisation, nationalisation, taxation, excise duties, health charges, things like that?  Those are matters of controversy; those are matters for compromise on other sides of the House. As has been said repeatedly by Fianna Fáil spokesmen on the Bill, they agree with its broad principles.  That is all we are dealing with on Second Stage.  If the Government agree with the broad principles of the Bill, I do not see why they do not avoid their own embarrassment, go along with it and make any amendments they feel may be necessary or appropriate.  That would be a responsible way to handle the matter.  But I disagree with this idea that Governments must do everything, must move everything, be responsible for everything.</P>
    <P>I do not say that is an attitude peculiar to this Government.  No doubt the same criticism could be applied to former Governments but whichever Government it may be I disagree with it.  When a non-controversial Bill of this nature arises it ought be accepted.  It may be that the previous Government had the Bill, they did have the Bill, but perhaps there was not time with the pressures on them to introduce it in Government time.  Here is a case where an Opposition party are prepared to devote their Private Members' Time to the purpose.  That is something that ought to have been welcomed. I should have thought the Government would have been very <Col N="1915" /> happy to have availed of the fact that an Opposition party would devote their Private Members' time to a non-controversial issue of this nature.  It seems to me that any embarrassment there is on this issue is of the Government's own making.</P>
    <P>There are certain provisions of the Bill that could well be examined on Committee Stage.  I do not intend to elaborate on them because there are other Members anxious to speak.  I take the point that this whole adoption situation &mdash; by reason of legal and perhaps constitutional positions &mdash; could possibly turn out to be a paradise for lawyers. That is a matter of great regret.  It is also a matter of great regret that the issue of whether or not an adoption order should be made, or permission given for an adoption order to be made, should be left in the hands of a High Court judge.  I do not see any particular expertise on a social issue of this nature vested in High Court judges.  I have no doubt that many or all of them are humane people who will do the best they can but High Court judges have not the training, the knowledge or the expertise which many other professional people in our society have, such as social workers, health workers and experts who specialise in the field of adoption and who work on it all the time. I realise there are certain constitutional constraints on this point and that is regrettable.  I would prefer to see the matter dealt with by a tribunal, a board or a panel made up of experts such as child psychiatrists, social workers, adoption workers, ministers of religion perhaps and so on who would be much more highly qualified to make a decision on these matters than would any High Court judge.</P>
    <P>In the present system of administration of justice, one day a High Court judge may deal with civil jury actions, another day he might be in the Criminal Court, another day in the Probate Court and another day he may have to deal with Chancery matters.  These judges have no expertise on these issues.  If this matter <Col N="1916" /> has to be dealt with within the realm of the courts and on an adversarial basis at least there ought to be a special family court with a special family judge who would deal with nothing else but family matters.  In that way there would be a degree of consistency and expertise among a section of the Judiciary to deal with these kinds of cases.  It may not be possible to bring that about without amending the Constitution but if the Constitution has to be amended to provide for that sort of issue, so be it, it should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Lawlor I am concerned about the legal costs involved.  We may be left with many tribunals and there might be a great deal of litigation involved in these applications.  The health boards are involved in adoption and the Adoption Board have a role to play also. This could result in an adversarial situation. The High Court have a crucial role in adoption matters and any case that goes to the High Court can, on appeal, go to the Supreme Court.  One can see that there is a totally unnecessary complexity in regard to the whole matter under which the procedure is initiated.  First, perhaps the case will go to the health board, then to the Adoption Board, then to the High Court, then to the Supreme Court and back again to the Adoption Board for an order to be made.  A scheme should be devised, even by a constitutional amendment, under which one tribunal would deal with this issue and examine it on an informal basis instead of in a court scenario with solicitors, barristers, junior counsel and senior counsel all being paid fees with the result that an appreciable sum for any one application could be involved.  It would be a much more desirable approach for one body to deal with the matter but that would require a constitutional amendment and we should tackle the problem now.</P>
    <P>It is wrong and unnecessary for the Government to have taken the line that they will oppose this Bill because they are going to introduce a Bill that, quite clearly from the statements which have been made, will be very little, if at all, at variance with this one.  There is not much <Col N="1917" /> room for variation in it in the present constitutional position.  It would be very welcome if the Government were to say that they will go along with the general principle of the Bill and make amendments to it.  That would not be a source of any embarrassment to them, quite the contrary.  To treat a matter of this nature which involves the adoption of children as a bipartisan measure would be very welcome on all sides of the House and would be very welcome by the public. They would say that at long last there is some measure of responsibility here and that there are some things which do not have to be regarded as adversarial in Dáil Éireann.  They would say that for once the Deputies have got together and put their party matters aside for a personal issue of social necessity.  They would see that we were dealing with the matter on a unified basis, that we had done the right thing.  It would be to the general good of the House if that approach was taken.</P>
    <P>A number of points that could be made on the Bill would be appropriate to Committee Stage.  For example, I would like to see a provision under which relatives of a child to be adopted, who would be concerned about the child's position, would have to be consulted, that it would not be left open to the court to decide whether they might be consulted.  In other words, that they should be involved in determining whether an adoption order should be made.</P>
    <P>There are no provisions in the Bill whereby the rights of the child would be argued in deciding whether an adoption should be made.  There is provision for those seeking the adoption and who are parties to it and also for the parents who might resist the application.  It is open to the courts to bring in other parties but there is no specific provision under which the interests of the child are represented. It can be glibly said on occasion that in these cases the welfare of the child is paramount.  That is a high-sounding and very admirable notion but on many occasions it may not be so easy to apply or as easy to determine as it may sound.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Government to accept Second Stage of the Bill, albeit <Col N="1918" /> with reservations, but let them have their reservations.  Let them say they will bring in amendments as they see fit on the legal cost issue.  I accept that is a valid point. There is no reason some limit should not be put on the cost element or some arrangement should not be made to ensure that these costs are kept to a minimum and are confined to those who can afford them.  The main thrust of the Bill speaks for itself.  It is much overdue. Time has been given to the House in Private Members' Time to debate it and I ask the Government to allow it to pass Second Stage.  We can then meet in a special committee and discuss, and perhaps achieve, necessary improvements of a technical nature.</P>

      <P>I have undertaken with Deputy Shatter to be brief so as to allow other Deputies to contribute.  I welcome the Bill and I commend my constituency colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, and Fine Gael for allowing Private Members' Time to be used for the purpose of this Bill which proposes much needed legislation. It seeks to give those in long term foster care in particular and who have formed strong parental bonds with foster parents the opportunity to be adopted. It is very hard both on the children and on the foster parents not to have a proper relationship at law.  This reflects the reality of the position.  Even very occasional visits by natural parents to these children are upsetting and often the natural parent will hold out hope of setting up a home or trying to discredit the foster family when on those visits. The child's best interest is not served by allowing this to continue without some definite end in sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other children not covered <Col N="1919" /> by the provisions of this Bill who could properly benefit from adoption and the stable family life it provides.  However, I know it is necessary that the Bill should be very carefully drafted, as Deputy McCartan I think said last evening.  It is essential that we pass an Adoption Bill that will be in keeping with our Constitution. Ideally we would have a constitutional referendum, not simply to add or delete words allowing for adoption of legitimate children, but a referendum which would incorporate some sort of charter of rights for children.  At present, anyone reading our Constitution would be struck by the proprietorial nature of parenthood over children.  The child of its natural parents, who are married to each other, is seen more in property terms than as a person in his own right. What we must aim for is to strike a balance between rights of the parents over what they desire for the future of their child and what society demands as basic needs for that child.  If a conflict arises between these, I feel the needs of the child must prevail.  However, in order to establish what they are in a court, be it in adoption proceedings or in other family cases, the child should be separately represented and his needs seen as those of a separate person.</P>
    <P>In that connection I have to say the present system for dealing with family matters in the courts is grossly inadequate. Injustice is unfortunately regularly done to litigants because there is no proper system of family courts, no proper training for court personnel, including judges, and no proper referral system for those in need of medical, psychological, social or rehabilitative help.  These facilities are essential to deal properly with sensitive matters of relationships, personal problems and such like.  They are not the same kind of things as the subject matter of civil actions in contract, tort, conveyancing and so on.  While I recognise that the Bill provides for these cases to be heard in private, I think Deputy Shatter would probably agree with me that to have a proper family court system <Col N="1920" /> to deal with these cases would be far better.</P>
    <P>Before I finish my truncated speech I will deal with the Government's attitude to the Bill.  I believe it is nothing short of blatant hypocrisy.  The Minister is adopting a dog in the manger attitude and I can only surmise that the beleagured nature of his position regarding cuts in the health services has spilled over into his attitude to this Bill.  He seems to be saying, as does his Minister of State, that if we, that is the Government, cannot bring in this Bill now, however worthy it is in principle and largely in detail, no one will do so.</P>
    <P>Wearing my hat as spokeswoman on institutional reform for the Progressive Democrats, I see a prime example of where the business of this House is appallingly ordered.  Of course I mean no disrespect to the Chair.  I do mean, however, that the business moves very slowly through the House and indeed often never reaches that stage with delays in drafting etc.  If in Private Members' Time a responsible measure is brought forward with the approval of the Government of the day for the principle of the measure and, as in this case, it has been very carefully drafted for the greater part by the parliamentary draftsman's office, the Government, by rejecting such a Bill, are wasting taxpayers' valuable money.  If we are to take the Minister at his word, a Bill will be introduced in Government time thus pushing aside other legislation that could be dealt with if the Government allowed the Second Stage of this Bill to pass.  We should be showing by our example in this House that we believe in being as productive as possible.</P>
    <P>The suggested changes in the Bill which the Minister proposes, if they were found to be right and necessary, could be dealt with properly on Committee Stage.  His proposal regarding the role of the health boards is, I believe, totally ill-advised and perhaps contrary to the concepts of natural justice.</P>
    <P>There are one or two areas, such as the issue of possible collusion between parties to an adoption application, which I would like to see incorporated in the <Col N="1921" /> Bill.  However, the time and place for that is Committee Stage.  The principle of the Bill is absolutely praiseworthy and, as far as I can see, it has been drafted extremely carefully.  I would feel, as a safeguard to future adoptions under this Bill, that it should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court before promulgation.</P>
    <P>With my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, I support the passage of the Second Stage of this Adoption Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened that this Bill is not getting all party support because it is an important and very desirable Bill.  I believe this Bill does not present any constitutional problems. Article 42.5 of the Constitution reads:</P>
      <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been drafted tightly to keep within that section of the Constitution and I do not see any constitutional or legal difficulties arising.</P>
      <P>Since 1929 legitimate children could be adopted in Northern Ireland.  I am not certain about all our EC partners but I am sure the majority of them have similar provisions to what is contained in this Bill.  We are very far contained in this issue and we should try to keep in step with the rest of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this late stage I do not believe the Government would lose face if they allowed the Second Stage of this Bill to <Col N="1922" /> pass.  I am pleased the Taoiseach has come into the House to listen to the concluding speeches.  He is very welcome.  In his capacity as Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach had the name of a reforming Minister, particularly in the social field.  It would be a magnanimous gesture on his part if he and his Minister agreed to the passing of the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Shatter for bringing in this Bill but there are some points where I would like to have changes made, such as the time limit mentioned in section 2.  A period of 12 months was mentioned but I would like to see that period extended.  Under the Constitution children may be adopted in exceptional cases where their parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards there children but there may be other reasons for such adoption, such as emotional or mental torture.  This would require a referendum.  I believe the Bill as drafted keeps within the ambit of the Constitution.  Again, I urge that this Bill be supported by all sides because it is of major importance.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy should try to improve family law.  This is a very big and important area to which we should all turn our minds.  Deputy Lawlor mentioned that this area was a Pandora's box for lawyers. I have been qualified as a solicitor for more years than I care to remember but I believe the majority of solicitors and barristers approach family law with a great deal of sadness.  They tend to get involved with the families because they want to understand their problems.  The majority of solicitors and barristers involved in this area are not in it for money.  I would not like people think that is why this matter is being discussed as everyone here is interested in the good of the children concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies who have spoken in this debate which has run for two weeks.  In particular.  I wish to thank all those who made comments supportive of the Bill who represent parties of different ideologies and beliefs and who have come together on a Bill which I hope will be non-contentious <Col N="1923" /> and will receive the support of Members of all parties in the House.  I should like to thank Deputies from the various parties represented who have spoken and I should also like to thank the Independent Deputies who indicated that they are supportive of the Bill and will be supporting it in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initial comments made by the Minister for Health when he indicated that the Government accepted in principle the aims and objectives of the Bill.  The purpose of this legislation is to extend the possibility of adoption to children who are either in long term foster care or in long term residential care and who have no prospect, for the rest of their childhood, of resuming a normal family life with their own parents.  I welcome the fact that the Minister acknowledges there is a need to change the law in this area.</P>
      <P>It appears at least in this debate that we have achieved a consensus on this issue because it was only on 30 April last, in reply to a Dáil question which I tabled to the Minister, that he indicated, in the context of the report of the adoption review board which recommends the reform we are seeking to bring about, that he would in the coming months consider the recommendations contained in that report with a view to producing legislation. It appears that this debate in a sense has focused the mind of the Government on the issue and has brought forward a general agreement in principle in the House that our adoption laws in this area require change and that such change proposed in the Bill is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the agreement in principle, I find it totally inexplicable that the Government are not merely not willing to extend their support to the Bill or to even abstain on a vote but are, apparently, intent on opposing it.  A vote on Second Stage on any measure in the House is a vote to accept the principles of the legislation.  The specifics, the nitty gritty, of the individual sections and subsections are teased out on Committee Stage.  If the Government are genuine in <Col N="1924" /> stating that they accept the need for this change and that they agree with the Bill in principle, the only action they can take is to support it on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the specific measures contained in the Bill and Deputies on different sides of the House have referred to possible amendments which may be necessary.  The Minister, in his speech, also made such reference. Indeed, Deputy Andrews has already stated what I intended to state on this issue and what I stated in opening the debate last Tuesday week, that Committee Stage is the normal process during which amendments are tabled to a Bill. We on this side of the House are open to consider any reasonable amendments which will ensure that this legislation will work fully and properly to achieve the objectives it seeks to bring about.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a number of concerns including the constitutional issue and suggested that there might be a constitutional infirmity in the Bill.  Neither the Minister nor any member of the Fianna Fáil Party has, in any speech delivered in the House, referred in any specific detail to any constitutional infirmity within the provisions of the Bill. If such exists and if there is a genuine concern in this regard, it is open to the Minister to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said he wishes to consider extending the possibility of adoption to married couples under the age of 18 years.  I have not heard any great public clamour on the part of married couples under 18 years of age to have the possibility of adoption extended to them. That issue as a problem does not even appear in the context of the review committee on adoption services but, in so far as the Minister perceives it as a problem, it can be raised on Committee Stage.  If it is a problem it is a very minor one compared to the position of many hundreds of children who are currently abandoned by parents and deprived of the family security that adoption can extend to them.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are in excess of 1,000 such children at present in that <Col N="1925" /> position.  How many thousands of children in the years gone by have been deprived of the security of a normal family life because of the Dickensian nature of our adoption laws?  How many thousands of children who found themselves in permanent residential care in the past decades could have benefited from an adoption law which sought to extend the possibility of a normal family life to them?  If the Government are genuinely committed to this reform, I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister not to divide the House on this issue.  The Government may be defeated but I do not perceive it as a matter of party politics.</P>
    <P>Abandoned children should not be kicked about the floor of this Chamber as if they were footballs on a political football pitch.  They should be treated seriously and their problems should be addressed.  I hope the measure will not be opposed and I appeal to the Minister not to do so.  If he is suggesting, as has been said, that he will introduce his own Bill &mdash; various timescales have been given &mdash; it is quite clear that any Bill which the Government might produce has no prospect of completing its passage through the Oireachtas this side of the summer recess.  Indeed, any Bill that might be published by the Minister has no hope of a Second Stage debate this side of the summer recess because of the burden which the Finance Bill will impose on the House.  Any such Second Stage debate which might take place would merely repeat much of what has been said during the course of this debate.  I suggest to the Minister that the Fine Gael Party, in bringing forward this Bill, have done a service to the House by providing for a debate on a major issue of social reform within Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister in supporting the Bill, if it achieves a Second Reading, to adopt it as a Government measure, to bring it into Government time and to take up Committee Stage.  He should table whatever amendments he deems appropriate and I invite him to do so in the context of his announced agreement and commitment in principle to this reform.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the difficulties <Col N="1926" /> inherent in the adoption process provided in the Bill and technical matters which need to be resolved.  I agree with many speakers who said it would be preferable to have this issue dealt with in a properly constituted family court than in the context of the High Court, but no such family court exists and, constitutionally, it appears that the issue of adoption of legitimate children must be dealt with at High Court level.  I would be the first to state that the issue of expense and legal costs for lawyers or anyone else should be reduced and, if possible, removed from an adoption process.  However, if it is necessary for these matters to be dealt with at High Court level, it is also necessary to ensure that the children available for adoption are not just available for adoption by those rich enough to be able to afford to complete the type of adoption process which our Constitution appears to impose on them by virtue of the provisions contained in Articles 41 and 42.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will reconsider their approach.  A major social reform programme is necessary in the general area of children's law and services.  For far too long Members of the House and successive Governments have paid lip service to the need for reform but have been very slow in bringing forward legislation. It is not our intention in proposing the Bill to cause embarrassment to the Government.  Deputy Taylor put it well when he said that, if the Government are embarrassed this evening, it is an embarrassment which they brought on themselves.  If the Government are defeated on this measure this evening, in real terms it will not be a political defeat but a victory for the children of Ireland. It will be a victory for the abandoned children of Ireland who look to us in this House to extend to them the possibility of a secure family life with parents whom they can regard as their true parents. They look to us to extend to them the possibility of a family life outside institutional care when they have been abandoned by their own parents through no fault of their own.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry Desmond has given me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the waiver of health contributions from the farming community. We have a shortage of time.  May I suggest that the Deputy take seven minutes and the Minister four.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount outstanding from farmers and collectable by the Revenue Commissioners now stands at £9.7 million.  This is in respect of the years commencing 5 April 1985 and presumably to 5 April 1987, inclusive.  The figure is suggested as an estimate.  I was quite taken aback when I heard from the Minister for Finance in reply to a question raised by Deputy Wyse that the actual amount which is likely to be collected out of the £9.7 million is a derisory £2 million.  I am concerned, and the House should be, that £7.7 million of health contributions for the years 1985-86 is effectively being written off prematurely on a questionable basis by the Revenue Commissioners.  I should like to indicate the effect of a loss of Appropriations-in-Aid to the Health Vote of £7.7 million.  If the Department of Health had the full £9.7 million in 1987, as they should have because that money is due &mdash; reminders have been sent to those concerned &mdash; it would provide pay and pensions and employer contributions for 1,000 health workers.  It should be remembered that other sections of the community pay their health contributions on a weekly or monthly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate of the Department of Health is made up on the basis of £10,000 per worker and if the amount outstanding was available there would not be any need to pay off 1,000 people employed by the health agencies or to cut services. That is the impact of the failure to collect those contributions.  I am not satisfied about this matter.  Only now, after two or three years, are the Revenue Commissioners indicating that because of overall limitations on staff resources they are commencing enforcement proceedings in the case of health contributions. That is not acceptable <Col N="1931" /> particularly when one realises that revenue is urgently needed to keep essential public services in operation.  The Government did not have any difficulty in writing off, in addition to that £7.7 million, a figure of £6 million in farm tax.  Legislation has not gone through yet to deal with that issue and, hopefully, it will not go through.  I hope the Government will revise their policy decision in that regard before the publication of the Finance Bill on 22 May.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the position that a section of the community whose representatives through the IFA are simultaneously calling for a massive reduction in public expenditure are, in effect, having £6 million written-off in farm tax and a further £7.7 million due in health contributions waived by the Minister for Finance.  That is something the rest of the community should feel irate about and it should be addressed by the Minister.  If the Minister, who is responsible for the public service, could find 125 people for Jobsearch I am sure he could find 20 or 30 people in the public service to issue enforcement proceedings through the sheriff's office in respect of health contribution arrears.  The Minister laid off 200 people in the farm classification office and I am sure he could have asked them to stay for a couple of months to collect the arrears of contributions. Those skilled persons, including a number who live in my constituency, are now drawing the dole.  The money is due and there is no excuse for not collecting it.  I may be regarded as being anti-farmer but I am not.  As far as I am concerned we must all pay our due share of income tax and levies to maintain essential public services.  A bitter lesson is being learned now in rural areas with county hospitals closing down and basic community care services being withdrawn because of the lack of financial resources for health boards.  That arises because of the decision in regard to the farm tax and the failure to collect health contributions.</P>
    <P>Were I a farmer and had seen over the years one Government being played <Col N="1932" /> off against the next, and one party being played off against another with promises of amendments in the taxation system, I too would be tempted not to bother paying any taxes, including health contributions. As far as I know the only time farmers now pay will be under the regulations I brought in.  If they go into hospital they will have to pay £100.  They will have to pay when they are faced with the extremity of an emergency admission but that is not good bookkeeping, good taxation or good administration.  I urge the Minister to remedy this as a matter of the utmost public importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity tonight to dispel any misconceptions which may have arisen in this area and others.  I am pleased to be able to say that what Deputy Desmond has said is totally untrue and misleading.  There has been no write-off whatever of any tax liability. It is nonsense to say, as Deputy Desmond did, that £6 million has been written-off in respect of land tax.  He is aware that another provision of the budget was a reduction in the VAT refund to farmers which yielded the same amount straightaway to the Exchequer.  Let us deal with facts and not create banner headlines for emotional reasons.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of my reply to the question tabled by Deputy Wyse the health contributions due from full-time farmers are collectible by the health boards for years prior to the year ended 5 April, 1985.  Contributions from full-time farmers for the year ended 5 April 1985 and subsequent years are collectible by the Revenue Commissioners as are contributions from part-time farmers for all years.  Arrears of approximately £6 million are due to the health boards from farmers and these are being pursued by the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated in my reply yesterday that there was a total balance outstanding of £9.7 million in respect of farmers' health contributions which are collectible by the Revenue Commissioners.  I emphasised that the figure of £9.7 million was no more than an estimate and on the <Col N="1933" /> basis of previous experience the amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal, and for various other reasons and the figure will change accordingly.  In fact, a large part of contributions outstanding relate to cases where income tax is under appeal, that amount of the £9.7 million being £4.5 million.  Late appeals may be received in other cases.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that these factors and such collection difficulties as those arising from the financial position of some farmers will result in an actual collection of £2 million out of the total balance outstanding of £9.7 million.  I should also like to stress that £2.5 million has been paid by farmers in health contributions.  I wish to emphasise, as strongly as possible, that the difference between the balance outstanding and the expected yield is due primarily to factors such as the amounts being reduced on appeal and is not, as has been alleged, as a result of a decision not to pursue these arrears from farmers.</P>
    <P>I should also emphasise that arrears of health contributions from farmers are only a very tiny fraction of the total tax to be collected at any given time.  It is perfectly sound administrative practice on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, and common business sense, to deploy resources towards the collection and enforcement of the various taxes in a way which reflects the scale of the arrears in the context of all arrears of tax.  This practice was, of course, followed by the Revenue Commissioners during the previous administration, during the course of which collection responsibility for health contributions for full-time farmers was transferred to the Revenue and at a time when that administration was reducing the staff at the Revenue Commissioners.  All the facts should be put on the table.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> I accept there is scope for improvements in the collection and enforcement of health contributions.  There is always scope for improvement.  The question is, of course, a simple pragmatic one: what resources are required and what extra tax would be collected as a result.</P>
    <P>Improved enforcement also will require that the existing enforcement agencies will have to experience some relief from the heavy burden of the very large numbers of income tax and VAT cases which they have to handle at present.  There are prospects that the appointment of 12 Revenue sheriffs last year and the operation of the tax clearance certificate scheme in relation to public contracts and grants will make a contribution towards this and that the enforcement agencies, sheriffs and solicitors, will have the capacity to take on health contributions.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government will take all possible steps to bring about a situation where more effective enforcement of health contributions will be effected.  To this end I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to review their present operations in this area to see if a speedy improvement can be instituted and what cost-effective changes can be made.</P>
    <P>The collection and enforcement of health contributions is not as satisfactory as I would wish.  On the other hand, statements about £7 million of contributions not being pursued are grossly exaggerated and totally untrue.  I am reviewing the present position to see what further improvements can be made and whether these would be cost-effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 43 together.  In two recent Supreme Court judgements, the latest in December last, serious doubts were raised about the constitutional competence of peace commissioners to remand prisoners in custody or on bail.  I have been advised that in the light of the Supreme Court's comments the continued exercise of such functions by peace commissioners could be successfully challenged.  The problem of judicial functions and powers being exercised by peace commissioners in criminal matters does not appear to be capable of being resolved by amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peace commissioners have now ceased to be used for the remand of prisoners and instead prisoners are being brought before district justices.  After normal court hours this means that district justices must hold special courts.  The <Col N="1785" /> number of special courts being held outside the Dublin area is not great, but frequent special courts are being held in Dublin.  That is one of the matters which I will take into consideration in connection with the question of a permanent night court in Dublin which I have at present under examination.</P>
    <P>The change has placed an additional burden on district justices and I would like to take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of the co-operation of the President of the District Court, and district justices in general, in helping to deal with the problem.</P>

Resignations for other reasons and deaths, dismissals and possibly career breaks may reduce the force strength by a further 50 to 100 members during 1987.</P>
      <P>As regards replacements, the position is that 76 recruit gardaí, having completed their initial training, were allocated to stations on 16 April and a further 105 recruit gardaí, who will be passing-out at the Garda Training Centre tomorrow, will be taking up duty on Friday next.  In addition, 45 candidates from the last recruitment competition, to whom definite appointment commitments were made prior to the budget announcement on the proposed reduction in public service numbers, were appointed to the force yesterday and these members will become available for assignment to stations later this year.  It is not proposed to provide for any further recruitment to the Garda Síochána this year.</P>

      <P>I should make it clear initially that, at present, there is no diagnosed case of AIDS within the prison system and there is no evidence that the AIDS virus has been spread among offenders while in custody.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the emergence in the prisons of offenders with AIDS antibodies is simply a reflection of what has been happening in the outside community.  As is now well known, AIDS can be transmitted through the sharing of needles and, given the high number of drug abusers who are committed to prison by the courts, AIDS-related problems were bound to arise in the prisons.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive guidelines have been issued to staff on dealing with infectious diseases and the need for appropriate hygiene measures.  Last October 200 people from the prison and related services attended a two-day seminar organised by my Department on &ldquo;AIDS &mdash; Implications for the Irish Prison Service&rdquo; and this was in line with the continuing policy of making available the most up-to-date information about AIDS and enabling the prison service to respond effectively to the situation.</P>
      <P>Early in 1986 it was decided to segregate offenders who had been identified as having the AIDS virus.  This was an arrangement which it was considered would make it easier to adopt certain medical precautions and would facilitate the operational requirements of the prison service.  At present 36 male offenders who have been identified as having come in contact with the AIDS virus are being accommodated in the separation unit at Mountjoy.  The accommodation available there is no longer sufficient to meet requirements and I am taking certain measures to deal with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards services to these offenders, an additional doctor was appointed specifically to deal with them.  In addition, special provision has been made for counselling of offenders identified as <Col N="1791" /> positive and a multi-disciplinary counselling team is in place to improve the co-ordination of services to these offenders.</P>
    <P>In relation to the spread of AIDS, the Deputy will appreciate that, as in the outside community, an individual who avoids sexual or blood-to-blood contact with an infected person is not at risk.</P>

As announced in the budget, the Government have decided on measures to secure a reduction in the numbers employed right across the public service. In these circumstances, it is not proposed to have any additional recruitment of civilian clerical staff to the Garda Síochána this year.  I should mention, however that 81 temporary clerical trainees were appointed to Garda offices this year for a period of 12 months to give them experience of office work and this arrangement has the effect of making additional gardaí available for operational duty.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present examining an expert report, prepared internally, on the deficiencies in the present system containing recommendations to effect improvements.

The Garda authorities have informed me that there has been a decrease in the number of reported offences of this nature over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of the introduction of amending legislation in this area, the position is that following a <Col N="1793" /> decision of the previous administration, the reconstituted Law Reform Commission has undertaken an examination of the law on sexual offences, including the law on child sexual abuse.  In so far as any recommendations the commission may make, for a change in the law on child sexual abuse, come within the ambit of my Department, they will be considered by me following the publication of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>As regards training, I want to make it clear that the Garda role in cases of child sexual abuse relates primarily to the investigation of alleged offences.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the level of crime in our society remains a matter of great concern, I am happy to put on record the fact that the level of recorded indictable crime decreased by over 10 per cent during the period 1984-85 and that preliminary figures for 1986 indicate a further reduction of the order of 5 per cent.  This downward trend is distinctly encouraging. There can of course be no relaxation of the efforts to deal with our crime rates which still remain at too high a level. I can assure the House that tackling the problem is one of my priorities and that the gardaí will continue to have the full support and backing of the Government in their efforts to further reduce crime levels.</P>

      <P>Substantial work has been undertaken in recent years to improve the accommodation available at the women's prison in Mountjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1986 work was completed on converting the old officers' quarters <Col N="1795" /> into eight multiple cells capable of accommodating 24 offenders.  This accommodation is very modern and includes toilet and washing facilities in each cell.  It also provides additional recreation and showering facilities.</P>
    <P>Other improvement works included the conversion of an old storage area into a knitting room which provides working accommodation for 12 offenders and the conversion of a small area of the old laundry into a sewing room with working accommodation for six.</P>
    <P>The main block area has been totally rewired and a new cell communication system has been installed.</P>
    <P>While I believe that these improvements are welcome I am anxious to proceed with the acquisition of the new unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital which it was intended to use primarily for female offenders with medical and related problems.  The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government decided early last year that the unit should be handed over to my Department but this decision was not implemented.  I am in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Health, with a view to ensuring its implementation at this stage.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I do not accept that it is necessarily the case that the great majority of women sentenced to prison are convicted of relatively minor offences.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the invaluable work being done by the Irish Association for Victim Support and that there are now 100,000 crime victims in this country, he will increase the reduced allocation for this association from £8,000 in the Revised Estimates to allow the association to deal more effectively with the ever increasing number of referrals by the Garda Síochána; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Association for Victim Support is to be commended as an organisation for providing, on a voluntary basis, a variety of support services for the victims of crime and I fully support this work.  I regard the £8,000 being provided by the State this year as a token of this support, as indeed the £10,000 provided last year. The main contribution of the association must consist of the voluntary efforts of its membership.</P>
      <P>The amount to be provided for any service in the Estimates for any year is decided on the basis of the requirements of the particular service, the requirement for other services and the overall budgetary position.  While we would all like to be in a position to give the association a bigger subvention, I consider that, having regard to these criteria, the provision for 1987 is appropriate.  As to the number of crime victims in the country I am not in a position to accept or reject the Deputy's estimate without an unwarranted expenditure of resources.</P>

      <P>The provision of £145,000 covers four items, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Data Protection Authority</P>
      <P>By far the greater part (£116,000) of this sum represents a contingency provision to meet the cost of a data protection authority under proposed data protection legislation.  The Government has given approval to the drafting of such legislation, which will enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to the automatic processing of personal data.</P>
      <P>2.  Fees to members of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal</P>
      <P>£27,000 is provided to cover the fees paid to the members of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in respect of work done in assessing cases.</P>
      <P>3.  Fees under Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration</P>
      <P>A provision of £1,000 was included to cover the possibility that payment of fees to independent experts may arise under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>
      <P>4.  Commission on Gaming and Lotteries</P>
      <P>A provision of £1,000 was included to cover the possible setting up of a Commission to examine the whole area of gaming and lotteries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law in relation to moneylending is contained in the Moneylenders Acts, 1900 and 1933.</P>
      <P>I am aware that views have been expressed to the effect that this legislation is unsatisfactory and that allegations of irregularities by moneylenders have been made by the media in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí pursue actively all alleged breaches of the law in relation to moneylenders. In keeping with this policy all divisional officers had investigations carried out following the allegations of irregularities by moneylenders which were made in the media in November and December 1985 and subsequently. Some evidence of irregularities was found to exist in the area of Cork, Galway, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
      <P>This, however, must be assessed in the following context.  First, a difficulty nearly always encountered by the gardaí in investigating the allegations against moneylenders is that in many cases the persons making the allegations or the borrowers in question are either unable or unwilling to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second &mdash; and this is of central importance &mdash; most of what may be described as irregularities in the matter of moneylending are not criminal offences.  In many important instances the Acts do not create offences at all and, therefore, do not provide for a criminal sanction but only for a restriction on the civil right of the moneylender to recover a debt in the courts.  Accordingly, the remedy provided by law does not rest with the gardaí &mdash; even when they get full co-operation <Col N="1808" /> from the borrower &mdash; but with the borrower himself if the moneylender seeks to bring civil proceedings against him.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the matter of interest and related charges.  There is no power vested in the Garda to prosecute for excessive charges.  Charging more than 39 per cent is not a criminal offence.  The figure is mentioned in the 1933 Act in the context of a provision which allows a court, in proceedings brought by a moneylender for the recovery of money lent, to re-open the transaction and give equitable relief if the transaction is harsh and unconscionable.  The court must conclusively assume that it is such a transaction if the interest exceeds 39 per cent simple interest but can give relief even where the interest is less.  Charging more than that rate of interest could also be significant in the context of applications for renewal of certificates of fitness.</P>
    <P>The resumé I have given of the situation does not amount to saying that I would favour changes in the Moneylending Acts &mdash; either in relation to interest rates or in relation to remedies. I have serious doubts that that would be a satisfactory solution.  However, I propose to keep the matter under review and I am prepared to examine any suggestions for improvements by interested groups.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the essential character of a moneylending transaction it seems to me that there is much to be said for dealing with the issue in the context of consumer protection and-or credit control as is, for instance, the case in Britain.  That aspect has recently been the subject of consideration in the Department of Industry and Commerce and I intend to pursue it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the EC it is not possible to prohibit imports except where there is justification on animal health grounds.  The most effective response to import competition is for the Irish pigmeat industry to become as efficient as its rivals.  This applies at all stages from production to slaughtering and processing and up to the marketing of pigmeat products.</P>
      <P>While improved performance is possible at all levels the manufacturing sector is of particular importance.  A rationalisation programme for the slaughter-house industry is at present being implemented through the replacement of a large number of outdated premises with a smaller number of plants capable of more cost-efficient throughput.  Extensive modernisation of processing plants, which will obtain their raw material from the larger scale slaughterhouses, is also being undertaken.  The pigmeat sector has been singled out for particularly generous grant-aid of up to 75 per cent between the IDA and FEOGA for suitable projects throughout the country.  A special allocation of FEOGA funds for this purpose has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the industry is well structured at <Col N="1811" /> producer level, a recent An Foras Talúntais report on competitiveness pointed to a number of areas in which increased efficiency could be achieved.  Since feed is such an important element in pig production costs, it is clearly in the interest of both the compounding industry and the pigmeat industry to ensure that feedingstuffs for pigs are available at the most competitive prices to the user.</P>
    <P>The full benefits of improvements at producer level and of the capital investment programme at processing level will not be achieved unless they are supported by aggressive marketing, involving diversification of markets and products.</P>
    <P>The overall aim for the sector is the development of a more efficient and modern industry capable of competing effectively on both domestic and export markets.</P>

      <P>The conditions of the employment incentive scheme require that an application to participate must be submitted and approved by the local office of the National Manpower Service before recruitment takes place.  Failure to comply with this condition automatically disqualifies an employer from participation in the scheme.  In the case in question, the employer made an application to participate in the scheme dated 16 April 1987 and his application was received and approved by the local office of the National Manpower Service on 22 April 1987.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of approval to participate in the scheme and employer is required to complete and return to the local office of the National Manpower Service an eligibility certificate in respect of each worker recruited.  In this instance, the eligibility certificate showed that the employer recruited the worker concerned on 13 April 1987 which was prior to the date of approval to participate in the scheme by the local National Manpower Office.  (i.e. 22 April 1987).</P>
      <P>As the employer's application in respect of this worker was in breach of the published conditions of the scheme his application to participate was rejected by the local office of the National Manpower Service.</P>

In order to remain within the budget provided for the social employment scheme in 1987, participation quotas have been allocated for each NMS region.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 127 and 132 together.  The provision of transport facilities in respect of the child and family services referred to by the Deputies is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  I have made inquiries of the Eastern Health Board and I understand that the decision to discontinue the transport service to these facilities is part of an overall package of measures drawn up by the board in order to operate within its 1987 revenue allocation.  The board has indicated however that it will be prepared to review individual cases to ensure continuing attendance at these clinics.</P>
