      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell me if any provision has been made for consultation at European Community level in relation to the consequences of recent events on stock markets and whether any provision has been made at European Community level for an examination of the possible implications of these changes on money markets?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that the matter is so serious at this stage as to warrant some formal consultations so that at least financial operators and market operators in the Community can know that the Governments of the Community are taking an interest in the course of events?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach arrange with the Minister for Justice to make time available today for a statement on the unfortunate happenings in Midleton on Monday last involving the escape of the kidnappers of John <Col N="1427" /> O'Grady?  I say that with all sincerity.  I believe there is a need for the House to clarify what exactly went on.  I believe a statement from the Minister would be the best way of achieving this.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say when will the legislation to amalgamate the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board of Science and Technology be brought before the House? Would he agree that there is some urgency in the matter in the sense that the staff of both sides are, to some degree at least, operating in limbo at present as the Government's intentions do not correspond with the statute under which they are operating?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>This is very necessary legislation which is essential if an unsatisfactory situation which we inherited from our predecessors is to be cleared up and it will be brought before the House at the earliest possible moment by the Minister for Energy and Communications. I find it slightly ironically amusing that Deputy George Birmingham would suggest that there is any doubt about who is responsible for this legislation in view of its chequered history between his party and the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with amendment No. 6 in the name of the Minister.  Amendment No. 7 is an alternative, and amendments Nos. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are related.  Therefore, we are taking amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 together and <Col N="1433" /> in conjunction with this grouping it is proposed to take amendment No. 14(a) in the name of Deputy Mervyn Taylor which is on the additional list.  This is an alternative to amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Alan Shatter which is also on the additional list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Since on the last day it seemed that a consensus was emerging about a particular matter which arose under the original amendment No. 14, Deputy Taylor and I have tabled virtually identical amendments to replace the original amendment No. 14.  The point being made then was that there would be many situations in which a child would be born outside marriage, where the mother and father of the child had no dispute between them, where there was no doubt as to the father and where the mother may have a stable ongoing relationship in a variety of different circumstances and may wish, and indeed be anxious, that the father acts jointly as parent of the child born to them.  In other words, the father should be a joint guardian with her in the same way that a married couple are automatically joint guardians of their child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various amendments we were going through on the last day, some of which encapsulated a somewhat different approach by the Minister to the approach I was adopting, also had some similarities. One area we spent some time discussing was the issue of parents having to involve themselves unnecessarily in court proceedings.  Under the terms of the Bill, no matter what the circumstances relating to the birth of a child outside marriage are, if the father is to have joint guardianship rights with the mother a court application is required. On the last occasion I made a point that in most other jurisdictions, including member states and in countries like New Zealand and Australia, it is not necessary to make a court application in such circumstances. Where there is a dispute between a mother and a father, the father, in order to acquire guardianship rights, will often have to seek a court order.  Where there is no dispute it is putting an unnecessary burden on parents <Col N="1434" /> to require that a court order be sought. That does not seem to be in the interest of the child, if it can be assumed that a child has a right to have a relationship with both parents.</P>
    <P>Under my original amendment which sought to add a new section a father would automatically be joint guardian if registered as father in the register of births.  During the course of the discussion on that amendment it was suggested that in some circumstances a father could register as father without the consent of the mother.  However, under the Bill the father will only register with the mother's consent or as a result of a court order.  On the last day it appeared that a consensus was emerging in the House &mdash; the coincidence of Deputy Taylor and I tabling similar amendments shows that &mdash; which seemed to indicate that in circumstances where it was agreed by the mother that the father should have joint guardianship rights and where a child was registered under the name of the mother and the father there should automatically be joint guardianship rights.  That would cut out the necessity for a large number of court applications that might otherwise arise under the original provision.  Under the Bill as drafted, even where there is agreement between a couple under the new section 6 (a) to be inserted in the Guardianship of Infants Act &mdash; section 12 of the Bill before us &mdash; for a father to get joint guardianship rights a court application will have to be made.</P>
    <P>My proposal is to replace the amendment we discussed on the last day and my new amendment, if adopted, would become section 6 (b) of the Guardianship of Infants Act and would read:</P>
    <P>6B.&mdash;Where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other and where the father is registered as the father of an infant in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987 and, where the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian, the father shall automatically be a guardian of the <Col N="1435" /> infant and no application by the father to be so appointed as provided for in section 6A of this Act shall be required.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, in the interests of improving the Bill, reducing the necessity for people to incur legal expense by making court applications and with a view to providing a mechanism that would extend guardianship rights to fathers in circumstances where the mother agrees that they should be extended, to accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>The only basis on which it could be argued that the amendment should not be accepted would be if there was an assumption that generally speaking it was not in the interest of children born outside of marriage to have a relationship with their fathers, even in circumstances where the mother wishes that such relationship should be maintained.  It seems to me that some of the underlying currents in the Bill are based on a value system of a nature that is introducing a new discrimination into our law.  We are getting rid of the stigma of illegitimacy and regarding it as a duty on Members of the House through legislation to provide effective statutory provisions to place children in a position of legal equality and give mothers of children born outside of marriage as much protection as possible but are regarding the fathers of children born outside marriage in a somewhat different position.  It could be argued that in seeking to remove the stigma of illegitimacy and whatever stigma attaches to being an unmarried mother we are seeking to reimpose and copperfasten by legislation a very severe social stigma with regard to unmarried fathers.  We are seeking to make it as difficult as possible in the Bill for the unmarried father to acquire guardianship rights towards children born outside wedlock.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to organisations that represent single parents and unmarried mothers as objecting to fathers having automatic guardianship rights but my amendment would not confer an <Col N="1436" /> automatic guardianship right.  It would confer guardianship rights where the mother consents as is provided in the Act.  It provides that where the mother consents the father can become guardian but a court application is required.  We should examine the logic of that.  If the mother agrees that the father should become guardian and if they both apply to the court, the court has to decide the issue on the basis of the welfare of the child but I wonder in what circumstances the Minister would envisage where there is such a joint parental application the courts refusing to grant joint guardianship rights.  Are we going to say to judges who may disapprove of unmarried fathers that in those circumstances they should not grant joint guardianship rights?  We are seeking to create a situation that where a child is born outside marriage the law will be phrased in such a way that will encourage the mother and father to play a constructive role in the upbringing of that child and act as joint guardians, particularly in circumstances where there is no dispute between the parents.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 14 or No. 14a.  There is no great difference between them.  They would improve the Bill and limit the circumstances in which court applications are necessary.  They would help to provide a mechanism which would enable fathers of children born outside marriage to, in a simple way, acquire guardianship rights.  It should be remembered that we are not talking about the father in circumstances where a man and woman have been living together for a time and have never been through a ceremony of marriage.  We are talking about extending guardianship rights by agreement to fathers in circumstances where, perhaps, the father has previously been party to a marriage which the Roman Catholic marriage tribunals have declared null and void and the father may have gone through a second ceremony of marriage in Church and be living happily for many years with his second wife.  Under our curious legal system there are hundreds of couples in that position and none of <Col N="1437" /> them has the possibility of having a valid civil legal marriage but in the context of the religious area and their social position they are regarded by everybody as being a married couple.  It would seem to me anomalous that couples bringing up three or four children should be forced to make court applications if the father is to acquire guardianship rights.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment which deals with some of the worries and objections the Minister raised with the original amendment.  It deals with some of the fears of groups who represent single parents and adequately ensures that court applications of an unnecessary nature will not have to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw my amendment because it is virtually identical with Deputy Shatter's.  I support the substance of Deputy Shatter's amendment, the sole purpose of which is a very basic and simple one, to save parties the necessity in the circumstances outlined of having to go to the court, to retain solicitors and counsel, to obtain an order.  That burden is being imposed on them at a time when the Minister is failing to provide an adequate degree of free legal aid to enable them to do so.  People should be able to have access to the law.  If the Minister was providing a full and adequate free legal aid service there would be some grounds for refusing to accept the amendment.  If the father is on the birth certificate as the father of the child and the mother consents in writing <Col N="1438" /> to the father being joint guardian of the child I cannot see why the Minister should tell those unfortunate people that he is sorry but they must have recourse to the law and to see their solicitor.  In other words, even if they agree, they must go through the whole legal process with all the time, trouble, expense and reluctance which many people have to get involved with the law.  This is understandable and in many cases justifiable.  What is the purpose of this?</P>
      <P>The Minister on the last occasion made a remark about the wife having her arm twisted to agree to the joint appointment of guardianship.  However, that stretches the imagination because, if a man has been put down on the birth certificate as the father, he will create pressures on the woman to have himself appointed as a guardian.  In such a case he is showing an interest in the child and should be encouraged to do so.  Even if the Minister is right, arm twisting could also apply in a court case as it would always be open to the woman to claim that she was compelled to sign the letter of consent.  Why put these people, quite unnecessarily, to the trouble, annoyance and expense of going to court?  There is no rhyme or reason to it.  It is a very simple amendment which I thought the Minister would accept as it makes a lot of sense.  I am curious to hear his reasons for objecting to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two important issues dealt with by these amendments which must, for technical reasons, be debated together, first, whether the father of a child of parents who have not married each other should be appointed guardian without court approval and, secondly, when should a father be guardian following the grant of a nullity decree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these questions is raised in a substantive way by Deputy Taylor's amendment No. 14a and Deputy Shatter's substitute amendment No. 14, which is worded almost identically.  I note that Deputy Shatter has now forsaken the earlier approach in his original amendment No. 14, which would have made the father guardian of his child born outside <Col N="1439" /> marriage virtually automatically.  No doubt the Deputy was persuaded in this course by the weight of argument in my contributions when we were last debating these matters.</P>
    <P>The proposal in Deputy Taylor's amendment No. 14a, acceptable to Deputy Shatter, does, admittedly, have a certain initial appeal, but would be unsatisfactory in general respects for reasons which I will now outline.  It cannot be assumed that, generally speaking, fathers of children born outside marriage have an interest in those children of such a kind as to justify them becoming guardians merely with the consent of the mother.  In many instances this would not be true and the facts of many affiliation cases show this.</P>
    <P>Guardianship is an important responsibility &mdash; a guardian has in his or her hands the destiny of the child.  It is important that the fact of guardianship be ascertainable by the public at large; that a public and verifiable record of the relationship of guardian and child be available.  There must be some means by which people involved in the child's upbringing, such as doctors and teachers, would be able to check from public records who is guardian of a child in a situation where there was doubt about it and important decisions required to be taken about the child's welfare.  In the case of the child of a married couple, the facts of marriage and of birth, on which the guardian-child relationship is based, are matters of public record.  In the case of a testamentary guardian, the will which makes the appointment also becomes a public document.  Where a guardian is appointed by a court, the court records will show this.  In the case of a child whose parents are not married to each other, the births register points to the mother as sole guardian of the child.</P>
    <P>If the father were to become guardian following entry of his name on the births register and the mother giving her consent in writing, there would be no public record of this transaction.  One method of giving such a document the status of a <Col N="1440" /> public record would be to have it registered as a rule of court, in much the same way as an agreement between spouses for maintenance can be registered under section 8 of the 1976 maintenance Act. But registration with a court implies approval by the court; and if the court is to approve such a document it must, in arriving at its decision, consider the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  While I would be prepared to consider a provision along these lines, there seems to me to be little distinction in kind, or in convenience to the parents, between a hearing to approve such a document and a hearing of the type envisaged by the proposed section 6A (3) of the Guardianship Act, at section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The principle seems to be generally accepted that, where parents enter into an agreement which involves the provision of maintenance for a child, or a property settlement which will affect the child's interests, court approval is necessary to ensure that the child's interests are secured.  Section 8 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, is one example of a statutory provision on these lines.  It is concerned with a child of the family; but section 20 of the Bill proposes a similar provision in the case of a child whose parents are not married to each other.  If it is necessary to have court approval to a maintenance agreement or a property agreement which affects the child's material needs, how much more important is it to have court approval for what is, in practical terms, an agreement between the parents which would affect also his religious and moral, intellectual and social welfare by the appointment of a guardian.</P>
    <P>In many cases the child, his mother and his father may have been living in a marriage-like situation where the father shares <i>de facto</i> guardianship with the mother.  This does not mean, however, that, if the father's position as guardian of his child is to be put on a legal footing, it should be done in a way which circumvents the safeguards that a court hearing, however informal, offers for the child's welfare.  The proposal in section <Col N="1441" /> 12 of the Bill as it stands will enable the court to give proper consideration to all the relevant factors in each case, including, in an informal hearing, whether the mother's consent was free and informed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the inclusion in the section of guidelines for the court, it is not possible to formulate any such guidelines which will not either be so restrictive as to exclude otherwise suitable cases, or else so loosely expressed as to be capable of admitting otherwise unsuitable cases. The wide variety of circumstances that can arise from case to case means that it would be futile to attempt to guide the court in any more particular way than that set out in section 3 of the guardianship Act, which is in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant ... etc., is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is defined in the Act as comprising the religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social welfare of the infant.</P>
    <P>The two Government amendments, and the remainder of Deputy Shatter's amendments, in this group deal with the position of the father as guardian of his children following on the annulment of a marriage.  The matters raised by these amendments fall into two areas and I will deal with the more straightforward of these first, that is, the question of ancillary orders in nullity proceedings.  As I indicated the last day, I am considering the principle underlying Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 15.  I again ask for this amendment to be withdrawn on the basis that if I consider that anything should be done in the context of the Bill I will come back to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I now come to the substance of the Government amendment No. 8 and Deputy Shatter's alternative amendment No. 9, both of which deal with the question of when a father should be guardian <Col N="1442" /> of the child of a void or voidable marriage by operation of law.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, the Government amendment does not alter the substantive thrust of the Bill as it stands.  It merely re-words the provisions of the Bill dealing with this matter so as to ensure that the desired result is achieved without running the risk that wider significance might be read into the provision than what is intended, having regard to the position of the family based on marriage under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment, Deputy Shatter's amendment and the provisions of the Bill to which they relate do not deal with the establishment of paternity &mdash; that is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill &mdash; but only with whether a father should be a guardian in certain circumstances. As Deputy Shatter has acknowledged, this matter is complex enough as it is and we should endeavour to avoid making it more complex if that is at all possible. The Government amendment sets out the circumstances in which a father will be guardian by operation of law.  If the identity of the father is put in issue, in this as in any other matter, that issue can be resolved by the courts.</P>
    <P>In one respect at least, there seems to be little difference of principle between the Government's amendment No. 8 and Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 9: that is, in regard to voidable marriages.  In relation to the case where a voidable marriage ceremony took place before the birth of the child, both amendments will ensure that the father would remain guardian after the marriage was annulled.  The obvious justification for such a provision is that, since the marriage ceremony is presumed to be valid, the father has been presumed to be joint guardian and will have been acting as such, possibly up to the pronouncement of the decree; to declare at that point that he is no longer guardian would most likely unsettle the child and would be unjust.  That being the case, then it is hard to justify excluding from the provision, as Deputy Shatter's amendment does, a father whose voidable ceremony of marriage took place after the birth of the <Col N="1443" /> child, since up until the decree of nullity that too will be treated as a valid marriage, and the father will have been, accordingly, presumed to be the child's legal guardian since the date of the ceremony.</P>
    <P>The other point of divergence between Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 9 and Government amendment No. 8 concerns marriages which were, or have been found to be, void <i>ab initio</i>.  The Government proposal is that, where the father went through the ceremony in the belief, held on reasonable grounds, that it resulted in a valid marriage, then he should be guardian of the child.  This is based on the same justification as for fathers in voidable marriages: the father in a void marriage, and in many such cases the mother too, will have been acting on the assumption that the marriage ceremony was a valid one and that, accordingly, the father is joint guardian of the child.  Subsection (b), incidentally, provides for a presumption that the father's belief in the validity of the marriage was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there is little practical difference between a petition for a nullity decree based on grounds which would make it void <i>ab initio</i>&mdash; indeed, the same petition may have alternative arguments on both grounds.  In each case, the trigger for the nullity proceedings will usually have been the fact that unhappy differences have arisen between the couple; it is only then that lawyers are consulted with a view perhaps to obtaining a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> and the existence of possible grounds for an annulment emerges. It is reasonable that, in such circumstances, a similar rule regarding the father's guardianship should apply to both voidable marriages and those that are void from the start.</P>
    <P>There are other possible circumstances where a marriage thought to be valid can turn out to have been void from the start much to the dismay of the parties, who may be very happy together; for instance, a case where the couple find out after years of &ldquo;married&rdquo; happiness that they are in fact within the prohibited degrees <Col N="1444" /> of relationship.  Even though such a relationship never was a marriage, it had all the appearances of one to the parties, to their children and to the world at large. Once again, it is reasonable that in such circumstances the father should be guardian of the children by operation of law.</P>
    <P>A line must be drawn at some point, however; and it is drawn in the Government amendment at the point where the father underwent the marriage ceremony knowing it to be a sham.  It would not be right that a bigamist could, by knowingly entering into a bigamous so-called &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;, be guardian of the children of that union by operation of law, while at the same time another married man, who sets up a new relationship with a woman not his wife and has children by her, is constrained, by his honesty in not going through a spurious marriage ceremony, to apply to court to become the guardian of his children.  Hence the requirement that, in relation to void marriages, only the father who acted bona fide will be guardian by virtue of the proposed provision.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid uncertainty in the day-to-day application of this provision, and for obvious practical reasons, the Bill, as I have already mentioned, provides that there will be a presumption in any such case that the husband did have a reasonable belief that the marriage was a valid one; this will enable the parents, the children and the court to act on the presumption that the father is guardian unless and until his <i>mala fides</i> have been determined by the court in which the father's guardianship is challenged.</P>
    <P>These provisions are designed to lessen hardship and provide certainty in as many nullity cases as appropriate, and to avoid unnecessary recourse to the courts, with consequent trauma and expense to the parties and their children.</P>

      <P>As I said the last day the difficulty with the discussion is that we are dealing with a number of amendments in areas of law which are particularly complicated.  In trying to bring these matters to a conclusion may I point out to the Minister in a nutshell the problems <Col N="1445" /> with the current structure of the Bill.  I invite the Minister in the context of Report Stage to consider tabling a similar amendment to amendment No. 15.  I also invite the Minister to consider dealing with the issues which I am now going to raise.  If the Minister is willing to do that I am prepared not to push any of these amendments to a vote on the basis that we can come back to them on Report Stage when the Minister has had a further opportunity to consider them.</P>
      <P>If we take the amendment as tabled by the Minister and the structure of the Bill as it would emerge following the Minister's amendments being adopted &mdash; if they were to be adopted &mdash; a whole series of problems would arise.  The first is the one which the Minister acknowledges in the context of nullity proceedings.  At the end of a nullity hearing in the High Court in which a decree of annulment is granted, be it a void or voidable marriage, the reality is that a father may retain his rights as guardian but the court cannot currently make any of the ancillary orders.  If there is a dispute as to which parent should have custody, the court cannot currently resolve it.  If there is a dispute about visitation or access rights, the court cannot currently resolve it.  If there is a dispute concerning the future education of the child between the parents, the court cannot currently resolve it.  If there is a dispute with regard to income support payments to be made to the mother of the child, the court cannot currently resolve that in the context of making ancillary orders after nullity proceedings.</P>
      <P>The parents are forced, if they cannot reach agreement, to resort either to the District or the Circuit courts and they can get caught up in ongoing litigation.  The Minister has acknowledged that this is an area that should be dealt with in this Bill. Section 15 was designed to deal with that area.  The Minister has indicated that he is willing to come back to the House, having considered this amendment, on Report Stage with his own proposal and I am prepared to accept that, but if he does not do so we will be tabling our own amendment to section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The other matter I should like to raise in the context of this amendment is that, if a voidable marriage is declared void, the parties to that marriage will remain joint guardians of any children and if there is a reasonable belief that his marriage was valid on the part of the father and if the marriage is declared void, he will remain a joint guardian.  The Minister may not be aware that in practice there have been a number of nullity cases in which decrees of annulment have been granted by our courts in circumstances in which at the time the decree of annulment was granted, one or both parties have already been involved in relationships with other people and have had children by other people.  I can recall a case in which a decree of annulment was granted on the grounds of the husband's impotence at a time when the wife was residing with somebody else and she had two children by that other person.  On the basis of the Minister's proposal in the context of that voidable marriage there would be an assumption that the &ldquo;husband&rdquo;, the male party to the marriage which is annulled, is the guardian of his wife's children, even in circumstances in which the wife is living with someone else and has given birth to a child or children by another party.  I believe there is a case for allowing joint guardianship to remain, or assuming it will remain after a voidable marriage.  There is also a case, in amendment No. 15 which I tabled, for allowing the courts at the conclusion of nullity proceedings, where there is a dispute as to parentage &mdash; even in circumstances where the Minister's amendment with regard to voidable marriages is accepted &mdash; to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>If we take the case to which I am referring where marriage is annulled on the grounds of the husband's impotence and the wife has two children by somebody else at the date of the nullity proceedings, there is little point in leaving the legal position at the end of those proceedings in such a way that the former husband is assumed to be a guardian and the only orders the court can make are about guardianship or custody rights <i>vis-á-vis</i> the parties to the nullity proceedings.  It <Col N="1447" /> may be necessary in the context of those proceedings to make a declaration as to parentage.  It would seem highly unnecessary to leave the parties in a position whereby there would be a necessity for further court proceedings to clarify the status of the child and the guardianship rights of the former husband or the father of the child who may be a different person.</P>
    <P>There is a need not merely to give the High Court, in nullity proceedings, ancillary powers to determine issues of custody, access and maintenance support payments.  There is also a need, even in the context of what the Minister is saying, to give the High Court jurisdiction to determine parentage disputes or to make a declaration of parentage in circumstances where it is clear that the former husband in the marriage is not the father of the children.  I ask the Minister, when dealing with amendment No. 15, to deal also with that issue.  The effect of the Minister's amendment would be that the former husband would be regarded as guardian of children he may not have fathered.  A great problem would arise in that case and the courts would not have jurisdiction at the conclusion of a nullity case to deal with that issue.  On the one hand, there is an advantage in some instances in allowing former husbands of voidable marriages to retain guardianship rights but there is a necessity for a mechanism to allow those rights to be lifted in circumstances where the former husband is not the father of the child, without the parties having to resort to the other provisions of this Bill which allow a parentage proceeding to be brought in the Circuit Court.  That is a portion of what should be dealt with in the context of nullity proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, in the context of void marriages, that there would be an assumption that the father entered into the marriage with a reasonable belief that the marriage was valid.  I fail to see what that has to do with fathering.  If he believed the marriage was valid but it was not reasonable to do so and nevertheless lived with the mother for some years and <Col N="1448" /> was involved in the rearing of his child, I do not understand why that father should be in a different category in his relationship to his child from the father who did have a reasonable belief that the marriage was valid.  It seems we are going around in very complicated circles in dealing with this matter and that is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 which I have tabled would cover that matter.  If a marriage is void and the birth of a child of that marriage is registered and the mother consents to the father being guardian, this elaborate provision in relation to void marriages would not be necessary.  It would not matter whether or not the father had a reasonable belief in the validity of his marriage.  What would be more effective is that the child has been registered in the name of the father and the mother consents to him being a guardian.  If the reasonable provision is to be included, even where there is an assumption that the belief is reasonable, in the context of nullity proceedings the mother could raise that as an issue and say: &ldquo;This man knew he was not party to a valid marriage and he could not have reasonably believed he was.&rdquo;  If the Minister is going to adhere to this somewhat illogical approach which was copied from British legislation there should, at the very least, be some formal jurisdiction conferred on the High Court to determine at the end of nullity proceedings, if the parties wished the court to do so, whether or not the father had a reasonable belief that the marriage was valid.</P>
    <P>When marriages break down the unfortunate reality is that very often there is a great deal of vindictiveness between husband and wife.  The wife and mother far too often seeks to exclude the father, even when the marriage is valid, from an involvement in the day to day care and upbringing of his child or children.  I could see many cases arising in which nullity decrees are granted where it is alleged by the &ldquo;wife&rdquo; who is a party to a so-called void marriage that the father could not have reasonably believed that the marriage was valid.  The decree will be <Col N="1449" /> granted simply because there is an anxiety on the part of the mother to exclude the father from an involvement in the decision-making process regarding the upbringing of his child or children.  If the Minister's approach about reasonable belief is to be adopted, it would seem that unless the court is conferred with a jurisdiction, after nullity proceedings, to determine that issue, it will give rise to endless practical problems in the day to day workings of nullity cases in the High Court.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems inherent in the manner in which this Bill has been approached by Government, even taking into account the various amendments tabled by the Minister.  It seems that all the arguments the Minister is making with regard to requiring some judicial authority to agree to a father becoming a guardian in circumstances where a child is born outside marriage are based on the concept that generally speaking, fathers of such children are somewhat inferior and unmeritorious people to whom a social stigma should be attached.  It seems that is the premise behind this argument.</P>
    <P>It would be ludicrous to suggest that where a mother has a child outside marriage &mdash; one can imagine the outcry this would cause &mdash; the courts would have to decide whether the mother was a proper person to act as guardian of her child. That has not been suggested and, indeed, it would be extraordinary for someone to suggest it.  Yet is seems that when a mother has a child outside marriage and there is no dispute as to who the father is and if the father wants to act as guardian and the mother consents, that is not good enough; the courts must determine whether it is in the interests of the child's welfare that a particular father act as guardian.  There would be an extraordinary public outcry if it was suggested that in order for an unmarried mother to have guardianship rights over her own child she must first of all have her background checked by the courts.  Equally, there should be a similar outcry in the case of that suggestion being made in the context of unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> In so far as there are some fathers who should not have such rights &mdash; for example, where a child is born as a result of rape &mdash; it is quite clear under the amendments tabled that such a father would not have such a right because the mother's consent would not be forthcoming. The vast majority of children born outside marriage in Ireland today are born as a result of a consentient sexual act taking place between mother and father.  If this Bill is seeking to ensure that the father meets his financial obligations, it should equally seek to ensure that the father is encouraged to have a full parenting relationship with his child where possible and that he should not be excluded from it.  This Bill seeks to create a new stigma, the stigma of the unmarried father and it does everything possible to discourage fathers from exercising parental rights.  A void marriage is a marriage which in law has never taken place so there is little logic in saying that a person who has gone through a void marriage should automatically get guardianship rights but that if somebody forms a relationship and does not celebrate a void marriage, they will not have guardianship rights.  There is little sense in that approach and I would urge the Minister to have another look at the whole structure of these sections of this Bill with a view to seeing if we can remove the necessity for court applications, with a view to seeing if we can encourage the fathers in couples with a stable relationship to exercise their guardianship rights and with a view to seeing if we can confer on our courts the ancillary powers required to determine disputes in circumstances relating to the parenting of children following the granting of decrees of annulment.</P>

The Deputy raised important points for the Minister to consider on Report Stage, and I have brief observations on some of them.  I previously indicated the opposition of The <Col N="1451" /> Workers' Party to the original amendment No. 14 tabled in the name of Deputy Shatter.  I welcome the direction taken in the substitute amendment No. 14 in his name and in amendment No. 14a tabled by Deputy Taylor.  Before we move on to the section Deputy Shatter might respond to some of the points that still concern me about this amendment. The amendment indicates that a father would assume full guardianship rights on the signing of consent by the mother. While the birth of a child can be a happy event for the parents it can also be a time of great trauma for the mother.  It will be accepted that a mother in those circumstances is vulnerable and susceptible to pressure and indeed a lot of pressure. I am concerned that there should be some safeguard in the amendments.  If these amendments are not being pursued this issue might be considered on Report Stage and perhaps the Minister and his officials will bear it in mind with a view to drafting a suitable amendment concerned with the procedures adopted to secure consent from a mother soon after a child has been born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act envisages an informal procedure, a procedure as informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice.  To what extent does the Minister consider that there will be elements of formality in a procedure that is consistent with the administration of justice?  A procedure currently in use in the High Court dealing with a change of name by deed poll involves a formalised document being lodged and once lodged and acknowledged by the registrar, it becomes a document of record.  Is it something like this that the Minister has in mind in this application, or will there be more to it?  If the procedure is to be informal we should not be too worried about putting the onus on the father in going through the applications on an informal basis where there is consent, and allowing a third party then to have the right to review.  If on the other hand the procedure is to be somewhat more formal that may require recourse to legal advice and assistance.  Then, in <Col N="1452" /> the absence of legal aid, the balance would have to be in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter.  These are my two questions.  They relate first to the circumstances in which the consent would be sought from the mother and then to the ultimate procedures that would need to be gone into if one was to have recourse to the Act without the amendment in terms of registering a father's right to guardianship.  I would like these matters explored a bit more before ultimate decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>In the probate section of the High Court a person is appointed who works on behalf of the applicants.  A member of the public can get the full assistance of the person dealing with the applications in that area.  The applications are set out and the applicants are guided and advised on them.  It involves virtually no expense to the person coming in.  Will the Minister consider appointing such a person to the staff of the High Court to deal with the type of applications referred to as being as informal as is practicable but at the same time consistent with the administration of justice?  That might be an easy way of overcoming some of the difficulties that Deputies Shatter and Taylor had when they said they were concerned that in the absence of comprehensive legal aid, people would have to go through the costly process of having to go back to court to get agreements registered, which to all practicable purposes are a foregone conclusion, because of the consent existing between the parties.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is a very sensible amendment and I would be sorry if the Minister did not give it due regard on Report Stage.  I support Deputy Shatter in that amendment and I recommend to the Minister that he take on this whole question of ancillary orders before we pass this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;Section 5 of the Act of 1964 (inserted by the Courts Act, 1981) is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (2) of &ldquo;£60&rdquo; for &ldquo;£30&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 26 may be taken together as they are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are interrelated. Amendment No. 26 seeks to insert the following new section which states that &ldquo;section 23 of the Act of 1976 is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (2) (a) (inserted by the Courts Act, 1981) of `£60' per week for `£30' per week&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Let me briefly explain the reason for these amendments.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, in the context of District Court proceedings, currently allows the District Court to make a maintenance order for child support up to £30 per week.  The Guardianship of Infants Act proceedings up to now for child support payments would only have been brought between husband and wife and the maximum a wife could get in the District Court from her husband for the support of children was £30.  That has been the maximum since the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the mother brought identical proceedings in the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court has an unlimited financial jurisdiction and can order a far higher figure <Col N="1455" /> which is based solely on the income and earnings of the parties.  Similarly, under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the position is that a wife can bring maintenance proceedings against her husband in the District Court and get £30 a week by way of child support for each dependent child; she can get £100 per week for her own support.  Under the same Act, if a wife goes to the Circuit Court she can get a maintenance order for child support that is unlimited in amount and, again, the amount would ultimately depend on the financial circumstances of the husband and wife.  The Status of Children Bill seeks to extend to the mother of the child the right to seek a maintenance order for child support both under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  In doing so it effectively abolishes what is the Affiliation Orders Act, 1930.  That Act currently allows an unmarried mother to go to the District Court to get an affiliation order made against the father of her child for a sum up to £30 a week and the unmarried mother can go to the Circuit Court and look for a higher figure which is, again, unlimited in amount.</P>
    <P>The financial amounts that I am concerned about relate to the limitation currently imposed in the District Court's jurisdiction.  The District Court's jurisdiction has been changed.  In 1976 the jurisdiction conferred powers on the District Court to order sums up to £15 a week by way of child support.  In 1981 the Courts Act increased it to £30 a week. Since 1981 there has been substantial inflation to the extent that the sum of £30 a week, as enacted in 1981, would be the equivalent of a sum just under £60 a week currently.  What these amendments are designed to do, in the context of this Bill and of child support payments, is to increase the jurisdiction of the District Court to allow the court to order child support payments of up to £60 a week for the support of both an illegitimate child &mdash; as the child would formally be termed under the Affiliation Orders Act &mdash; and a <Col N="1456" /> legitimate child.  In other words, a parent seeking a maintenance order should be able to get up to £60 a week by way of child support whether they bring proceedings against a parent who is a spouse or against a parent who is not a spouse.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Minister could accept this amendment.  The current position is that the majority of affiliation proceedings are normally brought in the District Court.  Because the financial limitation on the District Court is now becoming somewhat outdated due to inflation some mothers are having to make a choice, either go to the District Court and get a lower order than the order to which they might be entitled, or go to the Circuit Court to get the higher order and, by bringing proceedings in the Circuit Court, incur far more legal expense than is necessary or should be warranted in a matter of this nature. What I am trying to do is bring the financial limits with regard to child support up to date, taking into account the approach adopted in 1976 and 1981 when it was acknowledged by this House that these limits on payments should be increased.</P>
    <P>This is a simple amendment.  It is designed to help unmarried mothers to secure the type of maintenance support order that will allow them to reasonably provide for children born outside marriage without forcing them to go to the Circuit Court.  I suspect that if we do not make this change today the current financial limits are likely to remain in this area for a number of years.  I hope this amendment will receive the support of all Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter said, this is a sensible amendment and one I hope the Minister will accede to for all of the reasons he has outlined.  Times have changed and the sum of £30 is now unrealistic.  The point has been made that it is the ceiling figure, the maximum for which an application can be made in the District Court, forcing many simple and straightforward applications into a higher jurisdiction with the attendant extra legal costs.  The Minister will be aware also of the very long lists of applications pending <Col N="1457" /> in the metropolitan area.  Many of these applications are unnecessarily in the higher court and are more suitable to be dealt with in the lower District Court which is much more widely available to litigants.  The Minister should be doing everything to ensure that the District Court jurisdiction is enhanced so that these applications can be kept within it. It is not outrageous to increase the ceiling figure from £30 to £60 a week in keeping with inflation.  I hope the Minister will take this one on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the main thrust of the amendment tabled by Deputy Shatter and I appreciate the support for it by Deputy McCartan.  These amendments would double the maximum amount which the District Court has jurisdiction to award by way of maintenance for a child under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>These amendments do not arise out of the need to remove discrimination in the law against children based on the marital status of their parents which is the purpose of the Bill we are debating this morning.  The appropriate way of providing for an increase in the jurisdiction limits of the courts in matters of maintenance would be a maintenance Bill or a courts Bill dealing with jurisdiction matters in general.  It would then be possible, as it would not be in this Bill, to consider also the maximum level of weekly maintenance which the District Court might award as between spouses. I would suggest that a practical test as to the appropriateness of an amendment to this Bill would be to ask oneself where would a practitioner be likely to search for a particular provision.  In the case of maintenance limits the answer surely is not in an Act dealing with the status of persons but in one dealing with maintenance or the jurisdiction of the courts.</P>

      <P>I most certainly do.  I was going to suggest to the Deputy he should understand that I am not necessarily objecting to what is the main thrust of the amendment but the Deputy, as a practitioner, should surely recognise this is the wrong place for it.  Also, the amendment only covers the children but not the spouse.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that if it did the amendment would be outside the scope of the Bill.  I am not opposing what the Deputy is saying.  In fact I would agree.  I am saying, and I am sure the Deputy will agree with me, that it is a matter for another day.  It is something we should turn our attention to some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To preserve one's sanity in this House one would have to have a sense of humour; if one did not, one would not survive very long.  In this Bill we are dealing not only with the status of children but repealing the entirety of the Ilegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930.  This is the measure which made provision for unmarried mothers seeking support payments from fathers to require the fathers to contribute towards the children's support.  That Bill, which was very modest in its aims, initially allowed an unmarried mother to get something like £2 a week.  This was increased to £15 in 1976 and £30 in 1981. The measure with which we are dealing today is providing, in effect, the new maintenance provisions for child support with regard to children born outside marriage. My amendment will allow child support payments made in the District Court to be increased to a maximum of up to £60 a week, which is not exactly a royal sum.  It is based on the approach adopted in previous legislation and takes into account inflation so nobody in this House can suggest that I am doing something new.  It would also benefit spouses and I have no excuse to make for that. Currently, a wife can get only £30 a week in child support in the District Court, which has been the position since 1981. If this measure succeeds, it will allow both unmarried mothers and wives to get up to £60 a week in the District Court for <Col N="1459" /> child support.  As the Minister correctly said, one cannot increase the £100 a week that a wife can get currently, but it would provide the District Court with more leeway and flexibility in maintenance cases and, in the context of maintenance cases brought by a parent of a child born outside marriage and by a spouse with regard to children born within marriage, that would allow the parent to seek a sum of maintenance that bears some realistic relationship to modern costs of minding a family and also bears a relationship to the income of the person against whom the maintenance order is sought.  I do not believe that the Minister is really serious in what he is saying.  As we see so often in this House &mdash; and in fairness my party are the sinners in this as much as the Government party &mdash; the Minister seems to have the endemic view that one should never accept any amendment put forward by somebody on the Opposition benches. He is advancing the most tenuous of reasons for opposing this amendment, suggesting that it is not appropriate.  It is an appropriate amendment which will benefit children &mdash; that is what this Bill is about &mdash; and will benefit unmarried mothers and, incidentally, wives.  It will also do something which the Minister should be anxious to do.  Not only will it ensure that the many unmarried mothers who may currently feel they must go to the Circuit Court will be able to have matters dealt with in the District Court but it will also reduce the number of family maintenance cases going into the Circuit Court when marriages break down.  As a result of this, wives may be able to get a more adequate maintenance order than was the case up to now.  There will be the added assistance to the Minister and his Department of the reduction in some of the legal costs incurred when people have to go to the Circuit Court to get maintenance orders and are represented by the law centres.  Some may now be able to do this in the District Court.  This is a relatively simple provision, basically saying that in the case of an unmarried mother or of a wife wanting a child support order from the District <Col N="1460" /> Court, the maximum jurisdiction of that court, which originally in 1976 was £15, increased to £30 in 1981, would now in 1987, going into 1988, become £60.  That is in the interests of the children concerned, of the unmarried mothers and wives so if the Minister is unwilling to accept this amendment, I shall put it to a vote.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I am not objecting to the thrust of this amendment. In his last contribution the Deputy has made some very sound arguments.  I am not contesting the case he is making. However, as I have already said, this is the wrong Bill entirely and the wrong place.  As a practitioner he should know that more than anybody else.  I would refer the Deputy to the Bill about which we are now talking.  The very first two lines state &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to equalise the rights of children and amend the law relating to their status ...&rdquo; That is what we are talking about here and nothing else.  A case has been made by Deputy Shatter which I would readily accept if we were discussing a maintenance Bill or a courts Bill here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is forgetting to tell the House when referring to the long Title of the Bill is that it is a Bill to amend the law relating to the guardianship of infants, to amend and extend the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 and to amend further the law relating to maintenance, which is in the long Title.  The Minister is offering a most spurious argument on what should be a totally uncontentious issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter, as I intended to do, referred a little beyond the first two lines of the long Title to the many other features which are to be considered, including maintenance.  The next part of the Bill which we will be discussing and which has a great many sections, to one of which amendment 26 relates deals with maintenance.  The Minister cannot seriously argue that this is the wrong place to be discussing this item. It is not.  I would even say that as a <Col N="1461" /> practitioner and despite his having tried to entreat Deputy Shatter to abandon his good sense and return to his practitioner's hat for a moment.</P>
      <P>I have never known the accusation of being in the wrong place to be levelled at sensible legislation, publicly or elsewhere, either in the law courts or in the Dáil.  If it is doing the right thing, it will be welcome.  Certainly, a proposal to increase the ceiling from £30 to £60 and in that way to aid the courts and the applicants who want to go to the most available, amenable, least costly and cumbersome court, the District Court, should be facilitated.  The Minister has said he agrees with the whole idea, that his only reservation is that it might not be the right place to talk about it.  I ask him to review that opinion.  He might avoid this present tangle if he could give some indication as to when, for example, a courts Bill or a jurisdictions Bill would be before the House to deal with this and the many other outdated ceiling figures fixed within the jurisdiction of the District Court, particularly in the area of family law.  If he gave some indication that he had something in mind that would mirror what Deputy Shatter is trying to do, perhaps we could retreat quietly to our corners.  Otherwise, I am in support of Deputy Shatter.</P>

      <P>We had legislation in 1971, 1976 and 1981.  It is very likely that we will have a further Bill within, say, a matter of 12 to 18 months.  I am not objecting to what Deputy Shatter wants. His arguments are good, they would impress me and are arguments that I would accept if we were discussing a different Bill.  Deputy McCartan referred, as did Deputy Shatter, to the <Col N="1462" /> Title of the Bill.  Let me read it out again, because they are missing out something important.</P>

      <P>The entire Part IV of this Bill is headed &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo;.  Following this discussion we will go on to deal with elaborate criteria which the Minister says the court should take into account in determining maintenance applications made by unmarried mothers.  This Bill deals with the amounts the court can order and as somebody who is a practitioner in the area of family law, I can tell the Minister that most such practitioners look to family law legislation to find out the jurisdiction of the courts in family law matters.  They do not go looking at courts Bills.  In my naiveté I thought this amendment would get support across party lines, including the Minister. I hope all Deputies will support the view that 18 months is a very long time for an unmarried mother trying to get adequate support payments.  My proposal would not cost the State anything; it might save it money.  I am putting the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 37, to delete &ldquo;section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sections&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The second amendment seeks to insert a new section 5B in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.</P>
      <P>The section would read:</P>
      <P>A court may when making a maintenance order pursuant to section 5 or 5A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act for the support of a dependent child provide that the sum ordered to be paid by it be backdated to the date when the maintenance application was issued but no earlier where it is deemed appropriate that such order be made having regard to all the circumstances of the case and may in so doing order that any arrears of maintenance it accordingly deems to have accumulated be paid by the maintenance debtor by way of a lump sum by a specified date and may in ordering the payment of such lump sum give credit to the maintenance debtor for any relevant moneys paid by him to the maintenance creditor in the period between the date when the maintenance application was issued and the making of a maintenance order and any lump sum so ordered to be paid shall be deemed, for the purposes of section 9 and Part III of this Act to be a maintenance order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal with this amendment in a non-legalistic way and explain its intent and why I believe it is desirable.  Currently if maintenance proceedings or affiliation proceedings are brought by an unmarried mother and the court decides that a maintenance or support payment order should be made, the court under the existing legislation and under this Bill as phrased can make a support payment order to apply only on and from the date of the court hearing.  Therefore, if an unmarried mother issues court proceedings and six weeks or six months later her case is finally heard, the support payment that the court can order will apply only from the date of the hearing of the case.  It is quite usual that when affiliation proceedings are brought there <Col N="1467" /> is in the region of at least a three months' gap between the time proceedings are issued and when the proceedings are heard by the court.  The case may not be heard on the day it is originally scheduled to be heard by a court.  It may be that the court has too many cases on the court list.  The case may not be reached and it can be put back for a number of weeks. Also on occasions, particularly in the context of proceedings brought by an unmarried mother, the person alleged to be the father of the child may engage in a variety of delaying manoeuvres to put off the date when the court proceedings will be heard.  For example, a summons may be served on the father for a court hearing that is to take place in approximately eight weeks' time and the father may not communicate at all with the mother.  On the day of the court hearing the lawyers acting for the father might suggest that the father is going to dispute paternity, and to ensure that there is not a row over that, might propose that blood tests or tissue tests be carried out.  Everybody may agree to that and the case might be adjourned for a further two or three months while the necessary tests are carried out and the results obtained.  Ultimately the case may come to the court and the person alleged to be the father may be so held to be and may be required to make payments.  As things stand at the moment there is a distinct financial advantage for a father in such circumstances to seek to delay the court hearing.  By delaying the court hearing you are delaying the time from which you must start making payments.</P>
    <P>In most other European countries and under English legislation in the context of maintenance orders there is a provision which allows the courts to backdate a maintenance order to the date when the court proceedings were issued.  In other words, if a court is asked to hear an application for maintenance support from an unmarried mother and the mother has issued her proceedings in July and they come up for hearing in November, the court can decide that the father should pay, say, £30 a week by way of <Col N="1468" /> child support from the date of the court hearing.  In the context of this amendment the court will also be entitled to say that the sum of £30 a week is backdated to the date when the mother issued the summons.  This amendment seeks to ensure that mothers do not lose out by fathers engaging in delaying tactics.</P>
    <P>It is done also to confer a discretion on the court.  For example, when the court makes an affiliation order under current law and what will be a maintenance order under this Bill, there may be circumstances where such an order is made but where the father, in the intervening period, has been making some support payments to the mother.  This amendment allows the order to be backdated if necessary to the date of the order.  It allows the court to give the father credit for the payments he has made.  In doing so it makes the provision that if the court calculates that there is a sum of arrears of payment to be made between the time of the court hearing and the date of court proceedings being issued the arrears can be ordered as a lump sum payment.  For instance, if proceedings were heard some four weeks after the summons was issued, which would be extremely quickly, and if the order was for £30 a week, the court could say that from that stage the father must pay £30 a week.  Four weeks would have passed since the court summons was issued and that would mean that arrears of £120 had accumulated.  Those arrears of £120 must be paid in a lump sum by a particular date.  If during that period the father had paid, for instance, £30 to the mother as a contribution the court might credit him for that.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to give greater protection to unmarried mothers and their children, to give the court a discretion with regard to making payments &mdash; a discretion which courts in other countries have &mdash; and to backdate them to the date when the summons was issued rather than to date them only from the date when the court hears the case. It is a discretionary matter and will depend on the overall financial circumstances. This would apply in the context of this amendment to support <Col N="1469" /> payment orders sought both by spouses for dependent children and by unmarried mothers for dependent children.  I urge that the Minister accept this amendment, but having regard to the approach adopted by him on the previous amendment I suppose there is no chance of his doing so.  Nevertheless, this amendment is designed to provide additional protection for unmarried mothers and to ensure that where it is decided by a court that there is a duty to make support payments for the children those support payments can be taken to apply from the date when proceedings were issued.  While it is appropriate that such order be made, it does not oblige the court to do that.  It gives the court a discretion to do it.  It would provide welcome relief to many unmarried mothers to know that between the time when they bring their court proceedings and the case is heard they are not forfeiting those weeks with regard to any support they might get for their children.</P>
    <P>The same position applies with regard to spouses where a wife seeks a maintenance order when her husband is paying her nothing at all and she has to wait six, eight or ten weeks for her case to get into court.  It is reasonable that the courts should have a discretion to make an order to require the husband to make up payment to the wife of some of the moneys she would otherwise have received if the court had been able to hear the case earlier.  Often the delay is the fault of neither the father nor the mother.  It is the fault of a court system that is clogged up, overworked and unable to cope with the numbers of family law applications coming before it.  I urge that this amendment be supported and I hope it will have the support of other Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The substantive amendment here is amendment No. 18.  This proposes to insert a new section into the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, providing for the backdating of maintenance orders in relation to dependent children to the date of application.  This is a matter of general <Col N="1470" /> maintenance law and has no bearing on the equalisation of the rights of children or on the amendment of the law relating to the status of children.</P>
      <P>The amendment is in substitution for one which was ruled out of order.  I understand that this was because it would have covered maintenance orders not only for dependent children but also for dependent spouses, something clearly out of place in a Status of Children Bill.  By retabling the amendment with a clause limiting its application to dependent children, Deputy Shatter has succeeded in making it technically in order, but that does not alter the fact that the substance of the amendment is appropriate to the general maintenance Bill, which this Bill clearly is not.</P>
      <P>Whatever the merits of the notion of backdating maintenance payments &mdash; I do not propose to enter into debate on them &mdash; it does not seem to make very much sense that it should apply to maintenance orders for children only, and should be precluded from applying to orders where a dependent spouse is covered.  I have no doubt that, if this proposal were enacted by way of Government amendment, it would be criticised in textbooks on family law as being anomalous and piecemeal.  Maybe the Deputy will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say yet again that this is an amendment of very practical import.  It is based on the very real world that exists particularly in the metropolitan family law courts where a lapse of time from the initiation of proceedings to an ultimate determination can often run for weeks and months and on occasion when given appeal to the higher courts it can take years before an ultimate decision is taken and an order fixed.  It would seem to be very desirable that in the interim period a successful applicant at the end of the day has some recourse to recover the moneys that would have lain in abeyance through the weeks and months that the proceedings were before the courts.  A mother should not be punished for the intricacies and tortuous routes of our court proceedings <Col N="1471" /> and should not be punished for the very long lists of cases that exist.  It is not so much the mother we are speaking about but the infant child and this is what the amendment seeks to address.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's suggestion that we are out of place.  When you are doing the right thing, no one will trip you up and say: &ldquo;This is not the appropriate legislation; it should be slotted in under the heading of another Act.&rdquo; I do not accept that argument.  This amendment deals with maintenance which is a very practical instance that arises on a daily basis in our courts.  For that reason I think the amendments should be supported.</P>
      <P>However, I could not let the opportunity pass without saying that the previous vote shows an agreement to help the Government between parties other than The Workers' Party who commented on earlier Stages.  I was disappointed that more members of Deputy Shatter's party were not here to support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment comes reasonably within the ambit of this Bill. Those of us who practise law know that these delays can adversely affect needy litigants and in simple terms this is what the amendment is designed to deal with. The Minister said it would be an anomaly if it was confined to the children covered by this Bill.  That may be so and it would be a matter for the Minister to ensure that any further commensurate or co-equivalent amendments would also be made to cover spouses or other situations that would arise.  The House is faced with the anomaly that a court is confined to giving maintenance for the child as from the date of the court order.  That is an anomaly because the child and the problem were there as much before the hearing of the court application as they were after it.  It behoves both the Minister and the House to address that anomaly and deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister was not more receptive to many of the amendments which are not political <Col N="1472" /> issues.  They ought not to be controversial issues and the House and the political parties ought not to be dividing on them. They are not of that nature.  They attempt in a small way to help people who have to avail of this legislation.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments in that light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first outstanding feature of the debate on this Bill in the Seanad was the high level of debate and the consistency in attempting to bring about the very best legislation in this area.  The second outstanding feature of the debate was the willingness of the then Minister to listen, accept and recognise that no one side of the House has all the wisdom.  I appeal to the Minister to make the Committee Stage of the Bill in this House as serious and constructive as it was in the Seanad by taking on board amendments which have been put down by people who have experience and expertise in family law and who know what the court systems are like.  They also know the reality of what women's lives are like where it can be a matter of grim reality and poverty to be delayed through the court system to the extent that they are.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment seriously and to see that it would strengthen this Bill.  Not alone would the amendment cover situations where a woman can be faced with delays that are none of her fault but which she has to bear.  Deputy Shatter has also included in his amendment the words &ldquo;any lump sum so ordered&rdquo;.  After the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, Cherish made the point that there would be many occasions when the availability of a lump sum would represent a more feasible and preferable means of obtaining maintenance for a single woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I ask the Minister to consider both of the points raised by Deputy Shatter and supported by other Members of the House. All of us want the greatest protection, recognition and acknowledgment of <Col N="1473" /> mothers and children and this amendment goes a long way towards ensuring that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask Deputies to understand that the Status of Children Bill is aimed at removing discrimination and the amendments we are discussing raise matters of general maintenance law.  Deputies must understand that a line has to be drawn.  Otherwise there would be no end to this Bill which covers several major areas of law, for example, guardianship, maintenance and succession matters.  I can only reiterate that this is not the Bill for proposals of this kind.</P>
      <P>The anomaly to which I referred is that if an application was made for dependent children alone, the proposal in the amendment would apply.  If, however, the application was for dependent children and a spouse, the proposal would not apply.  This anomaly serves to illustrate the inappropriateness of trying to do something in this Bill which does not belong to it.  This is not to deny the persuasiveness of the arguments in favour of the substance of the amendments.  I appreciate, as was said by Deputy Taylor, that these are not political or controversial issues but I hope that, in turn, the Deputy will appreciate the situation as I have outlined it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in this House is that Deputies are constantly urged by people outside this House to take legislating as a serious occupation. It is very difficult to take legislating, or the Committee Stage of a Bill, as a serious occupation when faced with the approach the Minister is adopting to the amendments tabled to this Bill.  In reality, this amendment, together with the previous amendment which the Minister's party sought to vote against, would improve the position of children and improve the protections afforded to women, which are uniquely within the competence of the Bill.  The Minister says that if the maintenance order was sought by a wife, she could not get a lump sum or a back payment for her support but <Col N="1474" /> only for the support of her children. When we come to deal with maintenance legislation relating to spouses a similar provision should apply to wives.</P>
      <P>If you asked a wife who was not being supported by her husband and who had to go to court for maintenance if she had the possibility of getting no back payment ordered at all for the period between the commencement of the proceedings and when they were heard, or if she had the possibility of at least getting a back payment to cover the sum the court allocates to her by way of child support which would she prefer, she would say she would like to get some of the money that the court orders to be backdated for child support.  If you asked an unmarried mother which would she prefer, a maintenance order which starts at the date when the court hearing takes place or a maintenance order which can be backdated to the time the proceedings commenced, giving her an entitlement to a lump sum payment for the intervening period, she would wish to get the lump sum payment.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to deal with an aspect of maintenance law that relates to children generally.  If I had tabled an amendment with regard to children born outside marriage, the Minister would have criticised me for introducing discrimination in a Bill that seeks to deal with the equality of children.  Because I am extending the provisions to apply to children born inside marriage the Minister says I am dealing with a measure that can only be dealt with by way of spousal maintenance.  If children are to be placed in a position of equality we have to deal with both situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not accept the previous amendment and I am astonished that he will not accept this amendment.  We are talking about enacting legislation that would cost the State nothing but would merely provide a more efficient and sensible legal mechanism to afford protection for children and mothers.  That is the stuff of many speeches delivered by Members outside this House.  It is a favourite topic of the day.  We are all in favour of providing <Col N="1475" /> protection for mothers and children and the measures in this Bill try to increase that protection.</P>
    <P>I find it incomprehensible that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  The objections he raises to it are spurious.  He suggests that because we can only do part of the job today, we should do none of it.  I would prefer to do part of it and, in the context of children born outside marriage, this is all the job we can do. The continuous harping that this legislation does not deal with maintenance is little short of fanciful.  We just nodded through an entire section running to a page and a half that deals solely with maintenance and the criteria the courts are to apply in determining maintenance applications.  As the Minister clearly will not accept this section I will put the amendment to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have to accept that this Bill is not about improving the position of spouses, although no one will deny that improving their position is a <Col N="1476" /> good thing.  This Bill is about equalising the rights of children.  If we were to start making changes in the substantive law in the various areas the Bill covers there would be no end to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Later on the Minister will be asking this House to accept an amendment relating to succession law which will change the succession law and does not just equalise the position of children but brings in new provisions.  There are new provisions of law throughout this Bill. There is no logic in the Minister's argument beyond the usual logic &mdash; which I think means that this House is taken less seriously by the people and deservedly so &mdash; that a Government Minister never dares to accept an amendment tabled by a Member of the Opposition.  I formally put the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 17 is in the name of Deputy Shatter. Amendment No. 20 is related, and <Col N="1479" /> amendment No. 19 is consequential on amendment No. 20.  I suggest, therefore, that we take amendments No. 17, 19 and 20 together, by agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Court shall not make a maintenance order under subsection (1) or (2) where an order has been made approving an agreement concluded between a mother and father under section 8B of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19, proposes that in page 13, line 28, the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; be deleted and substituted by the word &ldquo;sections&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 20 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 14, after line 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8B (i) Where the parents of a dependent child who are not married to each other enter into an agreement by which provision is made for the payment of a capital sum by the father of the child to the mother of the child as a contribution towards the future maintenance and education of the child and/or by which any interest in any property or properties is conveyed to or for the beneficial use of such child and such agreement is stated to be in full and final settlement of the father's obligation to make maintenance support payments in respect of such child, such agreement may be approved by the Circuit Court or High Court upon application for approval being made to it if the court is satisfied that</P>
      <P>(a)  the agreement is fair and reasonable;</P>
      <P>(b)  the agreement is in the best interests of the child having regard to the circumstances of the child and the circumstances of the mother and the father;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> (c)  that the mother has entered freely into such agreement with a full knowledge of its consequences having obtained appropriate professional advice in circumstances in which the mother possessed the capacity to make a fully informed decision.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where an order under this section is made approving an agreement, such agreement shall be made a rule of court and the order of approval shall bar the making of an application for a maintenance order for the support of the child under section 5A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Where a court declines to make an order under this section approving an agreement stated to be in full and final settlement of the father's obligations to make maintenance support payments, either party to such agreement may within 21 days of such decision (hereinafter referred to as the specified period) serve a notice on the other, (hereinafter referred to as a Notice of Recission) rescinding the said agreement and following the service of such notice neither party shall remain bound by any provisions contained in such agreement provided that neither party shall be entitled to reclaim any moneys already paid or any property already transferred pursuant to its provisions.</P>
    <P>(iv)  If no Notice of Recission is served within the specified period an agreement for which approval was declined as referred to in subsection (iii) herein shall remain valid and enforcable as between the parties to it but shall not act as a bar to the making of a maintenance application under section 5A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act and after the expiration of the specified period application may be made under section 8A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act by either party to such agreement for an order making the agreement a rule of court under the aforesaid section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> Perhaps I might explain what this is about in non-legalistic terminology.  Under the Legitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, it is possible for an unmarried mother to enter into an agreement with the father of her child whereby a lump sum payment is made for the child, and the future support of the child.  An application can be made to the District Court to approve of the agreement which has been concluded as a once and for all settlement for all financial claims which can be made on behalf of the child.  If approval is obtained, that prevents the mother at a future date seeking an affiliation order.</P>
    <P>The legislation we are dealing with here is essentially replacing the Affiliation Orders Act, 1930.  It is providing a mechanism whereby unmarried mothers can, through court proceedings, obtain a maintenance order which, in this Bill, is another name for an affiliation order. This is an order which can be obtained against the father to require him to make weekly or monthly payments to the mother towards the child's support.  Such payments can be made for child support until the child reaches 16 years of age or, if still involved in full-time education, until the child reaches 21 years of age. Under the Guardianship of Infants Act even if the child has ceased in education and is still dependent, the mother can get maintenance support payments up to the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted the mother will be able to seek a maintenance support payment against the father to contribute towards the child's support until the child is 21 years of age.  In the majority of instances mothers seeking support payments through the courts would look for such an order but circumstances do arise, in practice, where a child is born outside marriage, the father acknowledges he is the father of that child, or there have been court proceedings and a maintenance order is made against the father and subsequently the mother and father want to conclude a once-off financial arrangement.  The mother does not wish to be tied to obtaining weekly or monthly payments from the father for 15, 16 or 17 <Col N="1482" /> years.  Indeed she could be worried that the father might at some stage leave this jurisdiction and not comply with such order for that length of time.  The father might acknowledge that he is the father of the child but he might have sufficient financial resources to wish to make a once-off payment to the mother to provide for the future well-being of the child. He may be in a position to make many thousands of pounds available or to transfer a property, such as a family home, to the mother.</P>
    <P>In practice, over the years, I am aware of a number of cases where this has happened &mdash; mothers have required support from a father for a child.  They have said they do not want to have an ongoing relationship with the child's father for 15 or 20 years getting support payments but would like a capital sum of money to invest for the benefit of the child or to be used to acquire a home.  Indeed, I am aware of fathers who accept that they are the father of the child and are willing to make a full capital payment of some description rather than pay money every year.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Bill is that the mother who wants a once-off payment, who sees such a payment to be in the child's and her interest, will not be able to obtain one.  The reason is that a father who makes such a payment will not be able to obtain any legal assurance, even if he makes a very large payment or transfers a house worth £30,000 or £40,000 to be held in trust for the child, that the mother may not within a year look for maintenance support payments from him.  The only circumstance in which fathers would make those payments would be if they had the security of knowing that the large payment they had made, or the property they had transferred, left them no longer liable to maintenance applications.  Mothers will very often wish to obtain such payments where this is possible but the Bill prevents that happening.</P>
    <P>It is important if mothers enter into agreements whereby they get a lump sum <Col N="1483" /> or property that they voluntarily participate in those agreements.  It is important that the interests of the child are fully protected, that there is an assurance that a mother does not enter into an agreement for a small sum of money which prevents her at some future date getting the support payments that are necessary for the child.  The amendments before the House are designed to deal with those problems and to create a mechanism whereby the mother and father of a child born outside marriage can enter into a once-off arrangement under which a large sum of money, property or properties can be transferred to the mother for the benefit of the child. The amendments propose that such agreement will have the effect of barring the mother from seeking support payments at a future date.  Such an agreement could give a mother more financial security than she can ever have as a result of a court ordering periodic maintenance payments.  They provide that for such an agreement to bar the bringing of court proceedings it is essential that mothers are not pressurised into concluding agreements that are against their interests or the child's interests and that they do not cut themselves off from court proceedings when such proceedings may be desirable in the interests of their child.</P>
    <P>The amendments propose that it should be possible to enter into such agreements but for them to be a bar to court proceedings they must be submitted either to the Circuit Court or the High Court for approval.  They also provide that such approval should not be forthcoming unless the court is satisfied that the agreement being entered into is fair and reasonable, that the best interests of the child are fully protected and that the mother is a free and voluntary participant in entering into such an agreement.  They are designed to enable such agreements to come into being and such settlements to be concluded.</P>
    <P>An obvious example of a circumstance in which a mother might want to conclude such an agreement is the mother who gives birth to a child outside marriage <Col N="1484" /> and some three or four years later marries someone who is not the father of her child.  She may feel that rather than receive maintenance payments on a periodic basis for the next ten or 15 years, a situation that could create a great deal of tension and difficulty in the context of a marriage, it would be better to obtain a lump sum.  The amendments would enable that type of sensible arrangement to be concluded.  My view is that if it is in the interests of a child it should be possible to enter into such an agreement.</P>
    <P>The amendments are carefully drafted to deal with a number of possible consequences. For example, what happens if the agreement is concluded and the court does not approve of it?  Under these provisions a court may decide that the agreement was not bad but that the funds provided are insufficient or for some reason the agreement was not in the best interests of the child for the mother for all time to be barred or prevented from bringing a maintenance application.  The amendment provides that such an agreement will have legal effect as a valid agreement when signed and approved by the court.  If that approval is forthcoming that is the end of the matter, the agreement must be implemented and the bar on bringing proceedings in the future operates.  If it is not approved by the court the couple may decide that, nevertheless, they want to implement its provisions. Financially they may see it as a sensible arrangement.  The amendment provides that in those circumstances the agreement can be made a rule of court, not for approval as barring proceedings but a rule of court under the mechanisms currently available to ensure that any payments that would apply under it are enforceable in the normal way.  If the couple do not want to abide by its terms, then within 21 days of a court refusing to approve the agreement as a bar to court proceedings either the mother or the father may serve notice on the other party rescinding the agreement and bringing it to an end.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to cover a number of possible eventualities and to extend to couples the facility currently <Col N="1485" /> available to them under the affiliation orders Act.  I have no doubt that there are a number of unmarried mothers who would wish to have the opportunity of getting a lump sum payment as opposed to having to get weekly or monthly payments for many years.  There are many who would wish, if the father of their child is in a financial position to do so, to have the possibility of negotiating that, perhaps, a home be provided for them and their child instead of having to depend on weekly payments and live in rented accommodation.  I make those statements as one who has worked in the area of family law for about 15 years. What I am suggesting is not hypothetical or designed for the purpose of debate in the House but to deal with a problem that arises.  It should be said that the maintenance orders Act of 1976 has cast some doubt on the effectiveness of a court approving an agreement concluded under the 1930 Act preventing future proceedings.  Nevertheless, some agreements have been concluded since then.</P>
    <P>My amendments are designed to provide additional protection for children, to ensure that the maintenance provisions in the Bill as drafted provide the most appropriate mechanisms possible to assist children and mothers of children born outside marriage.  They are designed to ensure that where a mother has the possibility of getting some degree of financial security for the future in the context of funding for her child will have the opportunity of getting greater and certain security which a court order cannot offer. The legislation we are enacting will not act as an impediment to her obtaining such security.</P>
    <P>I hope, though everything that has happened this morning would indicate it might be a vain hope, that the amendments will be accepted by the Minister.  I have no doubt that the Minister's officials have given him many reasons why he should not accept them but I ask the Minister to accept that the amendments have been drafted in the light of knowledge of a practical nature of the real problems that confront unmarried <Col N="1486" /> mothers and children when they seek support payments.  They are designed to deal with an eventuality that is not provided for in the Bill and to remove an impediment that the Bill seeks to copperfasten by rendering it virtually impossible for mothers and fathers to conclude agreements which can for the future be regarded as a once-off agreement fully and finally dealing with financing support payments required for a child born outside marriage.</P>

      <P>I also support Deputy Shatter's amendment as it contains the safeguards we would be looking for to the extent that the mother of a child would not be exploited in any way, that she would have professional advice and the choice to make a decision which at that time in her life could have tremendous implications in regard to the security of herself and her child.  Deputy Shatter referred to two situations where this would be highly desirable, the provision, for instance, through that lump sum of a family home where ordinary maintenance payments might never allow the mother and her child a home other than rented accommodation.  We can also all readily recognise the other situation where the marriage to another partner takes place and where unnecessary friction or tension might be avoided by such an agreement.</P>
      <P>There is a third situation which springs to mind and which will ensure the greater economic independence of a mother and child by an agreement to such a payment with the full safeguards.  It would perhaps give an opportunity to the mother for further training or enlargement of a career which she would never normally, under a small maintenance agreement, be able to exercise.  By getting a lump sum, she might be able to develop a career which would mean that she and her child would have much more independence and security.  With the safeguards contained in Deputy Shatter's amendment, the Minister should look favourable on it.</P>

      <P>In supporting this <Col N="1487" /> amendment I borrow the arguments the Minister used against the previous two. This is certainly the place in which we should be discussing this proposal as it is very practical and good.  I should like also to remind him of the first two lines of the long title of the Bill where we are trying to equalise the position in regard to children born outside marriage so that they will have the same rights as children born inside marriage.  Children within marriage have available to them, or to the parties to any proceedings in maintenance or otherwise in winding up a marriage, the opportunity of getting a lump sum.  I cannot understand why the same is not made available, as an option, for the settlement of maintenance in relation to a child born outside marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The substantive amendment in this group is amendment No. 20 which, in effect, proposes a replacement provision for the provisions in the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, which enable a father to buy out his continuing obligations to make periodical payments towards the maintenance of his child by means of a lump sum payment. The amendment has clearly been carefully prepared by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands does not contain any provision for lump sum maintenance payments; the provision in the 1930 Act will lapse with the repeal of that Act by section 25 of the Bill.  The thinking behind this is that there is no similar provision in existing legislation whereby a spouse can divest himself or herself of the continuing obligation to maintain a dependent child of the family by the payment of a lump sum; to replace those provisions of the 1930 Act, whether it be on the lines proposed in these amendments or by adopting some other approach, would give rise to an anomalous situation between dependent children of the family on the one hand and dependent children of parents who have not married each other on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leaves two alternative possibilities: either have no provision at all, as in the Bill as it stands, or else to have <Col N="1488" /> some system whereby all parents, whether spouses or not, could discharge their maintenance obligations by one-off payments, which raises serious issues of principle, particularly in relation to married parents.  That is not to say that the broader approach cannot be considered: it might well be that some such approach to settling maintenance problems, particularly in the context of judicial separation, could prove fruitful.</P>
    <P>However, this involves general issues beyond the scope of this Bill.  In these circumstances, I am opposing the amendments. I would point also to the anomalies in amendment No. 20 which contemplates such matters as property settlements by the father on the mother, but not by the mother on the father, who might be the parent obliged to care for the child.  I am of the view that the subject matter of these amendments is more appropriate for consideration in the context of maintenance law in general rather than a Bill dealing with the status of children.</P>
    <P>Under present law, it is open to spouses to agree between themselves that one should pay to the other a lump sum which may be understood by both parties to be a substitute for periodical maintenance payments, whether for spouses or children or both.  This can be made a rule of court under section 8 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  But such an agreement cannot rule out the possibility that, if circumstances change, either spouse can apply for a maintenance order against the other.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of this Bill is to enable an exactly similar type of agreement to be made between the parents of a child who are not married to each other for the maintenance of the child.  It can be made a rule of court in the same way under the proposed section 8A of the 1976 Act, being inserted by section 20. Likewise, if circumstances change, it will be possible for either parent to apply to court for a maintenance order.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is scope for further <Col N="1489" /> argument as to the principle of the ordering of lump sum payments in lieu of maintenance in the context of the maintenance obligations of married couples.  I would suggest, however, that that question would be appropriate to a Bill dealing with the general maintenance code and not to this Bill which is essentially concerned with assimilating the legal rights of persons born outside marriage to that of persons born within marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be saying he agrees that this is a power currently existing in the 1930 Act that mothers still avail of but because it does not apply to married couples we should deprive unmarried mothers of this provision. I understood we were dealing with a Bill which was not only trying to equalise the position of children born outside wedlock but trying to improve that position and seeking to ensure that some degree of financial security was provided for them.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a number of different matters relating to maintenance.  The Minister previously indicated that this Bill is not about the amounts of maintenance but section 21 is about allowing various orders of a financial nature to be made in respect of expenses incurred ancillary to the birth of children, etc.  I agree that there is a need to look at the whole area in regard to spouses and the possibility of lump sum agreements being concluded because circumstances arise between husbands and wives when marriages break down where the husband wants to make a large lump sum payment to the wife and where the wife wants to receive it so that she will have, as Deputy Barnes correctly described, some degree of economic independence.  However, those agreements cannot currently be concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not accept my amendment, this Bill, by repealing the provisions of the 1930 Act, is putting unmarried mothers and children in a worse position in some respects than they are in under current law.  The Minister is depriving unmarried mothers and children of the possibility of a degree of <Col N="1490" /> security which they have under current law.  The 1930 Act has been with us for 57 years and during that time mothers have been able to enter into these kinds of arrangements even though spouses have not been able to do so since 1976.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in this House on 7 April of this year, the achievement of equal status and equal opportunities for women are matters which arise across the whole range of policy making.  Responsibility for different aspects of women's affairs is, therefore, best realised by individual Ministers being responsible within their own policy areas for making progress on women's opportunities and status.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with that reply from the Taoiseach.  If what he has said about individual Ministers being responsible for various programmes means the abolition of programmes, as has happened in the case of the women in business programme which the Minister for Industry abolished when he went to launch one of the successes of that programme, how can the Taoiseach accept what he has said as being positive given that the allocation to the Council for the Status of Women has been cut by £50,000 or 36 per cent, which, I assume, <Col N="1491" /> means that the Government want to wind up that body?  If the Taoiseach has other plans for that body perhaps he will so inform the House.  The allocation to the Employment Equality Agency has been reduced by £37,000, a cut of 11 per cent, and the anti-poverty programme in the Department of Social Welfare has been cut by £300,000, a 23 per cent cut.  How can the Taoiseach come into the House and inform us that each Minister is responsible for initiating programmes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question of the allocations to different bodies, the former Tánaiste would have to acknowledge that the Government have sought to be impartial and objective and have made reductions right across the board. They have endeavoured not to let the burden fall too heavily on any one area or to show any favouritism in any area. There is room for honest disagreement on the question of how best to handle the whole question of women's affairs and to advance the status of and opportunities for women.  This is my idea of how it should be done, with each individual Minister having a special responsibility for these matters.  I have always been of the opinion that the most important issue so far as the status of women is concerned is women's rights.  I am sure some Deputies have heard me say from time to time that the effort should be to achieve perfect equality, particularly before the law and indeed in all adminimstrative areas. In that respect I was very encouraged by the activities of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights who were established in the last Dáil and who did excellent work. <Col N="1492" /> I look forward very much to that committee being the main emphasis of our activities in this area.</P>

The Taoiseach has said that there is a lot to be done to achieve equality and on the basis that something needs to be achieved &mdash; while I respect his view that a committee of this House may be a vehicle for achieving it &mdash; surely knowing how Government works, he will admit that a Minister is needed in this area if any action is to be achieved.  He has admitted to the House that equality has not yet been achieved and surely a Ministry for Women's Affairs would be the correct vehicle for achieving that.</P>

I am totally committed to the idea of the successful operation of the Council for the Status of Women but unfortunately at present all agencies, bodies and Departments have to take substantial cutbacks in their allocations.

Because of the economic climate and the cutbacks in other organisations under the aegis of the Council for the Status of Women it is now more important than ever that resources be made available to the council to enable some of those organisations to continue in existence?</P>

      <P>In introducing the Second Stage of the Irish Film Board Bill on 15 October 1980 the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism stated explicitly that investments by the Irish <Col N="1494" /> Film Board should be made by reference to commercial criteria and that the Irish film sector would sooner or later have to finance its activities entirely from its own resources rather than from State support. He suggested in that context that it would be appropriate to review the progress of the board after three or four years. Between 1981 and end 1986, the Irish Film Board advanced £1,842,118 by way of loans to film makers.  Repayments to the board on foot of loans over the period 1981 to end 1986 have amounted to only £54,383.  It is clear, therefore, that the board did not succeed in developing the industry on a commercial basis.  It is for that reason that the Government decided to wind down the affairs of the board and adopt the alternative strategy to develop an indigenous film industry as outlined by me in response to Question No. 47 on Wednesday, 14 October 1987.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree, from his vast experience of the Irish film industry and other industries, that this industry is not alone in not meeting its potential by way of returning to the Exchequer the investment that was made in it?  If that is so and in the light of what he has said, that would not be enough to justify the winding down of the Irish Film Board, as he has so done in recent months.  Does he not think that there is a future for the Irish film industry in this country and that its potential in future will not be met in the manner in which he outlined by way of response to a question that was put down last week by Deputy Michael Higgins.  Would the Minister not agree that, in line with the emerging philosophy of the present Government, one single State board entrusted with the development of any industry, especially the film industry, would be the proper vehicle for the fostering of the Irish film industry at this time, and not the ragbag of agencies he now has drawn on for the financing of the film industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I have a great interest and belief in the future of an Irish film industry.  But I do not think anybody, <Col N="1495" /> particularly a member of the Progressive Democrats, could be prepared to stand over a situation where the film board would grant £1.8 million with practically no return.  They gave £1.8 million of taxpayers' money for making films which were not commercially viable.  None of us would wish that situation to continue. The Government have introduced an important tax incentive in the Finance Act, 1987, which, in the view of the most progressive people in the film industry, was what was needed.  The Deputy should be prepared to see how that major tax incentive works before seeking any other measures of support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach to say it is all right to give away taxpayers' money through tax incentives but not to give it to the film industry in the form of grants?  What return will the taxpayer receive in the form of dividends from the tax incentives?  Is the Taoiseach aware that it is common cause on both sides of this House that the film board, as previously constituted, were not fulfilling their commercial role?  But is he aware that the board were reconstituted by the previous Government and, as a result of that, much more commercially-oriented people were put on the board precisely to achieve the objective that we agree should be sought, and that it is rather premature to cut the board off at the knees, so to speak, just when this new commercially-oriented board were getting into their stride?</P>

The Minister, when introducing the Bill in 1980, clearly indicated that the Board should be looked at after four or five years to see if they had succeeded in doing their job.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, I would like to ask him the following supplementary.  Where does he envisage pre-production finance for film making coming from &mdash; and I do not think he can fob us off by saying that the Arts Council will be able to provide seed money?  Would he further agree that it is a very crude criterion to use to say how much money has been advanced by way of loans and how much has been repaid? Would he like, for example, to tell the House how many films have been made through the activities of An Bord Scannán providing seed money, the initial finance?</P>
      <P>Finally, is the Taoiseach aware of the number of signatories in the international and national film making community who are at one in saying that a body such as An Bord Scannán should be in existence? I ask him to tell us as well in relation to what he has mentioned in his reply, the tax incentive that arises under the 1987 Finance Act, how people are going to get as far as that?  Would he not agree that if there is no funding to initiate films, there will be no commercial films against which the tax incentives can be claimed?</P>

All we are concerned with in this question is the activities of one particular board.  The argument for ending the remit of that board is unanswerable.

Will the Taoiseach say if any provision has been made in his Estimates or any other Estimates for the commitments already entered into by An Bord Scannán to the extent of £200,000 and as promised by the Minister of State in the Seanad in July of last year?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are put forward in full agreement and in consultation with the IDA, as far as they are concerned.  I think that I have already pointed out that the IDA have been achieving something in the region of 1,500 to 1,700 new jobs.  What we are asking in the period immediately ahead is not all that much of a radical advance on that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach might start building on reality by answering this question.  Can he say whether the <Col N="1504" /> figures are gross or nett, whether, for instance, 1,000 new jobs in toolmaking mean that the Taoiseach is talking about 1,000 extra jobs there or simply 1,000 jobs that will be created in order to replace perhaps a loss of 1,500, which would be a nett reduction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has all been published and the Deputy might have taken the trouble to read it.  What the programme envisages is the creation of this number of new jobs.  It does not take into account job losses.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he, or either of his Ministers of State has directed any of the staff employed in his or her departmental constituency office to travel to or work directly in the local constituency clinic; if such practice, if any, is in the public interest; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In her absence abroad on official business a member of staff attached to the constituency office of the Minister of State at my Department, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has represented the Minister at her constituency clinics on two occasions to make notes for the Minister of representations made by members of the public.  The duties of the officer concerned normally involve receiving such representations by telephone or by correspondence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not support it and did not support it when the last Government engaged in it to a very great extent.  It is important, however, to try to keep a sense of proportion.  If a Minister has to go abroad unexpectedly and has made some arrangements, I do not think it unreasonable to have a member of the staff of the Minister's office stand in on an occasion in a very limited and exceptional way.  Apart from that, I would not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely agree with the Taoiseach on that aspect.  In fact, we are unduly critical.  Would he share the view that in the matter of ordinary ministerial work, it is not proper to ask a private secretary to travel out of Dublin on a regular basis to attend in a constituency and do ordinary clinical work in that constituency? That is not, I presume, worthy of his support?</P>

      <P>Faoi mar a mhínigh mé don Teach le deánaí, is í Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe atá freagrach go príomha as feabhsú agus cothú na mbóithre poiblí i gConamara.  Tuigim ón Aire Comhshaoil nach bhfuil an soláthar a cheadófar don chomhairle chontae le caitheamh ar bhóithre i 1988 socraithe fós.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, bíonn soláthar an-teoranta ar fáil do mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre Gaeltachta: níl an bealach ina dháilfear an soláthar sin i 1988 socraithe fós ach an oiread.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí mé mar bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe is minic a chuala mé nach raibh airgead a dhóthain ag an chomhairle leis an obair seo a dhéanamh.  D'fhiafraigh mé den Aire Stáit sa cheist an bhfuil sé i gceist aige aon airgead breise nó airgead speisialta á chur ar fáil seachas an méid airgid a bheidh curtha ar fáil don chomhairle chontae chun caitheamh ar na bóithre mar is gnáth.</P>

Níl aon deontais le tabhairt ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ach do bhóithre áise agus do bhóithre portaigh sa Ghaeltacht. Sin an nós, leis, sa Roinn Comhshaoil, agus mar a mhínigh mé don Teachta sa bhfreagra, níl sé socraithe i gcóir na bliana seo cén chaoi an gcaithfear an t-airgead ar bhóithre poiblí i gConamara sa bhliain 1988.</P>

      <P>Ach an cheist arís atá mé ag cur air ná seo, an mbeidh airgead breise speiaialta ar fáil do na bóithre i gConamara?  Agus an aontaíonn an tAire <Col N="1512" /> Stáit liom go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar leith agus práinn ag baint le cúrsaí bóithre i gConamara faoi láthair?

Ach níl an t-airgead socraithe do 1988, agus ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios ag an Teachta é féin, mar bhall den chomhairle chontae.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that medical opinion is against the closure of the County and City Infirmary in Waterford as it will cause a gross inadequacy for acute operations and will cost lives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waterford area will continue to receive an excellent hospital service despite the regrettable closure of the county and city infirmary there, since additional beds and support facilities are being made available in Ardkeen Regional Hospital, Waterford, to cope with the increased demand.  In addition, a completely new hospital is currently under construction at Ardkeen.  This development will facilitate the provision <Col N="1517" /> of regional hospital services of the highest standard in the south east.</P>
    <P>The special fund for the financing of redundancies in the public sector will apply only from 1988 onwards.  In terms of redundancies which arise this year, additional funding will be made available to agencies to finance the application of the redundancy terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I want to refer to the last part of the Minister's reply because it has to do with Question No. 15.  Will the Minister give the source of the funding of the redundancies in question and indicate what they will amount to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say at this stage what exactly redundancies will amount to in relation to Waterford County and City Infirmary.  It depends on the number of staff who will be redeployed. It is intended that the 35 student nurses would transfer to Ardkeen Hospital to complete their training and that redeployment will be offered to a number of the staff who are at present in the Waterford infirmary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me the terms of the redundancy?  If he cannot tell me now when will they be available? When can he communicate those terms to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy about the terms of redundancy. I understand that negotiations are proceeding in the usual way with the representatives of the staff and officials of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Question No. 35, did the Minister say that additional beds have been provided in Ardkeen to offset the loss of beds due to the impending closure of the infirmary?  If so, what is the total number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that 45 beds are at present closed in Ardkeen Hospital and that in total 41 beds were in service in the Waterford <Col N="1518" /> County and City Infirmary.  It is intended to open sufficient beds in Ardkeen to cater for the beds that were closed in the Waterford infirmary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that difficult to believe because the experts in Ardkeen who jointly service Ardkeen and the infirmary maintain that there are no additional beds or facilities available within Ardkeen and that when the infirmary will close one-third of all beds for acute cases involved in operations will be surrendered or taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to the Central Applications Bureau.  An Bord Altranais is the statutory authority concerned.  However, I fully support a central applications bureau to accept applications and ensure that the candidates have the necessary qualifications.  The Central Applications Bureau would then refer them to the hospitals of the applicants' choice.  I believe that the training schools should have a major input to the selection of trainees.</P>
      <P>Some of the health boards and a large number of the voluntary hospitals including the Mater, Adelaide and St. Vincent's, would not accept An Bord Altranais's decision to make the final selection of trainees.  A court action was threatened.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I did not wish to see a legal battle involving a State board under my aegis and a voluntary hospital funded totally by taxpayers' money.  I attended a meeting of An Bord Altranais and suggested that they allow the training schools to interview the candidates with a representative of An Bord Altranais on the selection board.  I made it clear that if the board were dissatisfied with the manner of selection in any individual case I would rigorously investigate it.  It is a matter of disappointment to me that An Bord Altranais decided not to accept this compromise and subsequently suspended the operation of the Central Applications Bureau for this year.</P>

I might add that the working party on nursing, who reported in 1980 with a very broad representation on them, at no stage discussed the Central Applications Bureau where nurse trainees would be selected in the same way as students are selected for university.  That was never discussed by that body.  I suggested to An Bord Altranais that if they were to allow the hospitals to select their own trainees with a representative of An Bord Altranais on the board, if that representative of An Bord Altranais was unhappy with the manner in which the selection was carried out and if they reported to me I would rigorously investigate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed in principle to granting representation on the Western Health Board to Galway County Borough.  As I explained to the Deputy in reply to a parliamentary question in March last, I considered it vital to review the position carefully before arriving at a decision in the light of the necessary assessment of the organisation of the health board structure generally and its composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that each county borough has representation on its local health board and Galway County Borough is the only corporation area in the country which is being denied representation on the Western Health Board?  This has been denied since the county borough was established on 1 January 1986.  Will the Minister accept that that answer might have been understood when given by his predecessor who indicated publicly that he had proposals to alter the number of health boards and to change them basically but he is on public record as favouring the continuation of the health boards as presently structured? In the light of that surely it is unreasonable to continue to deny a corporation area, where there are three major <Col N="1524" /> hospitals, two of which are teaching hospitals, doctors and nurses in major training areas and where there is located a major medical school and a number of other medical facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the Minister said he has been considering this matter since last March?  Surely it is unreasonable to continue to give that answer.  It could not possibly be accepted by any person who understands the facts.  Is it not true that the political balance on the Western Health Board might be a factor which is influencing the Minister?  In view of recent decisions made by political representatives on that board, surely it is imperative that an area where there are major hospitals should have representation to protect the interests of the hospitals and institutions in that area?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle I, propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to discontinue funding of the National Social Service Board with effect from 1 January 1988 followed a general review by the Government of State bodies which are supported from public funds.  It was considered that the services could be provided at less cost without diminishing the quality of the service.</P>
      <P>I recognise the value to the public of the community information centres and I intend that they will continue to operate with the support of the health boards and other public authorities.  Details of the new arrangements are under discussion between my Department and other interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is unnecessary for the purpose of the new arrangements to <Col N="1526" /> repeal the Act under which the board was established.  I have made arrangements to ensure that the National Council for the Aged continues its work on which I place a high value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit perturbed on a number of fronts.  Does the Minister expect that the services provided for a very small sum of less than £500,000 and a staff of 20 providing a whole range of services from insurance and training courses to community information services can now be performed by his Department and can maintain any semblance of independence to criticise Government policy while, operating directly from his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The services will not all be provided by my Department.  I expect the Department of Social Welfare will have a major input in view of the fact that 50 per cent of the inquiries received by the information centres are concerned with social welfare matters.  One of the reasons it was decided to abolish the National Social Service Board was that there was so much duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The community information centres are of vital importance. A number of other functions are provided by the National Social Service Board including a group insurance scheme which offers very competitive insurance cover to voluntary organisations, more than 200 nationwide, and the 850 people from voluntary and statutory bodies who were trained last year.  Who will provide this training?  Who will provide this insurance cover?  Can it be done on a cost saving basis when all this was provided last year on a budget of less than £500,000?</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make a statement about my decision to integrate the Health Education Bureau in the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to explain that I see health education as but one element in a broader policy of health promotion. I am sure Deputies will be familiar with the concept of health promotion.  It requires that we not only concentrate on the health education of individuals but that we also develop health promotion <Col N="1528" /> policies in those social and economic sectors which influence the quality of our health.  In order to initiate the actions required to bring about these broad changes, it is obviously necessary that I and my Department should take the lead role.  For that reason I have decided to establish a health promotion unit within the Department and to merge in it the present functions of the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    <P>I shall also be appointing shortly an advisory council on Health Promotion which will include persons selected from the major social and economic areas which influence the quality of our health. I might mention that the appointment of this council is based on a recommendation which the Health Education Bureau made earlier this year in their report, <i>Promoting Health Through Public Policy.</i></P>
    <P>The new unit within the Department will have responsibility for developing health education campaigns.  They will also provide the secretariat for the council and will have the immediate responsibility for taking action on the council's recommendations.  The implementation of the council's views will have the further support of a special Cabinet subcommittee of which I shall be chairman as Minister for Health.  Their role will be to secure the necessary support and co-ordination of the sectors concerned.</P>
    <P>As far as funding is concerned, I intend at least to maintain this year's level of expenditure on health education.  In looking at the published Estimates for my Department for next year, and particularly at the proposed breakdown of expenditure, Deputies should bear in mind that the payment of the staff who will be employed in the new Health Promotion Unit is provided for in the general subhead covering the salaries and wages of the personnel of my Department.  Furthermore, in giving health boards their allocations, I shall be asking them to make allowance for the increasing emphasis on health promotion and for the fact that health boards themselves will have a role in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the four questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I want to stress to the House that my prime concern, and that of the Government, is for the safe return of Mr. O'Grady to his family.  Accordingly, it is not my intention to say anything here today which might in any conceivable way militate against the achievement of that objective.  I am sure that all Deputies from all sides of the <Col N="1531" /> House will be anxious to adopt a similar attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the nationwide search for Mr. O'Grady which has been under way since his kidnapping became known to the Garda.  Major Garda efforts and resources were devoted to the search without any concrete result until Monday last when, as a result of intelligence received, three uniformed gardaí went to check a transport container at the rear of a cottage situated about two miles outside Midleton. The gardaí spoke to the owner of the cottage, ascertained the name of the person who had responsibility for the container, called to that person's home and invited him to accompany them to Midleton Garda station, which he did, voluntarily.</P>
    <P>Arising out of information provided by this person, the gardaí decided that it would be prudent to assemble armed reinforcements before revisiting the container. Having assembled an armed unit the gardaí returned to the vicinity of the container.  They parked their vehicles some distance away in order not to alert their quarry.  They were in the process of surrounding the field where the container stood when a number of armed men broke cover from a ditch approximately a quarter of a mile away from the container and outside the cordon which was being put in place.</P>
    <P>This group fired shots at the gardaí and made their way to a nearby road where, at gunpoint they forced the occupants of a van and a car to get out of their vehicles. The presence of the civilians restricted the ability of the gardaí to return fire.  An unarmed man who was handcuffed to one of the group was identified as Mr. John O'Grady.  The group took over the car and, while driving away, fired at the gardaí, one of whom returned fire with a burst of 11 shots from a sub-machine gun, which broke the rear window of the escape car.</P>
    <P>Some two miles from this scene, the getaway car was involved in a collision with another vehicle but did not stop. On reaching the Cork-Midleton road, the <Col N="1532" /> armed group abandoned their original getaway car in a lay-by and hijacked another.  In this they succeeded in making good their escape from the immediate area.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have explained to me that by reason of the fact that the Garda vehicles were deliberately parked some distance away from the scene of the initial encounter, the gardaí were not in a position to stop the getaway vehicle or to go in instant pursuit of it.</P>
    <P>At approximately 6 p.m. on the same day, Monday, a group of at least three armed and masked men called at a house about three miles from Mallow.  They departed one hour later taking the family car with them, having warned the family that the house was being watched and that the matter was not to be reported until the following morning.  This car was found abandoned in Dundalk on the morning of Tuesday, 27 October.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources I can say that I have been assured by the Acting Commissioner that the gardaí have available to them all the resources that they need to deal with this major criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>What I have set out to the House are the principal facts of the case as reported to me by the Garda authorities.  I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go any further than that at this stage. Questions arise from the account that I have given but these I believe are best left for another day.  I have told the Acting Commissioner of An Garda Síochána that I wish to have a full report of all, I repeat all, aspects of the case in due course, including, of course, a full explanation of the circumstances in which this armed group of men managed to get away from an assembled force of gardaí.</P>
    <P>But for the moment, as I said earlier, the priority is the safe release of Mr. O'Grady.  I do not propose to ask the gardaí at this stage to engage in any postmortem activities which would distract Garda attention from the principal task which they have on hand &mdash; the safe release of Mr. O'Grady from his abductors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> I believe this is a reasonable and proper approach in the present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if armed units from the Army are available on call to the Garda authorities when such an incident arises.  What was the reason Army units were not called to assist the gardaí on this occasion?  Will the Minister consider holding a public inquiry into this matter in due course to ascertain the reason for this debacle that has given rise to so much public concern and as to why John O'Grady, having been sighted and contacted there, should have been lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy it is the practice that Army units are available on request to the Garda.  I understand that on this occasion the Garda made a request for an armed unit and that this request was fulfilled.  I understand that the Army unit in question went, as it was requested, but that the gardaí were unable to wait for it, through no fault of the Army, and decided to move ahead with the operation before the Army unit were ready to help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister advise the House as to what extent, given the fact that it was a bank holiday weekend, the cutbacks on resources and in particular on overtime to the gardaí, hampered the operations of the gardaí? Is the Minister aware that the foot move on the container was not backed up by a second mobile force of gardaí?  The pattern has emerged time and again of men slipping through the cordon of gardaí and at this stage surely the lesson has been learned that there is need for a second mobile unit in support.  How can the Minister explain how the motor car was able to travel from the south of Ireland, across the country &mdash; through Dublin I believe &mdash; and on to Dundalk without any detection or interception and without any radio contact ahead to try to intercept it?  That matter is of great concern to all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary is &ldquo;no, definitely not&rdquo;.  The answer to the second part of his question is that this is an operational matter for the Garda Síochána.  It is they who make the decisions on such matters having regard to all the circumstances which they, and they alone, would be aware of at the time.  With regard to the question about the gardaí being able to intercept the motor car that was stolen from Mallow between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Monday evening before it got to Dundalk, the Deputy, and the House, will appreciate that the Garda were not aware that car had been stolen until 6 o'clock the following morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that post-mortems at this stage or comments about the operations of the Garda on Monday may have the effect of demoralising the gardaí who are endangering their lives by being involved in this criminal investigation?  Will the Minister not agree that it would be better if in the House, and in the public media, examinations of what did or did not happen on Monday were left until Mr. O'Grady is safely back with his family?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that while we are all most anxious for the safe return of Mr. O'Grady there is a great deal of public concern that the effort being made to secure his release has, to say the least of it, been somewhat haphazard if one is to read between the lines about what went on at Ballyedmond near Midleton?  The reason for tabling <Col N="1535" /> a question of this type is hopefully, to eliminate perhaps unjustifiable criticism of those who are supposed to be involved. Will the Minister tell the House whether the gardaí in Midleton were in touch with headquarters in Dublin before they embarked on this rescue operation?  If so, did they receive any directions?  Will the Minister tell the House why road blocks were not set up throughout surrounding areas before the gardaí moved in to prevent a possible getaway?  Will the Minister say whether he was in touch with those responsible over the weekend?  Will the Minister deny rumours that Garda overtime to man road blocks in a number of areas was stopped after 6 p.m. because of lack of funds?  Those rumours are circulating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody should be more aware of rumours and the difficulty any Member on either side of the House has in trying to catch up with them than Deputy Barrett.  Let me repeat that I am assured by the Assistant Commissioner that the Garda have all the resources, manpower and financial, they require to do the job of work that needs to be done in this instance.  I am anxious to nail that malicious rumour to the mast and get it out of the way once and for all.  With regard to the suggestion in the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, that the efforts of the Garda were haphazard, I should like to state that the gardaí have an exceptionally difficult task to fulfil in this case.  They have to be very careful how they proceed to deal with this having regard to the fact that the people they are looking for are a well known armed gang of criminals whose value on life is very questionable to say the least.  The Garda can be, as Deputy Harney stated, unjustifiably criticised. We should not distract them in any way from the difficult task they have to accomplish in securing the release of John O'Grady and his safe return to his wife and children.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the allegation of haphazard efforts by the Garda and the only other question to be replied to is that in regard to road blocks.  They are operational matters for the Garda Síochána and there is no question of any financial resources being taken from them that would have interfered with the road blocks.  I should like to tell the Deputy that there was a problem in setting up road blocks to deal with this gang because if those road blocks did not have an armed presence we can rest assured that the lives of the gardaí in uniform who would not be armed would be seriously at risk.</P>

    <P>In page 12, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Shatter)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned before lunch we were dealing with amendment No. 20 which is designed to enable an agreement to be concluded between the mother of a child born outside marriage and the father, whereby a lump sum settlement is agreed.  It would mean that a large sum of money or property, or both, would be held by her for the benefit of the child born to her in a once off arrangement.  I was making the point that mothers, in practice, often wish to enter into such an arrangement, <Col N="1661" /> that the fathers often wish to do so and can do so under the 1930 affiliation orders Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us will remove that possibility and the Minister in voicing an objection to the provision said that married parents cannot conclude such an arrangement.  With respect, the position in this area is not the same and the desirability of married couples entering into such an arrangement when their marriage breaks down is a separate issue.  A mother who gives birth to a child outside marriage, who is not living with the father of the child, who has no ongoing relationship with him and who has the prospect at some future stage in her life of marrying someone other than the father of her child will often find that the lump sum arrangement is the most appropriate means of securing financial support for her child.  This type of financial arrangement can often benefit the child because, even when a mother succeeds in getting a maintenance order to ensure that payments are made, very often she does not receive them especially when they are made on a 15, 16 or 18 year period.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment because, if it is not, rights of mothers of children born outside marriage and which accrue to the children will be removed. The possibility of concluding these sorts of settlements for children will be removed.  I am personally aware of situations where a mother has waived her rights to support in the future because the father has purchased a house for her which will be held in trust for the child or jointly with him or her.  That has given the mother far greater security than she would have had by way of a court order and it has entitled and enabled her to have a far better standard of living than she would otherwise have had if she had been dependent on a weekly or monthly payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admitted that I was correct in this regard.  The section is very carefully drafted to ensure that, when mothers enter into such arrangements, they will not be cut off from bringing future court proceedings unless the court <Col N="1662" /> has ensured that the present arrangements are fair and reasonable, are in the best interests of the child and have been entered into freely by the mother.  If we remove this provision from unmarried mothers we will deny to them and their children the possibility of a great deal of security and protection.  I urge the Minister to accept the section and the amendment and not to approach them in the somewhat partisan way which is usually the case in this House and which has been the case in regard to some of the amendments dealt with today.  Legally and technically the amendment is correct and socially it will provide protection for children.  If we do not enact it we will be depriving children and others of a degree of security that can be obtained for children born outside wedlock at present.  We will also be denying them the possibility of such security in the future.  Such an approach is indefensible and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment as tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial issue with this amendment is whether a father should be able to protect himself against further claims for maintenance without regard to a change in circumstances.  Deputy Shatter suggested earlier in his contribution that by not reenacting the provisions of the 1930 Act in this Bill in so far as it deals with the payment of a lump sum to put an end to the child's father's rights to periodical maintenance payments, we would in some way be worsening the position of the child whose parents have not married each other or perpetuating discrimination against such children.  I cannot accept the contention and I should like to point out that the 1930 Act was passed in a social climate very different from that which prevails at present.  The lump sum provisions of that Act were designed to act as a sort of carpet under which could be swept the socially embarrassing and somewhat distasteful fact that one had fathered a child outside marriage.  The matter could be hushed up in the making of a once-off payment and hopefully forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> I agree with Deputy Shatter that if we are to have such provision in a modern Bill we must make sure that any agreement between those responsible for the maintenance of a child is adequately made in the child's interest and, no doubt, that would include some of the matters provided for in Deputy Shatter's amendment.  It is he who would perpetuate discrimination by tabling this amendment in its present form, applying as it does only to the father of a child who has not married that child's mother.</P>
    <P>This amendment could be said to offer protection to such fathers not available to any other parents and that that protection is at the expense of the right of a child to be maintained by both parents whether or not they have married each other.  There may well be a case for giving all parents the facility to make a clean break with regard to the maintenance of their children.  The matter can be examined for spouses at least in the context of the proposals for judicial separation at present being considered in my Department. The position of children whose parents are not spouses cannot be ignored in that examination.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that section 20 of the Bill meets most of what Deputy Shatter is seeking.  It enables parents who are not married to each other to conclude agreements which may include lump sums or property transfers regarding the maintenance of the child and to have such agreements approved by the court.  It stops short, however, at making such an agreement an absolute bar to the taking of maintenance proceedings in the event of circumstances changing in the future.  This is the aspect of the Deputy's amendment which is the most problematical.  Because it raises such important questions of principle regarding the law of maintenance generally, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment so that the question can be examined in the context of future legislative proposals, which I mentioned earlier, without delaying the passage of the Bill.  In the interests of eliminating discrimination against persons born outside <Col N="1664" /> marriage, it is important that this Bill be enacted as soon as possible.  I am sure the Deputy agrees with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Previously he criticised an amendment I tabled because it applied to children born inside marriage and not to children born outside marriage.  Now he is criticising it because it applies to children born outside marriage and not to those born inside marriage.  He says that section 20 will have a similar effect.  Of course it will not.  The purpose of this provision is to allow mothers of children born outside marriage &mdash; where they and the father wish &mdash; to conclude a once off settlement by the father with the mother and her child to give them a degree of financial security and independence of the father that they would not otherwise have.</P>
      <P>A father who knows that if he is taken to court the worst thing that can happen is that there will be a District Court order made for £30 a week is not going to enter into an agreement to buy a £40,000 house for a mother knowing that even if he does provide such a house a maintenance order can still be made against him.  The ways of the world being what they are, a mother seeking that type of security will get it only if the father feels he is also achieving something.  In most other jurisdictions there is provision whereby agreements of this nature can be reached which effect what the Minister refers to as a clean break and which allows the mother to conclude an arrangement with the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here only in the context of people who have a relatively high degree of means and resources.  For the majority of unmarried mothers such an arrangement is not possible but for a minority it is possible and I have seen it in practice during the years.  Very often the mother and the father want to make this arrangement and if we do not make such a provision in this Bill the conclusion of arrangements of this nature will prove to be impossible.  There will be no reason a father should make a long-term arrangement to provide a home in the mother's <Col N="1665" /> name or in the name of the mother and the child in circumstances in which he is given no protection against future legal action being brought against him.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister has said, it is not a question of trying to sweep under the carpet the fact that a child has been born outside marriage.  It is a question of trying to provide a legal arrangement whereby mothers, instead of finding themselves dependent on weekly or monthly payments being made to them &mdash; such payments can be considerably uncertain on occasions and may dry up if the father leaves the jurisdiction &mdash; if they have the facility to do so and if the father has the means and is willing to do so, can conclude a once-off arrangement which stabilises the mother's financial position, gives her a degree of economic dependence and gives a degree of permanent financial security and protection for the child.  That is as much a part of the reasoning behind the provision in the 1930 Act as the sweeping under the carpet might have been an intent of that Act.  I do not know whether or not that was so.</P>
    <P>In the seventies and eighties, in practice, mothers and fathers of children born outside marriage wished to enter into this sort of arrangement and if this type of amendment is not provided they will not be able to do so.  A mother whose child is born outside marriage and who marries someone who is not the father of her child two or three years later would wish to conclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not completely satisfied with this amendment.  In order to help me make up my mind about it, I want to put a hypothetical case to the Minister.  If a father approaches the mother and child and says he is emigrating to Australia in a few months time and that he is prepared to make a settlement from his capital resources for the child, surely, in such a case it would seem hard to deny that possibility.  While that father may have good intentions, when he has gone to Australia and set up a new life there, he may not have any interest in sending maintenance for his child in Ireland.  Is it right, therefore, in those circumstances to deny the possibility, while the iron is hot and when the offer is made, of making some secure provision for that child, which would have to be approved by the court and be proven to be satisfactory?  Are we saying that cannot be done and just hoping that the father continues to remit the maintenance payments?  Are we not putting a family in those circumstances at risk if we deny that possibility?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I have missed that provision in section 20 but that section seems to provide for periodic payments rather than for a capital sum.  I do not think a signed agreement for periodic payments will be of much use if the father is going to Australia.  Once the person has left the jurisdiction, the possibility of making amenable contractual arrangements of that nature does not exist.  It is only when one would have one's hands on a lump sum that it would mean anything. I see no provision in section 20 for a lump sum.

      <P>That is the reality. Deputy Taylor is correct.  The only incentive for a gentleman going to Australia to make a lump sum payment would be to know that he could not be required again through the courts, to make further payments.  If his trip to Australia was a failure and he returned to Ireland two years after making a lump sum payment, under the Minister's current provisions in the Bill he could be taken to court again and required to make payments, or he could be pursued, in theory, to Australia to make payments.  Fathers only enter into such arrangements if they have the inducement of knowing they will not be required by the courts at a future date to make further payments.  Deputy Taylor has hit the nail on the head with regard to this issue.  The Minister does not seem to appreciate the fact that such arrangements cannot effectively be concluded unless there is some advantage to the father as well as to the mother and the child.</P>
      <P>This Bill removes all inducements from the father and curtails any incentives or advantages there may be to him in entering into such an arrangement.  The gentleman Deputy Taylor referred to might just as well go off to Australia and pay the mother nothing because he could not be pursued to Australia for it and would have no inducement to make a lump sum payment under the Bill as is currently drafted.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the situation as envisaged by Deputy Taylor is more than adequately covered in section 20 (a) (ii).  The parents can voluntarily enter into an agreement on the question of payment; that agreement can be registered in court and is not a bar on any <Col N="1669" /> further payments it may be necessary to have made at some other stage.  If the <Col N="1670" /> circumstances change that is the way it should be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 33, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£3,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section seeks to re-enact a provision that was in the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, of 1930, extended to apply not merely to children born out of wedlock, but, as I would understand it, to children born within marriage.  The current position is that when a child is born to a mother outside marriage the mother can recoup certain expenses, by way of court order from the father of the child, additional to the moneys that can be obtained by way of affiliation order, or what will be a maintenance order under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that expenses incidental to either or both of the following matters can be obtained, first, expenses incidental to the birth of the child and also, in the context of a child who, unfortunately, dies expenses arising as a result of the funeral.  In the context of the expenses ordered under the Bill, it is provided that any lump sum order shall direct the respondent parent to pay to the applicant a lump sum not exceeding £1,000.  It goes on to say that no such order shall direct the payment of an amount exceeding £500 in respect of the birth of the child or £500 in respect of the funeral of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should first explain what are expenses incidental to the birth of a child. The courts, in practice, have interpreted such expenses as, first, medical expenses incurred by the mother with regard to the birth of the child and, secondly, expenses incurred by the mother for the provision of clothing for a baby to be taken home from hospital.  It can include also, in practice, the expenses of a carry cot which might have to be purchased for the purpose of bringing a child home from hospital.  It can be interpreted as including the other types of expenses a mother might incur such as the purchase of nappies to be used by the baby while in <Col N="1673" /> hospital &mdash; some maternity hospitals now require mothers to supply these whereas previously they supplied them.</P>
    <P>Expenses incidental to the birth of the child can also relate to medical expenses incurred by the mother relating to the birth of the child, such as visits to a gynaecologist for check-up pending the birth of the child and other types of expenses. Regarding expenses incidental to the birth of a child the maximum sum a mother can receive in the District Court under this provision is £500.  No similar financial limit is applied in the Circuit Court though I may be wrong in that. Perhaps, the Minister would clarify that for us.  Certainly, at present there is no financial limit with regard to the amount the Circuit Court can order.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, the District Court will be confined in making an order for expenses incidental to the birth of a child to a sum of £500.  That is not enough; it is not a realistic sum.  A mother when incurring expenses incidental to the birth of a child can incur a great deal more expense.  Admittedly, many mothers nowadays when a child is born will have some of their maternity expenses met either through the health service or by way of supplement through the VHI but that is not the case in regard to all mothers.  Secondly, the amount of expenses which can be incurred on some of the basic items I have referred to can considerably exceed the sum of £500.  It would seem that there is no rational reason for this Bill to impose a limit which does not allow the mothers to receive a full sum.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate what I am talking about by giving a very practical example. In a court case of about 18 months ago a mother sought a sum of money for expenses incidental to the birth of her child.  The case was determined in the High Court on appeal from the Circuit Court in March 1986.  In seeking expenses incidental to the birth of her child items of expenditure incurred or relating to the child were held by the court to come to a total sum of £952.  Under this Bill the mother could not get that £952 back, she would be limited to receiving a sum of <Col N="1674" /> £500.  There is no rationale for so limiting it.  The amendments I have tabled, if accepted, would allow the mother to receive a sum of up to £2,000 for expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  Bearing in mind that the courts have been making orders in the region of £900 to £1,000.  I do not understand why this House should curtail to £500 the sum the courts can order.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I propose that the courts be empowered to make an order for up to £2,000 for expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  That is a sum which is well within the limits of the District Court and if this provision extends beyond the District Court and into the Circuit or High Court jurisdictions it is quite clear that there is little sense in this House reducing the protections which mothers have and requiring the courts to make orders of a lower nature which they currently regard as being acceptable and correct under the provisions of existing legislation.  Secondly, in the event of the death of a child funeral expenses are limited to a sum of £500.  I propose that that sum should be increased to £1,000. Again, this is to allow some degree of flexibility and we should also bear in mind that our financial limits in these areas very rapidly become irrelevant because of inflation.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the courts will not order sums to be repaid to a mother unless she can properly in court proceedings prove that valid expenditure has been incurred.  It would seem that the financial limits laid down in this measure are unnecessarily narrow and do not accord either with the interests of the child or of mothers.  The third part of this amendment seeks to allow a total overall sum of £3,000 to emerge if expenses incidental to the birth of a child and funeral expenses are incurred.  Of course, in the vast majority of cases, fortunately, the question of funeral expenses will not arise.  Of most importance to mothers are the expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 are designed to increase the financial limits and to make them more realistic in the context of current costs <Col N="1675" /> incurred by mothers when they have babies.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 seeks to add a further subsection to this section.  The amendment seeks to insert subsection (4) to section 21 and would read that, &ldquo;for the purposes of the section expenses incidental to the birth of a child shall include expenses incurred by the mother incidental to and arising out of the period of pregnancy relating to such child together with any earnings lost by the mother due to her pregnancy during the aforesaid period&rdquo;.  I, again, emphasise that in that section there is an upper limit of £2,000 by virtue of the earlier amendments to this provision.  The Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930 refers to expenses incidental to the birth of a child, as does this Bill, but nowhere in that legislation is it defined exactly what encompasses expenses incidental to the birth of a child.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I dealt with expenses which are generally agreed among all judges as being expenses incidental to the birth of a child &mdash; gynaecological expenses, expenses for clothes immediately required to bring the child home from hospital, for nappies, for a carry cot and so on.  There is no dispute about any of these items.  In the case of <i>McV v. McG</i> of March 1986 which is unreported in the Law Reports a member of the High Court sought to delimit what was meant by expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  He held that a mother's loss of earnings was not an expense incidental to the birth of a child.  He also held that where a mother, for example, gives up work some weeks before her child is born and does not receive any payments or where the payments which she receives through some form of maternity payment are below what she would have received through her salary or wages, that the moneys she loses are not an expense nor are they referrable to a birth.  The High Court judge said that it is a loss referrable only in part to the fact of the birth and in the main to the period of pregnancy.  He also held in that case that the cost of maternity clothing was not something <Col N="1676" /> incidental to the birth of a child but was referrable to the period of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Many mothers outside marriage are in very difficult financial circumstances and cannot afford the additional expense which is incurred as a result of having to buy maternity clothes solely out of their own funds.  Where loss of earnings results they find themselves in some difficulty. What I seek to do in inserting a new subsection (4) is to provide a definition of expenses incidental to the birth of a child whereby they shall include expenses incurred by the mother incidental to and arising out of the period of pregnancy relating to such child together with any earnings lost by the mother due to her pregnancy.</P>
    <P>It is taking legal reasoning to a tortuous extent to say that expenses incurred due to pregnancy are not expenses which relate to the child being born.  Of course, the two are interwoven.  It is probably futile to urge the Minister but nevertheless I urge him to accept the amendments which I have tabled along those lines with a view, as I have said on the previous amendments, to giving greater protection to children both inside and outside of marriage and with a view to ensuring, in the context of &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rdquo; some uniformity of judicial approach in the courts with regard to applications made by mothers when they seek such expenses.</P>

      <P>I am seeking to address the very problem to which Deputy Shatter has been alluding.  In our discussions this morning Deputy Shatter highlighted the problems encountered, when the provisions of a Bill fix sums, how quickly they <Col N="1677" /> become out-of-date and how difficult it is to find an opportunity of updating them.  We have been frustrated on two occasions already today when we sought to avail of the opportunity this debate affords to effect an improvement in the figures and to bring them to a more realistic level.  Perhaps I should read our amendment No. 25 into the record.  It states:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) The Minister may, from time to time, as he thinks proper, by order vary the amounts allowable on award under subsection (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) Where it is proposed to make an order under this subsection, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireactas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (b) of our amendment seeks to give Deputies an opportunity &mdash; as and when Ministers may think fit to introduce an order &mdash; to have their voices heard and taken on board by the Minister in the fixing of a sum.  At this stage in preference to the formula of fixing figures, perhaps the Minister would leave the figures as they stand at £500 each because in certain respects they are generous and constitute an improvement on the present position.  I suggest that amendment No. 25 be accepted as constituting a means of dealing with the matter in the future.  I believe it to be the most workable formula and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 24, which is the principal amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter, raises a major issue of principle arising from the manner in which it defines &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rdquo; for the purposes of a lump sum awarded under the provisions of this section.  It has always been a principle of maintenance law relating to the children of parents who are not <Col N="1678" /> married to each other that the father is liable to maintain the child but not to maintain the mother.  Amendment No. 24 breaches that principle by including loss of the mother's earnings in the category of expenses which the father may find himself ordered to compensate by way of a lump sum payment.</P>
      <P>For that reason I am opposed to it, at least at this stage.</P>
      <P>There may be two views on the matter but we would need to consider very carefully all the implications of such a proposal before effecting any change in the long-standing principle I have just mentioned. For instance, it raises the issue as to what, if any, obligations the parents of a child who are not married to each other should owe to each other as distinct from those they owe to the child.  These are not matters which should concern us in our consideration of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards the maximum levels of lump sum proposed in amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23, the proposed £2,000 overall limit clearly is related to amendment No. 24 which I am not accepting and, accordingly, is now out of the question.  The amounts specified in the section were arrived at having regard to the rate of inflation prevailing since the last time the maximum amounts were set for the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act of 1930 by the Courts Act of 1981.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to look at these figures between now and Report Stage but I doubt very much that I could justify a doubling of those amounts proposed in the amendments.  I am not sure that such would be warranted.  However, I am quite prepared to have a good look at the matter and to revert to it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 25 in the name of The Workers' Party representatives, I should say that the maximum amounts of £500 each for birth and funeral expenses specified in subsection (1) of the proposed section 21A constitute limits on the jurisdiction of the courts.  The courts in question here are the Circuit and District Courts.  There is a long held principle in relation to these <Col N="1679" /> courts, that in view of the fact that they are courts of local and limited jurisdiction under Article 34 of the Constitution, it is inappropriate that their jurisdiction limits be set other than by an Act of the Oireachtas.  From time to time a Courts Bill is introduced, the purpose of which is a review the civil jurisdiction limits of the lower courts.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 25 Deputy McCartan can be assured that the appropriateness of the maxima specified in this section will be considered when the next such Bill is being prepared.  The last occasion on which the jurisdiction limits were increased was when the Courts Act of 1981 was enacted.  I understand that at that time some allowance was made for anticipated future inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 24 refers to expenses arising out of the period of pregnancy.  The section of the Bill under discussion refers to &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth.&rdquo;  This follows the wording of the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act of 1930.  Having regard to the case made by Deputy McCartan, I am prepared to look at the formula suggested by him between now and Report Stage to ascertain whether I can meet him on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one or two additional points.  The Minister appears to be missing the point I was making when he refers to the provisions of his Bill increasing the financial limits in accordance with inflation.  The position obtaining at present is that there are no financial limits when it comes to the Circuit Court making orders in this area. That is the reality.  The present position is &mdash; as per the example I gave &mdash; that currently the courts are making orders in excess of the financial limits the Minister is imposing.  I gave the example of the case in which the courts made an order in the sum of £952 for &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child.&rdquo;  I am endeavouring to provide a mechanism &mdash; as I did earlier by way of amendments I had tabled &mdash; whereby mothers generally <Col N="1680" /> can bring these matters before the District Court or Circuit Court.  I am trying to ensure that the provisions of this Bill do not curtail rights already in existence.</P>
      <P>It would seem to me that what this House should be interested in doing is ensuring that the easiest and cheapest forms of legal assistance are available and that the courts can exercise a discretion of a nature that relates to the true expenses incurred when deciding what order should be made.</P>
      <P>In the context of amendment No. 25 &mdash; a continuous problem in the area of family law and in relation to support payments for spouses &mdash; is that very rapidly the maintenance upper limits fixed by this House for District Court orders become irrevelant.  I would agree with the type of formula advocated in amendment No. 25, as applying possibly not simply in the context of these types of orders but in the context of maintenance support orders generally.  Indeed amendment No. 25 is not mutually exclusive of those I have tabled; they are complementary.  I contend that Deputy McCartan is wrong in saying that the Minister's financial limits here are generous.  The point I was making was that they are actually out-of-date already on the basis of the type of court orders currently being made.</P>
      <P>Ministers never accept amendments from the Opposition parties, rather they consider amendments and then produce them under their names on Report Stage. That does not really matter.  I do not care whose amendments they are.  I just want to see the provisions of the Bill improved. If the Minister is willing to have another look at this area and on the financial limits before Report Stage I am quite happy with that and we can revert to the matter then.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister also that the definition of &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rdquo; is not trying to provide support payments for mothers but rather is trying to provide that mothers will truly receive and be recompensed for expenses they incur relating to the birth of their child or to their pregnancy with that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been heard about the rights <Col N="1681" /> of the unborn child.  The birth of the child would not take place without proper prenatal care by the mother.  I suggest that the definition I have given for expenses incidental to the birth of the child is quite reasonable and because there would be a financial upper limit on it, it does not mean that exorbitant orders could be made that bear no relationship to the real expenses incurred by the mother.  My concern is that recent court comments and judicial decisions in this area are unnecessarily curtailing the concept of expenses incidental to the birth of a child in a way that is not to the benefit of the child or its mother.</P>

      <P>While I am not absolutely satisfied with the Minister's reply that the fixing of jurisdiction of a local and limited District Court should be confined to an Act of the Oireachtas, if this matter is to be looked at again by him before Report Stage I am happy to let matters pass for the moment so far as my amendment is concerned.  However, I hope that by Report Stage there will be an improvement along the lines Deputy Shatter and I have been proposing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the will of a testator who dies before the commencement of this Act, but shall apply to the will of every testator who dies after such commencement, whether the will was executed before or after that time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with probably the most crucial and critical area that remains to be addressed by the Minister and the House in relation to the elimination of discrimination and the equalisation of the status of children born in or out of wedlock.  The section as drafted seeks to deal with the position of wills made and of children born out of wedlock <i>vis-à-vis</i> such a will.  At what stage should these provisions come into operation? Which wills will be affected by them? Will wills already in existence at the time of the passing of the Act be covered?</P>
      <P>The amendment being proposed by The Workers' Party is seeking, as its wording indicates, to apply to the will of every testator who dies after the enactment of this Bill whether the will was executed before or after that time.  In other words, we are seeking to make the operative date, in keeping with the general principles of wills, the date on which the testator dies.  For that reason I hope the Minister will accept this amendment without debate.  The issues are clear and straightforward.  I remind the Minister that his own Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad when this amendment was being debated there supported it.  I trust that that line has remained constant and consistent and that the Minister will be rising to tell us he intends to take this amendment on board.  I am surprised he has not indicated so already.</P>

      <P>Subsection (6) (a) of <Col N="1683" /> this section provides that the new rule of interpretation of dispositions provided for by the section will not operate retrospectively to affect dispositions made before the commencement of this part of the Bill.  This is in accordance with the view of the Law Reform Commission on the matter.  In their report on illegitimacy, at paragraph 339, when recommending the abolition of the present rule of interpretation, they state, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Commission consider ... that it would not be advisable for the legislation to provide that the abolition of this rule of construction should be retrospective in its effect so as to apply to instruments made before the enactment of the legislation.  Such a policy would greatly unsettle the law and would cause immense confusion, practical difficulties and uncertainty. Accordingly, we recommend that this change in the law should apply only to instruments made after the enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is a cardinal principal of succession law that, when the question of interpreting a will arises, the courts will endeavour to implement the intention of the testator as expressed by him in the will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a will is drawn up under the present rules of interpretation which refers to, say, &ldquo;the children of `X' &rdquo;, then when that will comes to be implemented, it is taken to refer to the legitimate, including legitimated, children of `X' and to no others, unless there is something which clearly indicates that the testator must have had in mind children of `X' born outside marriage. This is the way the present law works.  People who make wills, and their legal advisers, know that that is the way the law works, and phrase their wills accordingly.  If the law is changed as proposed in this amendment, it will have the effect that a will may no longer mean what the testator thought it meant and intended it to mean.  This would be a breach of the principle of construction to which I have referred, and, as the Law Reform Commission said, would cause confusion and uncertainty.  In addition, I <Col N="1684" /> am advised that there is a distinct possibility that any such provision would be held to be contrary to Article 43 of the Constitution relating to property rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am disappointed to hear that the Government are not prepared to stand consistent with their position on this amendment in the Seanad.  I am even more disappointed to learn that the Minister is seeking simply to take on board now at this late stage the views of the Law Reform Commission which comes down to the suggestion that the amendment by The Workers' Party would create confusion; would throw some spanner into the legal network as it operates at the moment.  That is not the basis on which we as innovators and legislators should be concerned.  We should try to create equality as the Bill is designed to do.</P>
      <P>I understand that this Bill has been on the rounds of the Houses of this Legislature for two-and-a-half or almost three years.  It was a signal to all out there that if the father of children born outside wedlock wanted, for example, to put the future disposition of his property in such a way as to avoid dispositions to such children, all he had to do was draft a will and put it aside.  While the Bill addresses fairly and squarely wills that will come into being consequent on the passing of this legislation, the vast majority of parents of those children already in existence &mdash; fathers in particular &mdash; will have drawn up their wills will have done so simply to disinherit those children.  It is incredible that we cannot address that practical result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operative date should be the date of the will of the testator.  I understand that a cardinal principle of all wills is that the date which the person dies is the date the will becomes effective and has any legal meaning.  It is in the context of the time that the person dies, not the time when the will was made, that one has consideration for the construction of the terms of a will.  I think there would be no difficulties in the example the Minister has given in constructing what the term &ldquo;the children of `X' &rdquo; means if at the date <Col N="1685" /> that the testator dies he has children who have been born both within and outside marriage.  I do not think that presents any difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is that this suggestion of constitutional infirmity is simply not a runner in this context.  It has been presented, with respect to the Minister, as a means to try to deflect attention away from the merits of what is contended here.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter again.  He has not sought in any way to explain why it is that his party in Government have changed from the view they held in the Seanad not so long ago that this was a worthy amendment and deserved support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good amendment and the Labour Party will be supporting it.  I do not believe it involves anything dramatic so far as the general law is concerned. The basic principle of the law is, and always has been, where wills are concerned, that a will speaks from date of death.  That is well settled law and it has numerous implications and numerous consequences.  It has had numerous implications in various pieces of legislation over the years.  Sometimes it has effects one way and sometimes another way.  That always has been the general principle of law and I know of no exception to it.</P>
      <P>A will speaks from the date of death. I do not see any reason for departing from that general principle where the provisions of this Bill are concerned.  In a sense the entire Bill is a retrospective measure.  It is a progressive measure and I am pleased to see it coming on to the Statute Books.  It is long overdue.  It recognises the fact that we should have recognised long ago that there is no distinction between one child and another child, whether they are marital or non-marital. I do not see why we should go out of our way in those circumstances to change the long established principle of law that a will speaks from date of death. To preserve some measure of that inequality that by bringing in this Bill we are trying to get away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is right and proper that <Col N="1686" /> the existing well settled principle of law should apply now as it always has done and that when a person dies the will is looked at and as from the date of death is the critical date.  People change their wills from time to time as circumstances change.  People can change their wills if they want to do so and it is open to their legal advisers to put them wise as to what changes of the law may imply for them.  That happens all the time in all kinds of circumstances.  Changes of the law are brought in in all sorts of ways covering all manner of things that change the existing position.  People have to enter into new documents and make new arrangements as the law changes from time to time.</P>
    <P>This is a retrospective measure.  We are saying retrospectively that there is no difference between all these children, that all children are equal in the eyes of the law be they marital or non-marital. Why can we not just leave it at that rather than go out of our way to change a long established principle of law of inheritance and succession, to try to defeat perhaps some of those people who at long last after all these years under this Bill will be given the equality, which in my view they always were entitled to and should have had, but now that they are being given it why grudgingly should we stretch out one hand to try to exclude a few of them at this late stage?  To do that gives some degree of validity to the position that we have had up to now that we are saying in this Bill was wrong and was mistaken, should never have been, which we are correcting it now and which we should have corrected a long time ago. Why then should we try to say that we will hold back a bit, we will not go the whole distance and we will change the existing principle of law that a will speaks from date of death to accommodate this position?  That is not necessary.  We do not have to change the law to accommodate or to pay some kind of tribute to a situation which was always wrong and always unfair, and only at this late stage in our legal history on this subject is it being finally recognised and finally changed.</P>

      <P>Testators and other disposers of property are free to dispose of their property as they think fit and they may leave their property to charity, ignoring spouse and children, or they may distinguish between children on whatever criteria they please.  This will continue to be the case whether or not this Bill is enacted.  No one will be forced by this legislation into making a will leaving property to a child born outside marriage. There are provisions in the Succession Act of 1965 which are designed to mitigate hardship to the spouse and children where insufficient provision has been made by the testator.  These are the legal right share for a spouse provided for in Part 9 of the 1965 Act and the provision of section 117 of that Act, which enables the child of a testator to apply to court for just provision out of the estate where the testator has failed in his moral duty to provide for the child, either in his will or otherwise.  This latter will be available to children whose parents have not married each other where the testator dies after the commencement of this part irrespective of when the will was made.</P>
      <P>These provisions operate only if they are invoked by the spouse or child and do not limit the freedom of a testator to will his property as he pleases.  They do not change the meaning of the will.  They only serve to modify the effect of the will, and then only at the option of the spouse or child, and in the child's case subject to court decision.  This freedom of testation is a long standing principle of succession law and is one which remains unaffected by the proposal in this section to change the rule of construction of references to family relationships.  Those who wish to exclude children born outside marriage from their dispositions will have to choose their words more carefully.  That is all.  People making wills are entitled to rely on the meaning of words at the time they make their wills.  It is wrong in principle for legislation to change retrospectively the meaning of the language used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the fact that this Bill has been public knowledge for some years and suggested that this <Col N="1688" /> interval would give people an opportunity to change their wills back to the original meaning.  Such a proposal presumes that everyone who drew up a will or other disposition with a future effect would be aware of the change being made in the meaning of the disposition and be in a position to change it back to what was originally intended.  This would by no means be the case.  What of the person who is abroad and cannot possibly be aware of these changes?  What of the person who succumbs to mental incapacity after making his will?  What of the person who sets up a trust and may be long dead when the trust property is finally disposed of in accordance with his instructions?  None of these are in a position to restore the meaning of the will or other dispositions.  We cannot treat lightly the very strong recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  With regard to the advice given to us by the Attorney General and by the previous Attorney General we have to be very careful about the constitutionality of what we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in saying that where a will is made prior to the enactment of this Bill and a person dies after this legislation becomes law, although the will will be interpreted on the basis of the current construction models where a child born outside marriage is excluded from benefiting from the estate of the person who made such a will, such child will be able to make an application under section 117 of the Succession Act 1965.  Would I also be right in saying that it would be a misinterpretation of this measure to interpret it as meaning that where someone dies after this legislation becomes law and there is a will in existence which was made before the legislation became law, children born outside wedlock will be excluded from benefiting from an estate? The reality, as I understand it, is that such children will still be able to benefit and bring an application under section 117 of the Succession Act for adequate and proper provision.  All this section, unamended, does is effectively to provide <Col N="1689" /> rules of construction that a will should be construed in the manner it was intended when it was drafted and we cannot superimpose different rules of construction.  If we did so it could be putting an intention into the mind of a testator which he never had and it seems to me that that would create considerable problems.  This matter was given a great deal of thought by the Law Reform Commission, and by the previous Government, composed of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and the present Government are concerned with it.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned with this section if it excluded children born outside wedlock from benefiting from an estate of a person who died after the Bill became law and leaving a will made before the Bill became law, but it does not do that. Such children can automatically seek application under section 117 of the Succession Act.  It seems to me that that very welcome provision will guarantee that all children born outside marriage will have full protection under this measure with regard to the estates of both father and mother when, on their death, they leave wills made either before or after the coming into force of this legislation.  It may be that that aspect of the measure is not completely understood if we take this section in isolation.</P>
      <P>In my view, the fact that a section 117 application can be made puts children in a true position of equality while ensuring that there is not a constitutional infirmity in something we are enacting, while also ensuring that wills are effectively interpreted as they are supposed to be taking into the account the intention of the testator. However, if the testator intends to exclude a child born outside wedlock from benefiting, that child will benefit by bringing a section 117 application, which is an application many children of married parents have to bring in order to secure their entitlements under a will.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with what Deputy Shatter said.  One of the problems with illegitimacy has been the concept of succession and the rights of &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; children to succeed to their <Col N="1690" /> fathers' estates.  This amendment seeks to put all children on an equal footing and not to discriminate against those children born outside marriage whose fathers happen to have made a will.  In my view this is a very reasonable amendment.  If we continue to discriminate against children in succession matters we will not end the concept of illegitimacy because this is central to what illegitimacy means in practical terms to those children who have been so unfortunate that they have been discriminated against, and it would seem from this Bill will continue to be discriminated against, in terms of what they would be entitled to as a result of their father making a will.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity to comment on Deputy Shatter's view about the merits of the Bill as it stands and, if you like, the demerits of the amendment being proposed of The Workers' Party.  Section 117 applies only to young persons, to children, and is designed to assist them in their education and start in life, and there it ends.  Once a child has moved from the educational area section 117 is of no avail to him or her thereafter.  Consequently, a child, legitimate or otherwise, could be totally disinherited or denied any share in an estate once that child passed beyond the stage of education or start in life.</P>
      <P>This amendment is trying to address the position of children born outside marriage who have progressed beyond that position and who should and would, if this amendment were accepted, stand equal as children of the testator, irrespective of their status.  That is the objective of the Bill &mdash; to equalise and to make fair the relationship of all children to their parents, in this instance, a testator.</P>
      <P>However, I do not want to go on about this.  I have made the points as clearly as I possibly can.  I recognise there is no give in the Minister and he is now being aided by Fine Gael in respect of this issue.  I do not propose to pursue the matter further but I am exceptionally disappointed in the so-called progressive views of the Fine Gael Party in this matter.</P>

      <P>In my speech introducing the Bill, I mentioned that this section had been criticised in the Seanad as being over-protective of personal representatives and trustees.  I indicated I was considering the possibility of amending the section to take account of that criticism.  The point made in the Seanad was that the section could be interpreted as leaving personal representatives and trustees free to distribute an estate or trust property without making any effort to trace persons born outside marriage who would have a claim to the property concerned in consequence of the provisions of this part of the Bill.  In absolving personal representatives and trustees from liability where they administered estates or trust property in ignorance of any such claimants, the section could also be said to discriminate against persons born outside marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken advice in this matter from legal practitioners experienced in this area of the law and the gist of that advice is that there is no need for the section. The situation is that personal representatives are adequately protected under the Succession Act, 1965, section 49 of which provides a mechanism which enables them to obtain protection by publishing appropriate notices.  As regards trustees, it is considered that they are used to making reasonable inquiries of the kind involved, and a proposal to give them additional protection as envisaged in the section would be of doubtful advantage to them.  It would also have some <Col N="1692" /> practical drawbacks, not least of which would be the expense of publishing notices on the occasion of every distribution of part of the assets of a trust.</P>

We could never understand how the original proponents of this Bill could have thought of introducing this regime of protection for personal representatives in the distribution of assets under a testamentary will.

      <P>In page 19, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 117 of the Act of 1965 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3):</P>
      <P>`(3A) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 109 (1), any reference to &ldquo;testator&rdquo; in this section shall include any person who dies wholly intestate after the coming into force of Part V of the Status of Children Act, 1987.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I am happy to move this amendment. Under the Succession Act, 1965, where a person dies testate, or partially testate &mdash; that is disposing of some of their property by will &mdash; it is open to the children to contest that will under section 117 of the Succession Act to have an improved provision made for them.  On the other hand, where a parent dies intestate and there is no surviving parent, the property or the estate is divided equally among all the children.  All Members will be aware of cases where one child, very often a woman, stays at home to look after a father or mother for many years.  Such people give up work opportunities but very often the parent dies intestate with the result that all the children of that family, irrespective of the responsibilities they exercised, how often they visited their parents or how well they looked after them, are entitled to an equal share of the estate.  I have come across many cases where hardship has been caused to people who have taken good care of a parent.  Even if hardship is not caused I do not think it is fair that a person who stays at home, exercises so much responsibility and gives up so much to look after a parent or parents should be treated on the same basis as all other children.  There are many examples of a home being disposed of and the person who has looked after a parent or parents having to look to a local authority to be housed because other children who may live very far away from the family home insist on the property being sold to get their share.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the same benefit and protection that is given by section 117 where a will is made, or partially made, to a case where a will is not made.  I do not think my proposal is unreasonable.  Children in such circumstances should be given the same protection as children of a parent who dies testate.  It may be that where there is no will, such children need greater protection than where a will makes clear the testator's wishes.  In such cases the testator may not have left any wishes and it is only right that under section 117 of the Succession Act such children should be able to apply to the <Col N="1694" /> court to have their position improved to one superior to that of the other children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to apply the provisions of section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, which were designed to apply where the deceased made a will to cases where the deceased died without having made a will.</P>
      <P>Firstly, this amendment is inappropriate to this Bill; it belongs in a general succession Bill, which this Bill manifestly is not.  The amendment has nothing to do with equalising the rights of children.  That is the essential purpose of the Bill, and that purpose should not be obscured by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That apart, the proposal is, in substance, inappropriate.  It ignores the existence of Part VI of the Succession Act, 1965, which sets out the rules for distribution on intestacy.  These rules, which have been in operation since the Succession Act came into force, are designed to apply a fair distribution of a person's estate among his or her surviving family, where the deceased did not specify by will how it was to be distributed. They have operated very satisfactorily since their introduction, and one of the most satisfactory aspects of their operation has been that they provide a clear-cut and unambiguous set of rules which apply without the need to resort to court proceedings in the event of a dispute.  It is open to the surviving family, of course, to agree on a distribution of the estate which is different to that provided for under the rules, and this often happens where, for instance, the other members of the family agree to forego their entitlement in the family house in favour of the son or daughter who stayed to take care of the deceased parents.  If they fail to agree, the fall-back position is the strict application of the rules of distribution on intestacy; there is no need, or indeed opportunity, to institute court proceedings. These rules ensure that where there are children of the intestate, each one of them will be entitled to a share, and section 30 of the Bill has the effect that the rules will apply to all children of <Col N="1695" /> the deceased intestate whether or not the deceased had married the other parent.</P>
    <P>Section 117 of the 1965 Act is designed to meet a different situation entirely: it gives redress to a child whose parent has died leaving a will, where the deceased arranged his or her affairs so as to deprive that child of a fair share of the estate.  To apply section 117 in circumstances other than this would simply not make sense. As I have said, the rules of distribution on intestacy guarantee a fair and equitable share to each child where no will has been made.  It would be totally inappropriate to superimpose on that a provision designed to cater for a case where a parent, in making a will, has overlooked, or deliberately ignored, the child's normal expectation of a fair share of that parent's accumulated wealth.  Apart from its inappropriateness, the principle of the proposal is unsound in that it contemplates unnecessarily introducing scope for legal proceedings in the area of intestate estates.  This would be a retrograde step, as it would increase the prospect of estates being frittered away on legal costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the general principle Deputy Harney is seeking to introduce into the Bill.  In my view, the form of her amendment would not necessarily achieve the results she is seeking in that it would set up two contradictory provisions within the Succession Act.  We would have the entirety of Part VI of the Succession Act, particularly section 67, and we would then have this amendment in another Part.  I could see a great deal of confusion arising as a result but the principle she is raising is a matter of some importance and one with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that if a parent makes a will and does not adequately provide for a child or for children, an application can be brought under section 117 of the Succession Act alleging that a parent had in some way failed in his or her moral duty to make proper provision. There have been many court cases of that nature.  The courts in determining <Col N="1696" /> whether a parent has so failed can look at a variety of factors including the financial position of the children at the date of the death of the parent, the contribution the parent made during his or her lifetime to the children and the support and assistance children have given to a parent during that parent's lifetime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney is correct in saying that we can often get the case of a son or daughter who has remained with elderly parents, helping them to work a farm, look after a small grocery shop or some other type of small business for many years.  In many cases, where the parent does not provide adequately for that son or daughter, that son or daughter goes to the courts.  Courts have rearranged wills in those circumstances to the effect that the child &mdash; in this sense &ldquo;the child&rdquo; can be a person in their twenties, forties or fifties &mdash; should get a great deal more than one-third of the deceased parent's estate.  The courts may take the view that a greater provision should have been made by the parent for that child than for other children.  The courts will often examine the financial background of the children at the date of the parent's death and may reach the conclusion that children who are financially well off should not have provision made for them that equals the provision made for a child who is not in similar secure financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>When a parent in that situation dies intestate, the law currently confers on all children equal shares of the estate regardless of the financial position of the children or of the assistance the children have given to the parent during his or her lifetime.  The law also disregards the finances the parent has made available to individual children during his lifetime. There is need for a provision which would arise under Part VI of the Succession Act and which would probably be an amendment which could be dealt with on Report Stage in this Bill dealing directly in the context of children as an amendment of Section 67 of the Succession Act. It would provide, generally, when a parent dies intestate that current rules would apply but where having regard to <Col N="1697" /> the family circumstances and the parents moral duty, the courts are of the view that it is reasonable that greater provision be made to one or more children than to others, they would confer a similar discretion in the intestacy area as is the current position when a parent dies testate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points raised by Deputy Harney that this is an area where considerable injustice can be done when a parent dies without making a will, in particular in the context of a child who may have given up many years of his or her life and independence to care for elderly parents who have not arranged their affairs so as to provide some protection for the child who has been of assistance to them.  Unfortunately, the form of the amendment creates practical difficulties in its implementation.  There is a great deal to be said for this sort of general discretion.  It would not mean that all children would rush into court when a parent dies intestate just as all children do not currently rush to court when a parent dies having made a will.  It would cater for some children, for whom proper provision has not been made and where there has been a failure of duty on the part of the parents to make a will in which adequate provision was made for them.  There is a difficulty with regard to the drafting of the amendment and it is the wrong portion of the Succession Act. I urge that we come back to it on Report Stage by which time Deputy Harney and the Minister would have examined it.  I previously said when dealing with another aspect, that I do not accept the argument made that this is more appropriately dealt with under succession law and does not relate to this Bill.  This relates uniquely to children and we will shortly come to another amendment dealing with succession, children and parents and which will bring new law into play in that area.  In principle, I support much of what Deputy Harney said although there might be technical difficulties with the amendment.  I hope the Minister will have a more open approach to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the fact that my drafting does not seem to be up to Deputy Shatter's high standards. However, I am quite satisfied with the sentiment expressed therein and the advice I had was that it is perfectly adequate.</P>
      <P>I want to take up a number of points made by the Minister.  He referred to the fact that in some cases families agree about the distribution of an estate and, of course, in such cases, there is never a problem.  However, I have come across many cases and heard of many more where this is not the case.  I know of a woman who stayed at home and looked after her parents until her late forties or early fifties.  Generally speaking, parents look after the person who looks after them but when there is no will it is a different matter.  I know of a person in those circumstances who was put out of the family home which had to be sold to be divided among members of the family, many of whom lived in the United Kingdom and the United States.  The person who looked after her elderly parent was forced to sell the house, she merely got her share like everybody else and ended up having to be housed by the county council.  I thought it was very unreasonable that someone who looked after her parents for the best part of her working life and gave up many opportunities to move outside the home and to work should have been treated in this way.  It is not fair in such a case to treat all children equally.  The child who exercises responsibility, who foregoes so many opportunities, should have a higher claim on the estate than children who did not even live in the country.  Under section 117 of the Succession Act, if there is a will the person can apply to the court to have their position improved; if there is no will they need this provision.  The Minister will argue that it should not be done in this Bill but we get very little opportunity in this House of making progressive, fair or just amendments to the law and when we do I do not like to let such opportunities pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not put down any other amendment to the Bill because Deputy Shatter <Col N="1699" /> has done a very good job and I am happy to support many of his amendments. Indeed, I do not see any need for duplicating the work of the House but this is something about which I feel very strongly because it affects women as they tend to stay at home to look after elderly parents.  I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister would give me an assurance that for Report Stage he will draft an improved amendment which would be free of the difficulties contained in my amendment.  If he does not give me this assurance I will press the amendment because it is important to amend the Succession Act in favour of children in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the views expressed by Deputy Harney are sincerely held and that Deputy Shatter was genuine in his analysis of Deputy Harney's amendment.  I accept that there is much in what was said on the amendment and I appreciate the difficulties which Deputy Harney outlined, that opportunities for amending the law in areas where it is felt necessary do not often present themselves.  However, that is not a good enough reason for accepting her amendment as it is not appropriate to this legislation.  I would love to accommodate Deputy Harney but I cannot, I am sorry.  I would not like her to think that if she withdrew the amendment I could do something on Report Stage because I am advised that I could not.  It is not appropriate to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the cases made by other Deputies in relation to this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the matter.  He indicated that there is an element of sympathy in his thinking and that there are other amendments which will change the broad area of law in relation to children and their parents.  This amendment could be considered in that light.  The Bill before us will have a substantive effect on the Succession Act and it is not inappropriate to frame an amendment which would have a general effect on the Succession <Col N="1700" /> Act which is desired by everyone in this House, responding to what is clearly an oversight in the basic Succession Act. The question of wills is clearly something we have not caught up with in that area and if it is possible to look at it the Minister should do so.</P>

This Bill is about the status of children and I am seeking to upgrade the status of particular children who find themselves in very difficult circumstances when no will has been made.  This Bill is about maintenance, succession and guardianship.  It is not just a specific Bill, it goes way beyond what some people might think is in the Bill.  There is an opportunity here to amend the law to improve the lot of those children.  There are not very many of them &mdash; I do not want to exaggerate the numbers &mdash; but there are sufficient to warrant a change in the law to improve the position of those children who look after their parents and, as a result, are very often badly treated by the other members of their families.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 36 to 45, and in page 20, to delete lines 1 to 8 and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" />&ldquo;34.&mdash; The Act of 1965 is hereby amended by the insertion after section 120 of the following section:</P>
    <P>`120A (1) Where a person (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the deceased&rdquo;) dies intestate an application may be made to the court in a summary manner for a declaration that a parent of the deceased</P>
    <P>(a) if still living, is, or</P>
    <P>(b) if he dies after the death of the deceased, was,</P>
    <P>unworthy to share in the estate to which the deceased died intestate and the court may make the declaration sought if it considers it just having regard to any circumstances it considers appropriate and if it is satisfied that such parent did not make a contribution (whether financial or otherwise) of a substantial nature towards the upbringing of the deceased.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a declaration is made under this section the parent of the deceased declared to be unworthy shall not be entitled to a share in the estate to which the deceased died intestate and that estate shall be distributed as if such parent died before the deceased.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is proposed to replace the section proposed in the current Bill. First, I wish to refer to the section as it is drafted at present and then I will explain the reasons for my amendment. Section 34 of the current Bill seeks to insert a new section 120A in the Succession Act, 1965.  It is a very curious provision particularly because of what the Minister has said up to now.  He has been talking about the need to put children in a position of equality, not to discriminate between children born inside marriage and those born outside marriage and not to discriminate between parents of children born inside marriage and parents of children born outside marriage. This provision, as it is currently drafted, seeks to provide for different treatment of the estate of a deceased child depending on whether that child is <Col N="1702" /> born to a couple who are married or born to a couple who are unmarried.  It superimposes upon that a discrimination against fathers which apparently is justified on a particular basis.  Apparently, the drafters of the Bill saw no possibility that a similar provision could arise with regard to mothers.</P>
    <P>Section 120A provides that where a person whose parents have not married dies intestate an application may be made to the court for a declaration that the father of the deceased is unworthy to share in the estate to which the deceased died intestate and the court may make the declaration sought if it considers it just, having regard to any circumstances it considers appropriate and if it is satisfied that the father did not make a substantial contribution towards the upbringing of the deceased.  Generally speaking, if a child dies intestate leaving property and if that child is unmarried, the parents may jointly inherit the property of the child.  This section is designed to provide that where a child is born outside wedlock the father will not inherit if he is unworthy to inherit in particular because he has not made a significant contribution towards the child's support. Other reasons of unworthiness can also arise.  This provision is based on an assumption &mdash; it can be traced throughout this Bill and it arose in the earlier discussion with regard to guardianship &mdash; that most fathers of children born outside marriage are usually unmeritorious and are worthy of condemnation and of social stigma.  It is based on the assumption that you may always have an unworthy father but you can never have an unworthy mother.</P>
    <P>If a child is born outside marriage and the child dies after having been in the custody of the mother and if the father has taken no interest in the child and has made no contribution towards his support, it is correct that that father should be regarded as the unworthy father.  If the child dies leaving property it is correct that the mother should inherit that property.  Other situations also arise. <Col N="1703" /> For example, I am aware of circumstances in which children born outside wedlock have been abandoned by their mother and have been permanently cared for by their fathers.  If a child in those circumstances dies and leaves property and has not made a will, the father will share in that property with the mother even though the mother is in the same circumstances could be in the same category as the unworthy father in the first example.  In other words, she could be regarded as an unworthy mother.  The mother who abandons the child to the father, shows no interest in the child's upbringing, does not visit the child and makes no contribution towards its support would, under this provision, share in the inheritance of the property with the father if the child dies in a traffic accident or through an illness.  In reversed circumstances, if the child had been brought up by the mother the father would be cut off as an unworthy father.</P>
    <P>Uniquely, this provision seems to apply solely to children born to couples who are married to each other.  Examples can also arise in the marital area in which a father could be regarded as an unworthy father.  If a father deserts his wife when his children are two, three or four years of age and leaves the country or goes to live at some address of which the mother is unaware, if he makes no contribution towards the support of his children, never visits with them and never communicates with the mother of his children who were born legitimate under current law, he would equally share in the child's property if the child dies intestate.  It seems there is merit behind some of the thinking of this proposal in the original Bill but it is unduly narrow.  It is based on a sexual bias that assumes that you can have unworthy or unmeritorious fathers but never unworthy or unmeritorious mothers.  It is also based on an assumption, probably born of our own social values that whereas the unworthy father might reappear in a non-marital situation he would never reappear in the marital situation.  It seems that the provision in <Col N="1704" /> section 120A which introduces a new concept is fatally flawed for all of the reasons I have described.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I have tabled is designed to resolve all of these problems. It makes provision that where a child dies intestate there is a jurisdiction conferred on the courts to deny to a surviving parent the right to succeed to property left by that child if such parent could be deemed to be unworthy.  That unworthiness is based on a number of factors contained in this proposal which would apply to both married and unmarried parents and to mothers and fathers equally.  My amendment contains the following provision:</P>
    <P>Where a person (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the deceased&rdquo;) dies intestate an application may be made to the court in a summary manner for a declaration that a parent of the deceased (a) if still living, is, or (b) if he dies after the death of the deceased, was, unworthy to share in the estate to which the deceased died intestate and the court may make the declaration sought if it considers it just having regard to any circumstances it considers appropriate and if it is satisfied that such parent did not make a contribution (whether financial or otherwise) of a substantial nature towards the upbringing of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that where a declaration is made under this section the parent of the deceased declared to be unworthy shall not be entitled to a share in the estate to which the deceased died intestate and that estate shall be distrubuted  as if such parent died before the deceased.  That provision is designed to deal with a problem that can arise under existing succession law and to resolve the problems that can and will be created by the provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It could be suggested that the provision in this Bill as drafted is unconstitutional. The provision in this Bill designates someone as an unworthy father but does not provide a designation of an unworthy mother.  It deprives the so-called <Col N="1705" /> unworthy father of an entitlement to a share in an estate.  He could successfully challenge the constitutionality of this measure before the High Court and the Supreme Court if ever it was enacted on the basis that there was nothing embodied in this other than a pure sexual discrimination for which there was no justification.  Indeed, there have been cases in the adoption area of that nature which would back up the point I am making.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for an effective provision in this area to deal with the unworthy parent &mdash; the parent who has abandoned children and wife, or mother of children &mdash; so as to ensure he or she cannot benefit from a share in the estate of a deceased child.  But there is no basis for enacting a provision sexually discriminatory, probably unconstitutional and consequently inoperable.  What we should do is provide a measure such as the one I have proposed which would apply to all unworthy parents and confer on the courts the jurisdiction they do not currently have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section should be opposed for all the reasons Deputy Shatter has advanced as to why his amendment should be accepted in preference to what is in the Bill and because of its blatant discrimination.  I fail to understand why it was ever contemplated.  The section should be deleted for the very reasons the Minister may call in aid as to why Deputy Shatter's amendment should not be taken, that we are now moving from the area of the status of children into the whole area of succession law, and the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter involves the general principles of succession law and are not appropriate to the debate at this time.  I see a lot of heads nodding away from me at this stage.  Maybe I misapprehend what is coming but I have listened to that message for so long this afternoon that I would be surprised if it was not advanced.  We are simply saying that this is not a proper proposal in the form in which it is in the Bill at the moment, because it is blatantly discriminatory.  There is no reason for its <Col N="1706" /> being confined to fathers, and there is certainly no reason for its being confined to children born outside of wedlock. There is a lot of merit in the suggestion that this general provision be considered to deal with all children and affecting both father and mother.</P>
      <P>On that basis I accept that we are getting away from the narrow construction in the Bill and into an area that requires a lot of further consideration, particularly where it could be illustrated to the court that both parents of the deceased child were unworthy.  What then becomes of the assets?  There is a lot more to be done in this.  It requires a separate debate.  For that reason The Workers' Party propose that the amendment be deleted in its entirety and that the Act be left to its better devices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of Deputy Shatter's amendment is to extend the principle of this section to apply to either parent who is shown to be unworthy, not only the father.  It is a cardinal principle in the rules of distribution on intestacy as expressed in the Succession Act of 1966 that they should operate with certainty and with the minimum of recourse to the courts.  This section of the Bill in its present form interferes with that principle to the least extent possible and is likely to apply in only a very small number of cases.  If we were to widen the scope of the section as suggested in this amendment the rules of distribution on intestacy would become much more uncertain in their operation and would be open to serious abuse, for instance, by opportunistic persons threatening proceedings in the expectation of buying off genuine beneficiaries.  It could lead to increased litigation and the wasting of estates by expenditure on legal fees, and I would be opposed to any further extension of the section as it could result in destroying the certainty with which the existing rules operate.  I might point out that the Law Reform Commission considered this matter at paragraphs 324 and 331 of their report and recommended against having any provision of this kind. <Col N="1707" /> Rather than extend the section as proposed in the amendment I would prefer if it were dropped altogether from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 21, lines 23 to 28, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>This section 38 is to do with the declaration of parentage.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a person makes an application for a declaration by virtue of subsection (1) (b) of this section, he shall specify in the application the reasons for seeking the declaration from the Court, and the Court shall refuse to hear or refuse to continue hearing, as the case may be, the application if at any stage it considers that there are no good and proper reasons for seeking the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why this provision is in this section at all.  If someone applies to the court to seek a declaration of parentage, they may simply want to <Col N="1708" /> determine who their parents are.  I do not know on what basis a court can decide one has no good reason for making the application.  I know some of our current Judiciary have some rather odd views about some areas of family law.  Indeed they have some odd views about the position of children born outside wedlock and of their parents.</P>
    <P>I can very well envisage some member of the Judiciary at some stage saying to someone who is seeking a declaration of parentage &ldquo;why are you bothering the court with this?  We have other things to waste our time on rather than this application&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that that is an appropriate way to approach it, but I genuinely do not understand on what basis any judge can decide that someone does not have a good and proper reason for seeking a declaration.</P>
    <P>One comes to court looking for a declaration, one's proofs are in order, one calls one's witnesses, and if there is a dispute as to parentage the court decides the issue.  I may want to determine my parentage for no good reason other than that legally at the moment it has not been determined who my father is, or even more mysteriously, under some of the current medical techniques, it may not even have been determined who my mother is.  I do not understand on what basis any judge could say someone does not have a good reason for making the application.  I do not understand the background or the rationale behind this section, and I would urge that the Minister delete it.  The only good thing is where one has some &mdash; and I emphasise some &mdash; members of the Judiciary who have anachronistic views or old fashioned views about family life and who are not prepared to confront and accept the reality of there being children born outside wedlock who are entitled to equal rights with children born within wedlock, who are entitled to trace their origins and ascertain their parentage.  This is a section which could result in a court remedy that is extended to children by this Act being curtailed due to no reason other than some subjective assessments taken by some members of the Judiciary. <Col N="1709" /> I ask the Minister to accept that this section serves no purpose and to withdraw it to avoid this House having to proceed to oppose it.  It is of no functional use at all.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) taken in conjunction with paragraph (b) of subsection (1) has the effect that persons born outside the State will have to show good and proper reasons why the Irish Circuit Court should consider granting a declaration.  For instance, it is unlikely that an English-born person of English parents, resident all his life in England and having no connection in family business or property with this country, would be able to justify seeking a declaration of parentage in the Irish courts.  A person born abroad of Irish parents who returned home during his youth and whose whole life was Irish based would have little difficulty in showing good and proper reasons for the same course.  The great variety of situations that can arise makes it impossible to set down any list of inclusions and exclusions which would not give rise to injustice in some cases. The court itself can be relied upon to weed out those cases which are jurisdictionally ill-founded.</P>
      <P>If, as proposed by the Deputy, this subsection were removed, it could result in the courts being expected to make declarations of parentage in cases where the only connection with this country was the fact that a declaration was sought here.  It simply does not make sense that the Irish Circuit Court should be asked to make a declaration of parentage in relation to a person who has no connection with Ireland.  The court does have an inherent jurisdiction to dispose of frivolous applications, but subsection (3) of this section does more than confirm this by statute.  It sets down a clear marker for potential applicants and their legal advisers that an application will not be entertained unless some good and proper reason can be adduced for invoking the Irish courts' jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>What this section does is set down a clear marker for eccentric <Col N="1710" /> members of the Judiciary to refuse to entertain parentage applications.  It is only family law practitioners who know that that is the problem because family law cases are heard behind closed doors. That is what this section will mean.  There will be some judges sitting in our courts who will use this section to refuse to entertain parentage applications on the basis that there is no reason for them do do so.  The case which the Minister raises of somebody coming from England to seek a parentage order in our courts while the parents live in England and have no connection with Ireland is fanciful in the extreme.  If that person seeks a parentage order here he is not going to be able to undertake that sort of court proceeding to obtain that result that he is seeking. He will lack the adequate and necessary court proofs.  The court would have an inherent jurisdiction to say that it is not in a position to deal with that.  That is a different matter.</P>
      <P>The absence of proof preventing somebody getting an order or a judge saying that he is not in a position to deal with that because it is a matter under private international law that should be dealt with, say, in England is a different matter from a judge saying that he should not hear the application because there are no good and proper reasons for seeking it. This provision does not say that where a person who resides outside the jurisdiction and has no connection with this jurisdiction seeks a parentage order the courts may decline to hear the case because they do not have adequate proofs on which to reach a determination.  What it says is that a child of 18 or 19 years of age, living in Ireland, who seeks to ascertain a parentage issue can apply to an Irish court.  The judge could ask if he was looking for support payments or for anything from the father and the child might say no, that all he wants is to get a court declaration that that man is his father.  It will be open to a judge to take the view that that was an application made for no good and proper reason and it could be thrown out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section merely lays down legislation which could frustrate the intention <Col N="1711" /> of this Bill.  It provides a mechanism whereby an eccentric member of the Judiciary could, in a wide variety of circumstances, refuse to entertain a parentage application.  It is not suggested that we currently have a problem of all sorts of people from outside Ireland landing here simply to invoke the jurisdiction of our courts to seek all sorts of spurious court orders in a wide variety of other areas.  Why somebody should get it into his head to do that for parentage applications, and uniquely so, escapes me. The Minister is taking logic to extremities in seeking to justify this provision.  It was in the Bill as originally drafted and is not the Minister's fault.  I have no doubt that there was some thinking behind it, but I do not think that that thinking was very bright.  It does not add anything to the Bill, but creates an impediment and difficulty in the operation of the parentage provisions here.  I ask the Minister in the circumstances to withdraw it at this stage and if he has another provision in mind about people using Ireland as some sort of friendly jurisdiction to land in from England, Europe, the United States and everywhere else and to seek spurious parentage applications, we could provide for that on Report Stage.  This measure makes no sense.  It does not achieve anything and could frustrate the intention of the section.</P>

      <P>The issues raised by Deputy Shatter are serious ones.  As he has pointed out, the provision under this section would allow for a judge's discretion in particular situations and some of our judges are notorious for their inconsistency and incredibly colourful decisions.  In legislation under which we are seeking to equalise rights to allow, through an <i>ad hoc</i> interpretation by individual judges, the refusal of one of the most basic rights that we are trying to offer is a fundamental flaw, if the legislation is allowed to proceed as drafted.  I would add my weight to the points made by Deputy Shatter in asking the Minister to accept the amendment on this occasion.  If there is a particular problem <Col N="1712" /> that he is trying to address, perhaps he could find a way of redrafting which may not be so general and so open to undermining many of the entitlements that we are giving here, of which this could be a fundamental element.</P>

I may be corrected by somebody in the House who is better versed in these matters, but it strikes me that in the legislation proposed there are no basic ground rules of jurisdiction laid down as to how a court could determine whether or not it had jurisdiction to deal with these applications.  If that matter were addressed on Report Stage, it might be a means of solving this problem.  I tend towards Deputy Shatter's view that it introduces superfluous legislation because of the inherent jurisdiction of courts to deal with all matters of frivolity. A more substantial matter is the question, not of frivolity but of jurisdiction. How does a court here decide when it has or has not jurisdiction to deal with <Col N="1713" /> applications for declaration of parentage?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32 in the name of Deputy Shatter is a substitute amendment on the additional list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 22, lines 18 to 21, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> Section 39 makes provision for rules of court for parentage applications but it contains a curious provision in subsection (2).  Under section 38 the Attorney General can join in proceedings in which someone is seeking a parentage declaration and he can join in those proceedings of his own volition and on his own motion.  Indeed on the application of any party to the parentage proceedings the court can send papers to the Attorney General to involve him.  Therefore, where a child seeks to have a parentage declaration made he may have as a litigant on the other side of those proceedings the person alleged to be the father of the child.  Also under section 38 it seems that the Attorney General, as he can do under other legislation, may have an interest in getting involved in the proceedings and may appear as a notice party in the proceedings.  This would mean that the Attorney General could go into court and argue legal issues of relevance to the parentage application.  It may very well be that the Attorney General may argue legal issues which are justified and correct and the legal issues which he argues may result in the application being made by the child not succeeding or may result in the application being made by the child succeeding and the father opposing that application not being successful.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that the Attorney General is involved in such proceedings and he wins his point in the court case, whatever that point may be.  If the Attorney General wins his point in the court case, under subsection (2), as drafted, the Attorney General, as he normally can in proceedings, can get an order for costs against the party in respect of whom he has won his point.  Subsection (2) provides that where costs are incurred by the Attorney General in connection with any application for declaration under section 38 of the Act the court may make such an order as it considers just as to the payment of these costs by other parties to the proceedings.  Normally, the court would consider it just that the Attorney General's costs be paid if the Attorney General is on the winning side in a point <Col N="1715" /> made or on a legal point which has to be determined by the court.</P>
    <P>However, there is another possibility. The Attorney General may involve himself in proceedings on a legal issue and may be held by the court to be wrong, legally.  In other words, the Attorney General having been joined as a party to the proceedings could lose on the legal point and having done so he might, by coming involved, have considerably increased the costs of the legal action, caused a court case which might otherwise have been disposed of in one day to continue for two or three days and may have caused a child seeking a parentage application to have to employ more lawyers than would otherwise have been necessary.  Instead of bringing the application with the assistance of a solicitor the child may have had to instruct counsel.</P>
    <P>It would seem that under this section, as drafted, where the Attorney General has been proved to be right in whatever point he has made he can have an order for costs made against the other parties to the proceedings.  If the Attorney General is proved to be wrong and if the other parties to the proceedings incur considerable expense due to the Attorney General getting involved in those proceedings they cannot get an order for costs against the Attorney General.  I can understand why the Attorney General's office, who assist in the drafting of legislation, would be enthusiastic about a Bill which allows the Attorney General solely to get orders for costs and ensures that other litigants cannot get orders for costs against the Attorney General.  I have no doubt that the Attorney General's office would permanently enact legislation in a wide variety of areas if they could get away with it.</P>
    <P>It is a usual rule of litigation that if a litigant is involved in court proceedings and is unsuccessful and causes other people involved in court proceedings to incur additional legal costs because of their involvement, those people can get orders for costs.  I first tabled an amendment to this section seeking to confer general discretion on the court to, where <Col N="1716" /> appropriate, make orders for costs in favour of the Attorney General and where, appropriate, make orders for costs against the Attorney General.  That amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it could impose a charge on the State.  If it cannot be dealt with in that way the only way to deal with it is to delete subsection (2).  That would leave in practical terms the same result because if the Attorney General involved himself in court proceedings the court would retain a general discretion, if that provision was deleted, to make orders for costs in favour of the Attorney General in some instances and against him in others.  At least then we would not be enacting a discriminatory measure which could cause children born outside of marriage to incur unnecessary legal costs due to action taken by the Attorney General and which they could not recover from him.  It would seem that the ordinary laws as they apply to legal costs would exist.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I propose that we delete subsection (2) of section 39 because all it seeks to do is put the Attorney General in a favoured position which is unwarranted and unnecessary and which would ensure that no matter on what spurious reason he involved himself in court proceedings no matter what vexatious point of law he brought up, and which the court wants thrown out, he is permanently immune from orders of costs being made against him.  Incidentally, like a reference I made to an earlier matter on a section the Minister agreed to delete, it could also be unconstitutional and it would seem that the Attorney General in trying to enforce an order for costs made in this manner in such circumstances could find the courts saying that that was an unconstitutional provision because it failed to place litigants in a position of equality and, as in this case, it discriminated against the child born outside of marriage.  It is not a provision we could accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to say that for all of the arguments advanced by the previous speaker, I support the proposal for the deletion of subsection (2) of section 39 as currently drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) enables the court to order the payment of the Attorney General's costs by other parties to the proceedings where this appears to it to be just in the circumstances.  It is unreasonable that where the State incurs costs in connection with the pursuit of a remedy by an individual the court should not have the discretion to charge those costs to the individual concerned or to some other party whose conduct in the proceedings may have given rise to those costs, where the justice of the case demands it.  That is the effect of the Deputy's amendment for that reason I oppose it.  However, in view of the arguments put forward by Deputy Shatter in support of the amendment, I am prepared to look at the matter again between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Minister's point, where it is just, this provision allows orders for costs to be made in favour of the Attorney General but equally where it is just to do so, it does not allow the courts to make orders for costs against the Attorney General.  Those circumstances can equally arise.  The Minister makes a reference to the Attorney General being brought into proceedings by other parties.  The reality is that the Attorney General can independently bring himself into the proceedings if he wishes to do so.  This provision does place, in particular children born outside marriage, in an unfair position, and at a disadvantage in litigation seeking to determine paternity and parentage &mdash; that in a Bill in which we are seeking to encourage children to have such legal remedy or making available such legal remedy when it has not existed heretofore.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is unwilling to withdraw this subsection I would have to say that I intend putting it to a vote, that is, the proposal that the section be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Shatter carefully but I really do not see the need for the purport of his amendment to this section.  I see nothing in the Bill &mdash; as drawn in this section &mdash; which <Col N="1718" /> would preclude a court giving costs against the Attorney General if the Attorney General loses on the issues raised in the case.  It is given out by Deputy Shatter as implicit, arising from the situation, that there is some preclusion there, that the court is in some way debarred from giving costs against the Attorney General if the Attorney General loses.  I do not see any basis for coming to that conclusion &mdash; perhaps it is there &mdash; but I must admit I do not see it.  It seems to be that if the Attorney General becomes a party to proceedings and loses, as in any similar circumstances, it is open to the court and the court could give costs against the Attorney General. Where does it say otherwise in this Bill? The fact that it is to be implicit in Deputy Shatter's amendment does not make it so.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the purpose of section 39 (2) is to clear up some doubt having regard to the fact that the Attorney General was brought into a case, willy nilly, in the course of the proceedings or whatever, to clarify the point that his costs may, in appropriate cases, be provided for by the court.  It seems a fair enough provision to me.  But it is quite clear that, in other circumstances, the normal procedures of the courts would apply.  Even as the section stands it would be perfectly open for the court to give costs against the Attorney General if it was minded to do so under the rules of court,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the Minister having to say that.  It is a standard procedure, under the rules of court, that the courts may give costs to or against the parties to the proceedings in a case before it, as the court thinks appropriate.  There does not have to be a provision in a Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think section 39 (2) adds a great deal.  Under the rules of court &mdash; even without this subsection &mdash; my personal feeling would be that it would be open to the court to give costs to the Attorney General in an appropriate case, I assume &mdash; to clear up any doubts about that &mdash; by reason of the fact that the Attorney General may not have been a voluntary party, that he is brought in in an unusual way, he was not an initial party to the proceedings in a case brought by one party against another; he is brought in in the middle of the situation which is somewhat unusual.  I have not discussed it with the draftsman.  But probably to put the matter beyond any doubt, the Attorney General having been brought in, he clarifies that it would be open to the court to give the Attorney General his costs in an appropriate case. I do not see any necessity for Deputy Shatter's amendment on this issue.  The rules of court and the general principles apply.  It would be perfectly open to a court to give costs against an Attorney General if the court was minded to do so and if the findings warranted that result.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 36 to 39, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `bodily sample' means a sample of bodily fluid or bodily tissue taken for the purpose of scientific tests and includes blood taken for the purpose of such tests;</P>
      <P>`scientific tests' mean any tests carried out under this Part and made with the object of ascertaining inheritable characteristics of blood, bodily fluids or bodily tissue;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled a whole series of amendments to this Part of the Bill.  In effect Part VII provides for blood tests in determining parentage in civil proceedings.  It gives a definition of `blood samples' and `blood test'.  Blood tests, as they were formerly undertaken in paternity or affiliation proceedings, could determine, in certain circumstances, whether it was possible that a person alleged to be the father of a child was its father, whether he came within the blood group that could result in a particular child of a particular blood group being born.  In effect it was a negative thing, in that one could exclude from an allegation of paternity someone as being the father of a child if he fell outside a particular blood grouping but <Col N="1721" /> one could never positively prove or establish that someone was the father of a child in circumstances in which blood tests were used.</P>
    <P>Our law up to now did not make provision for blood tests in this whole area, though they were undertaken on occasion voluntarily by a person alleged to be the father of a child in order to determine the issue of paternity.  This Part of the Bill provides a series of mechanisms to allow for blood testing to take place and for certain consequences to flow if people fail to co-operate in blood tests.</P>
    <P>The amendments that have been tabled seek to extend these provisions. In addition to blood testing, science has now advanced considerably in the means available for determining paternity.  A type of genetic testing or tissue sampling, what is now known as DNA fingerprinting, has become available which can determine, to a very high percentage point of accuracy, whether someone is or is not the father of a child.  It is no longer a question of using conventional blood tests to ascertain whether a person can be excluded.  It is now a question of using genetic fingerprinting to determine specifically whether a person alleged to be the father of a specific child is actually the father of a specific child.  Effectively what used to be known as simple blood testing initially became tissue testing, which involved, in certain instances, the scraping of a skin sample in the context of determining paternity.  We have now advanced to a stage at which what is known as genetic fingerprinting effectively establishes whether someone is or is not the father of a child.  DNA fingerprinting is a new, scientific method which is available in England and will shortly be fully available here; it may even be available here in this area.  DNA fingerprinting, or the genetic fingerprinting test, was discovered and described by Dr. Jeffries, an expert in this area, in the United Kingdom and has now been established as effectively providing a method of scientific testing which can be of tremendous assistance in this area.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Second Stage <Col N="1722" /> debate I referred at length to the need to ensure, under the provisions of this Bill, that DNA fingerprinting, genetic testing, could be used for the determination of paternity.  The provisions we have in this Bill at present with regard to blood samples mirror those that were in English legislation some years ago which have recently been changed by an Act which went through the British Parliament and became law just before the Westminster election.  It sought to replace the conventional blood testing for the taking of what are known as scientific tests and to provide a far wider definition of testing that can be carried out than the blood sample testing provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose that instead of using the terminology &ldquo;blood test&rdquo; we should confer on the courts powers to require that scientific tests be carried out which mean &ldquo;any test carried out under this Part and made with the object of ascertaining the inheritable characteristics&rdquo; of blood, bodily fluids or bodily tissue.  Whereas blood can be used in the carrying out of DNA testing, other tissue from the body can also be taken for the purpose of such tests.  The current provisions we are enacting are far too narrow to extend fully to the carrying out of the type of genetic testing which sophisticated medical science now provides.</P>
    <P>Instead of using the definition &ldquo;blood samples&rdquo; that is in this Bill as originally drafted, I provide a substitute definition of &ldquo;bodily sample&rdquo; which incorporates both a blood sample and other samples. &ldquo;Bodily sample&rdquo; in my amendment means &ldquo;a sample of bodily fluid or bodily tissue taken for the purpose of scientific tests and includes blood taken for the purpose of such tests&rdquo;.  Bodily tissue here can be a skin scraping; it does not have to be blood &mdash; indeed some people have objections to blood tests &mdash; and could still be brought within the ambit of this type of testing.</P>
    <P>If the amendment to section 40 is amended then sections 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46 would require consequential amendments that would have to arise by the use of the concepts of &ldquo;bodily sample&rdquo;<Col N="1723" /> and &ldquo;scientific test&rdquo; instead of the concepts of &ldquo;blood sample&rdquo; and &ldquo;blood test&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has taken us 57 years since the enactment of the Affiliation Orders Act to get round to dealing with this legislation and providing a statutory mechanism for &ldquo;blood test&rdquo;.  In providing a means for determining paternity through scientific methods we should ensure that the statutory measures we are enacting provide for the most advanced use of medical sciences.  Other countries have found it necessary to bring up to date their own legislation which provides for blood samples to deal with modern scientific testing and, in particular, genetic and DNA testing. The amendments I have tabled would make provision in our law similar to the provision the Westminster Parliament found necessary to make in their own legislation which was passed this year.</P>
    <P>The view was expressed at some stage that the blood test referred to here may cover DNA sampling.  I do not believe it does.  If this was put to test in the courts the blood testing as referred to here could be held to be confined to the old type of blood test.  If I am correct in this, then very likely this Bill would fail to provide a proper mechanism to enable paternity to be tested on the basis of the most recent advances in medical science.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendments that have been tabled.  They can only improve the Bill.  Even if the Minister is of the view that the Bill as phrased currently has a similar effect, I invite him nevertheless to accept these amendments.  If the Bill as currently drafted has, in his view, the same effect I see no reason why we cannot copperfasten the position.  If necessary we can go through the various sections in the Bill individually to illustrate the problems. I am certain that because blood tests are referred to in this measure, it is not as broad or wide as the type of scientific testing that can be used in circumstances such as exist now.  It is not necessary to confine it to being a blood test.  Tissue other than blood can be used for the purpose of this test.  In recent <Col N="1724" /> years before the DNA testing became as sophisticated as it is, tissue scraping, scrapings of skin from the hand, were done in the carrying out of less sophisticated tissue testing in this country for the purpose of determining paternity.  In practice these have been extensively used in recent years.  This Bill as currently drafted would not provide even for those tests.  The wider definition provided here would incorporate all of them and would ensure that we do not have to bring this legislation back in the House in the not too distant future to catch up with advances in medical science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the definition as contained in the Bill as it stands.  If one takes blood samples and blood tests as they are defined there together, what is in the Bill is clearly designed to deal with the old, traditional form of testing, namely, the use of blood. &ldquo;Blood sample&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;blood taken for the purpose of blood tests&rdquo; and it goes on to define blood testing.  On Second Stage of this Bill the Minister indicated his view that the definition of &ldquo;blood test&rdquo; there means any test carried out and he believed that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; would cover all the various scientific developments such as tissue testing, DNA and finger printing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about that.  Blood samples are clearly confined to blood only and to blood in the context of blood testing. We must come to the firm conclusion that the likely construction any court would give to that provision and those definitions is the old tradition of blood-based testing.  It is crucial that the court has the power to order the widest possible scientific testing available, and the DNA, tissue testing and fingerprinting processes are far more exact and serviceable than blood ever could be.  The DNA can be based upon any form of bodily excretion. It does not have to be confined to tissue or blood.  It can be based on semen or perspiration.  The courts should be in a position to call upon the widest, most effective, most positive, up-to-date modern scientific basis for arriving at a decision which in the use of DNA is based <Col N="1725" /> on certitude, whereas in blood it is based upon an exclusionary basis of non-possibility. For that reason we should not waste as much time on the proposals here as their length and extent seem to warrant. The issue is clear.  To borrow Deputy Shatter's word, the Minister should copperfasten any difficulties that might arise in the subsequent determination of these features.  I ask him to take these amendments on board and let it through on the nod.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments raised by Deputy Shatter and Deputy McCartan are correct.  The definition of &ldquo;blood samples&rdquo; in section 40 could be amended to include tissue samples and blood test. It is not sufficient to rely on the wide definition given to &ldquo;blood test&rdquo;.  Throughout that part of the Bill &ldquo;blood sample&rdquo; is given significance and all the evidential and other implications come from &ldquo;blood sample&rdquo;.  As Deputy Shatter pointed out, &ldquo;blood sample&rdquo; can refer only to blood and not to any tissue test.  By a simple change of the defintion of &ldquo;blood sample&rdquo; and &ldquo;blood test&rdquo; it would be possible to give an inclusive meaning which included tissue and tissue test.  It would permit, without all the necessary amendments that Deputy Shatter is arguing for, the same result to be achieved.  I do not see why that should not be conceded.</P>

Now that we are bringing in the Bill on this issue we should have it in drafted form based on the most up-to-date scientific information available.  As it stands at present we will be somewhat out-of-date from the scientific point of view before the Bill enters the Statute Book at all.  We have an opportunity now to have this as a most up-to-date measure. We should take advantage of that situation and ensure that we have an Act which takes cognisance of all the most recent scientific and evidential benefits on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various tests which may be carried out on blood with the object of ascertaining inheritable characteristics.  Those currently available include blood grouping tests on the red blood cells such as the classification on the ABO and Rhesus positive/negative systems as used by the Blood Transfusion Service and tissue typing on the white blood cells based on immune reaction to foreign cells.  Another test likely to be used more and more frequently now is DNA profiling, which compares the genetic material of cells including blood cells.</P>
      <P>The blood sampling and testing provisions in this Bill were criticised during Second Stage by Deputy Shatter as not reflecting modern technology.  Under this part of the Bill a court can direct the taking of samples of blood under pain of having adverse inferences drawn against any person who fails to comply with the direction.  This can be a significant sanction, although admittedly not of a penal nature.  The taking of a blood sample is to some extent an infringement of one's bodily integrity, but it is an infringement which most people willingly undergo for various purposes.  I have no intention, however, of proposing legislation to this House which would empower a court to direct the taking from a person of samples of skin or other organs of the body, or of bodily fluids other than blood, under pain of adverse inference being drawn against him.  I have been advised that tests on blood groups, tissue typing and DNA profiling or fingerprinting are all capable of being carried out with complete success on blood cells.  They constitute tests carried out for the purposes of ascertaining inheritable characteristics and, as such, are quite clearly contemplated by the provisions of Part VII of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that DNA analysis can be carried out using cells from other fluids and tissues of the body.  It is, I suppose, <Col N="1727" /> remotely possible that in some cases such substances, rather than a sample of blood, might be made available.  It is open to a court to hear evidence of tests on such tissues or fluids in the normal way. The provisions of this Part do not preclude the hearing of such evidence, but for a court to be able to direct the taking of samples from a person's body of anything other than blood, particularly when a blood sample is perfectly adequate for the purposes of determining parcentage, would in my view be going too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's response.  The whole point, advantage, development and achievement of DNA fingerprinting, as it is called, is that it is the one test which gives you certitude.  It puts beyond all doubt the issue of heritage and for that reason it should be accommodated and advanced as much as possible in our legislation particularly in legislation dealing with controversy as to the parentage of a particular child.  The sanction as the Minister calls it, of the adverse inference can often leave so much acrimony and so much unanswered questioning in these type of proceedings that where that type of provision can be got away from all the better. Many times, because a person can make legitimate objection to the giving of blood he then leaves himself or herself open to an adverse inference being drawn.  That is unsatisfactory and second best.  Our legislation should work for the better.</P>
      <P>There are parallels in it.  I do not want to reduce this debate to the murky confines of the toilet but in road traffic legislation where the blood sample is not immediately forthcoming an option is given to the suspected offender to provide another form of sample.  I am not suggesting that that is what we are advocating here but obtaining even hand perspiration I understand is sufficient, to enable testing on a DNA level.  The very simple process which allows for taking a fingerprint in the normal course of events, aided by powder, can be sufficient with proper technology and proper testing to give a DNA reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> The Minister is suggesting that to go beyond the taking of blood, which involves the insertion of a pointed needle into the arm or other portion of the person, from whom a sample is to be taken, is for some reason an acceptable invasion of that person's bodily integrity whereas, for example, the very simple scraping of the outer tissue level of a finger or a portion of the arm is some greater invasion of the bodily integrity of the person.  That is not putting the matter into proper perspective.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister think a little bit more carefully about this?  There may well be instances where a person can very legitimately not be prepared to volunteer a blood sample, I do not want to go into all the realms of that now.  At the same time we want to end up with the certainty of a conclusion that is far better in the interests of a child seeking definite information through the courts on parentage. We should work towards a scheme which allows for the absolute certainty that DNA will provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately withheld making any comment in support of this amendment because I was anxious to hear what the Minister had to say and because I felt that the logic and the support from all sides of the House was such that the response could be nothing but positive.  I cannot understand why, when we have an opportunity to update and make much more substantial and much more specific, the scientific advances made in this area, particularly in an area where it is open to such contradiction or question, that the Minister is not prepared to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point Deputy McCartan made that evidently the Minister believes it is more acceptable to draw blood than to take a tissue sample.  That does not make sense.  If we confine ourselves to that specific and ask the court to allow itself to make further demands in this area it could lead to questioning about going beyond the bounds of this Bill.  In relation to section 46, where we have the penalty for personation for blood test <Col N="1729" /> purposes, if we confine this to blood testing purposes there could be far greater occasion to attempt personation in that one area than if we have the more specific and scientific logical amendment which is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate I have only a minute or two left but I would like to say to Deputy McCartan in particular that DNA profiling is carried out on blood and the taking of blood samples is contemplated in this section.  DNA profiling does not work on secretions such as urine or perspiration.  It requires cells of the body which contain chromosomal information in order to operate effectively. We are not just talking about law on its own, we are talking about biological facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had just commenced speaking when the House adjourned last week and I want to repeat for the record that I favour the abolition of pensions for serving Dáil Members.  However, a much wider question has to be addressed.  If the present system of payments for Members of the Oireachtas, especially those with long service, is terminated, then the whole area of parliamentary allowances must be examined in tandem.  This is the weakness of the proposal put forward by the Progressive Democrats who, in my view, have addressed one question without addressing the other.  For that reason I strongly suspect their motives in bringing this Bill forward and I believe that is a reasonable suspicion to express.  The Progressive Democrats want the abolition of the Seanad.  They have doubts about the need for a President and want to reduce the number of TDs.  This is a useful subject for debate but it has to be considered with the other proposals they are putting forward.</P>
      <P>The most common complaint I receive from my constituents at election time is that they do not see me often enough, despite the fact that I am supposed to have the reputation in this House of spending more time in my constituency than the average TD.  I admit that I spend a lot of time in my constituency but I also find a lot of time to spend in this House. I wonder if it is in the best interests of democracy to go along the line suggested by the Progressive Democrats.  If we do, it could happen that 51 Members could elect a dictator.  I am very anxious that we do not undermine our parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of running the Parliament &mdash; the Dáil, the Seanad, staff and pensions &mdash; in 1987 will be £13 million.  This contrasts favourably with the expenditure for the Department of Health, £1,169 million, the Department of Social Welfare, £1,560 million, the Department of <Col N="1731" /> Defence, £301 million, the Department of Education, £1,100 million and the Department of the Environment, £865 million.  Exactly how much is the abolition of these so called pensions to save the State?  The reality is that it will cost the State and it is important that this be outlined in this House.  If these pensions are abolished TDs would have to be properly remunerated.  Many of us run our parliamentary careers like the self-employed with a turnover of approximately £20,000 a year, taking into account all allowances and income.  Out of this £20,000 we have to pay for our cars, the use of our home telephones for parliamentary and public purposes, internal travel in our consitituency and many other things.  None of us is paid extra money to take on additional responsibility whether it be front bench responsibility or the chairmanship of a committee.  This would not be tolerated anywhere in the public or private service.</P>
    <P>Let us abolish these pensions, but let us reward people for service, for being spokesmen, for chairmanships and so on. Let us be consistent with what is being done elsewhere in the public service.  It should not be said on the one hand that we should not be treated differently from members of the public service, and then treated differently.  If we abolish pensions we will have to address both sides of the equation.</P>
    <P>Many of the most vociferous critics of Parliament never have anything to say about other institutions.  One of those institutions, the Judiciary, which in my view is grossly in need of reform, has been the subject of defensive action by Members of this House on many occasions.  In a democracy it is only right that Parliament should be open to criticism but is it necessary for Members to promote their own interests by abusing this right and attempting to make a virtue out of it?  There are, in this Parliament, representatives of doubtful democratic origin and it seems that the Progressive Democrats are increasingly competing <Col N="1732" /> with these people for that strange segment of the people who do not see the need for a Parliament.</P>
    <P>Our people need to be reminded of the fact that this is one of only 15 parliamentary democracies left.  Until very recently many Members would have put Fiji on that list.  In my view the existence of this House, of Seanad Éireann, of the Presidency, of Members with long service and also of new Members is something to be cherished.  A democracy has to be paid for and if we look at the Estimates we will find that the amount allocated to the Houses of the Oireachtas is miniscule when compared with other Departments. I believe we get good value for the money spent.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is need for reform in this House, but not necessarily when compared with other Parliaments.  Let us look at the House of Commons with 660 Members and the House of Lords with 2,000 plus members and the village squire system.  Is it being said that Members of the British Parliament work harder than we do?  Where is the better Parliament with which people are comparing us? Members of the House of Commons get better remuneration than TDs, they have better pensions and they work shorter hours.  Most of them do not start work until the afternoon because of commitments in the City.  That is not so in this House.</P>
    <P>With what parliament are we comparing ourselves?  People constantly tell us we should not spend so much time on constituency business and perhaps they are right, but the fact is &mdash; and I have checked this with Members of other Legislatures &mdash; they all get social welfare queries.  In the House of Commons Members representing marginal constituencies, highly paid Members of the Tory Administration, have computers in their offices so that they can get in touch directly with the computer file in the Department.  In places like America, Senators send birthday cards to their constituents.</P>

      <P>Maybe Christmas cards.  Is that the system people want introduced here?  Before we run down this House we should know what we are comparing it with.  It is fair to ask which parliament in the world pays its members less than the Members of our Parliament. In which parliament in the world is service less recognised than here?</P>
      <P>It may be the case that because of the multiseat constituencies there is too much competition but competition is the spice of life.  In my view there is a lot wrong with the way our democratic institutions work but more than Parliament is involved.  Parliament has to be corrected because of what we see as the need for reform of the Irish system.  Were I a Member of Parliament in Britain I would want to reform the British House of Commons and were I Member of a parliament in other countries I would want to reform the way they do their business.  I am not saying we need to be reformed <i>vis-à-vis</i> other states but <i>vis-à-vis</i> the needs of our people.  If we want a reformed and active Parliament, the Members of that Parliament are entitled to be paid.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to make any personal remarks about any Member who contributed to the debate but I must point to the reason Deputy Geraldine Kennedy gave as the reason the Progressive Democrats brought forward this Bill, the fact that they had promised such legislation during the election campaign.  They also promised a 25 per cent tax rate during the election and, therefore, I expect that when the Finance Bill is introduced we will see their proposals on that promise.  I believe we should abolish these pensions until retirement or until a Member leaves the Oireachtas but in its place we should have proper pay and facilities, proper increments for Members, proper research facilities, severance pay like any other workers in industry get when they are made redundant and a qualification for redundancy benefits where appropriate. It is reasonable to look for such a package.  We cannot look at one side of the equation only; we must address the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House were awarded <Col N="1734" /> a 15 per cent interim increase because the independent arbitrator felt we were underpaid.  I am not suggesting we should take that increase because pay restraint is essential in these difficult times but we must address the whole question of pay of Members of the Oireachtas so that those who have given up lucrative businesses, lucrative practices or who cut off their opportunity for advancing their careers outside the House, or Members who are married with young families and big mortgages, are remunerated at a reasonable level taking into consideration their responsibilities.  They should not have to stand up and justify their pay as no other public servant is expected to do.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that some Members say that we should not be treated differently at all but yet go about making sure that we are treated differently to other public servants by requiring Members to justify their pay.  I support the view that the whole matter should be sent to a review commission who should be asked to report before budget day.  We should not miss this opportunity to send the entire question to such a commission because I have no doubt that Parliament would benefit and, consequently, the people.  We should not take one aspect in isolation because that is not in anybody's interests.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the debate has generated more heat than light and that is to be deplored because it presented a good opportunity for Deputies on both sides to make a worth-while contribution on the issue.  I will be objective and dispassionate in my remarks because I am well aware of the sacrifices Members have to make in terms of time, money and hard work to become a Dáil Deputy.  My chances of becoming a Minister are fairly remote and, sadly, I do not see much prospect of a socialist Government here in my lifetime.  I wish it were otherwise.  In that sense I can speak objectively on this issue, although I should add that if the other proposal of the Progressive Democrats, to reduce the number of Dáil Deputies was carried my <Col N="1735" /> chances of getting a pension as a Member would be somewhat diminished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third time to be elected to the Dáil and in those three terms I have hardly served two years. The prospect of not getting a ministerial or Deputy's pension does not frighten me because at 51 years of age I have managed to keep myself without any pension and I am confident I am resourceful enough to do so for the rest of my days.</P>
      <P>Some of the remarks made during the course of the debate were bitter, personal and too narrow.  I am not a Matt Talbot type of politician in that I do not believe that people should have to live on herring soup or have to sleep on railway sleepers. I do not think a person is a better individual for doing that and I do not see that that has much to offer to anybody in the modern world.  I do not think politicians should go around wearing sackcloth and ashes as if they have something to apologise for or to be ashamed of.  To be a public representative is an honourable calling and we should be paid accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that we are living in a time of national economic crisis and as public representatives we have a responsibility to account for our stewardship. We may think we are removed somewhat from the people but they watch us carefully and this debate is no exception.  The people will watch how we divide on this issue.  At a time of massive unemployment, emigration and widespread poverty it is important that we should set an example and a headline.  It is important that we are not divorced from the people.  I listened carefully to the contribution of a former Minister, Deputy Cooney, in his defence of the ministerial pension being retained by a serving Deputy but I was not too impressed by his arguments.  He made the point that a Deputy's salary is not that impressive and that a Minister might make commercial contacts during his <Col N="1736" /> term of office to be used when he ceases to be a Minister.  I do not think that is a good argument; there is nothing logical about it.  In my view it is a spurious case because if a person is that way inclined, in or out of office, I would not have much hope for him.</P>
    <P>Ministers who lose office are not destitute because they have their Deputy's salary and they should not be treated any better, or worse, than other Members. Most of those elected to this House are resourceful people.  In some cases they have pulled themselves up by their boot straps and some of them have unusual backgrounds that I will not go into now. I would not have any great sympathy for them or shed tears for them.  I am sure many of them would be able to survive on their Deputy's salary.</P>
    <P>The figure involved, £120 per week or £6,000 per year, is a fairly small amount in the overall context and it may not be very much for Dáil Deputies but we must not forget that some CIE workers after 40 years service received about £15 per week pension up to recently.  I am sure Deputy Carey will endorse that.  It is only recently that those workers got an improvement on that position.  Many people who work for 40 years do not get any pension and we must keep that in mind when discussing this issue.  We must set an example.  We cannot complain about abuses throughout the country, as we do on a daily basis in the House, without cutting out our own abuses.</P>
    <P>One difficulty I have about the Bill is that there is selective morality involved in it.  While abuses should be rooted out, we should not start with this one.  There are other abuses of public and private money and we should go after them. There are many abuses of the tax system. Lester Piggott got three years last week for tax evasion but I wonder how he would have fared here if he had been found guilty of a similar charge.  I have not heard of anybody here going to prison for three years for tax evasion although tax evasion takes place here on the same scale as in Britain.  We should also consider the morality of low wages.  The hotel industry and cleaning firms are notorious <Col N="1737" /> for paying low wages.  I do not see many Bills coming before the House asking for minimum wages.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to what the <i>Phoenix</i> magazine calls the &ldquo;Lazarus League&rdquo;, people who go out of business today and open up again tomorrow although sometimes they owe £750,000 to small suppliers who are then put out of business.  That sort of morality cannot be defended and the sooner we have legislation to stop those kind of abuses the better.  I hope we can bring legislation before this House which will cut out abuses of public money.</P>
    <P>For the past six months the Government have been saying, loudly and repeatedly, that we are all paying ourselves too much and that that has been the case for a long time.  This Bill is one way of demonstrating how honest and effective the Government are.  There is no point in the Taoiseach and his Ministers saying we are paying ourselves too much if they do not do anything about it.  It is important that they set a small headline in this respect and it will be a good day for the country if the Bill is passed.  It will be seen as a good, albeit a small, start in the long haul of trying to eliminate abuses, malpractices and waste of public money.  I will vote in favour of the Bill.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kemmy spoke about selective morality &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; but selective morality is little better than no morality. As he said, let this be the first step in the direction of more comprehensive morality where matters of paying ourselves and other people with taxpayers' money is concerned.  I will remind the House that when the Progressive Democrats were formed nearly two years ago it was mainly as a response to the fact that the country <Col N="1738" /> at that time was on the verge of bankruptcy. We had in Government a group of people who, while analysing the situation every day, failed to take any action to correct it.  Money which should have been invested for the future of the country was flowing out from the infamous &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;.  No action of any kind was taken.  There was a group of people on the Opposition benches who failed lamentably to fill the role of a constructive Opposition.  They continued to advocate measures which would have made a bad situation infinitely worse.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for our being here in the House tonight is the reaction among ordinary people in every county who said to people like Deputy Des O'Malley and Deputy Harney and others who were in Fianna Fáil at the time &mdash;&ldquo;For God's sake, will you break ranks, get up and do something to bring the country back from the brink of bankruptcy.&rdquo;  They wanted a return to solvency and sanity.  I am glad the call was answered and a new party was formed.  Because of their policy and the promise made by them during the course of the election campaign, the PDs brought this Bill before the House very early in the existence of their party.</P>
    <P>Nothing has moved me more than the generous response made at the outset of the discussion on this Bill by Deputy Desmond O'Malley, our leader, and by Deputy Molloy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an opinion with which I do not agree.  When I talk about Deputy Des O'Malley and Deputy Molloy I am not talking about a member of the Ford Corporation or Chrysler in America.  I am talking about ordinary people with ordinary family commitments and very ordinary incomes.  It takes a lot of guts and courage for a man to go home to his wife and children &mdash; who are at a most expensive stage of their education &mdash; and to tell her that he is sorry he will have £8,000 less next year to buy food, clothes and shoes.  That takes a lot of commitment.  I am very happy <Col N="1739" /> to be sitting behind such people at this important juncture in our history.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said and a good deal left unsaid in relation to this Bill. As politicians, we owe it to ourselves to accept this Bill.  We owe it to the reputation of this House.  Since the foundation of the State there has not been a time when politicians and politics were viewed with such cynicism as at this time. It is up to politicians to put that right as nobody else can do it.  We can do this by supporting this Bill and nobody else can do it for us.  As a new Member it is not my ambition to analyse the reasons for the cynicism; suffice it to say that it exists and it must be killed.  If we do nothing else except that, we will have done a good turn for the reputation of the House and of politics in general.</P>
      <P>I caught the tail-end of what Deputy Gay Mitchell said, that this is a miniscule kind of saving, that nothing very important would accrue and, because of that, he did not think it worth while to pursue the debate in any kind of constructive way.  That is very regrettable because Deputy Kemmy was right when he said it is the first step.  It is a very significant first step.  It will be seen by the public as a first step and the measure of support we get for the Bill will determine in the eyes of the public how serious we are about that first step.  It will also encourage the PDs to bring in a series of other measures which will cause us to move in the same direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not just how it will reflect on the Exchequer or the economy but how it will reflect on ourselves and our standing among the public whom we voluntarily elected to serve.  We must not forget that any working person in receipt of a salary ought not at the same time to be drawing a pension.  It is as simple as that.  All the arguments in the world should not take from that simple truth which the public perceive, that a person who is working and in receipt of a salary should not also be in receipt of a pension. We plan for pensions which will keep us at the end of an active life.  That is the way it ought to be at every level but <Col N="1740" /> that principle must be established and the leadership must come from the House.</P>
    <P>As for saying it would not make a major difference to the Exchequer, I would not dismiss the difference it might make.  After all, the money for this pension is paid for by the taxpayers and if a referendum was carried out among them asking if they could think of a better use for that money I have no doubt that with one voice they could all think of a better use to which the money could be put.</P>
    <P>Many of them could point to the fact that this money would be better used for developing better services for the elderly who have suffered so badly from recent cutbacks.  Many would say they would prefer to spend the money in developing some kind of proper care for the homeless children who are now haunting the streets of our cities.  Others would like to pursue a more independent course as citizens would probably say: &ldquo;Give this money to the Office of the Ombudsman and retain his budget at last year's level because we want to be free to pursue our grievances in our own way so that we will not have to go like gombeen men and women to the doors of politicians&rdquo;.  They might say: &ldquo;Give that money to the National Social Service Board to enable them to retain the level of services that they have retained since their inception.&rdquo;  Those are some of the many ussues to which the taxpayers' money could be put.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a great deal more but other speakers wish to contribute and I do not want to take up their time. During the course of the debate on this Bill I have been saddened on many occasions, especially by the fact that the Government party who are doing an extremely good PR job for all their own measures have failed to put in anything more than the most minimal appearance in the House during the discussion on this Bill.  To date only one speaker from the Government has contributed and that was the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, who made a very trite, routine kind of speech on the matter.  That is some leadership from a Government who are doling out to every sector of the community all sorts of cutbacks and <Col N="1741" /> measures to save money.  It is sad that they will not even face the discussion that has ensued from the tabling of this Bill. They will not even come in to hear what we have to say.  That is exceptionally sad and the loss is theirs.</P>
    <P>As for the manner in which the Fine Gael Party have approached this Bill, I can only say that this House must have hit rock bottom, culminating with the speech of Deputy Fitzpatrick last week when clearly his attitude to the whole business was that women in this House ought to take less by way of salary or other benefit than the male Members of the House.  The following day during the course of a radio programme when he was questioned on the matter &mdash; whether or not it was in an effort to explain the matter I do not know but he certainly succeeded in compounding the insult &mdash; his belief that certain people should be paid less than others was extended to people without children, whether they are male or female &mdash; as he put it, people without chick or child.</P>
    <P>Later during the course of the same discussion, in which I took part, he seemed to indicate that what he really wanted to say was that those of us who are new in the House should be paid less than those who are hanging around the House for a very long time and whose thinking has been decidedly stale.  That was his line of argument and a great number of people in the community were exceptionally upset by it, as was I.</P>
    <P>During the course of the weekend I waited in vain for the Leader of the Fine Gael Party to make a statement on the matter and to distance himself publicly from the utterances of Deputy Fitzpatrick but this he did not do.  By not doing so I can only conclude that this is now official Fine Gael policy, nouveau Fine Gael, post-Garret FitzGerald, policy.  Maybe they think women should not be in the House at all, perhaps that is what they are trying to say.  I have to say to them that this, taken in conjunction with the general level of the debate by them on this Bill, marks them out as people who are thinking in terms of a country that existed at least 50 years <Col N="1742" /> ago.  It is very sad for all the people of Ireland that we have a major party in this House whose thinking is so out of date and so out of touch with the reality of the times in which we live.  It is with sadness that I say that it reminds me of the way the Bourbons of France carried on long after the revolution was over or the Stuarts of Scotland or England.  It was said of Charles II that he never forgot anything and he never learned anything either.  It is very sad that major parties in this House are not prepared to come to terms with the reality of the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>While listening to some of the opinions that came from the Synod of Bishops in Rome this week one got the impression that they were a group of subversives having the underground meeting compared with what has been said by some of the people in this House during the course of the discussion on this Bill. However, I would say to the two major parties in this House that all is not yet lost.  There is an opportunity this evening for both parties to redeem their honour and they can do so by supporting our Bill. They will do more for their reputation and for the reputation of the House by doing so than by making utterances on other issues and they will not regret it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill which I regard as a fundamentally important measure.  It puts Deputies in this House under a spotlight and is forcing us to face up to the perceptions of the public as to how we organise ourselves and conduct our affairs in this House.  This Bill is the first of a series of reforming measures which my party intend to introduce in this House.  Politicians of all parties are often heard lecturing on how they want things changed.  The main point of this Bill is that we cannot lecture others about such matters if we are not prepared to take the first reforming steps ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Members of this House, on previous nights when this Bill was being debated, have tried to heap scorn on this measure and indeed Deputy Quill has referred to this in her contribution.  I <Col N="1743" /> resent the accusations made by Deputies Cooney and Fitzpatrick in their contributions last week when they variously described us as being opportunistic and said we were indulging in political gimmickry by introducing this measure. Deputy Fitzpatrick, as Deputy Quill has said, went on to make what can only be described as unworthy remarks about members of my party and I can only presume he did so to divert attention from the real issue which is that we must reform ourselves and ensure that the public whom we serve get better value for the money they spend on us in running the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is worth noting in passing that both Deputy Cooney and Deputy Fitzpatrick are former office holders and as such would be directly affected by the outcome of this Bill if it were passed.  It seems that fact more than anything else might account for the stance they have adopted in relation to it.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said in this debate, in purely money terms this Bill could be described as being quite insignificant in that if it were passed it would mean a saving of less than £300,000 to the Exchequer.  That is not an inconsiderable sum when one considers the savings that the National Social Services Board and the office of the Ombudsman are being required to make.  The Bill had far wider implications than the amount of money which would be saved.  As I said earlier, it has more to do with restoring confidence on the part of the public in the way we politicians conduct our affairs.</P>
    <P>No-one can deny that there is an anomaly when people who are in receipt of a salary for specific work are also drawing a pension for that work.  That is an anomaly which undoubtedly needs to be rectified.  We cannot continue to decry abuses of the social welfare system and continue to condemn those who operate in the black economy on the one hand, if we do not rectify this anomaly and put our own house in order first.  Last week, the Dáil spent four days debating the 1988 Estimates involving cuts in public expenditure of the order of £485 million <Col N="1744" /> which we agree are generally necessary in the interests of sorting out the public finances.  But in making these cuts in public expenditure many very necessary services have had to be curtailed, witness indeed the effects of these cuts on the education budget, on the National Social Service Board and on the Ombudsman's office.  It behoves us in that context to look at ourselves as legislators and ask ourselves are we practising what we preach and is the public getting full value for the money they pay us to represent them.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill, as I have said already, is to rectify an anomaly.  A pension, by definition, is a payment somebody receives on retirement. There are many people in this House who are far from retirement age and who are in receipt of this pension.  It is a weird practice.  It was established by a committee going back approximately 50 years.  It is time that system now came into the modern age because it does not apply anywhere else.  It is an anomaly that has to be rectified.</P>
    <P>I note that when the Minister for Finance was making his contribution to this debate he said that the pensions payable to former office holders were not a matter in which the recipients should be seen to be the arbitrators.  The recipients and every Deputy in this House must have a say in this matter by their votes.  It is the people who will be the final arbiters on this matter when they are asked to adjudicate on it in due course.  I can see some merit in the argument that has been put forward by speakers on other occasions on this Bill that a new pay structure other than the present one is needed for Members of the House which takes into account the length of service people have given.  There is in fact another anomaly here where back benchers who have served, say, for 20 years and never held ministerial office get the same pay as someone who has only been newly elected to the Dáil.  Of course, they get a lot less pay than others of their colleagues who are now on the back benches but were fortunate enough at some stage to hold ministerial office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> I would say, however, that any proposal to change the pay structure must be in the context of a package of other reforms relating to this House and the way in which it operates.  A new pay structure should not give rise to a net increase in expenditure by the Paymaster General for the overall Oireachtas salaries and expenses.  If that were the case, the only way in which it could be achieved would be to reduce the number of TDs, pay them a better salary and tax them on an equal basis with every other worker in the State.</P>

      <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, felt that the salaries of TDs should be sufficient to attract professional and business people into the Dáil, and I do not disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Carey is a businessman and I am delighted that he was attracted into the Dáil.  I do not disagree with what Deputy Mitchell was saying in that respect.  He said also that of the 14 Progressive Democrat TDs none of us was a businessman. I would like to assure him that indeed several of us are, including myself.  I would also say that it was not the salary that attracted us in here but the principles on which this party was founded, particularly principles such as the reforms we have advocated in this House on former occasions, and one of which we are debating here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the real world outside many workers have to face redundancies because of financial constraints.  I do not see why this House should escape the compulsory redundancies that are being imposed on others in the private and public sectors. The membership of the Dáil is too large. At present the Constitution allows for between 20,000 and 30,000 per Deputy. The lower ratio, the 20,000, is always used and that gives rise to the present high number of Deputies we have in this <Col N="1746" /> House, a total of 166.  That situation could quite easily be changed.  It does not need a referendum to alter that.  The Government could arrange for the higher ratio to be used; the net result of that would be that we would have a reduction of Deputies in this House of the order of 40.  At the moment we seem to have about four to five times more representation than in the UK and that seems to apply as well to many other international fora such as this.</P>
    <P>The public would welcome such a reduction because the present size distracts from our main role as legislators and encourages clientelism and the messenger boy approach to the work we do in our constituencies.  In my own constituency &mdash; and I am sure it is the same in every other constituency &mdash; the system is that one is forced to compete for votes on the basis of favours done for constituents which are probably their right anyway.  It would be much more appropriate that we Deputies would devote our time to our main role as legislators and get our votes based on policies.  Speaking as a Deputy in what could be described as a marginal seat, I have no hesitation in advocating a reduction in the number of seats in my constituency for the reasons I have already outlined.  In my opinion a reduction in the number of TDs, apart from saving money for the Exchequer and enabling the introduction of a better pay structure and a realistic pension scheme, would depoliticise the whole practice of getting people something that is their right in the first place; the messenger boys would be made redundant.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to rectify a glaring anomaly where people in receipt of salaries from the same employer are getting a pension at the same time.  It is also the forerunner to a number of other reforming issues that my party intend to introduce in this House.  Two of my colleagues have already set an example in the matter of their pension entitlements. It is up to each Deputy in this House to consider fully the implications of this Bill before deciding which way to vote.  I would urge them to support <Col N="1747" /> this Bill by the vote they take here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just reflecting on the empty seats around this House this evening and thinking that we do not so much face a grand Coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Deputies on this issue as a grand Coalition of mahogany and leather.  It is the empty seats in this House that are the most notable feature in this debate.  We were listening to a debate on the status of children and the urban trendy brigade of one of the political parties of this grand coalition were here in numbers but as soon as this issue arose they departed.  Why is that?  Why is there this total difference in attitude towards attendance at debates in this House when an issue of this importance comes before the House to be decided and debated on? Why, suddenly, did a group of Deputies who were anxious to participate in debate on a social issue, on an issue in which perhaps there are good headlines to be made, suddenly flee the House and leave it to the mahogany and leather to speak for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not including me in that.  The Deputy was very much absent last week when the Estimates were being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Rough deal would probably sum the Deputy up.  But, with respect, the reality is that this debate has been boycotted not out of any sense of principle but by reason of shame, by those who know they have been sent in here to defend the indefensible and have made a very poor job of it on occasion. It has been boycotted by those who do not even want to hear the indefensible being defended in their name.  It is being boycotted by those who are in receipt of these pensions and by those who hope one day to receive these pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has this boycott been imposed?  It was done to try to minimise this debate, to try to reduce its importance in the eyes of the public, to do it dishonour so that the media would in turn regard the matter <Col N="1748" /> as of no consequence.  But those tactics have fallen flat on their face on two counts, first because the people of this country do regard this as an important issue, and second because we will not permit the empty benches to run this debate into the ground.  We will not permit people to absent themselves from reality to absent themselves from discussing an issue on which people feel so strongly, and to absent themselves from the judgment of the people in the last analysis.  I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle that this is not the end of this Bill. It will be brought back again and again to haunt those people who know that it is a correct measure.  We will not sit down and walk away from this measure if neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil support us here tonight and if the Bill is defeated. We will not decide that that is the end of the matter and move on to some other topic.  We will bring this Bill back as soon as the provisions of this House and the Standing Orders of this House render it proper to do so, and we will wrap this measure around the thick and brass necks of those Deputies in this House who feel that by ignoring it it will go away.  It will not go away; it will remain centre stage in this House, in the media and at the next election.  We will not let the issue die.  We were sent here with a strong mandate to bring this measure before the House and we will ensure that that mandate is not eroded by the passage of time or by the movement of history or events in the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The present system was defended by the Minister for Finance in a most unmoving speech, if I may say so, by reference to a report which was made 50 years ago by the Shanley Committee.  No good reason was offered as to why 50 years later the people of Ireland, who resent bitterly this improper use of public funds, are wrong and the Shanley Committee still should hold sway over our affairs.  The curious thing about the contribution of the Minister for Finance to this debate was that it was virtually identical with that offered by his predecessor when this Bill was first brought before the House.  At that stage, because the <Col N="1749" /> Progressive Democrats had not enough members to see it through, it was thought safe by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael not to oppose it.  Once we have the Members, once we have the clout in parliamentary terms to bring this measure before the House and force the issue, then we realise where these people stand who were all sweetness and light on the first occasion, who said that they had no opposition to offer to the Bill and that it should be read a Second Time.  When it comes near to becoming legislation and their votes really do count, we realise where they stand.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael last year could posture as parties which did not oppose the measure.  This year we see them for what they really are.  The ideological teeth they bare on occasions turn out to be dentures removed at night time for comfort.  I suggest we are now seeing them for the flabby frauds they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Forced to decide how they are going to cast their vote, now we see where they stand on the issue.  Last year, when the Progressive Democrats could not put the matter to a vote, when we had no entitlement to Private Members' time and had five Deputies, they said that there was nothing wrong with the Bill and that they would offer no opposition to its setting a first reading. That is hypocrisy.  It stinks and the people of Ireland know just how badly it stinks. They know how much nonsense has been gone into in posturing on the issue last year and changing that posture this year. We will never let this issue rest.  Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will find we will keep coming back to the issue, putting it in front of them very much like a child who will not eat its meal.  It will come back the next morning cold, and will be all the more unpalatable the second time, and coming towards the next election it will be all the more damaging.  As that time appears, we as a party will become all the more determined to expose the hypocrisy which has gone for a political stance on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no great view that any individual <Col N="1750" /> Member of this House has a higher moral quality than any other Member.  I resent the suggestion that in some sense the Progressive Democrats, in advocating fearlessly that there should be parliamentary reform, are arrogating to themselves a monopoly of political virtue.  I further resent the suggestion which has been made quite vociferously on occasions by people who should know better that in some sense it is wrong that a Member of this House should make criticisms of its structures and methods because he owes some kind of loyalty to the institution itself and that loyalty to the institution involves silence on its faults. That is the beginning of the end for democracy.  That is not loyalty, it is complicity. As far as this party are concerned, we will not be in complicitous in the suppression of debate on the way in which our democratic institutions work.  We will not be cowed by those who accuse us of some form of disloyalty when we criticise the way in which this House works.</P>
    <P>It will be easy, and it has been done, to say that every one of us comes from some walk of life where there is some flaw in the institutions with which we normally deal.  That was levelled at this party, and in particular, at myself, when I offered some views as to how this House might be reformed.  The reality is that every single measure before this House must be judged on its own merits.  Deputy Kemmy made the salient point that this perhaps is only one small instance of where reform should be made and that there are plenty of others.  But where else can we start to reform except among ourselves?  If we start reforming others without reforming ourselves we shall be taken for what we are, unwilling to take punishment but quite willing to mete it out, unwilling to make sacrifices but quite willing to impose them on others, unwilling in any way to suffer for what we believe in while we make others suffer for what they do not believe in.  That is the perception of politics which is being suggested by the Fine Gael attitude in this debate.  I reject it and so do all right thinking Members.</P>
    <P>This measure has a considerable <Col N="1751" /> number of consequences.  It does not just mean that Members of this House should be deprived of their pensions while they hold office, it applies also to the Judiciary.  It is not considered correct that the members of the Judiciary who are paid on one basis should have their total emoluments varied this way or that on the basis that 20 or 30 years ago they held office as Ministers in Government.  Most people would not accept that as a correct way of remunerating our Judiciary.  If we are talking, as Deputy Mitchell suggested, about reforming the Judiciary, does anybody really believe that is a fair and proper way to remunerate the Judiciary?</P>
    <P>I should also point out that this Bill, if enacted, will also apply to the Presidency. The Chair directed on the last occasion that the President himself could not be brought into this debate and I am respectfully bound by this ruling.  I accept it.  However, I believe it is a feature of this Bill that if it is enacted it will have the effect of depriving the President of his statutory entitlement to a pension. That is one of its consequences and I cannot shy away from it.  I presume I am not in any way trespassing on the privileges I have as a Member of this House in pointing that out.  I shall confine myself to saying it is a great thing that it would not actually have that effect in this case because of the sacrifices already being made.</P>
    <P>This measure will not go away.  It is coming to stay and will be passed.  What will make it pass in the last analysis is the pressure of public opinion.  It is here, it is bearing down on this House.  This measure will pass and I am quite satisfied that the longer Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael avoid the issue or pretend that it is not there, the greater will be the approbrium in which they are held and the greater the contempt when they finally change their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak but, having listened to some of the speeches that have been made, I feel obliged to speak.  I want to make it clear <Col N="1752" /> that I am opposed to this Bill.  I have no axe to grind in doing so because, unfortunately, I have no pension.  I spent two periods in Government and I understand the job which a Minister has to do and how much work he has to do.  It is a very demanding job both physically and mentally.  Up until now, you did that job in the knowledge that if you completed a certain term in office you would receive a pension.  It is very wrong for someone to try to change the rules during the course of a game and to be very selective with those for whom you are trying to change the rules.</P>
      <P>During one of those periods of office we decided to forego an increase which was granted and I do not remember anyone saying that we were great to do so at that time.  I notice that any time an increase was accepted it made headlines in the newspapers and the media are very quick to pick up things such as that.</P>
      <P>At a meeting which I attended recently I heard of one description of the Press Gallery of the Canadian Parliament and such a description would also be remarkably applicable to this House.  The Press Gallery in the Canadian Parliament were described as being a group of people who sat all day on a hill overlooking the battle but took no part in it and then came down at night to shoot the wounded.  Not alone would they shoot the wounded but they would also desecrate the dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be pointed out that certain people may be lucky in that they do not have to give up a profession that they cannot easily return to but there are those, and I am not one of them, who have to make sacrifices and who have to divorce themselves completely from their business interests to devote themselves totally to politics and a ministerial post. If we want people of a proper calibre to do that job we cannot denigrate them as has happened here.  As I said, the Bill appears to be very selective and it is geared to improving the image that the public have of this House.  I do not think the negative self criticism which we have heard will be of any help towards improving the image the public have of <Col N="1753" /> Deputies.  After 18 years in this House I can say that financially I am worse off &mdash; maybe, mentally I am better off &mdash; than when I entered this House and my bank manager will confirm this.  If we want decent representation it is quite obvious that we will have to pay decent remuneration.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of boycotting this Bill because we have not spoken on it on every occasion.  We have somehow being blamed for the empty seats in this chamber.  If the Deputy as a performer cannot fill the arena he should not blame us.  Last week, I brought visitors into this House and they were unfortunate in having to listen to a long speech which was read and which was far from edifying.  I also want to know why politicians are being singled out in this Bill. Why have Army personnel not been included?  There are more Army personnel in my constituency than anywhere else.  Why are Army personnel entitled to a pension and why have they not been mentioned in this Bill?  Why have ESB workers or the legal eagles not been mentioned in this Bill either?  Why are we being so selective?</P>
    <P>I want to say that I am very pleased to oppose this Bill and I have no qualms about doing so.  There are those who have lots of money, who get regular sweeteners and who do not have to make sacrifices as the money they receive for a day in the Dáil would in no way compare with the money they would receive for speaking elsewhere who have the gall to come into this House to say that our attitude really stinks.  That is the height of hypocrisy. I have been told that the Progressive Democrats have said that they will keep coming back.  Only time will tell whether they are right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Power came into this House to speak on this matter because it would have been almost too much to find that nobody has spoken from the Fianna Fáil benches except the Minister for Finance. I find myself in a curious position towards the end of this six-hour debate on this Bill in that I am the eleventh Progressive <Col N="1754" /> Democrat speaker.  Last week in the debate on the Estimates which went on for four full days we had a struggle to get three speakers in and the fourth and fifth speakers whom we had lined up were unable to speak.  It is indicative of something that it should have been so relatively easy for us or anyone else over the last two weeks to speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell who spoke last week said that he believed if a referendum were held in the morning on this Bill it would clearly be passed and he thought that the majority might even be about two to one.  I can tell Deputy Mitchell that he is wrong because if a referendum were held on this Bill tomorrow morning, the majority in its favour would more likely be 99 to 1.  If this House regards itself as a representative one, representative of the people, does it care anything for the view of the people because the view of the people, by a 99 to 1 majority, is that this Bill should be carried.  What does this House think it will achieve by flying in the face of the people in a matter such as this?  Does it not realise that any so-called victory that will be won in the minor battle which will take place here at 8.30 p.m. tonight will be a pyrrhic victory and that the real war will be fought on the doorsteps of Ireland and that those who might be victorious in this small battle tonight will not necessarily be victorious in the real war which will take place out in the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people hold a strong view about this anomaly and feeble efforts were made to justify it.  They cannot understand how people serving in this House and who are being paid to do so are also in receipt of pensions for activities which were connected with their being Members of this House.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy Power, asked why this Bill does not apply to Army personnel.  It does not apply to them for this reason.  This Bill only applies to ministerial pensions and if someone has served as a Minister in the Government I find it very hard to see how he is going to undertake service in the Army.  So far as people who have served in the Army are concerned, we <Col N="1755" /> have been asked why those who leave the Army and who receive a pension for their service are not being deprived of their pension under this Bill.  What retired Army Officer receives a pension for serving in the Army?  That is the answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to make some of the points that I wish to make in support of this Bill I want to deal very briefly with some of the points which were made against it.  I have listened to all of the speeches during the six hours of debate and taken notes where appropriate.  The opposition to the Bill is curious and feeble to say the least of it.  One of the tests of a Bill such as this which seeks to make some kind of change and which tries to decide on whether there should be reform at a given time is to assume that there is no parliament and that somehow or other Ireland is suddenly fashioned from nothing and that we have to have a parliament. Do you think we would have one which operates in the way this one does?  Do you think that we would have built into it the kind of anomalies which exist here at present and which will be defended, if not by speeches, by quick votes tonight.  On the Government side, we heard earlier in the debate, a civil service-type speech from the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry.  I say &ldquo;civil service-type&rdquo; advisedly because that is precisely what it is.  It is almost the same speech as that delivered on Wednesday, 12 March 1986 in Seanad Éireann by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, then Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, when replying on behalf of the then Government to a motion on this very point in the names of Senators Ross and B. Ryan, which motion was defeated in the Seanad by 24 votes to 14, the two parties voting against it in the Seanad being Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  They are now feebly putting up many of the same arguments here.</P>
    <P>I am happy to find this evening &mdash; thanks to Deputy Power's brief intervention &mdash; that there is another voice on these extensive and empty benches that was able to speak.  I thought there was a <Col N="1756" /> grave danger that the only speaking that would be done now on behalf of Fianna Fáil would be done in a room on the second floor here by the man who, in the past, has described himself as the <i>voce</i> of <i>il Duce.</i></P>
    <P>It makes me think back to when I was first elected to this House &mdash; just under 20 years ago now &mdash; when there were men who sat on those benches like MacEntee, Smith, Aiken, Lemass and a few more of them.  They were the kind of men who did not need any <i>voce</i> on the second floor to talk for them.  If they wanted to say something they would come down into this Chamber and say it and, whether it was popular or not, it would be said. What have we now?  Eighty empty seats here.  I salute Deputy Power for having had the courage to at least come in and express a view.  On the other hand, with Fine Gael, we had four or five speakers, three of whom, curiously, went out of their way to say that these anomalies of Ministerial pensions being paid to people in this House, the Judiciary and elsewhere were wrong.  In fact in the ten minutes in which he spoke this evening, Deputy Gay Mitchell said four times that he disagreed with these pensions.  Then he implied that he was voting against this Bill.  Deputy Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, has an amendment down which suggests that this matter has been referred to the Gleeson Committee and, therefore, should be forgotten about in this House.  I checked with the Department of Finance today. They tell me that this is not so, that the terms of reference of the Gleeson Committee do not provide for that committee to make any recommendations on pensions paid to former office holders.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his speech, had referred at great length to the Gleeson Committee.  He did not say so but tried to imply that they were looking at the matter and that anything referred to a committee should not be looked at by this House.  Of course it has not been referred to that committee.  I am sure there are a lot of people who wish it would be because, in that way, it is swept under the carpet.  I thought it <Col N="1757" /> curious that the Minister for Finance, among other things, should say:</P>
    <P>.....they are free from any charge or suggestion that in some undefined way they can unfairly manipulate the system for their own financial gain.</P>
    <P>that is, speaking about Members of this House and these pensions.  That is precisely what we are doing.  If we vote down this Bill this evening that is precisely what we are doing.  Earlier he had said, at column 320 of the Official Report of 14 October 1987:</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the pensions payable to former Ministerial and other office holders are not a matter in which the recipients should be seen as the arbitrators.</P>
    <P>But Members of this House are seen as the arbitrators.  They have the choice this evening.  They can exercise that choice. They should remember that they are the arbitrators if they vote down this Bill because they will be voting to continue the payment of these pensions to Members while they are Members of the House.</P>
    <P>At column 317 of the Official Report of 14 October 1987 the Minister for Finance had this to say:</P>
    <P>The arrangements which are now in operation for nearly half a century have played their part in maintaining both the quality and stability of our political institutions.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the quality and stability of our political institutions, in particular of this House, not be very much greater if these kinds of unacceptable anomalies that people outside cannot understand or tolerate where done away with?  Would passing this Bill not be exactly the sort of thing that would raise the dignity and credibility of this House rather than have it the way it is?</P>
    <P>Deputy Power, like some others, was pained at the apparently low standing in which some speakers suggested politicians were held.  If Deputy Power is pained by that I can only tell him that <Col N="1758" /> that is the view widely held in this country. This is one of the first things we can do here to correct and change it, and I suggest we do it.  Why it is important for this House to take a step like this is that this is the primary democratic institution in this country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he will appreciate that, about now, I would &mdash; in accordance with normal procedure &mdash; be asking the mover of the motion, Deputy Anne Colley to reply.  I take it that Deputy O'Malley is utilising that time and is now replying to the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, I am replying on her behalf.  This is the primary institution in this country.  The reform of any other institution has to begin here. God knows, there is need for reform of institutions in this country.  But we have no moral authority to reform any other institution until we reform ourselves.  Of all the ways in which we must reform ourselves this constitutes the most glaring and silly anomaly.  It may cost the taxpayer only £250,000 but it is totally and grossly unjustified because of the nature of the way it is paid.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the reform that should be carried out in this country, at the reform necessary in the courts, in the whole legal system and the way things operate.  People who have been elected to this House from the Four Courts have often said to me: I thought things were bad in the Four Courts but, by God, I never believed they could be anything like they are here.  It is true.  We have no moral authority to change or reform other institutions until we begin to put this House in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the silliest ways this House seems so unwilling to change.  For example, on last Friday afternoon there was a debate on noting the Estimates for next year.  In order to take a decision on that the Members of this House had to spend precisely 70 minutes traipsing up and down those stairs when, in any other Parliament or place, it would be done in <Col N="1759" /> perhaps three or four minutes electronically. I remember, I think ten years ago, making a suggestion that that be changed and I was told: no, it could not. That thinking was there in the minds of Deputies Cooney and Tom Fitzpatrick when they spoke last week, their view that because this system has been here for 50 years, therefore it must be good, therefore it should not be changed.  How different they are from people of a younger mentality.  It can be summed up by saying that if they could say this Shanley Committee, on which so much emphasis is laid today, had reported 100 years ago, then the whole thing would be twice as valid as it was when they reported 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>In passing I want to express my anger, at and my repudiation of remarks made by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick last week, in particular in relation to Members of my party, in particular to the female Members of my party.  It may seem difficult for Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick to imagine that there could be a political party 29 per cent of whose Deputies are women but that is a fact of life.  I reject absolutely his insinuation that such people are amateurs in some way, or that they come into this House or engage in politics as a hobby.  They have an enormous contribution to make, they have made an enormous contribution and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick &mdash; and I suppose it shows the paucity of the arguments advanced on this matter &mdash; went on to say that what Deputy Molloy and I had done was, and I quote &ldquo;a dirty, mean little political gimmick&rdquo;.  I am not sure whether he also includes the President of Ireland in that phrase but, assuming he does not, I can say to Deputy Fitzpatrick that the making of a charge like that reflects far more on him than on the people about whom or against whom he purports to make it.</P>
    <P>We have had a curious argument from Fine Gael.  Three of their Deputies, including their spokesman, put forward the argument that this whole thing was anomalous and should be done away <Col N="1760" /> with, but they thought it should be referred to a committee and dealt with in a somewhat different way and put somewhat on the long finger.  They were at great pains to tell us that what the Bill was trying to do away with was wrong. On the other hand, Deputy Cooney and Deputy Fitzpatrick said that it is perfectly right.  We saw a strange division there in which they spoke with two voices and had different ways of looking at these things.</P>
    <P>The point was made about Deputies' pay, which is unsatisfactory, as few people know better than I, and I will have extra cause to know it from now on.  We were asked why we did not cope or deal with that in this Bill.  We have no power to introduce a money Bill and that is what would be necessary in that context.  The PDs see an absolutely valid case for having a much more reasonable and rational system of payment for Deputies if it were done in the framework of the institutional reform we propose.  We cannot see the jusification nor the need for a Seanad in this country and we do not accept that we need the number of Deputies who sit in this House at the moment at one per 20,000 when the Constitution allows one per 30,000.  If these kinds of changes were made and if the number of Ministers of State &mdash; which has become a bit of a joke as they are tripping over one another and getting into all kinds of rows about what to do and what not to do because they are seriously under-employed &mdash; were reduced to a reasonable figure, the saving overall might not be huge but it would be very valuable because it could be multiplied many times over in terms of the example it would give of a preparation on the part of people in this House to share sacrifice.</P>
    <P>In the recent national plan or public sector pay agreement, as a result of the reduction in the Estimates &mdash; which I agree with &mdash; and an increase in public sector pay, the vast majority of the people are being asked to tighten their belts.  Two categories and two only were not.  One are the great majority of the public service who retain their jobs, other than the 10,000 who have to be let go in <Col N="1761" /> order to pay increased wages for those who remain.  Apart from them and Members of this House everyone is expected to make sacrifices.  Is that right?</P>
    <P>I refer again to the primacy of this House and the entitlement of people to look to this House for leadership and example.  Even if individual Members here are called on to do things that by normal standards might be looked on as almost unreasonable and irrational to set an example, then it behoves ordinary Members in this House to do that and I am glad to say that some have done it. However, here tonight we are not voting on whether to save £250,000, we are voting really on the question of whether all people are prepared to pull together or whether only those in the real world outside these gates are expected to make sacrifices while the people in here who make the rules make no sacrifice.  Not alone do they not reduce what they have, they maintain what by any normal standards is indefensible and was not defended within this House.  That is the decision that is going to be made.  It will be about £250,000, but this Government or Fine Gael, if either of them were prepared to respond to the challenge that we throw down to them now, could revolutionise the thinking and could create here a real consensus that would get all the people pulling together for the first time in a very long time.  This is precisely the time in our history and in our fortunes as a nation that we need to do that. Tonight we are giving an opportunity to this House to redeem itself in the eyes of so many people and to vindicate its position as the primary institution in this <Col N="1762" /> country.  It is not often that that opportunity is afforded here; it is not often afforded on a single net issue like this, but this is a point on which people can make judgment, on which they will make judgment and will continue to make judgment for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the House, irrespective of Whips or anything else, to realise that there is something fundamental here.  This is not just an ordinary Bill or an ordinary law that will affect a small number of people and save a small amount of money.  This effects some Members of this House.  It gives them an opportunity to put their country before themselves.  I hope they do not fail to grasp that nettle.</P>

      <P>I have already clarified the position of Baggot Street Hospital earlier today in reply to a question from Deputy Gerard Brady.  The general hospital development plan for south Dublin provides for the development of three major acute hospitals, St Vincent's, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals.  The State is investing considerable resources in this development programme.  A major capital development is currently being carried out in St. James's Hospital which is intended to cater for a population of approximately 200,000 people from the south central areas of Dublin city and county along with part of County Kildare.</P>
      <P>In the case of Baggot Street Hospital it was always envisaged that the acute services, particularly those higher specialties such as cardiology, thoracic surgery and respiratory medicine presently located there, would transfer to St. James's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of reasons, not least of which is the need to concentrate essential activities in a smaller number of locations and eliminate avoidable management and maintenance overheads, it is now necessary and appropriate to advance this programme.  While this advancement has <Col N="1767" /> created difficulties for all concerned in the short term, it is the best option available in creating a rational, cost-effective arrangement of services.  It will enable all key services to be brought together under a unified management.</P>
    <P>This transfer is scheduled for completion on 31 December 1987 and with the co-operation of all parties it will be possible to effect it with minimal disruption of service and without imposing hardship on staff.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government have now taken decisions in relation to the terms which will apply to health services staff in relation to such matters as redundancy, early retirement and redeployment.  It is the Government's wish that any essential reductions in staffing required by the health agencies should be made on a voluntary basis. Redeployment is being used to the maximum to preserve employment.  The terms decided are aimed to allay the fears of staff who are understandably concerned about the implications for them of the rationalisation of the health services. The terms are generous, particularly having regard to the very difficult financial situation facing the Government. This clearly indicates the Government's concern that the staff of the health services who have served the community well, and will continue to do so, should be treated fairly and that the management of the process of rationalisation should be as orderly as possible.</P>
    <P>When I came to office and recognised that there was a decision to close Baggot Street Hospital on the transfer of services to St. James's I decided that it was necessary in the interests of the people in the area that Baggot Street should remain open.  Since the board of Baggot Street Hospital agreed to facilitate the transfer of services to St. James's, officials of my Department have been meeting regularly with all concerned to ensure a quick and smooth transfer of services.  Discussions are on-going between the hospital board, the Eastern Health Board and St. James's <Col N="1768" /> Hospital with a view to ensuring that the optimum use is made of the resources which will become available after the transfer of acute services in the hospital. The board of Baggot Street Hospital have agreed in principle that the following services would be provided at the hospital: accommodation for long stay patients; a community health centre and a minor casualty service staffed by local general practitioners.</P>
    <P>It is intended that these services would be fully integrated with all other health and welfare services provided in the area.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the hospital board have made to me about continuing as a community hospital is the subject of detailed examination in my Department and we will be responding to this suggestion as soon as this examination is complete.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to put on record the co-operation which my Department have received from the board and management of the hospital, the medical consultants and the many categories of staff involved in planning and carrying out what has been a very difficult exercise under considerable constraints. I have no doubt that the services now provided at Baggot Street Hospital will continue to be held in very high regard in its new location.</P>

      <Col N="1538" /> In regard to services for sexually abused children I am very conscious of the need to improve the present range of health and social services available.

The work to be undertaken in these two units will replace the work which is currently undertaken with children at the Rotunda Hospital sexual assault treatment unit. The new units are expected to be operational in the coming months.  In July last my Department issued a revised set of guidelines on child abuse which includes a special section on child sexual abuse. In circulating the new guidelines formally to the health boards my Department requested the boards to review urgently their present procedures and services for dealing with reported cases of child abuse.  This review process is now underway and my Department will be discussing the outcome of the different reviews with the health boards with a view to improving present arrangements for the investigation of cases of alleged child sexual abuse and also the treatment and support services required for abused children and their families.</P>

    <P>In 1982 a project team representative of my Department and the hospital authorities was established to prepare a planning brief for a limited development of <Col N="1548" /> the hospital including an outline of the long-term space requirements for the entire hospital.</P>
    <P>The planning brief was submitted and approved by my Department in June 1984.  A design team was then appointed to prepare a development control plan. In January 1987 my Department approved the preparation of sketch design and cost plans for the out-patients, accident and emergency and pharmacy departments.  The scheme is estimated to cost about £3 million.</P>

      <P>The policy of my Department for many years past has been to encourage the prescription of drugs using their approved or generic name.  This policy arose from the report of the working party on prescribing and dispensing in the GMS, of 1976 and was further endorsed by the report of the working party on the GMS published in August 1984.  I might add that this policy has my full support.</P>
      <P>Drugs and therapeutics committees were established in the major public hospitals on foot of the 1980 Trident report, in order to draw up prescribing policies to rationalise drug use and to realise fully the scope for economies, including those deriving from preferential purchase of generics.</P>
      <P>General practitioners participating in the GMS are regularly circulated by the GMS (Payments) Board with detailed information on the relative cost of a standard course of treatment with various alternative versions of the drugs most commonly in use, including the range of available generics.</P>
      <P>I might add that there is also clear statistical evidence of a significant level of generic prescribing in the GMS in regard to those formulations where generics are available.  The question of the level of savings which might be achieved on prescribing costs in the GMS will be a central issue in the recently re-opened negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on the future of the GMS.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he, or any body under his aegis, operates means tests or income thresholds for any purpose, for example tax exemption, eligibility for charge or benefit, in respect of such means test or income thresholds (a) the levels at which they operate and the period over which they are assessed (b) if account is taken of the income of a spouse and, if so, the way in which this has been done; (c) if account is taken of the income of other household members; and if so, the way in which this has been done (d) if account is taken of the costs of maintaining dependent children or other dependants (e) if any income, for example, social welfare payments, or the imputed value of home ownership is ignored or discounted in any way (f) if the value of property, real or personal, is included and, if so, the basis on which it is included (g) when the levels were last revised in line with inflation and (h) if there is a distinction in the way the means test operates between a couple who are married and a couple living together but not married.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council operates a means test as one of the elements in determining the award of Cnuais, currently £5,300 per year.  The applicants &mdash; who must already be members of Aosdána &mdash; must satisfy the Council that no position of emolument, whether wholetime or part-time, is held other than one concerned exclusively with creative work.  In addition, their income must be less than £5,000, averaged over a number of years, usually between two and five years.  The income of the applicant for a Cnuais is the sole income of which account is taken.  The level of the means test has not been revised since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Council's awarding of bursaries, scholarships and travel grants, while the artistic considerations are the principal criteria, the financial <Col N="1557" /> circumstances of the applicants are considered.</P>
    <P>As the administrative cost of operating the means test for the payment of a Cnuas is negligible, the need for the calculation referred to by the Deputy does not arise.</P>

      <P>As soon as we became aware of the reports of the mistreatment of the person mentioned in the Deputy's question who had been resident in Ireland we expressed our concern to the Chilean authorities and asked for details of the charges against him.  We have been informed that he is still in custody in hospital, although he is allowed to receive visitors such as representatives of the Red Cross and his lawyer.  I am not aware of any evidence of mistreatment or torture.  The person concerned is charged with the illegal possession of explosives.</P>
      <P>We and our partners in the Twelve are very concerned about the manner in which the second person named by the Deputy is being treated.  This concern has been firmly expressed to the Chilean authorities on several occasions, and as recently as last week.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to make such a change. A road tax relief for veteran and vintage motor vehicles would present serious practical difficulties &mdash; for example, in deciding the minimum qualifying age for the vehicles concerned, and in dealing with vehicles reconditioned with substantial replacement of parts.  It would also be difficult to justify low road tax rates for what could be termed hobby vehicles while ordinary motor vehicles &mdash; essentials to many members of the community &mdash; had to remain chargeable to road tax at higher rates for budgetary reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda national communications system, as well as providing a modern radio communications network for the Garda Síochána, is also providing the force with an improved and more cost-effective telephone system.  Telephone extensions from Garda stations to official Garda living accommodation are being withdrawn as part of this process.  These extensions were provided at stations which are open only for a limited time each day and they did not guarantee a Garda response to calls made by the public outside of normal station opening hours.  The decision to withdraw these extensions was taken by the Garda authorities. The new Garda communications system incorporates a public access call facility at all stations which are not manned 24 hours per day.  By means of this facility members of the public can have immediate direct contact, from any station which is closed, with the local Garda district headquarters station which is open round the clock.  The public can also get Garda service at any time by telephoning their local district headquarters directly or by dialing &ldquo;999&rdquo; in case of emergency.</P>
      <P>I am informed that savings amounting to £21,450 per annum will arise from the elimination of rental charges.  It is expected that considerable additional savings will arise from the cessation of call charges but these cannot be accurately estimated at this time.</P>

      <P>Two Garda drivers are allocated to each user.  The average annual cost per user in 1986, including driver costs, is estimated to be £93,000.  In accordance with a long-standing Government decision, official cars provided for Ministers and other users are for use as if the cars were their own private property.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that in certain instances the Garda authorities consider it necessary for protection purposes to provide a Garda car from time to time for a particular individual.  That is a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda authorities and, for security reasons, it is not policy to give information on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of measures have been introduced to counter the problem of armed crime.  These involve the redeployment of certain Garda resources and a constant review of the levels of protection to be provided at particular times and places, as well as other matters.  I do not propose to go into any greater detail about these measures as to do so could be counterproductive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, however, that the Garda authorities inform me that there has been a decrease of the order of 20 per cent in the number of armed raids in the first <Col N="1569" /> nine months of this year in comparison with the corresponding period last year and also that there has been an improvement in the detection rate of such crimes.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the law relating to this type of crime is adequate.  As regards proposals to strengthen the law I would remind the Deputy that the law relating to police powers was reviewed as recently as 1984 when the Criminal Justice Act of that year was enacted.  Some of the more important provisions of that Act came into operation only in July of this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present position regarding the social welfare entitlements of share fishermen; the way in which their insurance is treated under the social welfare code, if they are treated as self employed or as PAYE sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurability of share fishermen is provided for under paragraph 6 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, viz., &ldquo;Employment as a member of the crew of a fishing vessel where the employed person is wholly remunerated by a share in the profits or the gross earnings of the working of the vessel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the PRSI contributions in respect of all share fishermen were collected via the owners/skippers of fishing trawlers through the combined PAYE/PRSI collection system operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In a High Court judgment of February 1986, in relation to the crew of a particular trawler, it was held that an employer/employee relationship based on a contract of service did not exist in that case and that the skipper (who was also the owner) and his crew were partners; and that the skipper was not guilty of offences with which he had been charged under the PAYE/PRSI collection system.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has advised that this judgment only affected the collection system and that it did not affect the insurability of share fishermen (in cases similar to the High Court case or in cases where PRSI contributions would still be payable through the PAYE/PRSI system operated by the Revenue Commissioners). Accordingly, subject to the normal contribution conditions, the entitlement of all share fishermen to benefits under the Social Welfare Acts is unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General further advised that, in cases where the Revenue Commissioners PAYE/PRSI collection <Col N="1585" /> system does not apply, the collection of contributions from the owners/skippers should be made through the special collection system operated by the Department of Social Welfare in respect of insured persons whose earnings are assessable to income tax other than through the PAYE system.  Arrangements for the collection of contributions via this system in relevant cases are in train at present and the Department are in touch with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation in regard to it.</P>

      <P>On 8 July 1987 the person concerned was notified that a decision had been made awarding him invalidity pension from 29 January 1987.  However, before the arrangements had been finalised for putting the pension into payment a question arose as to the validity of the decision in view of the fact that the person concerned has also been insurably employed in another EC member state. The matter has now been resolved and a pension order book at the rate of £102.60 a week payable from the 12 November 1987 will be issued to the designated post office of payment.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of her husband's death on 8 May 1980 the person concerned was in receipt of invalidity pension at the weekly rate of £19.40 while he was in receipt of disability benefit at the weekly rate of £33.70.  Both payments continued to 4 July 1980 when she was awarded a widow's contributory pension of £22.50 weekly and half-rate disability benefit of £10.23 weekly.</P>
      <P>The half-rate disability benefit was awarded in substitution for the invalidity pension as this pension cannot be paid in conjunction with a widow's pension.  Her entitlements then totalled £32.73 a week which was a considerable increase on the invalidity pension which would otherwise have been payable and represented the better option for her.  However, as the person concerned was actually paid the invalidity pension up to 30 July 1980 an overpayment arose to the extent by which the invalidity pension exceeded the half-rate disability benefit for the period from 4 to 30 July 1980.  This overpayment, which was in the region of £30, has been fully recovered by deductions of £1 per week from her disability benefit entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She is currently in receipt of a widow's pension of £49.50 a week and disability benefit of £21.15 a week, a total of £70.65 weekly.  Invalidity pension would now be payable at £48.50 per week which would represent a reduction in weekly payments of £22.15 a week.  She would however be <Col N="1587" /> eligible to claim free travel, electricity etc., which are payable with invalidity pension but not with disability benefit or with widow's pension where the widow is under 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned still wishes to transfer to invalidity pension, she should notify the Department to this effect and her entitlement to that pension will be restored in lieu of her current payments.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a person can receive supplementary payments to assist with rent or mortgage commitments. Under these arrangements a payment towards rent or mortgage interest can be granted where the rent or the mortgage interest exceeds a certain amount, currently £1.50 per week.  This amount has remained unchanged since 1977.</P>
      <P>In future, supplementary payments will be made where the rent or the mortgage interest exceeds £3 a week.  The increase to £3.00 in the threshold above which supplements will be paid will only apply to new applicants for rent or mortgage supplements.  It is estimated that there will be around 10,000 new applicants for rent or mortgage supplements during 1988.  The savings arising from this measure are estimated at £400,000.

From January 1988 new claimants to disability benefit who are already receiving widow's pension, deserted wives payments or unmarried mother's allowance will not be entitled to claim disability benefit in addition.  It is anticipated that some 900 persons will be affected by this measure in 1988 and the total savings are estimated at £900,000. This measure will only apply to new claimants after January 1st 1988.  Persons already in receipt of both types of payment will not be affected.  They will continue to receive the payments as long as existing claims to disability benefit continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present legal requirements for the labelling of foodstuffs are set down in the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982 (S.I. No. 205 of 1982).  These regulations, generally referred to as &ldquo;the food labelling regulations&rdquo; gave effect in Ireland to an EC Directive on this matter.</P>
      <P>The regulations specify the details which must be shown on the labels of foodstuffs generally.  These details include such information as the name of the foodstuff, a full list of ingredients, the net quantity, an indication of the durability of the foodstuff (the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date), storage conditions, a name and address of a manufacturer or packager or seller, etc.</P>
      <P>I have recently amended these regulations so as to require that in future, greater information be given on the label of a foodstuff as regards any additives which the foodstuff contains.  Currently, only the name of the category to which the additive belongs need be given in a list of ingredients (e.g. colour, preservative, etc.) but when the amended regulations come into effect in mid-1988 the category name will have to be followed by the specific name of the additive or its EC number (e.g. colour tartrazine or colour E102).</P>
      <P>I believe that the current regulations, together with the recent amendment I have mentioned, provide the consumer with a reasonable amount of information about the food he or she buys.  While I do not intend to introduce further amendments in the near future, I would point out that proposals to amend the original EC Directive, which dates from 1979, are currently under discussion in Brussels but it will be a number of years yet before these result in any change in the current requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides for the carry over of endorsements on a driving licence to subsequent driving licences.  Under this provision a person whose licence has been endorsed must, before he can obtain a licence free from that endorsement, satisfy the licensing authority that he has held a driving licence either during a continuous period or not less than three years or a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years after the date of the original endorsement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation <Col N="1599" /> that the person referred to by the Deputy held a three year licence for the period 5 October, 1984 to 4th October, 1987 and was disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of one year from 1 January 1985.  However, on subsequent application to the Court, the disqualification was removed with effect from 4 July 1985.  His driving licence, duly endorsed with particulars of the relevant conviction and disqualification, was required under the Road Traffic Acts, was then returned to him.  The licence expired on 4 October 1987.  The person concerned applied for and was granted a further three year licence on 7 October 1987.  However, because of the gap between the expiry date of one licence and the granting of the next licence, the five year rule must apply.  There is a general legal obligation on a person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle to hold a current driving licence.  A person may apply for a licence up to one month before the expiry of his current licence.</P>
    <P>This information is clearly set out in leaflet D.10A issued by my Department which is available at motor tax offices. In addition, most licensing authorities, including Dublin Corporation, issue reminder slips to licence holders well in advance of the date of expiry of driving licences.</P>
    <P>As regards the endorsement rules, paragraph 6 of the leaflet D.10A specifically reminds persons whose licence has been endorsed not to have any gap between the date of expiry of one licence and the commencement of the next one.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is also the corporation's normal practice to draw the attention of personal applicants to these legal provisions and to enclose an explanatory leaflet in the case of postal applications.  The corporation cannot, however, confirm from their records if this was done in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I cannot waive or vary the existing statutory provisions in a particular case.</P>

      <P>The amalgamation of the Irish Water Safety Association with the Irish Road Safety Association and the Fire Prevention Council was decided on by the Government as part of the programme of measures designed to ensure that services in the public sector generally are provided in a cost effective way.  It will be a matter for the new body to agree a work programme and allocate the available resources to ensure the performance of its functions in the three areas, water safety, fire prevention and road safety in the most effective and efficient manner possible.  It is my intention that the functions to be performed by the amalgamated safety body will incorporate fully the present functions of the Irish Water Safety Association and the various matters referred to by the Deputies will be taken fully into account in determining the necessary organisational and other arrangements.  I fully appreciate the contribution which has been made by many people on a voluntary basis to the work of the association and look forward to their continued active involvement in water safety matters at local level under the aegis of the new body.</P>

      <P>Irradiation is a widely accepted technology for the preservation of food and the destruction of harmful food pathogens. Following extensive international research the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency have accepted the safety of the process and have approved food irradiation for use on certain foods at specified levels.  I am aware that 23 countries have approved food irradiation in respect of 40 foodstuffs and certain of these foodstuffs are imported from these countries from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By its nature, the process of irradiation does not leave any residue of radiation in <Col N="1621" /> the food and, to date, a detection test for irradiation has not been developed.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Health are currently involved in the preparation of an EC Directive to regulate food irradiation, which will include specific labelling requirements.</P>

It became clear that this proposal had little to recommend it.  Any such State company would be solely restricted to the manufacture of generic versions of drugs whose patent protection had expired.  There are already two relatively large Irish manufacturing companies who are very active in this particular area of enterprise both with regard to exports and domestic supply. These companies must already compete with generic houses in the UK.  I do not accept that it has been established that a State drug manufacturing company could improve upon the market performance of the existing Irish manufacturing enterprises in the generic sector.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Montessori teachers who have been permanently employed in special national schools for handicapped children are being made redundant; and that such teachers are ineligible for unemployment benefit under their PRSI contributions and are further ineligible to draw their salaries or be placed on the panel as per special arrangement agreed between the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the management of Catholic diocesan schools and her Department; the steps, if any, she will take to ensure that such teachers will be guaranteed continuing employment, or unemployment benefit, in the event of redundancy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Teachers in all national schools are employed by the board of management of the respective schools and my Department have no part in their selection provided they are qualified for the post.  Their employment is subject to the overall average enrolment.  When the enrolment figure falls below a certain minimum the most junior teacher becomes redundant.  Teachers who are fully qualified national teachers are eligible for placement on the diocesan panel where the patron of the school is the Ordinary of the Diocese.  Montessori trained teachers are not eligible for recognition as teachers in ordinary national schools and their employment is restricted to certain categories of special schools.  Teachers so recognised are not <Col N="1640" /> entitled to panel rights and both their employers and the teachers themselves are well aware that this is a condition of their employment.</P>
      <P>Since I do not select teachers for employment it would not be possible for me to guarantee their employment in another school, should they become redundant in the school that hired them. Neither do I have any control over the enrolment in individual schools, which is what determines the appropriate staffing. The question of the payment of unemployment benefit is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A vocational education committee may defray the travelling expenses actually incurred by its members in respect of meetings held at a place not less than five miles from their ordinary places of residence.  Alternatively, a VEC may by resolution decide that, in lieu of defraying the travelling expenses actually incurred, <Col N="1649" /> a fixed sum for every mile travelled may be paid.  The current rate which requires and has the sanction of the Minister for Education is 53p per mile.  In addition, in the case of members of VECs who attend meetings at a place not less than one mile from their ordinary places of residence and are obliged, by reason of their attendance to remain away from home for a continuous period of not less than three hours, subsistence allowances are also payable.  The level of allowance payable is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Education.  The current rates are £10.45 for absences from home of three hours but less than seven hours and £14.45 for absences of seven hours or more.</P>
    <P>Where members of VECs attend meetings at a place not less than five miles from home and are obliged to remain away from home for a continuous period of not less than three hours, an inclusive travelling and subsistence allowance may be paid.  The present allowance is £15.40. The level of allowance is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>No specific attendance allowance is payable in respect of attendance at meetings of VECs.</P>
    <P>The levels of the allowances payable are based on those prevailing for members of Local Rating Authorities and are increased periodically in accordance with increases sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

The vacated building was then to be acquired by my Department for the accommodation of the all-Irish national school, Scoil Santain, which, in accordance with my Department's policy, is <Col N="1654" /> entitled to apply for the provision of suitable permanent accommodation at State expense.  Scoil Santain has already been occupying part of the Bolbrook school under a temporary convenience arrangement with the school authorities.  My Department have entered into negotiations with the Catholic diocesan trustees for the purchase of their interest in the Bolbrook school premises, which interest comprises the ownership of the site in fee simple and the present value of the original local contribution towards the cost of the building.</P>
      <P>It was regarded as a matter for the patron and the trustees to establish local opinion in relation to the re-arrangement of the accommodation of the three schools mentioned at the outset.  My Department are, however, satisfied that all necessary consultations took place and agreements secured.

Capitation grants ceased to be paid to fee-charging secondary schools with effect from the commencement of the 1986-87 school year.  There was, consequently, no aid given in this category to such schools in the 1987 financial year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.  The tender recommendations for the proposed new central school at Calry, County Sligo which is to replace the existing national school buildings at Calry and Dunally were forwarded to my Department by the school authorities in September 1987. While it is necessary yet to complete the examination of tenders I have been made aware that enrolments at both schools have been falling.  It may, accordingly, be necessary to review the schedule of accommodation to be provided in the proposed new building.  I am not in a position to forecast the time scale which may be required for the completion of inquiries.</P>
      <P>I should add that irrespective of the outcome of the issues in question, it is unlikely, because of pressure on my Department's 1988 capital provision, that the project can proceed to contract for the present.</P>

Another official of his constituency office travelled to and worked in the constituency over a period of two days.  These arrangements were considered necessary by the Minister of State in order to have his constituency affairs dealt with in his absence on ministerial duties.</P>
