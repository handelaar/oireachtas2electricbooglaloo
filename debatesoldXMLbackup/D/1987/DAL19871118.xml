    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 12 to 14 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;adoption order&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an adoption order made under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, or</P>
      <P>(b) any order made or decree granted outside the State, providing for the adoption of a person, which is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State,</P>
      <P>and for the time being in force;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment changes the definition of the term &ldquo;adoption order&rdquo; for the purposes of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  It will mean that Act will now apply to infants adopted under foreign adoption orders, which are recognised in this country, in the same manner as it applies to infants adopted under domestic law.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister for Justice accepted an amendment on this point from Deputy Shatter, subject to consultation with the draftsman.  The text I am now proposing represents the outcome of that consultation.  I trust that it is acceptable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the principle of the amendment tabled on Committee Stage.  This is an important amendment. It means that because we recognise an adoption by a couple who adopt a child outside Ireland under our adoption law, <Col N="951" /> there can be no doubt as to the couple who do adopt such a child having all the rights which would normally be given to parents to whom a child is born or who adopt a child in Ireland under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  It means that such parents will automatically, under Irish law, be joint guardians of any child adopted by them in a foreign country and that all of the provisions in the Guardianship of Infants Act relating to guardianship and custody of children will apply.</P>
      <P>There is one matter I should like to ask the Minister about.  I raised it on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister has only one opportunity to respond on Report Stage.  In the context of this provision and similar provisions in other sections of the Status of Children Bill, I referred to the fact that currently in our statute law no legislation has been enacted at any stage since the foundation of the State setting out the circumstances in which we, in this State, recognise foreign adoption orders.  While this provision is of help in providing uniformity in the legal sense through the Status of Children Bill, the difficulty is that we abdicated this House's role in this area to the courts.</P>
      <P>We are effectively saying it is for the courts to decide, on whatever principles they wish to invent, the circumstances in which we will recognise foreign adoption orders.  No married couple in Ireland who have adopted a child outside Ireland know positively whether their foreign adoption order is valid or invalid under Irish law.  I accept that in the Status of Children Bill we cannot provide the detailed criteria which should be enacted setting out the circumstances in which we recognise foreign adoption orders or setting out the basis upon which a Minister can certify a country's adoptions as being adoptions recognised in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this matter with the Minister for Justice I asked that in the context of adoption legislation currently in the Seanad, or in the context of a more comprehensive adoption Bill which may <Col N="952" /> implement the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services, there should be a specific provision relating to the recognition of foreign adoption orders and setting out the circumstances in which we recognise them.  The Minister said he would look into the matter and bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I would like to ask the Minister if any further progress has been made on this very important issue.  This issue will become increasingly important as the number of children available for adoption in Ireland decreases and the number of Irish couples seeking to adopt abroad increases.  If we do not have legislation in the very near future in relation to this area we will have a new group of children in a legal limbo and many parents who have adopted children outside Ireland will not know, under Irish law, the status of the child adopted by them.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister in his reply give some indication as to whether the Government now intend to legislate to deal with this problem which is directly related to this amendment, and when it is anticipated that such legislation will come before the House?  Will we see it before Christmas or will we see it during 1988?  Would the Minister accept that it is a matter of increasing urgency that we enact such legislation having regard to the increasing number of Irish couples who are adopting children from places like Chile, Peru, India, Indonesia and the Philippines?</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their support for this amendment. With regard to Deputy Shatter's point, he is, of course, correct and I will convey his views to both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice.  As Deputy Shatter said, the Minister for Justice said on Committee Stage that he would note the views expressed by him in that regard.  No decision has been taken as yet but I would like to assure the Deputy that his views have been noted and are being considered.  It is <Col N="953" /> unlikely that anything will be done before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11. &mdash;Section 5 of the Act of 1964 (inserted by the Courts Act, 1981) is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (2) of &lsquo;£50&rsquo; for &lsquo;£30&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I commented on the fact that the Status of Children Bill effectively abolishes the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930. That legislation made provision for the first time for the mother to obtain a court order to require the father of the child born outside marriage to contribute towards the support of his child.  Under the provisions of the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, the District Court was conferred with a power to award the princely sum of anything up to 20 shillings per week for the support of the child born outside marriage. While the Act made provision for the support of a child born outside marriage it confined the support payment that could be ordered to a sum of 20 shillings per week.  The 20 shillings was increased to £2 in 1971 and subsequently the Courts Act, 1971, generously increased the support payment of £2 to £5, which was the maximum order that could be made.  This was increased to £15 in 1976 and it was further increased to £30 per week in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In abolishing the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, the Status of Children Bill will now enable the mother of a child born outside marriage to seek support payment for the support of her child under existing maintenance <Col N="954" /> provisions contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Under these Acts the maximum support payment that can be provided for the support of a dependent child at present is the sum of £30 per week, the same sum as applies to the making of affiliation orders.  In effect, the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act were used up to now by wives who sought maintenance payments from husbands for the support of dependent children.  The Status of Children Bill, in effect, says that a wife or a mother of a child born outside marriage can get a maintenance payment for the support of a dependent child under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Family Law Act.</P>
    <P>The limit of £30 per week has remained unchanged since 1981 despite the fact that inflation has greatly devalued that sum.  On present monetary values the sum of £30 per week as it pertained in 1981 should be a sum of just under £60 per week.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment to the Bill that would allow the courts to make an order for the support of dependent children of a sum up to £60 per week.  The Minister did not accept the amendment.  I have modified that amendment and on Report Stage I have tabled an amendment which would allow the courts to order a sum up to £50 per week for the support of a dependent child.</P>
    <P>The passage of this amendment would benefit all the children who would benefit from the provisions of the Bill; unmarried mothers, deserted wives, and wives who are receiving inadequate sums of money from their husbands for child support.  In effect, this amendment would extend the jurisdiction to the District Court to make support payment orders for dependent children born inside or outside marriage for a sum up to £50 per week instead of the limit of £30 per week imposed on the District Court.  The essential difference is that it would extend the financial jurisdiction in the District Court and in so doing would allow the District Court to <Col N="955" /> take account of modern incomes and expenses as compared with family expenses in 1981.  It would allow the District Court to make proper orders for the support of dependent children rather than orders based on a false and outdated financial evaluation of the expenses incurred in the day-to-day up-bringing of a child.</P>
    <P>In the context of child support payments we must remember we are not talking about payments for a baby of one year old but payments that can run all the way up to the 21st birthday of a dependent child.  The payments should not only make provision for basic food and clothing but must take account of educational expenses, such as the purchase of school books or expenses which arise when a young person participates in third level education.  If one looks at the support payments in that context one can rapidly draw a conclusion that £30 per week, the order made under existing legislation, is totally inadequate to make provision for a child to participate in third level education.  Having regard to third level education fees, the yearly total of £30 per week would be exhausted in many instances on fees, without taking into account any of the other expenses incurred by a young person in third level education on accommodation, food, clothing and purchase of books.</P>
    <P>At present if an unmarried mother or a wife seeks a larger sum than £30 per week for the support of a dependent child she must bring proceedings in the Circuit Court.  Proceedings in the Circuit Court are much more expensive and long drawn out than District Court proceedings. There is not as ready access to the Circuit Court for these type of proceedings as there is to the District Court.  Generally if a mother has to bring court proceedings, as this legislation seeks to provide, she can bring proceedings for child support payments and have them heard in the District Court within three to five weeks of issuing a District Court maintenance application.  It can take up to nine months, depending on which part of <Col N="956" /> the country, to take similar proceedings in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>This provision is designed to do one thing and one thing only, namely, to allow mothers who are getting inadequate child support payments to have ready access to the District Court to get maintenance orders of a more adequate financial nature than they can get at present.  In addition, it takes account of the increase in inflation since 1981, the last time this House considered this issue when it imposed a limit of £30.  The Minister said in his response on Committee Stage that he did not think this was the appropriate Act in which to make such provision and it should be done in a courts Act rather than in this Act.  However, this Act makes express provision for obtaining support payments for dependent children by mothers who are getting inadequate payments from the fathers of such children.  It replaces the Affiliation Orders Act which previously contained the basic legal framework for obtaining such payments.  It now appears that the Minister has acknowledged that the financial limits that exist in this legislation can be changed.  On Committee Stage I urged the Minister to increase the expenses set out in the Bill for other matters.  For example, at the time of making an affiliation order or a maintenance support order for a dependent child, be it for a sum of £20, £30, £40, or £50 per week, the courts can also make other orders.  They can require the father of a child to pay to the mother expenses which are incidental to the birth of that child.</P>
    <P>The Courts Acts of 1971 and 1981 increased the limitations on the amounts that could be ordered in that regard.  This Bill prescribes the amounts of money the court can order when making provision for expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  Originally it prescribed limits of £500.  I urged the Minister on Committee Stage to substantially increase those limits.  We will deal with his amendments on these matters at a later stage.  He has now come back to the House and is amending the sum that the courts can <Col N="957" /> order with regard to expenses incidental to the birth of a child and also with regard to other expenses.  If a child, tragically, dies the father can be required to contribute money towards funeral expenses. The Minister is dealing with this aspect though not adequately.  He is seeking to provide a lower sum than I believe should be provided.  However, I will deal with that matter at a later stage.</P>
    <P>When a court case takes place with regard to maintenance support payments for a dependent child, following this Bill's enactment, whether those payments are for a child born within marriage or outside marriage, the court will make two types of orders; it will make an order for a weekly or a monthly support payment plus an order stating what lump sum should be paid to the mother in respect of expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  It is not logical to say in this Bill we can ensure that adequate amounts are provided for expenses incidental to the birth of a child but we cannot ensure that adequate maintenances orders can be made by the District Court.  I urge that the Minister accept this amendment which seeks to ensure that where support payments are sought for dependent children the District Court limit is increased from £30 to a very modest sum of £50.</P>
    <P>The limit for a spouse's support is currently £100.  The court would be allowed to make an order up to £100 a week for a wife's support and up to £50 a week in respect of each dependent child.  That would ensure that unmarried mothers would have access to the cheapest form of litigation that has to be undertaken, that they could speedily come before the District Court and would not be forced into the more expensive and more lengthy procedures in the Circuit Court.  It would also take some of the pressure off the Circuit Court.  An increasing number of wives and mothers of children born outside marriage are currently bringing court proceedings for maintenance orders in the Circuit Court because the financial limits in the District Court are out of date and are irrelevant for many of them.  I presume it is the aim of the Government to ensure that legal costs <Col N="958" /> are kept to a minimum, that our court system functions as effectively and as efficiently as possible and that those who are dependent in society can avail of the most efficient and most speedy legal remedies that are necessary to alleviate financial hardship.</P>
    <P>If the Minister opposes this amendment I can only take it for granted that his view is that it should be made as difficult as possible for wives and unmarried mothers to get adequate support payments and that people will incur the maximum legal costs that can possibly be incurred.  There can be no logic in the Minister not supporting this amendment or in his saying that it would be more appropriate in a courts Bill and that maybe a courts Bill will come before this House in 1988, 1989 or 1990.  We can deal with the matter today in this Bill just as we can deal with the financial limitations on other types of orders.  The Minister is dealing with some of those matters in his amendments.  I urge him to approach this amendment in the same constructive and helpful way as he approached the previous amendment which I tabled and which is now being incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political issue or an issue that would give rise to any contention in most other parliaments in the world.  In most parliaments it would be seen as a constructive amendment to address an issue that needs to be addressed and to ensure that legislation is as effective and comprehensive as possible. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment so as to ensure that this Bill provides adequate protection for all children, those born inside and outside marriage, and that it provides proper remedies for unsupported wives and unmarried mothers in circumstances where the fathers of those children are refusing to make adequate and proper support payments for the benefit of the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable amendment and the Minister should take it on board.  The Labour Party support the amendment. There is no reason I can think of for <Col N="959" /> turning it down.  There has been talk about it being more appropriate to a courts Bill.  Maybe if one is to be orderly and logical about the matter that would be so but we could go through our whole body of legislation and find that we should be rationalising all sorts of legal measures to make them very neat and tidy but we should deal with the matter when it is on hands.  A reading of the Short Title of the Bill shows that it is perfectly within its parameters and ambit to authorise this increase for maintenance of a child from £30 to £50 a week. In circumstances where the father cannot afford to pay £50 a week or £30 a week the court will make the order in accordance with the father's means so this is only a maximum authorisation.</P>
      <P>It may be some years before the House gets around to dealing with a courts Bill or before the Minister gets around to introducing one.  It may never happen at all.  Even if a courts Bill is brought before the House in two years' time and if one accepts the principles that we should update the authorisation now, why condemn those families and those children to have to subsist on an outdated maximum of £30 a week which was laid down years ago and which has been totally eroded by inflation?  Why should they have to suffer for the few years that it will take for a courts Bill to come before the House for the sake of the Minister's neatness in the matter in so far as the legislation is concerned?  When the courts Bill comes before the House we can delete the matter from this Bill and incorporate it in the courts Bill.  To say that we should wait for a courts Bill is no reason for condemning those families and those children to having to subsist on £30 a week or less when the father is well off, is in an extremely comfortable position and would have no problem in paying £35, £40 or £45 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment has been put down and it is well within the parameters of the Bill.  The Minister could tidy up the matter later when he gets around to introducing the courts Bill but we should not ask these families to wait until then for <Col N="960" /> this increase.  It is most unfair and unnecessary.  It is a maximum provision only and whatever the maximum figure the court will award only what is within the father's means.</P>
    <P>Why turn aside from this point?  The Minister must know it is a perfectly simple valid point.  There is no possible basis for condemning families and children in cases where the father can afford an extra £10 a week or so to wait an extra two or three years or maybe indefinitely. We all know what the system is like.  We might not see a courts Bill which would alter this matter in the Dáil for a long time.  It is logical that we increase the provision in this Bill.  It is within the terms of the Title and why not accept it?  The Minister should take the matter on board and when the courts Bill is introduced he could then tidy it up.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to be realistic in his approach to this amendment now that the House has the opportunity to do something that will benefit some children and some families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The order in the House is such that at this stage we will not hear from the Minister until our contributions have been made.  For that reason we must try to guess, to some degree, what is in his mind.  There was a time when a helpful nod or a wink might have given us a hint but the Minister, Deputy Woods, is keeping his eyes downcast.  It appears the Minister will adopt the implacable approach that was adopted on Committee Stage in regard to this matter.  For that reason we must be firm about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all the reasons that have been advanced, it is a reasonable amendment to ask any Minister to consider.  We have to anticipate why it is that the Government will not accede.  The singular reason advanced on Committee Stage was that this was an item that did not arise out of discrimination and was not, consequently, appropriate to the Bill.  In the heading of the Bill the Minister dealt with the first two lines and Deputy Shatter and I brought him a little further down the Long Title to underline that this whole <Col N="961" /> area of maintenance was central to the provisions of the Bill and could clearly be addressed with in the confines of the Bill.</P>
    <P>No other indicator exists in the history of the legislation dealing with children born outside marriage that reflects more closely changing attitudes than the whole question of the level of maintenance for these children.  Deputy Shatter gave us a brief history.  In the 40 years ranging from 1931 to 1971 we were prepared to consider the paltry sum of 20 shillings weekly sufficient to support children born outside marriage.  As a young solicitor's apprentice I remember single mothers arriving at the office of the solicitor to whom I was apprenticed, child in arm, to collect the 20 shillings, sign the book and go home.  That was the state of affairs existing up to the seventies.  It was in part redressed in a meagre way in 1971 when it was increased to £5; in 1976 it was increased to £15 and in 1981 to £30.</P>
    <P>At this stage we are simply asking that we should address the matter afresh when we have the opportunity.  The point must be made that on Committee Stage the Government did not disagree with the notion that at this time a person applying could go to the District Court and expect a maximum of about £60.  We had to come down by £10 to facilitate a rediscussion. The Government does not disagree that it would be appropriate.  The single ground of narrow opposition is that we have not got the right, tidy Bill, as Deputy Taylor would call it, at this moment.  We are trying to deal with discrimination.  Surely it is discrimination to say to people that they cannot go to the most easily available court in the land to get a reasonable sum to maintain their children.  I understand that from the Government's point of view the sum is not in question; it is a question of when and where.</P>
    <P>The second point that arises from this proposed amendment is that it affords people in their access to court an opportunity of getting an order for a greater amount.  The point here is that where the parent has the means and the opportunity she can go to the Circuit Court and can <Col N="962" /> get an order for maintenance of a child in excess of the £30 that is currently fixed. It is, again, not a question of making an unfair rule and an unreasonable figure because if one goes further to the higher courts there is no limit to the amount of maintenance that can be awarded in a court on a weekly basis to the parent of a child born outside marriage.  What is central to this is simply the facilitating of access to the most democratic and easily accessible court, the District Court.  That would result in a considerable cost saving to the Government in terms of the administration of the courts.  In regard to costs, it is important to note that this amendment would not involve the Government in one iota of expenditure.  If anything, it would result in a saving.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government at this stage recognise this is not an unreasonable proposition and that it is an appropriate time to consider it.  The Minister should, as do the Government, recognise that inflation has left the sum of £30 behind and that it is time we brought the figure forward.  I urge the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were, in substance, debated on Committee Stage, as the Deputies have stated.  Both of them were opposed by the Minister on the basis that jurisdiction limits are a matter for a jurisdiction Bill and not for a Bill dealing with the status of persons. This is essentially a Bill designed to remove a discrimination.  The House, on a division, rejected the amendments on that occasion and supported the view taken by the Minister.  The Minister has not changed his view in the meantime and I do not think that any purpose would be served by taking up more of the time of the House on these amendments.  As the Deputies have mentioned, what is involved in this amendment is a change from £60 to £50 which does not alter the basic principle which the Minister made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned the situation of a rich man.  I would remind the Deputy that a rich man can be taken to the Circuit Court where there is no limit and where <Col N="963" /> ultimately he will have to meet the costs. Nevertheless the question of updating and reviewing these amounts is important. I accept that and I will certainly convey the renewed views of the Deputies on this matter to the Minister with a view to having an appropriate courts Bill brought forward without delay.  As the Deputies know, these are brought forward after certain periods, usually ten years, and there is an attempt made to cover the period somewhat ahead of the Bill.  With the rate of inflation in recent years it would seem desirable not to wait the ten year cycle from 1981 to 1991.  This could be done earlier and I will convey the Deputy's views on that to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Alan Shatter to reply to the debate on his amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the approach adopted by the Minister.  First, the Minister is acting on the advice of his officials and we have now had two Ministers in this House who have dealt with this Bill. This is a Bill of the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Social Welfare is taking it today.  I realise the Minister for Justice may have political problems of a different nature relating to a different issue which he may be dealing with at a private meeting in another part of this House.  That does not excuse the fact that this measure, which is a Justice measure, should meet with this sort of lame, contemptuous response to what is a serious proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments the Minister has made are, in all respects, incorrect.  The Minister says jurisdiction limits are normally dealt with in a jurisdiction Bill.  I anticipated the Minister would say that.  It is simply not true because the jurisdiction limits in regard to matters such as this have been dealt with in other types of legislation.  The Courts Act, 1971, increased to the princely sum of £5 the jurisdiction limits to make support payments. There was not a delay of ten years for the jurisdiction of limits to be next increased in the Courts Act of 1981. <Col N="964" /> Section 28 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of 1976 increased the sum that could be ordered for the support of a child born outside marriage to £15 a week.  Even that lame excuse for not supporting this measure is completely and utterly inaccurate, incorrect and untruthful.  I know the Minister does not intend to mislead the House; he is acting on the advice of his officials.  It is, however, misleading to suggest that these issues are dealt with only in a courts Bill &mdash; they are not. They were dealt with in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, because the view then was that the limits imposed by the Courts Act, 1971, were out of date.</P>
    <P>We had a Courts Act in 1981 and now we come to deal with the Status of Children Bill.  There is absolutely no reason these limits cannot be increased in this Bill because other financial limits are dealt with.  The Minister will have to address that matter shortly in his own amendment.  He says the House supported the view expressed by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, on Committee Stage.  The Fianna Fáil Party supported the view expressed by the Minister for Justice on Committee Stage. All other parties in this House, including some of the Independent Deputies, supported the view that the limits should have been increased.  It appears to be a particular view of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government that unmarried mothers and unsupported wives should not be allowed more than £30 a week for the support of dependent children in a District Court proceedings.  Those who have sufficient money to be able to afford to go to the Circuit Court in the view of Fianna Fáil should get larger sums of money for the support of their children. It is the Fianna Fáil view, however, that those who cannot afford lawyers' fees of an expensive nature should be confined to the District Court and that a legal situation should continue to persist whereby the District Court is deprived of the power to make adequate support payments for children born within marriage and children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> This is a fundamentally important issue, one of the most important issues in this Bill.  We are here trying to place children in a position of legal equality.  It is generally recognised that children born outside marriage start with additional disadvantages in that very often the funding is not available for second or third level education which is available to children born within marriage.  That is often the case because the father of the child born outside marriage is reneging on his responsibilities and the mother is struggling to care for her child and provide an adequate standard of living while often working and carrying on home duties without the support of the father.  The passage of this provision could make the difference between some children having extended to them the possibility of third level education or second level education after the minimum school leaving age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>I find it quite extraordinary that the Minister seems to regard it as something that should not be dealt with in this Bill. That is the most bureaucratic, gobbledygook response that one could possibly get to a serious issue.  It is the reason we have so much difficulty in this House in getting measures passed which deal with social reform, because of either the rather odd approach on occasion adopted by Ministers or the rather peculiar advice on which they rely.  One would have expected that the Minister for Social Welfare, who is aware of the difficulties in this area of unmarried mothers and deserted wives who have to rely on their allowances, would have wished to encourage a situation whereby the courts could make adequate support payments for dependent children.</P>
    <P>If this House since 1922 had never increased the financial limits in any legislation other than in a Courts Act, we would have some sympathy for the Minister's advice, although I would not accept that it is advice upon which he should act. Seeing that that is not the case, seeing that we have provided in ordinary legislation amendments to increase financial limits such as those contained in the <Col N="966" /> Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Minister's opposition to this makes absolutely no sense at all.  It can only be taken to mean that this Government lack any real understanding or compassion for the plight of deserted and unsupported wives or unmarried mothers who are seeking to obtain adequate sums of money to enable them to extend a reasonable standard of living to their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>And it would not cost the Government a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Taylor quite correctly remarked, this is a measure that does not cost the Government a penny. This is not asking that the State provide £50 a week, money it does not have.  It is not even suggesting, as Deputy Taylor says, that in all cases the courts will always order £50 a week; of course they will not.  In some instances fathers will not be able to afford that sum, but the reality is that in most cases nowadays which are brought in the District Court where an unmarried mother or a wife seeks a support payment for a child, because of current salaries and wage scales when the father is in employment the courts are making orders that are very close to or are at the financial limits.  It is quite usual now for orders of £25 or £30 a week to be made for the support of children born to unmarried mothers.  I have had the experience of some district justices indicating that if they had greater jurisdiction they would be making a higher order than £30 a week.  This Minister and Government are seeking to curtail the protections that can be provided for unmarried mothers, unsupported wives and children who are not being properly provided for by their fathers. They are doing it in circumstances which would not only not cost the Government money, but a curious result which would arise from this amendment is that it might save the Government money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many unmarried mothers represented through Government law centres in circumstances where the centre brings proceedings to seek support payments for a <Col N="967" /> child born outside marriage are currently having their cases brought in the Circuit Court but if this amendment is passed they could have them brought in the District Court.  That would save the Government the expenses incurred in employing barristers to appear in the Circuit Court. It would save the Government money in another way.  A mother who is currently getting no support payment and who brings proceedings in the Circuit Court, be she married or unmarried, may, pending the hearing of the court case, be in receipt of a supplementary welfare allowance. It may take some months before the court case is heard, yet if the mother could bring her case to the District Court and get an adequate sum the supplementary welfare allowance payment might have to be made for a much shorter period.</P>
    <P>Not only is this a measure which will not cost the State anything, which will provide greater protection for children, for wives and for unmarried mothers, but it will save the State money.  Even if one forgot about compassion and concern for those who are less well off, for mothers and children in circumstances where the father is refusing to provide support payments, if one looks at it in the cold light of economic reality there is a simple economic argument, from the State's perspective, which says that this amendment should be accepted.  It is quite extraordinary that the Fianna Fáil and Government view is that we should have one law for the poor and one for the rich, that unmarried mothers with very little money will be confined to bringing court cases in the District Court and that the powers conferred on the District Court will be curtailed in a way in which the Minister recognises they should not be curtailed.  Even the Minister has said in his response that he accepts there has been considerable inflation since 1981, that we should not wait another ten years, that perhaps, we should do this next year. The Minister is well aware that there is no legislation under preparation at present for a new courts Act which would <Col N="968" /> extend the financial limits of the courts. Considering the pressures that are on the Department of Justice in a variety of other areas there is no possibility that we will see any Government legislation on this matter in 1987 nor in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on the last occasion that the House rejected that the maximum should be £60, that we are now suggesting it should be £50.  The Minister's view is that the maximum should be £30 and that maximum has now become irrelevant.  The Government in opposing this measure are showing their true colours.  They are a Government who have no concern for women's rights, who have no concern for providing protection for mothers and who have no concern for providing protection for childre. They are a Government whose members when in Opposition waxed lyrical about children, both born and unborn.  A sound proposal is being made to amend the Bill which has widespread support, not just within this House but also outside of it, which would not cost the Government anything and which would ensure that mothers in particular have legal rights they can avail of inexpensively and speedily to ensure adequate support payments for their children but the Government are going to oppose it.  It is my intention to put the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6B.&mdash; Where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other and where the father is registered as the father of an infant in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987 and, where the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian, the father shall automatically be a guardian of the infant and no application by the father to be so appointed as provided for in section 6A of this Act shall be required.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate and earlier on Second Stage I drew attention to the fact that under the provisions of this Bill court proceedings must be brought in order for the father of a child born outside marriage to become the guardian of the child.  That seemed quite extraordinary and unnecessary in many different circumstances.  There are many instances where a child will be born to a father and mother who are living together in circumstances where socially they are regarded as being married to each other, although legally they may not be married. In such circumstances the mother may not only wish the father to be guardian but would consent to the father being joint guardian with her.  In those circumstances there would be no dispute between father and mother about joint guardianship.</P>
      <P>This Bill sets out in effect that, where the father and mother of an infant have not been married to each other, the court, on the application of the father, can by order appoint him to be a guardian of the infant.  The court in this instance will be either the District Court or the Circuit Court.  Rules of court can make special provision for determining an application under this section where the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian and if the father is registered as father in a register maintained under the Births and Death Registration Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider what this means for many couples in social terms.  Currently approximately 200 decrees of annulment are granted each year by the marriage tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church. Many people who have obtained Church decrees of annulment remarry another person in Church.  We have many couples &mdash; the total numbers are unknown &mdash; who are parties to such second marriages which according to their Church are marriages celebrated in the eyes of God. Canonically, spiritually, the couple are regarded as married to each other.  Very often they are regarded as married by the society in which they live.  The reality is <Col N="973" /> that most couples who remarry after a Church annulment are regarded by friends, relatives and acquaintances as a married couple.</P>
    <P>We tend to forget that in our civil law we do not recognise Church annulments. We do not accept in our civil law that the marriage of somebody to a third party following the obtaining of a Church annulment is a valid marriage.  We take the view that a person who obtains a Church annulment and marries a second time is still married in the eyes of the law to the first spouse, unless a High Court decree of annulment is obtained.  If a husband obtains a Church annulment and marries a second time, according to civil law he is still married to his first wife but according to the Church he is married to the second wife.  Most of his friends and acquaintances probably regard him as being married to the second wife.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare will often turn a blind eye and assume that his second marriage is valid.</P>
    <P>What happens to that husband when children are born of the second relationship? Is he automatically a joint guardian of his children under this Bill?  No, he is not.  If he wishes to be a joint guardian of his children that husband will have to bring court proceedings.  Presumably in those proceedings his wife of the second marriage &mdash; a wife according to canon law but not civil law &mdash; will be named as the defendant, even if she consents to the husband being a guardian.  The husband will have to issue court proceedings against the wife with whom he is living and to whom he regards himself as happily married, the mother of his children. He will have to ask the court to make him joint guardian of his child and hopefully the mother will come in and consent. They will have to employ lawyers to explain the procedure to them and issue the court proceedings.  The lawyers will charge legal fees for having the father regarded by the State as the joint guardian of children born to his wife and himself, children with whom he is residing in a family home.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of a more illogical legal <Col N="974" /> structure to incorporate in a Bill which is designed to place children in a position of legal equality.  The child born within marriage has an equal legal relationship to both mother and father.  The child born outside civil wedlock still does not have an equal legal relationship.  Whereas within marriage the mother and father are joint guardians, outside marriage the mother is a guardian but the father is not, unless he brings court proceedings against the mother.</P>
    <P>Many couples will not be able to incur the legal costs incumbent in bringing such applications.  Will the courts be able to cope with the numbers of such applications which could be brought if couples decided to incur these legal fees?  Could our courts be swamped with court applications? The law centres cannot currently cope with the demands on them because the solicitors there are overworked and the centres are understaffed.  Will they be able to cope with giving people advice and representing them in the bringing of such applications?  That is the position looked at from the perspective of a husband who has had his first marriage annulled in the tribunal of the Church and who marries anew.</P>
    <P>The problem has still broader implications. There are many couples whose marriages have broken down who do not get Church annulments but foreign divorces. Many of them get foreign divorces which are not recognised in Ireland and marry outside Ireland.  They then come back to Ireland living with a new spouse in circumstances where we do not recognise the marriage.  In their neighbourhood everybody regards them as married.  In many instances the Revenue Commissioners turn a blind eye and give them the benefit of the married person's tax allowances and tax benefits.  The Department of Social Welfare will often not look behind the marriage certificate to find out whether it is a valid marriage. What will happen to that couple when a child is born to them?  If the father wishes to be the joint guardian of his child, even if the mother consents, he will have to issue court proceedings, have the mother <Col N="975" /> named as a defendant and go to court.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the bounds of human ingenuity to devise a more sensible system.  Legislation placing children in a position of legal equality in many other countries contains a clause providing that where a couple are cohabiting or in circumstances where the couple are not cohabiting and the mother consents to the father being guardian, and where the mother and the father have agreed that the father be registered as the father of a child on a birth certificate, the father automatically becomes guardian.  Such a provision is contained in an Act dealing with the status of children and passed by the New Zealand Parliament in 1969 and it has been copied by many other countries. Why we have to provide this very peculiar and archaic procedure which seeks to preserve a difference between children born to couples outside marriage in circumstances where the couple agree that each should be a guardian of their child and children born to a married couple, I do not understand.</P>
    <P>We debated this issue at great length on Committee Stage.  We considered a whole series of amendments relating to this mater in our efforts to get the Minister to consider rearranging the Bill to cut out the necessity for such court applications. The Minister undertook to look at the matter and come back to us on Report Stage.  He said he would consider what other steps could be taken.  It seems to me that the Minister has not done anything about the issue because there is no amendment tabled in his name.  I anticipate that the Minister for Social Welfare will tell me that the Minister for Justice, who is not present, is unable to accept my amendment.  There is no logical reason why the amendment should not be accepted.  I predict, if my amendment is not accepted, that within a few years of the Bill becoming law an amending piece of legislation will be introduced in the House seeking to introduce a provision virtually identical to my amendment.</P>
    <P>In my view after the legislation is <Col N="976" /> passed Members, including members of the Fianna Fáil Party, will have couples from all over the country arriving at their constituency clinics expressing concern about this issue.  I am referring to couples who have remarried after Church annulments and where the father wishes to register and be named as guardian of the child.  Those people will be inquiring as to how they should go about having the father registered as the guardian.  I have no doubt that they will be outraged when told that they must involve themselves in court proceedings.  Many of those people have not been to a court and do not want to go near one or want to see lawyers. However, they will be forced into lawyers' offices and to get involved in court proceedings.  It is totally unnecessary that they should be required to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that it is futile to ask the Minister to accept my amendment. He may say it would be too easy to allow fathers to become joint guardians if he adopted my amendment, that the courts should exercise some degree of discretion over the matter.  I do not see that as a valid point.  In the case of a child born to a couple who know each other, where the mother wishes the father to be joint guardian and the father wants to be a joint guardian, I do not see why the courts should involve themselves.  If the child is at risk in any way, whether he or she is born to a couple who are married, or to a couple who are not married, our health boards have powers to deal with that problem.  A child will not be placed at risk by the father being named as joint guardian.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept my amendment although I do not expect to get a positive response from him.  I regret that I have to continue to say, as I did on occasions during the lifetime of the previous Government, that when we have debates on issues of a technical nature but which have a profound impact on the lives of a great number of people, on issues that should not be party political, we do not have a constructive legislative approach whereby it would be regarded as acceptable for Ministers occasionally to accept amendments <Col N="977" /> tabled by Opposition Deputies.  I welcome the fact that amendment No. 1 was accepted by the Minister but that amendment was tabled by me on Committee Stage and it could have been accepted then.  However, the Minister told us he had to consider it and we all know that meant that because the Minister had not tabled it he would not accept it.  He is willing to adopt it now and put it in his own name.</P>
    <P>We have a most immature approach to legislative procedures in this House.  I expect that as we go through the other amendments the Government will adopt the approach of opposing them all. However, I will keep pushing when we are discussing amending legislation until public opinion forces Governments of whatever political persuasion to start to regard what takes place in the House as a legislative process rather than something that is automatically part of a party political battle.  The measure before us is of no relevance in party political terms.  It is of a technical nature and people outside the House would not know a great deal about what we are debating.</P>
    <P>If my amendment is not accepted hundreds of men and women, hundreds of mothers and fathers, will be forced to get themselves involved in unnecessary court proceedings.  As the years pass, we will be talking about thousands of mothers and fathers finding themselves involved unnecessarily in court proceedings.  We may have the approach of the fathers concerned regarding the legislation as so ludicrous that they will not make the court application even though it may be in the interest of their child or children that they should be joint guardians.  If that happens children will suffer.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment although I must add that I am not optimistic that I will get a positive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a reasonable compromise on the question of guardianship.  There are various positions that might be taken up on this issue. It might be a line of argument to say that both parents automatically should equally be guardians of the children.  Provision <Col N="978" /> could then be made for the mother to apply to the court to take away the father's guardianship rights if he was not taking any interest in the child or was not involved.  It might be said that if the father involves himself with the child, or if the father and mother are living together for a fixed period, the father should automatically become the guardian. However, we are not making any of those statements; we are saying in the Bill that if the father is to achieve what is his natural right, to be a guardian, he has to go to court.  I do not know why we should compel him to go to court in every case.  It may be appropriate for him to have to go to court in certain circumstances but not in every case.</P>
      <P>If two adults who are living together have a child and agree that they should be joint guardians of that child &mdash; that is the most natural thing in the world &mdash; and put that agreement in writing, that ought to be enough.  Who else needs to be pleased?  Is it necessary to please me, Deputy Shatter, Deputy Barnes, the Minister or the Ceann Comhairle?  Who else is concerned?  The couple with the child are living together and want to be guardians of the child and there is nobody else involved once agreement exists.  If there is a dispute and the father is causing trouble, or is not showing any interest in the child, that is another matter.  The mother is not going to sign a written consent to say there should be joint guardianship in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we on about here?  What is the problem?  It seems clear enough.  Are we dealing with people under a disability who cannot be allowed to make a consent and come to their own arrangements regarding guardianship of their own children? This is the type of disability we would place on people who were insane or under age.  If we are saying the wife cannot sign because she is under age that is fair enough and I accept it, but if she is what we recognise in this House as an adult and in control of her senses &mdash; and so is the father &mdash; that ought to be enough.  Why do we have to say it is not enough that the parents of the child agree about guardianship but must still go into <Col N="979" /> court?  It is no good the Minister telling us he is making court procedure easier. For an ordinary person any court procedure has a measure of intimidation and difficulty about it.</P>
    <P>The present system of legal aid is totally inadequate to cover civil claims or civil applications of this kind, and that presents a difficulty.  It involves time and trouble.  Many people are nervous about the concept of a court, even a simplified procedure.  They fear the idea of court proceedings.  Why should any Deputy or Minister insist that when the parents agree on a course, they still must go into court?  I cannot see the reason for this.</P>
    <P>I raised this point on Committee Stage and the only signal I could get in response from the Minister was that the mother might be constrained to sign the consent under duress.  I suppose that is a possibility, but any paper she would be compelled to sign under duress would not be a binding document and she could bring a claim to establish that fact.  In any case, duress could also be applied to get her to sign the consent document as well as going into court and giving her consent to the application.  I do not see that possibility as a sufficient pressure to push them into court where adult parties consent to guardianship.</P>
    <P>There is too much unnecessary court involvement in this Bill.  This is one area where we should avoid courts, at least until such time as the Minister and the Government organise a full and free legal aid service in civil matters.  I recognise that in certain cases court proceedings are unavoidable, and that is unfortunate, but when they are avoidable in basic, obvious cases, then we should allow guardianship to set the family's position in order on the parents' signatures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated The Workers' Party's opposition to this amendment.  I said we would be concerned about the position immediately at, about, or shortly after the birth of a child born outside wedlock.  I said this can often prove to be traumatic and that elements of acrimony can exist at a <Col N="980" /> time when a mother is often found to be vulnerable.  I suggested that the amendment would be acceptable if a certain time had elapsed from the birth of the child.  What I had in mind as being acceptable was that this procedure could be embarked upon 12 months after the birth of the child.  By reason of the fact that the amendment has been introduced using the same wording as on Committee Stage, our position has not changed and for that reason The Workers' Party will not be supporting this amendment.</P>
      <P>I would agree with many of the points made by previous speakers.  It is important that we get away from the need for recourse to the courts as much as possible. There is no reason why, if adults are prepared to consent, they should not be facilitated with an informal, less costly procedure, avoiding courts entirely if that is possible to enable a registration or declaration of parentage to be acknowledged and registered.  However, as I said, in the absence of any alteration to the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter, we are happy to rely on the informal court procedure not involving the degree of complexity as has been suggested by some speakers under section 12 (3) (a).  For that reason we will not be supporting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was published many of us were struck by the amount of court procedure involved in bringing about the long awaited reform which we all want to see made as simple as possible.  Another point about this Bill is that it is more negative than positive in its approach.  If this Bill is to ensure the legal acknowledgement and status of all our children and the encouragement and approval of having the father face up to his responsibilities as a parent taking joint guardianship with the mother, it should be worded to encourage this rather than placing unnecessary obstacles in the way. For all the reasons the other speakers mentioned &mdash; such as overcrowded and even closed free legal aid centres because of over-burdened case loads, because of the intimidation and the awe in which many couples hold the court &mdash; if parents <Col N="981" /> want to take full responsibility for their child, they should not feel they have to go through a court procedure to do so. This is the most natural and encouraging supportive way for parents not alone to behave but to be allowed to behave.  Yet, in this Bill we have a total denial of that positive element we all want to see in this legislation.</P>
      <P>This was fully thrashed out on Committee Stage.  I believe everything in this Bill should be positive.  There are elements in this Bill which seem to be unique to this country, one of them being the difficulties which many parents find themselves in because we do not have civil divorce.  Apart from the other constraints and denial of rights to couples who find themselves living in situations which Deputy Shatter explained and defined, we now wish to put a second and further burden and denial of the same rights to them as to those whom we acknowledge as being married.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that Deputy Shatter could quote other countries which have freely allowed this type of guardianship to be adopted by the father without having to go through court procedures. New Zealand, since 1969, has been independent enough, open enough and trustworthy enough to allow the parents, without legal complications, to make up their own minds and has encouraged them to form relationships and full guardianship. Ireland does not give the same freedom of choice or the same legal acknowledgement to second relationships, second parenting and second families as is given in most of the rest of the world.  Most other countries need this type of positive legislation because of the difficulties experienced legally and indeed socially at times by the couples defined by Deputy Shatter.  Not alone should we at least accept such legislation in this country, we should positively discriminate in favour of those couples because of the difficult legal position in which they and their children find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other element which Members of this House should take seriously is the <Col N="982" /> type of authoritarianism which pervades our legislation.  Ordinary citizens are not deemed to be independent and mature enough to make personal decisions without the intervention of legislators or the courts.  When will we trust our own people and make laws which will allow them to act with autonomy and independence in their own right?  There is a psychological dependence which is very negative and at times downright destructive. This legislation condones and supports such an attitude.  Along with the authoritarianism goes a paternalism which I resent.</P>
    <P>I take the senstitive point which Deputy McCartan made and he did so in good faith in regard to women acting as if they had not mind or will of their own after the birth of a child.  This continues the myth perpetuated that a woman in these circumstances is some kind of hysterical or mindless creature who needs to be protected.  If safeguards are incorporated they will apply to the minority. Why should we bring in negative, complicated and costly legislation to address itself to the minority of cases where a mother may need to be safeguarded? I reject the allegation that women are less mature, less independent-minded and less caring of their rights and the good of their children.  Other Members have asked if we are going through some kind of a farce every time we go through the various stages of legislation in this House. Why do we bother using time, effort, printing and paper to bring in amendments on Committee Stage when the Minister soothes us by saying he will consider them on Report Stage?  In my optimism and naiveté, I believed the Minister for Justice when he said he would give consideration to the very valid points made by members of all parties on this side of the House.  I fully expected the amendments on Report Stage to be accepted or amendments in the name of the Minister to be put down.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter said, the legislation in this House can no longer continue to be treated as farcically as at present.  It is opposed for the sake of opposition, the expertise and experience on this side of <Col N="983" /> the House, particularly in the complicated and sensitive area of family legislation, being denied or ignored.  The Minister for Social Welfare, in response to a former amendment which was not accepted, hoped that legislation promised would go some of the way towards reforming what was needed in that amendment.  Considering the slow, sluggish, and at times frustrating, path that legislation takes through this House and the Seanad, everything possible to encompass within the legislation we are at present addressing should be accepted with alacrity and energy because God knows when the next reforming legislation will be allowed in the House</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to address himself to this amendment for the valid reasons given and to allow people to have some say, independence and maturity in their affairs.</P>

      <P>He considered the arguments made on Committee Stage.  It is very interesting that Deputy Shatter spoke about the political differences in this regard because the previous Government came to exactly the same conclusion after considering the matter.  When the then Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, spoke in the Seanad she also supported the Minister's conclusions.  Of course, this is a different time and people are entitled to take a different view. However, it is odd that it was not an extraordinary provision at that stage. When the Minister came to examine this matter following Committee Stage he came to the same conclusion.  Deputy Taylor said that at least until there is a simplified and inexpensive court procedure &mdash; he was obviously thinking <Col N="984" /> along similar lines, of the need for an informal procedure, which is the direction in which the Minister is going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking that as meaning inexpensive, without going into the legal aid system.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan was happy to rely on the informal procedure.  In that he is correct, as action on the informal procedure has already been taken.  The Court Rules Committee were asked as early as January this year to make the rules for the Bill and particularly for the informal procedure referred to in this part, to be installed before the Bill comes into operation.  This procedure was debated at length in the Seanad and is now well under way.  In Part 1 Section 1 (2) (b) it is stated that</P>
      <P>Parts II to IX shall come into operation six months after the passing of this Act or on such earlier day or days (not being earlier than one month after such passing) as may be fixed therefor by order or orders of the Minister for Justice, either generally or with reference to any particular Part or Parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of allowing the six month period as a maximum was to ensure that the informal procedures would be in place before these measures came into operation.  Needless to say, the rules of court are made for each of the different levels in the court but the Minister for Justice must concur in their making before they become law.  Each rules committee consists of judges of the appropriate court and representatives of both branches of the legal profession under the chairmanship of the president of the appropriate court and they have a wide discretion in specifying procedural matters subject to the concurrence of the Minister.  The rules committee have already been asked in anticipation of the passing of this Bill to consider what rules of court may be necessary under this and other provisions of the Bill.  It is for the <Col N="985" /> rules committee with their experience of the practice and procedure of their respective courts to determine how the informality required will be given effect. Deputies who are relying on that procedure can be happy that the procedure is well under way, that urgent attention has already been given to it by the previous Government and by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage the question of a person's guardianship is very serious.  The appointment of a person as guardian can affect every aspect of a child's upbringing and welfare.  It is generally accepted that where a child's financial future is concerned there should be a hearing to ensure that the interests of the child are secured.  We see this principle in action every day of the week where settlements agreed by the parties in an ordinary running down case must be agreed to by a judge where an infant is concerned while no hearing is necessary where the parties have reached the age of majority.  In relation to agreements dealing with maintenance and property settlements for a child, section 8 of the 1976 Act and the new section 8A of that Act at section 20 of this Bill give effect to this principle. It is considered necessary to have a court hearing where mere money or moneys worth is involved.  It is surely all the more important to have the court consider the matter when other less tangible but often far more important aspects of the child's welfare are at stake, such as religious and moral upbringing, education and his or her physical and social welfare generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that in the case of a child whose parents are not married to each other, the appointment of the father as the child's guardian is of sufficient importance to require that the matter be placed before the court so that it can be considered whether the appointment is in the interests of the child.  I am aware that there are many cases where the father is a loving father and shares in providing a stable family environment even though he and the mother of his children are not married to each other. While the Minister has no desire to <Col N="986" /> encourage the institution of legal proceedings, however informal, where this can possibly be avoided, he remains convinced that even in the light of such cases it is advisable that the court should be asked to approve the appointment of the father as guardian because of the seriousness of the issues for the child.  The Minister has given a great deal of consideration to this matter and he was very concerned about it and recognised the genuine views presented by Deputies on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said at that time guardianship is a very important responsibility as a guardian has the destiny of a child in his or her hands.  It is important that the fact of guardianship be ascertainable by the public at large, that a public and verifiable record of the relationship of guardian and child be available.  There must be some means by which people involved in the child's upbringing, such as doctors and teachers, may be able to check from public records who is the guardian of the child where there is doubt about it and important decisions must be taken about the child's welfare.  In the case of the child of a married couple the fact of marriage and of birth on which the guardian-child relationship is based are matters of public record.  In the case of a testamentary guardian, the will which makes the appointment also becomes a public document.  Where a guardian is appointed by the court, the court records will show this.  In the case of a child whose parents are not married to each other, the births register points to the mother as sole guardian of the child.  If the father were to become guardian following entry of his name on the births register and the mother giving her consent in writing, there would be no public record of this transaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to an important point when he pointed to the acrimony that can be there at certain times and the fact that the mother may be vulnerable.  The Deputy felt that the danger period here would perhaps be the first 12 months.  However, there is nothing to show that the vulnerability may not last longer.  It is to guard against <Col N="987" /> someone taking advantage of her vulnerable position that a proper hearing should take place.  If the father were to become guardian following the entry of his name on the births register and the mother giving her consent in writing there would be no public record of that transaction. One way of giving such a document the status of a public record would be to have it registered as a rule of court in much the same way as an agreement between spouses for maintenance can be registered under section 8 of the 1976 maintenance Act.  Registration of the court implies approval by the court.  If a court is to approve such a document it must in arriving at its decision consider the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  The Minister was prepared to consider a provision along those lines but there seemed to be very little distinction between that and what he is proposing at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister feels that where parents enter into an agreement which involves the provision of maintenance for a child or a property settlement which will affect the child's interest, court approval is necessary to ensure that the child's interests are secured.  This is concerned with the child of the family but section 20 of the Bill proposes a similar provision in the case of a child whose parents are not married to each other.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great pains on Committee Stage to consider this matter in detail.  I can assure Deputies that since then he has done likewise.  Nevertheless in the interests of the child he feels that the way in which he is approaching it is the best.  In many cases, the child, his mother and his father, may be living in a marriage like situation where the father shares <i>de facto</i> guardianship with the mother.  This does not mean, however, that if the father's position as guardian of his child is to be put on a legal footing it should be done in a way which circumvents the safeguards that a court hearing, however informal, offers for the child's welfare.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill enables the court to give proper consideration to all the <Col N="988" /> relevant factors in each case including, in an informal hearing, where the mother's consent was free and informed.  The Minister has also considered a point which was raised concerning the inclusion of guidelines in the section.  It is not possible, in his view, to formulate any such guidelines which will not either be so restrictive as to exclude otherwise suitable cases, or else so loosely expressed as to be capable of admitting otherwise unsuitable cases.  The wide variety of circumstances which can arise from case to case means it would be futile to attempt to guide the court in any more particular way than that set out in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which is in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant,...is in question, the court in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is defined in the Act as comprising the religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social welfare of the infant.  For these reasons the Minister decided to proceed with the informal arrangements which we have mentioned and he is opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of his long comments the Minister for Social Welfare, unknowingly, highlighted one of the most idiosyncratic implications in this amendment, one which I had not yet mentioned during this stage of the debate but I mentioned it at earlier stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that there are a number of ways in which someone can become the guardian of a child.  In our law at present a couple who are married to each other and who have a child are joint guardians by virtue of their marriage being valid.  The husband and wife, as mother and father, automatically become joint guardians as our laws stand at present.  The position will remain unchanged if this Bill is enacted in its present form.  The mother of a child <Col N="989" /> born outside marriage is automatically the sole guardian.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows the father of a child born outside marriage to become a guardian jointly with the mother by making a court application and by getting the court's approval to becoming a guardian. The mother who is currently sole guardian, with the court's approval, can have the father made a joint guardian.  The Minister says it is in the interests of the welfare of children that, even in circumstances where a mother consents to the father becoming a guardian, the court reviews the matter to ascertain whether the father should be joint guardian.  He emphasises that point as a matter of some significance.  Inherent in that point is the suggestion that fathers of children born outside marriage are generally not reputable people and that, generally speaking, they should not be guardians of their children.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary for courts, in circumstances where the mother and father agree, to check out whether the father should be a joint guardian when it is not suggested&mdash;and I would not suggest that it should be the case &mdash; that, if a child is born outside marriage, before the mother becomes a guardian she should be checked out to see if it is in the interests of the child.  We have here an inherent discrimination against fathers instead of legislation providing for equality seeking to encourage the father of a child born outside marriage to play a role as father both socially, parentally and legally. There is an inherent bias based on an assumption that fathers of children born outside marriage are generally disreputable people even in circumstances where the child is born to a couple following a Church annulment and a second marriage.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting we should have a procedure whereby for any person, married or unmarried, to become the guardian of a child born to them, the court should check out their bona fides? Is that the type of intrusive legislation the Minister is suggesting, because that is the only logically consistent approach on the <Col N="990" /> basis of what the Minister has said so far? Let us develop the point.  The Minister apparently is of the view that fathers of children born outside marriage should only become guardians if the court approves, but that is not currently the legal position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made reference to the concept of a testamentary guardian. A testamentary guardian is someone who becomes guardian of a child because they are named in the will of a deceased parent to be the guardian.  If the mother of a child born outside marriage makes a will today &mdash; as she can do &mdash; she can name in that will the father of the child to be testamentary guardian on her death.  She can also name a variety of other people, who might be unrelated to the child, to be testamentary guardians.  On the mother's death the father of the child automatically becomes guardian because he is named in the will as guardian.  No court application is necessary.  No court decision has to be made and no review has to be undertaken regarding the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is enacted in its current form &mdash; which appears to be the case taking into account the views expressed by The Workers' Party and the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; while the mother is alive she cannot by consent have the father of her child made a joint guardian with her without court approval.  But when the mother is dead she can nominate the father to be guardian without any court approval being required.  That is even more illogical than some of the other anomalies that will arise, which I have pointed out, if this legislation is enacted in its current form.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of what the Minister has said, and with respect to Deputy McCartan of what he said, that is also extraordinarily offensive to women and mothers.  This idea that a woman who gives birth to a child becomes by virtue of her pregnancy or birth a simple-minded, semi-mad creature, who is unable to make rational decisions about anything for a week, a month, a year or, according to the Minister, even for years after the <Col N="991" /> birth of her child is the most extraordinarily offensive and demeaning approach to adopt to women here, or indeed anywhere else in the world.  The sort of remarks that have been made in this regard in this House would be a cause of outrage in other parliaments in Europe.  There is this assumption that if a women gives birth to a child and within a few days of the birth says: &ldquo;Yes, this is the father of my child; yes, I want him to be joint guardian with me&rdquo; the woman either has become so feeble-minded or has gone so insane that she could not possibly make a responsible decision.</P>

      <P>There may be an excuse for Deputy McCartan &mdash; he has a parliamentary party of four male members &mdash; there may be an excuse for him. Admittedly the Fianna Fáil Party do not have too many women Deputies but they have enough to know, or perhaps the Minister has discovered that some of his colleagues, having given birth to children, have become feeble-minded and gone mad.  I have not seen that in this House at any stage.  Perhaps the Minister knows something I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look behind what is being said in that respect.  There is an inherent prejudice involved in the comments that have been made with regard to a woman consenting to the father of her child being a joint guardian shortly after the child having been born.  It is a most extraordinary view.  I do not understand why people advance these sorts of views but there is, on occasion, a need to examine what can only be the logic behind what is being said.  That seems to me to be the <Col N="992" /> logic of what the Minister and Deputy McCartan have said.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the Bill, as originally published, did not contain the provision I am endeavouring to have inserted.  That is very true.  The Bill before the House was substantially amended as it went though the Seanad; there were a number of improvements effected to it.  We should remember that Ministers are as good as the officials who advise them in technical areas of this nature.  Let us accept the reality of that in this House, that this Bill, when originally published, had the correct sentiments but many of its provisions were legally defective. The former Minister, who dealt with it in the Seanad, agreed to accept a series of amendments which were made to it and there have been amendments made in this House.  The Minister &mdash; or his colleague the Minister for Justice &mdash; has begrudgingly on Report Stage now accepted some of the amendments we sought to get him to agree to on Committee Stage.  We are engaged in a legislative process.  We are trying to tease out how we can improve the Bill.  It has become apparent only as this debate has progressed that this particular approach &mdash; requiring all fathers of children born outside marriage, no matter what were the circumstances, to have to get court approval to become joint guardian with the mother &mdash; is very illogical in the context of many circumstances in which children are born outside marriage, that indeed it might be preserving a discrimination in our law rather than removing it, that hidden behind it is a very odd view of fathers of children born outside marriage and apparently &mdash; as it has emerged today &mdash; an equally odd view of the state of mind of mothers when they give birth.</P>
    <P>I do not make any excuse for having tabled this or some of the other amendments I have tabled, some of which the Government have accepted.  For the Minister to talk in this House about people who expressed one view 12 months ago now expressing a different view is walking on very thin ice and on very sticky ground.  If I were the Minister <Col N="993" /> I would adopt the approach that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.  Indeed the glass about the Minister's house is very fragile and the views he expressed on every issue of a social or economic nature 12 months ago are very different today.  Were I the Minister I would be very cautious about drawing anyone's attention to the comments made with regard to any issue in this House by any member of his own party, including himself.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill we are engaged in the legislative process to ensure its provisions work.  I want to examine this informal procedure the Minister lauds and some of the problems inherent in that.  The Minister quotes the Guardianship of Infants Act.  Let us assume an application is made by a couple following the birth of a child to a district justice.  The father of the child has previously got a Church annulment and has married the mother of the child in Church. According to the civil law their second marriage is not valid though it is according to the laws of the Church.  The mother wishes the father to be joint guardian with her and the father does also.  They go into the District Court and lodge an application.  The district justice has to determine, on the basis of the child's welfare, whether the father be named as joint guardian.  He has to consider the moral, religious, physical and social welfare of the child.  The district justice has this couple in front of him, who are recognised by their Church as being validly married to each other, who are accepted by friends and relations as being married, but whom the law does not recognise as being married.  What decision is that district justice to make on the basis of welfare?  Is he going to say: &ldquo;Here we have a couple living in sin: they are engaged in an adulterous relationship; it is contrary to the moral welfare of the child of whom this man wishes to be joint guardian; here is a man committing adultery, living apart from the wife he married civilly; I do not believe it is in the interests of the welfare of this child that this father be joint guardian.&rdquo;  Is that the approach the court or district justice <Col N="994" /> will take because it is a very real possibility?</P>
    <P>Could the district justice take the matter further?  Could he say that, in the context of this couple, not only is their marriage not valid but that the father is engaged in a criminally bigamous act, that he is going to refer the relevant papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions to have the father prosecuted because he has come into open court and admitted he has celebrated a second marriage in circumstances in which his first marriage exists?  Could the district justice go on to say: &ldquo;I do not believe it is in the interests of the welfare of this child that this father be made joint guardian because clearly he is a person with a criminal background and is now a person liable to seven years penal servitude for committing bigamy&rdquo;? Could the district justice say that it is not in the interests of the child's social welfare that the child have this adulterous and bigamous father named as joint guardian because people in the neighbourhood and relations might talk about it; that if the school authorities learned of it it would be contrary to the child's social and educational welfare? Or would the district justice say: it accords with the child's religious welfare that this man be named as joint guardian because, although in the eyes of the State he is not married to the mother, in the eyes of God he is?</P>
    <P>I do not know how district justices around the country will take decisions in such circumstances.  I do know that if that couple are happily living together and bringing up young children, it is probably the view generally of people outside this House that they should be joint guardians of their children.  If the father acknowledged he was father, if the mother consented to him being joint guardian, if he was registered as father in the Registry of Births, then I do not see any reason why the couple should place themselves at risk of that sort of court procedure in determining whether there should be joint guardianship.  I believe it is in the interests of the welfare of children that the father who is father in those circumstances <Col N="995" /> be automatically joint guardian.</P>
    <P>What will lawyers advise people in those circumstances, people who are living together in what are socially regarded as marriage relationships &mdash; either because they are simply co-habiting after one or other of them has had a failed marriage or because they are living together having got a Church annulment and having remarried, or because they have got an unrecognised foreign decree of divorce and their marriage is not recognised in this State? What will lawyers advise them to do?</P>
    <P>I think a lawyer would have to advise a father in those circumstances making application to a district court to be named as joint guardian, that he cannot anticipate the district justice's reaction.  He cannot anticipate what decision might be made on the welfare issue and, even more dangerously, he cannot guarantee the father that the particular district justice may not decide to refer the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a prosecution to be brought against him, he having clearly celebrated a second marriage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of providing a positive, legislative framework within which to encourage the fathers of children born outside marriage to not merely participate in the day-to-day upbringing of their children but to be joint guardians of their children, we are presenting a framework within which there are a number of inherent dangers and in respect of which this House can have no certainty on what basis decisions will be taken by district justices, be the decision formal or informal, when a father seeks to have himself named as a joint guardian.</P>
    <P>What will happen is that fathers will play a game of judicial roulette. Some district justices will be helpful and sympathetic but others will not be.  Many of them will bring their own subjective views of life to bear on determining whether it is in the interests of the welfare of a child that a particular father should <Col N="996" /> be named as guardian.  The system that this Bill proposes is extraordinarily foolish. I regret that the Minister cannot support my amendment.  I find the approach of The Workers' Party, who present themselves as a progressive force in Irish society, a little surprising but considering that they did not support certain other amendments to the Bill I am not too surprised at this stage.</P>
    <P>There are many assumptions made with regard to fathers and mothers in the context of the provisions of this Bill which are anachronistic and insulting.  I regret that it is clear that this amendment will not be passed.  However, I believe that many of the problems that I have outlined in this House will mean that in the not too distant future there will be great pressure for this issue to be brought back to this House to be dealt with in a more logical framework.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if a mother consents there will be no public record of the father having become a joint guardian. Rules and ministerial orders can be made under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts which are dealt with also in this Bill.  There is absolutely no reason, in circumstances where a father is inserted as the father on the form to be filled in in the context of a child born outside wedlock, a mother could not equally at that time sign a consent to the father being joint guardian.  That could be done in the context of a simple statutory instrument under the relevant births and deaths registration Act.  If this was done there would be a public record; the mother's consent would be recorded, the father's paternity of his child would be on the birth certificate and this would cut out the necessity for court proceedings of any nature whatsoever.</P>
    <P>If any difficulty arose in the future between a mother and father with regard to a child, it could be resolved by the courts by way of proceedings either one of them would bring under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  This is what happens at present when difficulties arise between mothers and fathers, be they married or unmarried, relating to custody, access or guardianship disputes <Col N="997" /> over children.  There is no reason for dealing with this in the way it is dealt with in the Bill.  The framework we suggested is far more logical.  I would like to thank Deputy Taylor for his contribution and his support for this proposal.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;The Act of 1964 is hereby amended by the insertion after section 11 of the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11A.&mdash;(1) Where the High Court grants a decree of nullity in respect of a void or voidable marriage if there is a dispute as to the parentage of any infant born to either party to the nullity proceedings the Court may following the making of such decree upon the application of either party make a declaration of parentage with regard to any such infant.</P>
      <P>(2) Where the High Court grants a decree of nullity in respect of a void or voidable marriage the Court may, upon application being made to it, exercise the jurisdiction conferred by section 6A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act and by section 11 of this Act.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section into the Status of Children Bill and in doing so would amend the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  There are a number of provisions in the Status of Children Bill which amend the Guardianship of Infants Act.  They all appear in Part III of the Bill.  This amendment seeks to insert a new section in Part III of this Bill which would become section 11A in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> The Status of Children Bill seeks to set out a framework for dealing with the position of children born outside marriage. In doing so, it prescribes the circumstances in which the relationship between a child, a mother and father will give rise automatically to the mother and father being joint guardians.  Generally speaking a mother and father are joint guardians only if they are validly married to each other.  However, the Bill within its framework effectively seeks to preserve the guardianship of a father in circumstances in which a marriage is annulled.  If a marriage is a voidable one, under the provisions of this Bill a father in effect will preserve his position after the decree of nullity.  If it is a void marriage a father will also preserve his position in law provided he reasonably believed, at the time the marriage took place, that it was valid.  There will, of course, be some instances when a marriage will be declared void in which there will be no possibility for anyone to take the view that the father reasonably believed that the marriage was valid. That is one of the problems this amendment seeks to deal with and I will refer later to the manner in which it deals with it.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where a marriage is declared null and void because it is either void or voidable, the High Court can at present make a decree of annulment but has no power to make any other sort of decree.  There have been a number of cases in recent years where young children have been born to couples whose marriages have been declared null and void.  In some cases up to three or four children have been born to such a couple and I am aware of a number of cases where at least one child was born.  At present, when a decree of annulment is granted it terminates the marriage.  Following the granting of a decree of nullity all sorts of disputes may arise with regard to the child of a couple.  There may be disagreement between a mother and father as to which of them should have custody of the child.  If it is agreed that the mother should have custody there may be disagreements as to what access <Col N="999" /> the non-custodial parent should have.  If a mother has custody of a child a father may want visitation rights, to have the child spend time with him at week-ends, reside with him or go on holidays with him during school holiday periods.  A mother and father may not be able to reach agreement as to what access or visitation rights the non-custodial parent should have.</P>
    <P>If a couple who are granted a decree of annulment have one or more young children the question may arise as to what support payments should be made for the support of those children by the non-custodial parent.  If a mother has custody of the children she may wish the father to make some payments towards the support of the children.  Earlier today we dealt generally with maintenance.  As things stand, the difficulty is that if the High Court makes a decree of annulment it cannot resolve any of these problems. If there is a dispute about parentage of the child and a mother claims that her former husband is not the child's father, the High Court cannot, following the completion of the nullity proceedings, make an order deciding parentage.  It cannot make a declaration that the former husband is the child's father and it cannot make a declaration that a third party is the child's father.  At present, the High Court cannot, following the grant of a degree of nullity, decide a dispute about custody and cannot make an order that a mother or father should have custody of a child.  The High Court cannot resolve a dispute relating to the general upbringing of a child as an ancilliary matter to be dealt with following the granting a decree of nullity.</P>
    <P>The High Court at present cannot resolve a dispute about access arrangements or visitation rights for the father. The only way these problems can be resolved, if the couple cannot reach agreement, is by bringing new court proceedings. The mother, if she wishes to get support payments, may have to bring affiliation proceedings in the District or Circuit Court.  Following the enactment of this Bill she will have to bring maintenance <Col N="1000" /> proceedings in the District or Circuit Court.  If there is a dispute over custody or access new proceedings which are quite separate will have to be brought in the District or Circuit Court.  Even if this Bill is enacted in its current format, following the grant of a decree of annulment if any disputes should arise relating to support payment, upbringing, or custoday of a child, who as a result of the nullity decree is regarded as being born outside marriage, the couple will be forced to institute at least one, if not two, additional sets of court proceedings in different courts.  They will have to start afresh in a new set of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>That is a totally illogical and nonsensical approach.  It will cause couples to incur a great deal of unnecessary legal expense.  It means that a couple who have been through the trauma of a nullity case in the High Court will be forced to have another court contest in the District or Circuit Court before a different judge who probably knows nothing about the family background and who, particularly in the case of custody or access, will have to hear identical evidence to that already presented in the High Court during the nullity proceedings.  Many of the same witnesses will have to be brought back into court again.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their report on nullity of marriage recommended that following the grant of a decree of annulment the High Court should have ancillary powers to make all orders that are necessary for children, be it for support payments, guardianship or custody issues.  The last time we debated this issue on Committee Stage I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister, who raised certain technical issues on the drafting of the amendment I had tabled.  The Minister acknowledged there was a problem but indicated he would consider bringing forward his own amendment.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a new amendment on Report Stage, which takes into account some of the technical issues raised by the Minister on Committee Stage in that it would now be possible under this amendment <Col N="1001" /> for the court to do a number of things.  If this amendment were passed, following the grant of a decree of nullity if there was a dispute about the parentage of a child, the High Court could automatically deal with that dispute without new proceedings having to be issued.  In addition, the High Court could deal with disputes over custody or access.  If there was a dispute about maintanence and the mother sought to get support payments from the father of her child, the High Court could also deal with that.  It would mean that instead of the couple having to start all over again in a new set of court proceedings, a judge who had already learned of the entire family background and who had adjudicated on the nullity matter would then be equipped legally to make decisions on issues relating to children and support payments for children. If a dispute were to arise in regard to the parentage of the child, the High Court Judge would be allowed to make a decision on the issue as well.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very logical and sensible amendment.  It seeks to implement one of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.  I know this matter has been drawn to the attention of the Department of Justice for urgent consideration. The Association of Family Lawyers which comprises of a number of solicitors and barristers who specialise in and regularly appear before our courts in family law matters have, as far as I know, made a submission to the Department of Justice saying that it is necessary to enact a provision such as this so that the High Court, following the making of a nullity decree, has all the necessary ancillary powers and jurisdiction to deal with these issues.  I understand that the association have been told that currently nullity legislation is not being prepared and, accordingly, the matter will not be dealt with in the short term.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not just relate to nullity legislation, but to what this Bill seeks to do.  The Bill seeks to make provision for support payments, custody, guardianship, and parentage declarations for children born outside marriage, and <Col N="1002" /> seeks to place them in a position generally of legal equality.  This amendment is designed to place all children in position of legal equality.  Once a decree of annulment is granted the legal theory is, whether a couple have lived together for any period after the celebration of their marriage &mdash; be it one or 25 years &mdash; the decree of annulment is taken to mean that they never have been married and their children, until the enactment of this Bill, would be regarded as illegitimate under our current law.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to support this amendment.  I hope it will be recognised as being a constructive provision seeking to deal with some of the anomalies that exist in our current law and seeking to ameliorate some of the difficulties created by our current law.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, has acknowledged that this issue should be dealt with.  During the course of Committee Stage he seemed to accept that my suggestion was completely sensible.  I do not know what advice the Minister has received from his officials in the Department of Justice, because anyone who has any experience of how the courts work in the area of family law, or anyone who has had any involvement in nullity cases in which there are children born to the couple who are seeking the annulment decree, knows there is an urgent need to enact this provision.  Perhaps I will be surprised; the Minister may tell me that he supports the amendment.  However, on the basis of approach we have, I presume if the Minister had supported the amendment he would have tabled a similar amendment as he would not want to have it passed in the name of an Opposition Deputy.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister prove me wrong and support the amendment, that because it has been drafted in this way he did not feel the need to table a similar amendment in his own name, I will happily apologise and congratulate him on adopting a constructive approach to the legislative process.  However, I am not optimistic that that approach will be taken.  I hope the Minister will prove me wrong, because I have absolutely no <Col N="1003" /> doubt that anyone who has any knowledge of this area, or anyone who has seen the difficulties that arise in practice for couples following the grant of a decree of annulment, would tell the Minister that this is a sound and sensible provision that would greatly improve the current legal position.  It would reduce considerably legal expenses that couples with young children could and do incur following the grant of a nullity decree.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is not unique. Not only has it been proposed by the Law Reform Commission but the legislation of every European country currently makes provision for such powers to be conferred on their civil courts when dealing with nullity cases.  Legislation worldwide makes such provision, whether one looks to New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Nigeria or the various states of the United States.  I hope that the opportunity which this Bill gives to us to deal with the issue in this way will not now be lost because if we do not deal with it today I anticipate it will be many years before we have another opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected that the Minister and the Department of Justice would have welcomed this amendment with acclamation.  As outlined by Deputy Shatter, it goes a long way on every level towards ironing out problems, towards avoiding costs and particularly, and this is what all of our legislation must be about, towards easing the position financially and emotionally for couples and their children who have to go through this process.  I am constantly reminded when debating these amendments of the title of this Bill which is the Status of Children Bill.  As has been said, it is about reinforcing the position of children, particularly those who through no fault of their own find themselves outside the legal boundaries that exist already. As Deputy Shatter has said, when the High Court declares a marriage null and void the children who have been part of that legal and valid marriage find themselves outside that boundary.  That is not <Col N="1004" /> taking into account the emotional trauma of everybody concerned in having to go through the process of a High Court case. That must be heeded very seriously if we are going to set up, to help in the Department of Justice in particular and to help us as legislators in general, such agencies as the Law Reform Commission to explore these matters and to make recommendations on them.  When one considers the process we have to go through when legislation is needed urgently, the least we can do when such reports are made and such recommendations are given to us is to take them seriously.</P>
      <P>One of the most important points made by Deputy Shatter is that people dealing with these matters on a regular basis, the association of family lawyers, have made recommendations and asked that this matter be treated as urgently as possible. They, in their daily experience and practical dealings with it are encountering obstacles that they find indefensible.  I would have believed that the introduction and acceptance of this amendment would be an answer to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, to the requests of the association of family law-years and to the whole force and direction of legislation as drafted by the Minister and the Department of Justice.  It seems incomprehensible that when we have an opportunity to adjust an area that is causing such a problem we do not act upon it with alacrity.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Shatter, I await the Minister's response.  I feel it is almost impossible that he could respond with anything but the affirmative on this matter.  If we take this matter on a practical level, leaving aside the rights of the couple and the children involved, above everything else in this country&mdash;and I am sure this would be supported by the Department of Justice &mdash; would be the introduction of legislation in this House that would depend on less complicated, less costly and less drawn out court cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems almost incredible that when we have an opportunity to amend the legislation we would insist that High Court proceedings would not be allowed <Col N="1005" /> to be expanded to deal with this important and fundamental area.  As it stands, there is considerable cost involved as well as the emotional trauma of the family who have to experience again what they have painfully gone through before.  I am sure the Minister will agree we should ensure that the people who have to go through such an experience should suffer as little pain and as little cost as possible. Taking into consideration the fact that all our courts are clogged up already and the process that one would have to go through at District Court or Circuit Court level, we should deal with this matter now.  Our primary consideration should be for the parents and in particular the children involved.  I look forward to the Minister's acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a relatively new Deputy in the House, the approach and anticipated response of the Minister will make me very slow to accept future undertakings on Committee Stage that a Minister will agree to review or consider a matter for Report Stage.  When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage the Minister for Justice had very little to say in opposition to it and seemed to accept the wisdom of the amendment and the whole point of it, which was a matter of streamlining and putting in order what appeared to be an oversight.  It appears the failure to respond indicates the Minister was being a little dishonest and calculating in his approach if there was not an oversight and his Department and officials have not considered this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot begin to presume or anticipate what will be the response of the Department officials or the Minister to the suggestion that we should include this amendment, in the Bill as proposed.  Its inclusion seems to be totally and utterly sensible.  It gives us an opportunity to add to existing legislation a provision which would entitle the parties bringing proceedings for nullity to ask the court to make other orders that would naturally flow from the consequences of a declaration of nullity.  As the law stands, the parties will have to retreat to their respective lawyers and start afresh proceedings <Col N="1006" /> relating to issues of parentage or otherwise.</P>

      <P>A more relevant comparison would probably be between IDA cost per job approved and LEDU cost per job promoted. Under the IDA's small industries programme the cost per job approved in 1986 was £4,921.  This compares favourably with the overall LEDU average of £4,890.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above, there is a need continuously to strive to achieve the best value for the taxpayers' money.  It is for this reason that I have asked my Department to carry out a thorough review of the IDA's small industries programme. I expect to be able to announce the results of this review in the very near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the way in which it is intended to achieve the target of 20,000 extra jobs on average in the manufacturing industry, as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 18, 31 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The first and most important element in the Government's strategy for job creation is to create an environment conducive to investment and economic growth.  This the Government have done through their rigorous action on the public finances.  The significant results which have already been achieved with lower interest rates, low inflation, a stable exchange rate, higher growth and a reduction in the debt/GNP ratio will directly aid the creation of new employment and thus lessen the very high level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's strategy for employment creation is being developed primarily on a sectoral basis and will build upon the more competitive environment generated by the Government's fiscal and monetary policies.  Because available resources are strictly limited, the Government intend to concentrate them on those sectors where there is the best hope of generating real sustainable jobs and where the best use can be made of our indigenous skills and resources.  The Government have identified the following sectors as having the best potential for extra job creation: marine, food, tourism, horticulture and forestry.  Ministers have been appointed with specific <Col N="1013" /> responsibility in each of these areas to ensure that their full potential is realised.</P>
    <P>In so far as manufacturing industry is concerned, the objective of Government policy is to create approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, with the actual provision accelerating as the programme policies take effect.  The target for new jobs to be created in 1987 with assistance from the IDA and SFADCo is 12,600.  In addition, it is expected that approximately 5,000 to 6,000 extra jobs will arise through recoveries of jobs previously lost in industry.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of sectoral strategies for selected areas of manufacturing industry and for which my Department has responsibility is being undertaken under the aegis of my Department.  These strategies will draw upon the work of the Sectoral Development Committee, which is comprised of representatives of industry, trade unions and Government.  These strategies will be based upon market research at home and abroad to identify development and employment potential; our natural resources; the new advanced skills in our workforce; the achievement of increased market share in selected sectors and markets.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other elements which are intrinsic to the Government's strategy to create employment and expand our industrial base.  These include the rationalisation of the industrial promotion agencies; giving greater priority to the market and technological orientation of indigenous industry through the expansion and growth of selected Irish companies firmly rooted in the economy; a shift in resources from the support of fixed asset investment to the upgrading of marketing, product development, R &amp; D and management expertise; the linking of State support to the achievement of specific employment targets; the establishment of trading houses to provide a new and effective export service to indigenous firms to help them to increase their share of overseas markets; the establishment of Ministerial Offices for Trade and Marketing and for Science and <Col N="1014" /> Technology and the promotion of investment from overseas designed to give greater emphasis to the integration of such investment into the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that, with the implementation of the Government's strategy and a continuation in the improvement of the cost environment under which industry operates, the targets outlined by Government will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for what must be the longest reply to any question that I have heard in my short time in this House.  It is a pity that in the course of that reply my question was not answered.  Does the Minister now agree that the IDA report which was issued in 1981 &mdash; and as far as I know the prospects to which they were committed in that report have not changed &mdash; mentioned 1,000 net jobs per year?  Has that changed in essence since then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the plan called for a target of 20,000 jobs per annum and that is the target.  The Deputy will appreciate that no target is set for job losses because we have clearly taken the view that trying to estimate offsetting job losses is a very difficult exercise.</P>

      <P>How can the Government make such categoric provisions for job creation without being able to make similarly categoric provisions in regard to prospective job losses?  Would the Minister agree that figures for job creation which ignore prospective job losses are liable to be very misleading and that in fact this is the case with virtually all the figures mentioned in the <i>Programme for</i><i>National Recovery?</i> Further, in regard to specific matters mentioned in his reply, may I ask the Minister if the proposed trading houses which he refers to are compatible with EC law and if he has received any communication from the Commission on that matter?  May I also ask if the proposed sectoral strategies to which he referred will be published and, if so, when the first of them will be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the prediction of job losses, we have perhaps all learned from the experience of the past. That is that between 1983 and 1986 there was an accumulative loss of 20,000 jobs. That decline occurred notwithstanding the job targets set in <i>Building on Reality,</i> which were between 3,000 and 6,000 per year for ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a much easier job, as the Deputies opposite will appreciate, considering the targets for four years that were extremely wide of the mark.  I appreciate how those targets were wide of the mark.  It was difficult to put your finger on what the job losses would be. That is the situation.  Perhaps the Deputies should consider that point of view. The Deputy's question about trading houses is elsewhere on the Order Paper today and I shall deal with it in due course.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be <Col N="1021" /> aware that since he put down the question the receiver has made an agreement for the sale of the stores in question which he notified to me under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  I have decided not to make an order under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 in relation to the proposal.</P>
      <P>In arriving at my decision, I had particular regard to the position of the former employees of H. Williams, and those employed in shopping centres in which H. Williams was the anchor tenant and whose jobs would be jeopardised by delay in having the stores reopened.  I received written undertakings that at least 18 stores, including four Quinnsworth, will reopen over the next six months, giving employment to 700 staff, with a further 75 jobs later in 1988.</P>
      <P>I also had regard to the position of suppliers and consumers who would wish to see as many as possible of the former H. Williams stores reopen quickly as outlets for grocery goods.  It seemed to me that this offered the best prospects for the suppliers concerned.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that part of this question at least has been overtaken by recent events.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that suppliers to companies such as H. Williams are adequately protected against sudden closures in view of the fact that, unlike the banks, they do not normally have access to the accounts of these companies? Would the Minister of State consider introducing legislation or a regulation which would enable companies supplying supermarkets to have sight of accounts so that their investment in these companies would be protected?</P>

      <P>I agree that those supplying any company are exposed but the Companies Bill which is at present before the Senaad will, when enacted, considerably strengthen company law, although it does not address that particular problem.  It is a complex one and I will certainly take a look at it.</P>

      <P>An indication has been given that the staff of H. Williams will be given preference in restaffing the stores.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear there will be job losses but much will depend on what will happen to the other 13 stores.  As the Deputy is aware, an undertaking has been given that 14 stores will be reopened, and a further two stores will be reopened some time in 1988.  As the Deputy is also aware, Quinnsworth have acquired four of the stores and they are going to reopen them, hopefully before Christmas.  That leaves an additional 13 stores and much will depend, quite frankly, on what happens to those stores and on the plans which the new owners have for them.  The only undertaking we have received relates to the 16 stores I have mentioned plus the four which Quinnsworth have acquired.  I encourage everybody involved in the remaining stores &mdash; if there is anybody involved in them at this stage &mdash; to reopen them. I would like to see them reopened as independent stores and trading as soon as possible but the Deputy will appreciate <Col N="1023" /> we cannot dictate to the owner in that regard.  I hope there will not be job losses. It depends on what happens to those stores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but I thought it would be a good idea if I replied to the questions in the order in which they were asked.  The second question was in regard to whether an inquiry was needed.  The public are aware now of the whole saga of H. Williams.  It has been put before the House.  Details I have given now, such as the number of stores, what is happening to them, who is owning them, represent the position.  There is a liquidator in place in H. Williams at the moment and he has statutory duties to finish out the liquidation of the H. Williams company.  Therefore, in that context an inquiry would not be sensible and I do not think it is necessary just now.</P>

There are many people with different roles in the collapse of the H. Williams operation.  All one can say with regard to the banks is that we have not concluded that any action is necessary there other than to advise both banks and customers of normal commercial caution.</P>

Would he agree that by not doing so he has compounded the problem in the grocery trade because of the imbalance created in that market, and has put at risk further the whole question of the suppliers in the market by increasing the control of the market by companies such as Quinnsworth and Dunnes who have nearly 50 per cent of the market between them?</P>

We will use the Monopolies and Mergers Act to ensure at all times that there is genuine competition in the market.  We are not anxious that any stores or multiples of stores would get an over-dominant position in the market. What is a dominant position we have to judge as best we can.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available regarding expenditure on research and development in Irish industry relate to the years 1983, 1984 and 1985.  The expenditure for those three years is as follows: 1983 &mdash; £48.48 million; 1984 &mdash; £61.94 million; 1985 &mdash; £70.70 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on research and development in the industrial sector has been increasing steadily since the mid seventies &mdash; albeit from a very low base.  I would expect this pattern to continue. There is an increasing awareness among Irish companies of the importance of research and development but a much higher level of investment is required if Ireland is to match the levels of such investment in competitor countries.</P>
      <P>However, it has to be recognised that the size and circumstances of many Irish firms, especially small firms, restrict their capacity to undertake R and D.  Indeed, the undertaking of in-house R and D by such firms may not be the most appropriate way to improve their process and product development.  In such cases it may be more appropriate to use instead such measures as: contracting out R and D to specialist research institutes, universities and RTCs; technology transfer arrangements and licensing agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the way in which Irish prices, excluding taxes, compare with the European average, at the most recent date for which he has statistics, in respect of (i) premium petrol, (ii) regular petrol, (iii) motor diesel and (iv) residual fuel oil; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the weekly <i>Oil Bulletin</i> published by the European Commission.  However, that bulletin itself points out that comparisons between prices and price trends in different countries require care and are of limited validity.  In particular, the prices quoted for other States tend to be those <Col N="1032" /> applying in main urban centres whereas the Irish prices apply nationally.  Moreover, it is not clear that Irish prices for gas and fuel oil reflect rebates and discounts available in the market which can vary from time to time.</P>
      <P>The extent to which Irish pre-tax prices exceed the European average has been reduced significantly since July last when I acted to reduce Irish prices to a more reasonable level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Irish prices have exceeded European average prices for a long period of time and there are reasons why this has been so.  Irish prices are based on the mean-Platts quotations for north-west Europe with additional elements in respect of Whitegate and costs arising from the structure of the Irish market, involving a significant number of stations with a relatively small throughput, with particular distribution and retail costs and margins related to this.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the findings in the EC price bulletin were sustained by the independent work of the National Prices Commission when they examined this issue?  Will he not agree that the Minister's reduction of 10p in the price of petrol last July in fact involved 2p of taxpayers' money in reduced tax, 6p in the ending of promotional gifts in most cases and only reduced the margin taken by the companies by about 2p?  Will the Minister accept that the present position of having 30 per cent higher tax excluded prices for petrol here is not acceptable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that an amount of work in this area has been undertaken.  The Deputy referred to the consultancy commissioned in 1983 by the National Prices Commission and he will know from his time in this office that that identified certain uneconomic factors which pertained to the Irish market and necessitated an upward adjustment of prices obtaining in the six major EC markets.  The Deputy is correct in stating that that identified <Col N="1033" /> certain areas relating to distribution factors and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the contents of the report of the National Prices Commission which deals with a whole range of what they call uneconomic factors that pertain to the Irish market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Among a number of other things.  The Minister's decision in July to reduce the price of premium grade by 10p per gallon did, as the Deputy will appreciate, close the gap between ourselves and the European average.  In fact, in the case of premium petrol the gap was of the order of 34 per cent before that decision and the Minister's decision reduced the gap to about 24 per cent.  In regard to the Deputy's question about the breakdown of the savings involved in the 10p reduction, I should like to tell him that we are making every effort to bring Irish prices closer to European prices.  We improved the position considerably by the Minister's announcement in July and we will continue to make every effort to close the gap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the petrol distributing companies were able to live within a 3 per cent deviation from EC prices in the early eighties and that the National Prices Commission in their investigation sustained that that was a viable position? Will the Minister agree that the way to tackle this problem is by a link to EC prices instead of involving his Department in the bureaucratic examination of price movements on a monthly basis?</P>

      <P>Perhaps that is the way it could be undertaken.  I am aware of the Deputy's good work in that regard while on this side of the House and I will have a close look to see if it will be practical to adopt his suggestion.  Nothing would please us more than to be able to link the price to one that does not involve Departments having to crawl all over it. That would be the easy thing for us to do.  However, the Deputy will be aware that in the report of the National Prices Commission a whole range of factors are listed such as freight costs, different retailing structures, the Whitegate factor, smaller loads and drop sizes and so on. We will have to look at those issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the plans, if any, he has to introduce legislation to regulate the activities of hire purchase companies, including those allied to the major banks, who are charging, in effect, interest of up to 40 per cent on borrowings, which institutions have mushroomed in recent times, some of them having been created by the banks themselves; if his attention has been drawn to the social trauma being caused by such practices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of companies extending hire purchase credit are controlled by the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1960 and by Part III of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  The Hire Purchase Acts provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that:</P>
      <P>(i)  a note or memorandum of the hire purchase agreement must be made and must be signed by the hirer;</P>
      <P>(ii)  a copy of the note or memorandum must be sent to the hirer within 14 days of the making of the agreement;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the note or memorandum must contain a statement of the hire purchase price and of the cash price of the goods to which the agreement relates, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> (iv)  the amounts of each of the instalments by which the hire purchase price is to be paid and the date on which each instalment must be paid.</P>
    <P>These provisions help to ensure that consumers understand the extent of the financial commitments being undertaken when entering into hire purchase agreements. The Hire Purchase Acts do not regulate the rates of interest that can be charged by hire purchase companies.  I would point out that hire purchase has virtually disappeared as a means of credit from the consumer credit market and has been replaced by personal loans from finance companies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the activities of companies allied to major banks.  These companies advance personal credit to consumers and are licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Their activities, including rates of interest charged, are governed by the Central Bank Acts, responsibility for which lies with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has prepared an order that will require all advertisements and notices which make reference to the cost of credit to indicate the true cost of that credit by means of the annual percentage rate of charge. The APR represents not only the rate of interest charged but also takes all other charges arising from the credit agreement into account.  Accordingly, it is a more accurate representation of the true cost of credit to the consumer than the rate of interest.  The order has been approved by the Seanad and is on the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I believe that this order will help consumers make valid comparisons of the true cost of credit available from different sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the order the Minister referred to will be introduced soon.  In view of the existing legislation to which the Minister has referred and of the genuine concern that exists about the <Col N="1036" /> extremely high true interest rate charged by some of the finance houses I should like to know if there has been any intervention by the Department in the last year or two arising from complaints, from the Minister's inquiries or from his feelings about the carry-on of some finance agencies and lending houses.  I am anxious to know the rate of activity in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The action taken has been to advance with this order and the legislation which will make it necessary to publish the true rate of interest.  It is most important to ensure that people know the rate of interest they are being charged.  We are moving ahead with that quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any concern at the referral by banks to their own sister finance companies and the limit on true interest rates? Do they come within the Minister's ambit of concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear in mind that banks are controlled by the Central Bank Act.  I must point out that the Central Bank has responsibility in this area.  Our aim is to ensure that the consumer is protected as far as possible and at the end of the day the best protection for the consumer is to ensure that they can shop around and see the true rate of interest.  Up to now one of the difficulties has been that people did not know what rate of interest to compare the rate of interest quoted with because a plethora of interest rates were calculated in a different way.  The order, and the legislation, will ensure that there will be one common rate of interest to be charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Government have no interest in the area of consumer credit as witnessed by the fact that the order to which he referred has been on the Order Paper of the House since 31 March?  Will he agree that the Government have not seen fit in that time to provide time to put the order through this House?  Will he accept it from this side of the House that, if the <Col N="1037" /> Government wish to do so, we are prepared to agree to have the matter put through following a debate of no more than two hours?  Will the Minister agree that it is about time he did something about this matter?  He should stop the talk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an exciting tour de force.  The Deputy will be aware that the order has been put through the Seanad.  The Government have been looking for this order but, apparently, the Whips have not been able to reach agreement on when to debate it.  We are ready to put the order through the House, if the Whips can agree.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many hire purchase companies have switched to offering personal loans because those receiving personal loans have less protection than they would have under a hire purchase agreement?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that <Col N="1038" /> there has been a greater interest in personal loans and a movement away from hire purchase, but there are two reasons for that.  First, in the case of personal loans the rate of interest is more visible and secondly, in most, if not all, the rate is more attractive.  The question of protection is a matter for the Central Bank but I will certainly have a close look at the comments which have been made in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister outline the nature of the communication sent to the various companies which were to go to Libya this week and the nature of the directives sent to those companies? <Col N="1041" /> Would he tell the House if a directive was given to Coras Trachtála Teoranta, the body responsible for promoting international trade, in recent weeks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Government took a decision not to proceed with the trade mission to Libya. Consequently Coras Tráchtála Teoranta did not proceed with the mission and no Government personnel went either.  I understand some of the companies have gone or intend going, and that is their right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, I am looking for information and nothing was divulged in his last response. Would the Minister inform me of the nature of the communication sent to Coras Tráchtála Teoranta as well as the nature of the communications sent to the companies making up the trade delegation which the Minister intended leading? Would he tell the House the Government's reason as given to the companies involved for not going ahead with this trade mission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 25 companies which were anxious to join a trade mission to Libya contacted Coras Tráchtála Teoranta.  Subsequent to recent developments the Government decided that the trade mission would not proceed. The Government statement was published for everyone to see.  Coras Tráchtála Teoranta informed all the companies that there would not be a trade mission to Libya led by a Minister or by Coras Tráchtála Teoranta and that it was for each company to make their own decision.  As I said, some companies have gone to Libya and others have not gone yet.  The latest information I have is that these companies &mdash; I do not have the exact number &mdash; still intend going.  That is for each company to decide.</P>

      <P>I will try again.  Did the Minister, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, communicate with these companies orally or in writing? Did he <Col N="1042" /> give the Government's reasons for reaching that decision?  Is it now Government policy to encourage trade to and from Libya?  Have the Government made a decision given the public activities of the Libyan Government against this State and the clandestine activities of Libyan nationals in this country?  In view of all this, may I ask the Minister if the Government have made a decision that henceforth we should not encourage trade to or from Libya?</P>

      <P>For the third time, I will answer the Deputy who does not seem to understand.  The commercial activities of private companies trading with any other country are the concern of the companies. I have no intention of interfering with these companies or putting them at a disadvantage because this country depends so heavily on exports &mdash; two out of every three jobs depend on exports. Like every other State inside and outside the EC, private companies in Ireland have their own way of doing their commercial business and I have no intention of interfering with their right to do so.</P>

    <P>The increase in the resources available to the combined offices of director and examiner is reflected in the financial allocation to these offices; the allocation for the current year, 1987, is £385,000 as against an outturn of £253,000 in 1986 and the estimate for 1988 is £390,000.</P>
    <P>When the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before this House, is enacted, the post of examiner will be abolished and his functions transferred to the retitled Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  The offices of the examiner and director will be amalgamated and will have a combined staff of 26 as in the tabular statement.  This amalgamation is expected to result in greater overall efficiency and is intended to ensure the integrated administration of related policy measures.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the amalgamated staff, which includes a corps of inspectors will be sufficient to ensure the proper enforcement of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the increase in staff from 11 to 19 in the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs include price line inspectors and inspectors operating from both offices?  Is the Minister aware of the new responsibilities which have been assigned to this office, namely, food labelling, textile labelling, product safety, a whole new area of responsibility <Col N="1045" /> with competition policy related to statutory bodies, financial services and grocery orders?  Would he not agree that provision has not been made to deal with these matters?  This is the age old Irish solution where we bring in a law which cannot be enforced because there are no resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept what the Deputy said.  Naturally, every Department and every section in every Department would be delighted to have more staff.  The Deputy is only too well aware of the need to curtail public expenditure. I want to draw his attention to the fact that the staff of these two offices have been shielded form the staff embargo in the last few years.  It is not true that they are not being given enough staff to carry out the job.  The whole idea of bringing these two offices together under the Director of Consumer Affairs is greater efficiency and the more efficent administration of the legislation.  I am satisfied they have the resources to do the job.  It is quite clear from the figures that they have been shielded and have not suffered despite the fact that overall staffing in the Department of Industry and Commerce has been reduced by 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the past month one member of the staff took a career break and an embargo was put on filling the post?  In view of that, will the Minister not consider redeploying some of his staff out of the administrative structures of his Department to ensure that all these areas of competition and consumer policy are properly enforced and implemented?  Will he give a commitment to the House that he will consider such redeployment in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that a member of the staff recently took a career break.  I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that earlier two additional staff were taken on.  I will certainly keep the situation under review but I have already stated that the administrative staff of the Department have been <Col N="1046" /> reduced by 15 per cent which does not leave much room for manoeuvre. However, the Department is run in a very efficient and competent manner and if any resources can be used to better effect I assure the House that will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give details of the resultant effects in the operation of State marketing bodies such as An Coras Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council arising out of the 1988 Book of Estimates and the curtailment of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>CTT's grant-in-aid for 1988 is £20.022 million.  This is a reduction of £3 million on 1987.  The allocation to CTT under the special subhead for the market entry and development scheme remains unaltered in 1988 at £1.250 million.</P>
      <P>The impact of this reduced allocation to CTT in 1988 will be offset by the fact that CTT are obliged to increase their fee income in 1988 by at least £1.3 million. CTT have already announced the commencement of their new range of charges for services such as market investigation, market feedback, market information, market introduction, agent and distributor assessment, field assistance, office facilities, interpreter and courier services.  The Deputy will recognise that the charges involved, which range from £50 to £400 according to location and level of services, are justified in the current financial situation.</P>
      <P>I have also issued new guidelines to the board of CTT, included among which is the need for that organisation to become increasingly self-financing.  CTT have responded positively to this new idea and are currently looking at ways in which they can increase the income derived from their services to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CTT fully recognise why their grant is reduced and remain confident that they can continue to provide a comprehensive range of supports, information and <Col N="1047" /> development services to exporters, particularly those in indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Government have reconfirmed their commitment to domestic marketing by maintaining the Irish Goods Council's allocation for 1988 at £1 million.  The Irish Goods Council intend to maintain their current range of activities and level of services to industry in 1988 by meeting any increase in overhead costs, which they estimate will be relatively small, through modest increases in their charges for services and through minor reductions in the level of direct contributions which they make to projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State now admit that, despite all the rhetoric and PR in the marketing area, utilising these services is like taking a taxi, with the meter running continuously for every consultation, in regard to the new fees which have been introduced? Will he also agree that there is a great danger that these organisations, who are now depending on fees for their incomes, will switch their services towards remunerative and lucrative areas instead of concentrating on other services which are more important and necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused by the Deputy's remarks.  The doors of CTT and the Irish Goods Council are fully open to Irish exporters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and Irish business people.  It is not true to state that every service is charged for.  Consultations can take place and the meter is not ticking.  However, I am sure if the Deputy thinks about it he will agree that successful exporters should reimburse a State organisation.  It is a businesslike idea to which the board of CTT are fully committed.  It will mean that CTT can go after the areas from which they can get the best possible return on exports.  It is a radical idea and the Deputy should support it.</P>

Money will not be a difficulty but I am sure the Deputy agrees that CTT should aim to earn as much revenue as possible from successful exporters.  If the services of CTT are not successful in regard to a small exporter, there is no charge for most of the aspects of that service.  However, where an exporter does very well with the help of CTT, I intend to ensure that that exporter will pay a certain dividend to CTT for their services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take oral Question No. 28, priority Question No. 50 and written Question No. 84 together.</P>
      <P>I asked the Restrictive Practices Commission in July last to carry out a study of the alleged difference in retail grocery prices between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom (including particularly Northern Ireland), and to report their findings to me.  I have received that report and I am arranging for its early publication.</P>
      <P>The commission's report examines the position disclosed in the surveys referred to and finds that there are a number of factors which can account for different price levels North and South.  These include different VAT rates, payment of MCAs, differing freight costs and distributors' margins, marketing practices for individual products, differing product promotion or profit mix.  In addition, the retailers' overall gross margin expectations in particular cases may be entirely different.  One retailer may have a policy of low margin and high volume, while another may concentrate on service, variety, quality of goods, hygiene and so on and expect to obtain a higher gross margin as a result.  Furthermore, in comparing the two markets there can be differences in timing of price increases or reductions and exchange rate differences, including the necessity to buy currency forward, can all bring about differences in prices between one market and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the comments which have been made in relation to this matter did not make satisfactory allowances for <Col N="1050" /> factors such as these in arriving at conclusions regarding price differences.</P>
    <P>I expect to be able to publish the commission's report very shortly and this will allow for a further and more informed discussion on the questions which have been raised.</P>
    <P>A recent television programme on grocery prices referred to specific items and I have asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to investigate the detailed terms and conditions under which these specific goods were purchased and imported so that I can consider what further action might be necessary in relation to them.  I am awaiting the examiner's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the examination by the commission, will the Minister say whether any items were removed from the list which was originally subject to their consideration?  Was there any interference with the list or diminution of the range of products?  The publication of the report is interesting but will not do anything about the problem.  What action will the Minister take in this regard and when?  Is there an indication in the report that there is a problem in this area because many of us feel that there is?  The place is cluttered with reports, all saying the same thing and no one knows what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Some places may be cluttered with reports but my office is not one of them.  Action is taken on the basis of the recommendation of each report and I assure the Deputy that it will be taken also in this regard.  The report is with the publishers at present and the minute it comes back to me it will be circulated.  I cannot grasp too clearly what the Deputy is getting at.  Is he insinuating that I removed any items from the list for investigation?  If anyone else did I am not aware of it and if he gives me further information I will follow it up. In the television programme a small cash and carry in the north east of County Donegal was compared with a major cash and carry in Belfast.  That is not really comparing like with like.  Notwithstanding that fact, there were items which were being grossly overcharged in <Col N="1051" /> the Republic.  Already action has been taken and specific items have been reduced in price.  One item selling at a unit cost of £9.68 was reduced to £5 odd. That is the sort of action we are looking for and the sort of action we will continue to get.  In relation to other specific items that appear to have a gross margin installed, I have power under the Groceries Act to ask for a report within 14 days. Those reports are now in the examiner's office and whatever action is needed to be taken will be taken.  The prices of some of the items have already been reduced because of action following the report.</P>
      <P>I will continue to take action when necessary but I must emphasise that one must compare like with like.  The examiner's survey is more widely representative than some of the other surveys because it surveyed approximately 100 items whereas some of the other surveys picked out specific items. If one does a survey of a major multiple store, say in Dundalk, as against the same store owned by the same company in Newry, one will find that the differential is approximately 3½ per cent.  When one takes the additional input costs here, for energy and so on, that margin or an even higher margin could be justified.  We must be representative in relation to these examinations.  I cannot make <i>ad hoc</i> decisions based on allegations.</P>

    <P>In page 9, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;The Act of 1964 is hereby amended by the insertion after section 11 of the following section:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;11A.&mdash;(1)  Where the High Court grants a decree of nullity in respect <Col N="1116" /> of a void or voidable marriage if there is a dispute as to the parentage of any infant born to either party to the nullity proceedings the Court may following the making of such decree upon the application of either party make a declaration of parentage with regard to any such infant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the remarks made this morning, it is a salutary lesson perhaps learnt too late by me not to accept in future an assurance from a Minister that by Report Stage he would look into a matter and give it careful consideration because it seems to me that no consideration was given by the Minister in respect of the amendment.  If there had been the slightest consideration I am sure that we would have had a ministerial amendment in terms close to the amendment suggested.  Over lunch I had the opportunity to check on the record of our discussions on Committee Stage and it was brought to my mind that a group of amendments had been taken together, six or more of equal and varying importance. Towards the end of the debate when Deputy Shatter was moving that group of amendments he reverted back specifically to the point encapsulated in amendment No. 4 because it appeared that the Minister in his wide-ranging response to those amendments had not specifically addressed the issue in question, that is the power of the court to make ancillary orders on a declaration of nullity at the request of either party.  The Minister said on Wednesday, 28 October 1987, as reported at column 1453 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputies Shatter and McCartan that I will look into the matters mentioned by Deputy Shatter and <Col N="1117" /> supported by Deputy McCartan.  I will see what I can do on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister can do nothing and will not make an effort to try to address this very sensible straightforward proposal that does nothing more than seek to streamline the procedures before the courts and make them available in one set of proceedings rather than willy nilly in various different jurisdictions and by various initiating writs. A court that makes such a fundamental ruling that a marriage should be declared null should have power to go on then and make other important ancillary rulings that would of necessity have to arise from the order of the court being made.  I would simply ask the Minister to perhaps consider meeting the intentions of this proposal because it has nothing but merit pursuing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed.  The amendment is in similar terms to Deputy Shatter's Committee Stage amendment No. 15.  The Minister for Justice has had an opportunity of giving this matter some further thought, as he indicated he would do on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should say that the Minister for Justice is neither opposed to nor in favour of the idea that the High Court, when pronouncing a decree of nullity, should, in the same proceedings, have a general power to make ancillary orders concerning property, maintenance or guardianship of children or other matters which may need resolution in the wake of the decree.  The Law Reform Commission made recommendations on these lines in their report on nullity of marriage.  The Minister will be putting his legislative proposals, arising out of that report, to the Government in due course.  Such legislation would constitute a more appropriate context in which to consider the question of ancillary orders in nullity proceedings generally which might include questions of concern to the purported spouses only <Col N="1118" /> and might not necessarily concern the children at all.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we can deal with matters only as they concern children.  It would be quite inappropriate to tackle the question piecemeal by providing, in this Bill, for ancillary orders dealing with one aspect in relation to children only and in nullity legislation for orders dealing with the parties themselves and other aspects affecting the children.  The whole issue of ancillary orders will be examined in the context of whatever proposals the Minister puts to Government arising out of the Report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Apart from those general comments I might point out some technical reasons this amendment is opposed.  Subsection (1) of the section proposed in the amendment envisages an application by one of the parties to nullity proceedings for a declaration of parentage.  This is inappropriate since the procedure for declarations of parentage provided for in Part VI of the Bill is designed to be invoked only by the person whose parentage is at issue and, then, only in circumstances in which no other relief is sought.  In other proceedings, such as guardianship &mdash; where a person's parentage is put in question &mdash; the court dealing with the proceedings can determine the matter for the purpose of those proceedings. There is no need, therefore, to invoke the special procedure provided for at Part VI of the Bill.  Furthermore, there appears to be an inconsistency between subsection (2) of the amendment and the provisions of sections 9 and 11 of the Bill since, under those provisions, a father of children of a voidable marriage, or in some circumstances of a void marriage, is to be the guardian of those children simply by operation of law. It is obviously inconsistent that the Deputy's amendment should give the High Court power to appoint him guardian. The amendment would apply in all cases where a decree of nullity is pronounced. It does not exclude those cases in which, by virtue of the provisions of section 9, the father would already be guardian.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> Having regard to the general considerations I have outlined and the technical points I have raised I would invite the Deputy to withdraw his amendment. I might add that, in relation to matters such as this one, the Report of the Law Reform Commission was presented in 1982.  The previous Government proposed a scheme for the implementation of that report in March 1985.  A White Paper or consultation memorandum was published in May 1985 with a draft Bill, inviting public reaction.  This Bill was introduced early in the summer of 1986. It went to the Seanad and was passed in January 1987 following substantial changes. If we are to become involved in more change at this stage then it will involve considerably more time.  A large number of interrelated provisions, such as succession, maintenance, guardianship and others would have to be considered and, of course, that would take time.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that the Bill is comprehensive, as it stands, and that it would be important to get on with it at this stage.  It represent a major social advance.  Any other interrelated proposals that might be considered at this stage would certainly lead to the requirement for more discussion at various levels.  That could have the effect &mdash; which I am sure the Deputy would not want to bring about&mdash;of delaying what is a major social advance.  For those reasons the amendment is opposed and I would invite the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I understand why the Minister hesitates in his response because most of what he has just said is so nonsensical as not to merit a reply.  First, the position is that there is no inconsistency <i>vis-à-vis</i> this amendment and the remainder of the Bill.  The Minister is well aware of that.  The amendment confers a power on the courts where, following nullity proceedings there is a dispute about parentage, to resolve that dispute.  If there is no such dispute there is no reason for the courts to be involved in it.  Where there is a dispute about custody of children, or maintenance support payments <Col N="1120" /> for children it also allows the court to do that.  After this Bill has been passed the courts will be able to do all of those things.  But the difference is that, if we do not amend this provision, at the end of nullity proceedings, people who have obtained a decree of annulment, former husbands and wives, will have to start new court proceedings all over again in the District or Circuit Court.  It seems almost pointless to repeat this but it appears that either the Minister or his officials simply do not understand what is being said here or are refusing to understand what is being said here.  It is a question of improving a Bill that has already been substantially improved during its passage through the House. The Minister's reasons for not supporting the amendment are the most miserable, irrelevant excuses that have been given to date for his refusing to accept a variety of amendments that have been tabled to this Bill.</P>
      <P>These amendments have nothing to do with transfer of property rights, succession rights or whatever, nothing to do with any of that.  I do not know why the Minister raises those issues.  Possibly he does so either because he does not understand what he is talking about or his officials do not understand what they are talking about and the advice they are giving him.  I really do not believe it is tolerable that this House should have to constantly put up with the sort of response we have got to this proposal.  It makes a farce of the proceedings we are undertaking in this House.</P>
      <P>This amendment, if accepted, will not require any great consultation of a complex nature with anyone.  All it will do is reduce legal costs, give the courts a more coherent jurisdiction and approach in dealing with problems that arise when a marriage has broken down and provide protection for children.  This Bill is about providing protection for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says we should not tackle this matter piecemeal.  His approach is that we do not tackle it at all, that we bury our heads in the sand and pretend there is not a problem.  This is not a <Col N="1121" /> piecemeal approach.  It is simply trying to provide a codified approach and a comprehensive system based on what will be the law in any case after the Bill is passed but to enable one court to resolve all matters without mothers and fathers having to troop through two or three different sets of courts, in two or three different sets of court proceedings, to unravel the family circumstances resulting from a marriage being annulled.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that his colleague, the Minister for Justice, is neither opposed to nor in favour of what is being proposed.  The reality is that, apparently, he has no view on it at all.  He has referred to the various reports that have been published.  He did not refer to the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  The Minister for Social Welfare was a member of that committee.  I would hope that the Minister for Social Welfare would recollect, from the various oral hearings heard, that a number of groups suggested that when a nullity decree is granted the courts should be able to make support payment orders for dependent children and resolve custody and access disputes.  It appears the Minister <Col N="1122" /> does not remember that and it is correct that we remind him of it.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission with regard to the law of nullity is another day's work.  It recommends comprehensive statutory provisions dealing with other issues but with regard to children what is recommended in that report coincides with what I am proposing. Apparently the Minister's view is that we should not do anything about this.  He produced a number of spurious reasons for suggesting that there is some technical flaw or difficulty with the proposal. Unfortunately, we engage in what I would describe as a caricature legislative process in this House and the Minister's response on this proposal typifies the facile way in which we deal with legislation both on Report Stage and on Committee Stage.  It is most regrettable and it is a great pity that we cannot have a more constructive approach which would help the people that this Bill is theoretically designed to help.  I intend to put the amendment.  There is no point in going back on the ground we have already travelled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 33, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated he would look again at the maximum amounts which may be awarded by way of lump sum order under the Bill in respect of the birth or funeral expenses of a dependent child.  Amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9 are the result of that consideration.  In these amendments the Minister has taken into account the change in the consumer price index since the limits were last fixed in the maintenance legislation of 1976.  The new maximum of £750 for each category is subject to an overall limit of £1,500.  Also contained is some allowance for future inflation.  I am satisfied I would not be justified in going beyond these limits.  It is no harm to point out that these statutory maximum amounts for lump sum awards apply in relation to any court exercising jurisdiction in this matter and are not just District Court maxima.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested on Committee Stage that at present the Circuit Court is not limited as to the amount it can award for birth or funeral expenses under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act of 1930.  I am advised that this is not correct and that the effect of the relevant provisions in the Courts Acts of 1971 and 1981 providing for jurisdiction in this <Col N="1126" /> regard is that the limits set for such awards apply in relation to all courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The original provision in this Bill proposes that when a mother seeks to get expenses ancillary on the birth of her child the maximum sum she should get is £500.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment saying that the maximum sum she should get is £2,000. The Minister is now changing that maximum from the original £500 to £750. He says he is doing it simply because inflation since 1976 has justified the increase of the original figure of £250 to £750.  The Minister has not dealt with why it was that the original figure was calculated at £250, or on what basis this calculation was made.</P>
      <P>The reality is that this was a figure plucked out of the air.  It sounded a nice round figure but it did not bear any relationship to the reality of expenses incurred by a mother incidental to the birth of a child.  I drew attention on Committee Stage to the fact that in 1986 in a High Court case the High Court judge made an order in the sum of £950 in respect of expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  Certainly the judicial view &mdash; he was dealing with a case appealed from the Circuit Court &mdash; was that he did have jurisdiction to make an order beyond the then limit of £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat confused as to what is the Circuit Court's limited jurisdiction. Is the Minister saying that it will now be limited to £750?  In other words, that after this Bill has been passed the Circuit Court will be confined to ordering a lower sum in respect of expenses incurred incidental to the birth of a child than it can currently provide or than the High Court believes it can provide?  I do not know why the Minister is being niggardly about this. This, like the earlier matter we discussed, is not money the State will have to provide for anybody.  These are maximum limits which allow the courts to take into account the real and genuine expenses incurred by a mother incidental to the birth of her child and require the father to contribute towards those expenses up to a maximum figure.  My figure is £2,000 <Col N="1127" /> as a maximum.  That does not mean that every court will order every father of a child born outside marriage to pay a sum of £2,000 as expenses incidental to the birth of his child.  Those expenses must be properly proved in a courtroom setting. The court might determine the expenses to be £200, £500, £1,000.  It all depends on what real expenses have been incurred.</P>
    <P>When a mother is pregnant she may, for example, during the course of the period of pregnancy suffer some difficulties. She may be confined to bed for a period of time; she may have to give up her job or temporarily leave her job for longer than is usually the case; she may incur special expenditure on medication; she may incur special expenditure of a gynaecological nature.  Where there is a troublesome pregnancy, where difficulties occur, the mother may require medical help either in or outside hospital of a nature that not all mothers would incur.  There can be special circumstances which give rise to additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the limit from £500 to £750 but I do not understand why he will not accept £2,000.  If this would cost the State money, have an impact on the Exchequer, of course I would understand the Minister having difficulty in the current financial climate.  This is something which costs the State nothing, which is merely a facility to allow the courts to make an order in respect of expenses incurred incidental on the birth of a child of a sum up to a maximum of £2,000. In the context of funeral expenses, the Minister is increasing the provision for a sum of £500 to £750 and the proposed maximum there should be £1,000.  This measure is, for the first time, changing the financial limits here since 1976 and I assume that it may be at least another ten to 15 years before we revert to it again. I ask the Minister to accept my amendments with regard to the maximum sum in respect of expenses incidental to the birth of a child and, in the event of the death of a child, funeral expenses of a maximum in total of £3,000, being £2,000 <Col N="1128" /> concerning birth expenses and £1,000 concerning funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why my amendments cannot be accepted.  It costs the State nothing but gives the court more discretion.  It would facilitate them in making orders along the lines of an order the High Court saw fit to make in the context of expenses incidental on the birth of a child in a case dealt with in the High Court about a year and a half ago. I urge the Minister to accept my amendment in the spirit in which it is intended merely to allow the courts maximum discretion in making the necessary orders to allow mothers properly to recoup expenses incurred in these circumstances where the father of the child born is unwilling to make such expenses available to the mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the existing figure is £200, not £250, and the Bill earlier was raising that to £500.  The limit in the 1976 Act would be £200.  The Minister has taken into consideration the views given by Deputies on Committee Stage and has raised that limit further to £750.  It was previously £50 and made its way up to £200 and then to £500.  It is a reasonably substantial increase at this stage.  It is something which can be considered in terms of the jurisdiction Bill when the overall level of costs is examined.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a particular case where a higher award was given.  In that regard this would have been outside the limits in the legislation and the limit is £200 under the existing statute.  The Minister is increasing that reasonably substantially to £750.  That is the amendment which he is proposing to the House at this stage.</P>

In the context of any courts jurisdiction Bill which he may have in mind, I have no doubt that in a very <Col N="1129" /> short time we will have to revert to these sums.  I welcome that there has been some movement on the part of the Minister with regard to these figures, but do not believe that it is sufficient.

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 14, after line 50, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of this section &lsquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rsquo; shall include expenses incurred by the mother incidental to and arising out of the period of pregnancy relating to such child together with any earnings lost by the mother due to the pregnancy during the aforesaid period.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert an additional subsection in the Bill and seeks to provide a definition of what is meant by the term &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rdquo; in the Bill.  As a result of the Minister's amendment, the maximum such expenses a mother could get is a sum of £750.  The reason I tabled this amendment is that judges in the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court appear to have different views of what actually constitutes an expense incidental to the birth of a child.  Some are willing to include earnings which have been lost by the mother and some are not.  Some are willing to include expenses for medical treatment received during pregnancy and some are not.  Some are willing to include only expenses incurred relating <Col N="1131" /> to the delivery of the baby in hospital. There is a need for a uniform definition which the courts can have regard to.</P>
    <P>The maximum sum of £750 which the courts may order does not open up doors to very large awards of an unmerited nature being made.  The amendment merely seeks to provide for a degree of judicial uniformity in determining what expenses should be regarded as expenses incidental to the birth of a child and what expenses should be recoverable where a court order has to be obtained by a mother from the father of her child in circumstances where the father is not making an adequate contribution to such expenses.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12 in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla, McCartan, Sherlock and me seeks to enable the Minister to vary the amounts of awards which may be made under section 21 (1).  It relates to the amounts of awards we were discussing when dealing with amendments Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Minister to vary those amounts as he would think proper at any particular time and that in doing so he would place the draft of any such order before the House and that the House would then either agree to it or amend it.  It is clear from the Minister's response on Committee Stage that he would prefer to leave it to a courts Bill to alter the awards.  It is significant that the previous courts Bills were introduced in 1981 and, ten years earlier, in 1971, respectively.  It is likely that the rates of inflation and other costs will increase faster than the rate at which this House will get around to having a review of the awards or fines as covered by the District Court and the Circuit Court.  It is for that reason we are seeking to give the Minister and this House a degree of flexibility in dealing with these matters.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as amendment No. 11 is concerned it is very hard to see any <Col N="1132" /> reason for turning it down as it merely seeks clarification and a definition of what is meant by the expression &ldquo;expenses incidental to the birth of a child&rdquo;.  Apparently, different courts are interpreting this in different ways and if we have an opportunity to clarify it once and for all in this House we should take it.  It is hard to see how there could be any objection to that.</P>
      <P>So far as amendment No. 12 is concerned I can see its intent but I am reluctant to ask the House to vest more power in the Minister than he wishes to take. Normally, Ministers are all too anxious to get power for themselves and their Departments but in this case the Minister seems reluctant to take the power.  The question is how do we get more flexibility into the system.  When inflation runs at a high rate the amounts which are fixed by statute tend to lag very far behind values. If I thought the Minister could be relied on to take a progressive view and use the procedures as suggested in the amendment by Deputy De Rossa to update the allowances on a regular basis I would be inclined to go along with it.  Unfortunately, the Minister seems to have adopted a rather ultra-conservative attitude in his approach to the other amendments proposed to date on this Bill and I do not know whether there is much to be gained but I suppose there is not a great deal to be lost either.  Therefore, on balance I support Deputy De Rossa's amendment.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Taylor began to reply he pointed out the concerns from an Executive point of view and I thought he was going to continue along that line but he backed off it.  In relation to the jurisdiction of the courts, there is a desire not to vest more power in the Minister than is necessary and this is because of the position of the courts under the Constitution.  The obvious answer is to undertake more frequent revision of the jurisdiction of the courts and there should be a mechanism for doing so.</P>

      <P>I accept that but that is a matter which should be looked at separately from this Bill.  The Deputy put his finger on what were the concerns from an Executive point of view.  Basically the proposal of Deputy De Rossa and his fellow Deputies is a good one but it is generally not regarded as being appropriate to give too much power to the Executive in that respect or to cover that matter in legislation.  That can be done by the jurisdictions.  The Minister pointed out on Committee Stage that these limits are jurisdiction limits of lower courts, and because of the status of those courts under the Constitution as courts of local and limited jurisdiction it is appropriate that such limits be fixed by statute passed by the Oireachtas rather than by subordinate legislation.  The Minister feels, therefore, he cannot accept amendment No. 12 while he recognises the value and intention of it, but he would like to assure the Deputy that in the context of the next general Bill dealing with the jurisdiction of the courts these limits will be re-examined. A most appropriate thing to do would be to try to find some mechanism by which that can be done more frequently.</P>
      <P>Also on Committee Stage the Minister indicated he could not accept what is now Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 11, as it raises an important issue of principle regarding the maintenance responsibilities to each other of parents who have not married each other.  This matter would fall to be considered in the context of a Bill dealing with maintenance generally and not in this Bill which is concerned essentially with children and equalising their status.  This Bill is, in effect, setting up a new system which never applied previously to children of married parents and that is why the Minister is taking the approach he is taking in this section.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the most esoteric response I have yet had.  I found what he last said virtually <Col N="1134" /> totally incomprehensible and unworthy of a response.  I suspect that the Minister in the way he read it from his brief found it equally incomprehensible and it did not go without notice that other people in this House found it somewhat amusing. It is indicative of the intellectual level to which we sink in dealing with these issues.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in this.  This Bill will contain a provision allowing the courts to make expenses incidental to the birth of a child and to make orders to require that payments be made in respect of expenses incidental to the birth of a child.  Unmarried mothers have been able to avail of this provision since 1930 and it is being extended now to spouses who are unsupported by their husbands.  The Bill seeks to define what is meant by that phrase and it does nothing more than that.  The Minister has offered nothing intelligible to explain why he cannot support this amendment.  He has offered us a piece of bureaucratic gobbledegook which is even unworthy of his own officials who, I thought, could think of something more intelligent to say than the Minister said.</P>
      <P>I regret, again, that, the Minister cannot accept a fairly straighforward and simple amendment which we discussed on Committee Stage and which the Minister for Justice indicated he would consider for the purpose on Committee Stage.  I regret the Minister cannot deal with these things in a more constructive way and, in the context of this amendment, a more intelligent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet responded to Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  In principle I have no objection to it.  I agree with it.  In considering the difficulties that exist in the area of family law in particular where financial limits imposed on our courts become out-of-date, within two or three years there is need for a general provision whereby Ministers can through statutory instruments increase the maximum orders the lower courts can make not just in the context of expenses incidental to the birth of a child or funeral expenses but in the context of general maintenance orders.  I assume my amendment No. 11 will not be accepted and we will not get <Col N="1135" /> in through the House although I am going to ask that it be put formally.  Equally, I expect that Deputy De Rossa's amendment, which I support, will not ultimately be passed.  I hope the Minister and his officials will take note of the terminology in Deputy De Rossa's amendment No. 12 with a view eventually, about the year 1990, to bringing before this House a Bill relating to the courts, jurisdictions and incorporating an amendment along those lines to deal generally with the financial limits in respect of maintenance orders and expenses incidental on the birth of children, so that reforms in this area with regard to financial limits will not have to wait a decade at least each time for monetary values to be brought up to date.  It is a simple matter.  It could be done in a non-controversial way by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>There is one worry that Deputy Taylor did not articulate fully, although he might have had it in the back of his mind.  A Government of a particularly conservative persuasion with no concept of social justice &mdash; my description of the current Government &mdash; might use such a provision instead of increasing maximum sums the courts can order, to reduce or limit them.  That suggestion might be viewed as almost as absurd as some of the objections the Minister made to some of the amendments I have tabled.  I believe the intent of Deputy De Rossa's amendment is right.  Generally Governments with any sanity would not use such a mechanism so as to reduce the court limits, though one can put nothing beyond the bounds of some parties in the House, particularly the current party in Government.</P>
    <P>In principle, what I am talking about is worth doing.  If we do not succeed in doing it in this Bill I would like the Minister to look at it again with a view to incorporating it in a court or jurisdictional Bill.  I would like my amendment No. 11 put to the House.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed about giving undue powers to the Minister of the day to fix the level of the awards in these cases or to interfere with the jurisdiction of the courts.  For that reason we included paragraph (b) in amendment No. 12 which provides for a positive order to be made rather than a negative order.  The normal orders which Ministers introduce in this House are negative orders in that if a motion is not passed by this House within 21 sitting days the order automatically comes into effect.  No party in this House has ever had the opportunity to oppose such a negative order.  The positive order which we are proposing in paragraph (b) of amendment No. 12 makes it clear that any order which the Minister would make in relation to this amendment would have to be published in draft first of all and laid before the House and would not come into effect until the House agreed to it.  That covers the point made by Deputy Taylor and the Minister.  It is unreasonable for the Minister not to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved in discussing other Bills and have found Ministers <Col N="1137" /> taking powers much greater and much more draconian than we are concerned with here in relation to rights and bringing in legislation and making regulations which this House rarely has an opportunity to discuss.  Let me cite an instance which has nothing to do with this Bill and I make no particular point about it. Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act has been reviewed by this House every year for very many years but because it is brought forward by negative order we have had no opportunity to discuss it. That is a much more serious power than we are proposing here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained the provisions of this section shall not apply to the will of a testator who dies before the commencement of this Act, but shall apply to the will of every testator who dies after such commencement, whether the will was executed before or after that time.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important amendment. It is concerned with the timing of the Act <i>vis-á-vis</i> the date on which a will is made.  As the Bill stands, the benefits will not accrue to children under a will made before the date on which the Bill is passed.  That is entirely contrary to the whole thrust of the measure.  The Bill is designed to bring about as far as possible a position of equality by putting non-marital and marital children in precisely the same position, on the basis that they are all children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> This is a declaratory Bill.  We are not creating a new situation.  We are at long last recognising a fact, namely that all children are and should be in precisely the same position.  To say that those children mentioned in a will made before the Bill is passed are to be treated differently is directly contrary to the substance of what we are about and it maintains a divide which could have very serious implications for many children.</P>
    <P>When a man says in his will, &ldquo;I leave my property to my children&rdquo;, that must mean his children, whether they are marital or non-marital; I do not mind when the will was made.  We are giving recognition here after all these years to the fact that children are equal.  We are recognising in this Bill that a parent has a responsibility to a non-marital child in precisely the same way as he has a responsibility to a marital child.  He has that responsibility to a non-marital child, irrespective of the date on which he made his will.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a man who dies, having made a will five years ago leaving his property to his children.  If the Bill is left in its original form, extra-marital children will be excluded from the terms of the will.  That is entirely wrong and unjust, entirely contrary to the spirit of this measure.  The normal rule of law which always applies is that a will speaks from the date of death.  That has various implications but I know of no exceptions to it.  The position should be that if a man leaves his property to his children, all his children should come under that description, regardless of the date on which the will was made.</P>
    <P>Maybe the man who made the will might be annoyed.  Let us say he comes back from the grave to complain about what we have done to him and that he appears here in skeletal form to complain. He claims that when he made his will he was referring to his marital children and that we have averted his intent by including his non-marital children.  I would say to that cadaver if he reappeared in that situation, &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, if this is an injustice that has been done, whose fault is the injustice?  Is it <Col N="1139" /> the fault of your extra-marital child or was it your own fault?  After all, was it not you who brought this child into existence?  Therefore do you not have the same responsibility to that child as to your marital children?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  People are presumed to know the law and if this Bill becomes law in its present form no doubt there will be a fair amount of publicity concerning the date on which a will is made.  It is up to any person to amend a will if he is of a mind to do so.  People are imputed with knowledge of the law and the law is given publicity by the media when measures are passed.  Laws and promises are constantly changed and people have to cope with that situation.  Undertakings are often changed by matters arising outside a person's control.  I might mention as an aside that many people voted for Fianna Fáil in the last general election because of the express commitment that they would reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools, only to find that the situation is quite the reverse.  People set up in business when income tax may be at the rate of 40p in the pound but then it rises to 50p in the pound.  They simply have to cope with that change.</P>
    <P>A man may have made his will on a particular basis but if he wants to change it he can seek advice.  Otherwise we are getting away from the essential current of equality which runs through this Bill. Equality is the essential factor.  If we try to draw a distinction between non-marital children and marital children and disentitle the former from participation in their parents' estate because the will was made before the passage of this Bill, we are undermining the true purpose of this legislation.  I commend the Government and the Minister for advancing this Bill so strongly but let us do the job properly. Let us accept the proposition of equality of marital and non-marital children.  That is an admirable proposal.  Let us adopt it 100 per cent and not have any ifs, buts, or any other reservations.  We should accept that they are equal.  When we say &ldquo;children&rdquo; we should say all children irrespective <Col N="1140" /> of whether they are marital or non-marital.  What is so terrible about that?  Are we not saying in the Bill that a child is a child, marital or non-marital?</P>
    <P>The Minister has done well in bringing forward the Bill and is enunciating an admirable principle but he should do it properly without reservation, without begrudgery or detracting in any way from that principle.  If he does so we will have a sounder piece of legislation that will bring the matter to a logical conclusion in all respects.</P>

      <P>The case made by Deputy Taylor is the correct one.  The point we should keep in mind during this debate is that the contents of the Bill have been known since 1985 and those likely to be affected by it had ample opportunity to do whatever they felt necessary in order to avail of its provisions in good time or to avoid them, if that was their choice.  To exclude wills made before the commencement of the debate on the Bill is unacceptable.  As Deputy Taylor pointed out, the date the will comes into effect, when the testator dies, is the important date.  Though the two amendments are worded differently the intention in them is the same and I urge the Minister to accept the principle of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is opposed to these amendments for the reasons he explained in some detail on Committee Stage.  These are: that it is wrong in principle for the law to change retrospectively the meaning of a will or deed or other disposition.  That is the effect that either of these amendments would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle effect that section 27 of the Bill will have, in practice, is that, in future, people who are disposing of property, whether by deed or will, will be forced to think about the possibility that children born outside marriage may benefit from the disposition.  Up to now, disponers of property have not had to take this possibility into account when drafting their dispositions, because the standard rule of interpretation saved <Col N="1141" /> them the bother, so to speak.  Now, because of the change in the rule of interpretation, they will have to think about it, and if they wish to exclude a person born outside marriage from coming within the terms of the disposition, they will have to make a conscious and deliberate decision to do so.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that no law can compel a person making a will to provide for a relation born outside marriage; such a person is free to exclude from the will whomever he or she pleases, on whatever basis.  However, the Succession Act, 1965, confers rights on certain persons who are excluded from, or not adequately provided for, in a will. The legal right share of a surviving spouse is an example.  Also under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, a child of a testator who is so excluded has a right to apply to the court for proper provision from the estate.  &ldquo;Child&rdquo; in this context means issue in the first degree irrespective of age; and once this Part of the Bill comes into operation, this will also be irrespective of whether a person's parents have married each other.  Section 117 of the 1965 Act does not change the meaning of the will, however; it only provides for the modification of the effect of the will, and then only where a child of the testator exercises his or her right to apply, and the court, on such application, exercises its discretion to order that provision be made for the child out of the estate. That provision is contained in section 32. The amendments are considered to be unsound in principle, and, indeed, constitutionally suspect.  The Minister, therefore, cannot accept them.</P>
    <P>While it is true that a will speaks from the date of death, it must speak in the terms in which it was originally written. If a will was written in terms that were intended at the time of writing to have a specific meaning then it should speak in those terms at the date of death.  The courts are always at pains to give effect to the intentions of the testator.  That is a cardinal principle of succession law. The Deputies' amendments go directly against that principle and that is what <Col N="1142" /> makes them unacceptable.  Consequently, I am opposing the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and was unable to make my contribution at the outset of the debate on these amendments.  I should like to deal with the reservations expressed in regard to this provision on Committee Stage and today.  On Committee Stage I expressed the view that I considered similar amendments to be the most crucial ones that the House were asked to make to the Bill.  What we were trying to do was to close the gate that has been opened by reason of the amnesty granted to those who wanted to draw up their testamentary will specifically to exclude children born to them but outside marriage.  For three years those people have been aware that we were contemplating changing the law and it was open to them to draft a will before today's date.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the amendments are wrong in principle, are unsound in law but, with all the force that I can muster at this late hour, I should like to make the point that we are the makers of principle in law.  By definition that is what a legislator is and if we are not prepared to make principles of law we should recognise our weaknesses, pack our bags, go home and dare not return to this Chamber again.  I accept that it is a new departure to seek to legislate in this way but it is for that reason that we should embrace with enthusiasm the process we are involved in and not run away from it.  There is nothing that suggests that the House, the fundamental origin of all laws and principles of law in this State, should not make a new departure.  We did so yesterday on the Data Protection Bill which represents a whole new departure in our law, overturning principles, introducing new ones and building a whole new corpus of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The token concern about constitutionality is something that the Minister's colleague did not suggest on <Col N="1143" /> Committee Stage and I do not think it is one that should be broached now.  It has been suggested that the effects of these amendments will be that testators will be asked to rethink their wills.  Is that a terrible price to ask them, an exercise that involves signing a will the drafting of which will take anything from one minute to a number of minutes, depending on its complexity?  It is a very straightforward affair.  The effect of these amendments is to say that our law should impinge on the will at the stage it becomes operative, namely, at the death of the testator.  By definition all persons who would be directly concerned are alive and one would presume available to sit down and rethink their position with regard to their testamentary dispositions.  I do not see this as an argument against what is being proposed.  What we are trying to do is simply redress the position of those children born outside of marriage who would have been adversely affected by design by people who prepared their wills in the interim period since this Bill was first mooted.</P>
    <P>It would be very remiss of me if I sat down without making some reference to Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael Party. He did not for a moment shirk the opportunity to deride myself and The Workers' Party for some of the contributions we made to the best of our ability and judgment, and I must return in part the compliment. He accused us of being in some way suspect in our concern in this area. If nothing else, this amendment exposes the very weak flank of the Fine Gael Party with regard to their universal concern for the rights and status of children, particularly those born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has been singularly silent, a remarkable feature in itself, on this amendment.  On Committee Stage he addressed it very briefly when he made the point that section 117 of the 1965 Succession Act would be available in the future.  The point I made then, and I am making again, is that section 117 is of limited application.  It does not establish the full right of position of a child born outside of marriage.  It throws onto their <Col N="1144" /> shoulders the onus of being the moving party.  Therefore, by reason of passing this legislation, in a week's time a will made a week ago will be constructed in the context of, the law as it currently stands, in other words, children born outside of marriage affected in that will, will be excluded from the definition &ldquo;children of the testator&rdquo;.  But a will made next week which will be dealt with in a week's time, should the testator die, will include in the definition &ldquo;children of the testator&rdquo; and, consequently, children born outside of marriage.  The suggestion that section 117 is a provision to equalise the rights of children is not a fair answer to this issue.</P>
    <P>All through the debate we were told we were trying to deal with all areas of discrimination, and as far as practicable to put all children on equal standing after the passing of this legislation.  That is not being, and will not be, achieved if we leave the present wording of this section dealing with testamentary dispositions.  I do not know if the order of the House allows the Fine Gael Party, in the locquatious presence of Deputy Shatter, to offer some words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since Deputy McCartan did not move the amendment I presumed he was merely intervening.  Deputy Taylor gave a very good reason why his amendment should be accepted and I did not feel there was anything to add to that. Deputy McCartan was out of the House at that time.  I am quite happy to be attacked by Deputy McCartan on any occasion but he might hear what is going on before he mounts an attack.</P>
      <P>I was also amused to hear what he had to say about the Fine Gael Party.  This measure was originally introduced by Fine Gael.  Most of the amendments which have been made were pressed by Fine Gael and supported by The Workers' Party, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats.  Someone once described an attack by one of the current members of the British Cabinet as being set upon by a dead sheep.  I feel as if I have been half set upon by a sheep which has not expired yet.  Before Deputy McCartan tries to pull the wool over the eyes of Members of this House and the people outside, I want to put on record that I fully support Deputy Taylor's amendment but I have no doubt that from the Minister's response we will not get it enacted.</P>
      <P>The point I was making on Committee Stage was that even if this amendment is not enacted children born outside of marriage who are not catered for in wills can make a claim under section 117 of the Succession Act.  It is very important that they are aware of that.  It is also important if this Bill is passed in its present form that even if these children are excluded under a will from benefiting, because of the way this is defined, at least it should be known by children, lawyers and everyone else that they can still make a claim under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, which is something the Minister already referred to.</P>

      <P>One would have thought that this measure was one we could have got through without too much party political bickering or divide, but apparently that has not been possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the possible constitutionality of the amendment.  I think the amendment is perfectly constitutional. To leave the Bill in its present form might well prove unconstitutional because it will leave two categories of non-marital children.  The purport of the Bill was to abolish the concept of illegitimacy and we are not doing that because people mentioned in wills this week, last week or a year ago will have a different status to those whose parents make a will next week when the Bill becomes law. As I said, there will be two categories of people who should be the same because under the Constitution they are entitled to be treated in the same way.  That may be unconstitutional.  Has the Minister considered this aspect?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that as a result of this measure parents will be forced to think about their non-marital children. The enormity of that statement really hit me.  What does he mean by saying that they will be forced to think about their non-marital children?  They ought to be thinking about them because they are their children, whether they are marital or non-marital; after all, they brought them into being and their responsibilities to them are the same whether they are marital or non-marital children.  That is the question to which the Minister should have addressed himself but, regrettably, he did not.  Do we say that a parent has a responsibility to a non-marital child?  If he has, he has to meet that responsibility by dealing with his will if he has a mind to do so.  In the Bill, the Minister is going out of his way to facilitate a parent who is not interested in his non-marital child by changing and amending a basic, long established principle of law that a will speaks from date of death.  I do not see why the Minister or any Deputy should go out of their way to facilitate a parent who does not concern himself with the responsibility he has to all his children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is implied that some sort of injustice <Col N="1147" /> would be done, that there would be something unfair in the intent of the amendment. Where is the unfairness or injustice?  I do not see it.  If there is any injustice, it is caused by the parent and I do not see why Deputies in this House have to go out of their way to facilitate a parent if he is not meeting his responsibilities. We are telling him that he has &mdash; and always had &mdash; responsibilities to his <Col N="1148" /> child, I use the word advisedly.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted the amendment.  As Deputy McCartan rightly said, this is crucial to the whole tenor of the Bill and it is an act of begrudgery on the Minister's part in refusing to accept it.  He is not wholeheartedly accepting the basic tenet and principle running through the Bill and, therefore, we will have to bring it to a vote.</P>

      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 40 to 44.</P>
      <P>This amendment deletes section 30 of the Bill and is consequential on the decision on Committee Stage to remove from this Bill the former section 34.  That was a section which would have enabled the court to declare the father of a person born outside of marriage unworthy to share in that person's intestate estate. The purpose of section 30 was to confer on the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with applications arising out of that provision. Now that the former section 34 has been deleted section 30 is superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;32.&mdash;Section 109 (1) of the Succession Act, 1965, is hereby <Col N="1151" /> amended by the insertion of the following after &lsquo;dies wholly or partly testate&rsquo;:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;or, after the commencement of the Status of Children Act, 1987, intestate leaving a spouse or children or both spouse and children, the provisions of this part shall have effect, provided always that sections 110 to 116 shall have no application in the case of an intestacy&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have moved a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  At the time the Minister told me he would examine the amendment, that he certainly agreed with its spirit, whatever about its wording.  He said he would go away and if he could at all would come back on Report Stage having examined the possibility of including it in the Bill.  The Minister may have considered it &mdash; I do not doubt that &mdash; but he certainly has not come back with any recommendations to change the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give children who put themselves out, who look after their parents, a chance to get a greater share of their parents' estate when the parents die intestate than children who simply ignore their responsibilities or who do not look after their parents to the same extent.  All of us know that there are many children, particularly many women, who remain at home and look after an elderly parent or parents.  When and if that parent or parents die intestate that child or woman gets the same chance or the same equal share of the parents' estate as other children who may have travelled worldwide, who simply ignored their responsibilities or who may not have been in a position to help in any way.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair.  There are many instances of women in their forties and fifties who have been left practically destitute, when a family home has been sold in order that all of the members of the family may get their equal share of the parents' estate.  If the parents die having made a will a child who is not satisfied with a portion of the estate they get can <Col N="1152" /> challenge that apportionment under section 117 of the Succession Act in order to have a greater proportion allocated to them.  In particular, in circumstances in which a parent dies intestate, a child should have that opportunity to challenge the will and get a greater share of the estate in question.  It should be a question for a court to decide on what basis each child receives a proportion of the parents' estate.  It has been my experience that, when parents make a will, generally they will make better provision for a family member who has given a lot of his or her time to look after them, to provide for them and so on.  If we make provision in law for a child to challenge an estate when a will is made, then we have an even greater obligation to provide in law for a child to challenge an estate when no will at all is made.</P>
    <P>Failure to incorporate the provisions of this type of amendment in this Bill constitutes nothing short of gross irresponsibility to those children and people who save this State enormous amounts of money because they give of their time so freely to look after their elderly relatives. Many of them remain outside the workforce and receive very little in return.  At a time when it costs between £500 and £700 a month to keep an elderly person in a geriatric home is it not right that, in law, we should ensure greater regard for those children and people who put themselves out in this way?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us that this is not the correct way to change the law, that some other Act should be changed.  We are great in this House at suggesting changes to other measures.  We do not often have an opportunity of updating the laws, rendering them more relevant.  Certainly we should render the provisions of this Bill more caring in so far as this group of people is concerned.  It would be highly irresponsible of us to shirk our responsibilities and not avail of the opportunity this amendment provides to give people in that category a chance of having better provision made for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is <Col N="1153" /> opposed.  It seeks to achieve the same effect as the Deputy's Committee Stage amendment No. 29a, namely, to extend to intestacies the provisions of section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, which enabled the child of a deceased person to institute legal proceedings in order to have the distribution of the estate varied.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has had an opportunity of considering this matter since Committee Stage, as he said he would.  However, he has been unable to change his view that proposals of this nature should be considered in a Bill dealing with succession law generally, and not in this one, the primary function of which is to remove from the law provisions which discriminate against children whose parents have not married each other.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage, this proposal raises important questions about the way in which succession law operates particularly in regard to intestate succession.  At present the rules of intestate succession are designed to ensure that, in the case of a parent who dies leaving children, they are entitled to a share of the estate &mdash; equal shares of either one-third of the estate if the deceased also left a spouse or, otherwise, of the entire estate.  This entitlement is clear-cut and does not need the intervention of a court, with associated legal expenses, in order to establish it.</P>
      <P>If we were to change the law so as to permit scope for court proceedings to provide a &ldquo;fairer&rdquo; distribution, we must face the reality that in some cases at least the cost of obtaining that &ldquo;fairer&rdquo; distribution may place an unfair burden on the estate and may leave a very much reduced amount to be shared.  This is one of the considerations that would have to be taken into account in examining a proposal of this nature, but in any case it would not be appropriate to include it in a Bill dealing essentially with the rights of children born outside marriage.  Therefore, this is a question for the general succession law and it is the Minister's view that it should be examined in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Minister cannot be more sympathetic to my amendment.  I accept this is not a Bill about succession but it is one that includes many provisions that will affect succession rights.  Essentially it is a Bill about the status of children, but in endeavouring to change the status of some children we have to have regard to matters like maintenance, guardianship and succession.  Is it not appropriate that when we have an opportunity of amending the laws we should so amend them as to provide greater possibilities and opportunities for those children and people in our society who go to such trouble to look after their elderly relatives?</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the Minister gave for not accepting my amendment was that in the case of people who might have to go to court to establish their rights under the provision this might mean there would be ultimately a smaller estate for distribution.  Of course I accept that one must take into account legal expenses and so on, but is it not a fact that if parents die intestate children are afforded an opportunity under section 117 of the Succession Act to go to court to challenge the proportion of the estate left to them? If it is allowed when parents make a will &mdash; and, generally speaking, when a will is made greater provision is made for the child who looks after the parents &mdash; is it not then more important when no will whatever is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across cases &mdash; and I know many other Deputies in this House have also &mdash; where people have had to sell the family home, the home in which they have lived all their lives, having looked after their parents, never having worked outside it, in order to distribute the estate to the other members of the family.  Very often those other members might live in other countries and be reasonably well off.  We all know that when it comes to money and distributing the share of an estate left after people die many families are prepared to go to extraordinary lengths in order to get what they perceive to be their share and do not mind what happens to the person who has remained <Col N="1155" /> at home.  It is wrong that we do not avail of this opportunity to change that, to say to those people who have been so good, who have helped the State by being so responsible when it comes to looking after their elderly parents: we will reward you, recognise your effort; we will give you an entitlement to challenge in law the share of an estate to which you were entitled heretofore.  If we were to make provision for an amendment of this kind I have no doubt that people would be more responsible when it came to looking for their share of their parents' estate, that they would honour the responsibilities of the person who has been so good and so willing to stay at home to provide for their elderly parents.  As the law stands it is very heartless.  Many people whose parents have died without making a will have been shocked and very upset at the way they have been treated by the law and have had to turn to local authorities in order to provide housing for themselves.  It leads to terrible disputes within families and to undue hardship on the person who has to look after their elderly relatives.  The law is such that instead of rewarding those who make an effort to help their parents it gives them no more than the rest of the family.  That is not good enough, <Col N="1156" /> especially at a time when it costs so much to have people looked after in institutions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I did not press my amendment on Committee Stage because I thought the Minister would introduce an amendment along these lines on Report Stage but he has not done so.  It is not good enough to use the excuse that this not the right Bill.  We always seem to be able to find excuses in this House for not doing things, simply because it is not the right Bill or because we have not consulted enough people about the matter.  All the old classic answers are given.  We rarely get an opportunity in this House to amend our laws and when we do get such an opportunity we should use it to make the most effective and practical amendments to make sure that the lives of our people are improved as a result and that we do not continue to have on the Statute Book a provision that is grossly unfair to those people, albeit a few people in our society, who have been very adversely affected when no will has been made and their parents' estate is divided equally among all the children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> In page 26, to delete lines 35 to 40, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, where a married woman, being a woman who is living apart from her husband under&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> or</P>
    <P>(b)  a deed of separation,</P>
    <P>gives birth to a child more than ten months after the decree was granted or the deed was executed, as the case may be, then her husband shall be presumed not to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would look again at the presumption of non-paternity provided for at section 47 (2) of the Bill as it now stands.  Deputies had expressed the view that it would be too restricted to confine the presumption that a woman's husband was not the father of her child to cases where a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> had been granted.  Having given the matter considerable thought the Minister now proposes amendment No. 21 which would permit a presumption of non-paternity of the husband to arise in addition to where the husband and wife had been living apart on foot of a deed of separation.  Amendments Nos. 26 and 28 make consequential changes in the proposed new birth registration provisions to take account of the extended grounds for the presumption.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the requirement of a deed of separation rather than any less formal type of separation agreement would involve the couples concerned in the expense of a formally drawn up deed. I am particularly conscious of the remarks made by Deputies Taylor and McCartan in this regard on Committee Stage.  I am anxious to ensure, however, that the presumption arises out of a formal separation agreement the existence and currency of which can be readily ascertained.  Were the amendment to refer to a mere separation agreement, or <Col N="1160" /> even a written separation agreement as does Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 22, the range of types of agreement that would be encompassed by such description would be so wide as to include agreements of a most informal and uncertain nature, not suited to form the basis of a legal presumption on which people could be expected to act.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party amendments Nos. 23, 25 and 27 would have the intended effect that a presumption of non-paternity of the mother's husband would arise out of any separation of sufficient duration before the birth of the child. This I could not accept because the fact of separation for the appropriate period is often not a self-evident matter and requires proof by the adduction of appropriate evidence.  That being the case, the practical, everyday usefulness of such presumption is virtually nil.  There is no practical benefit in having a presumption based on something which as often as not requires court proceedings to verify whether the grounds for the presumption exist.  On the other hand, the formality associated with the execution of a deed and the fact that the deed and counterpart are retained by each of the parties after being duly stamped means that the presumption of non-paternity will have a firm and certain grounding, the existence of which can easily be verified by anyone concerned, such as the Registrar of Births.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the process of executing a deed of separation is regarded by many couples as a solemn statement that their relationship is finally at an end and is as much a psychological confirmation to them of this fact as it is a contractual settlement of their affairs. Furthermore, it will usually have been arrived at by a process of negotiation between the parties and would deal comprehensively with all matters at issue between them.  For these reasons it is likely to be observed by both parties. This makes it particularly suitable for the basis of a presumption of the kind provided for in amendment No. 21.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that <Col N="1161" /> the Minister has come three-quarters of the way with me in the amendment that I tabled on Committee Stage, when I sought to get his agreement to the presumption arising following the conclusion of a legal separation or written separation agreement.  The Minister is improving the Bill by the amendment that he has tabled which, by the and large, deals with the areas about which I was concerned.</P>
      <P>The reference in my amendment to a written separation agreement would not create a situation where a very simple and formal arrangement would be regarded as such.  Often the difference between what would be regarded as a deed of separation or a written separation agreement would simply be that the couple would not have bothered to have the document that they have concluded stamped.  That may in real terms be the difference, or its being set out on a particular type of paper as opposed to another type of paper.  I am prepared, in the context of the Minister tabling amendment No. 21 which largely implements the intent of my amendment as tabled on Committee Stage and today, to accept the Minister's amendment and to withdraw my amendment No. 22.</P>

      <P>The light of reality is becoming quite clear from the point of view of The Workers' Party amendment. It is obviously not something that one would pursue in view of the consensus now arrived at between the Government and Fine Gael in this matter.  Nonetheless, I want to take the opportunity to accentuate the points that I made on Committee Stage in relation to the restriction of this proviso to the two events that are covered now in the Minister's amendment, namely, that the presumption arises in the event of a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> being in existence, or a deed of separation.  I acknowledge and appreciate that the Minister has responded to the debate as made on Committee Stage.  However, the point that concerns me is that both of those events &mdash; the obtaining of a decree of <Col N="1162" /> divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> and the finalisation of a deed of separation &mdash; inevitably involve the necessity of access or recourse to the courts or lawyers and that there are many other events of certainty and record that could be relied on in trying to establish some proof of the fact of separation, the order of a District Court or other court barring a person from living at home, for example, being one referred to.  The fact that a wife would have to apply for, perhaps, a deserted wife's allowance or maintenance are other events of record that could be relied upon.  However, ultimately as both provisions, upon whatever event fixed, allow for the establishment of the presumption to be rebutted in court on a balance of probabilities, recourse ultimately in the determination of an issue in the context of this section would be to the court and would be upon witnesses being called for either party.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for a judge ultimately to make the decision whether or not the presumption should apply and whether the court is aided by a fixed record of events or not is secondary to the fact that ultimately in recourse to the court on a balance of probabilities determination, the decision will be determined by a judge sitting hearing all the facts available. Whether a party brings in witnesses or a matter of record or whatever is a matter ultimately for the court.  That is a fact which is perhaps being overlooked by the Minister in over-relying upon the need for an event of certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who have lived apart for a long number of years and have never sought and never want to seek recourse to lawyers, or the court, or, if they did, do not have the money to do so.  In the regrettable state of legal aid here they would not be in a position to be actively aided in that regard.  Consequently, I asked on Committee Stage that the Minister might consider broadening the matter simply to indicate, where parties lived apart, irrespective of whatever fixed event, of record or otherwise, they created, be it a divorce application, a separation agreement or simply application for a social welfare payment or the <Col N="1163" /> obtaining of a barring order or whatever, that they would be entitled to rely upon the presumption that if they lived apart for ten months or otherwise, the husband would not, as a matter of law, be presumed to be the father of the child. However, having realised that both the Government and Fine Gael are <i>ad idem</i> on this matter and appreciating that a small degree of improvement certainly was achieved and being happy with that, I shall not press the amendment of The Workers' Party, in view of the fact that I am facing overwhelming odds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 26, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section where a man and a woman although not married to each other were living together as husband and wife at the time of the birth of a child and were so living together for a period of 10 months immediately preceding the birth of a child, the man shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the final amendment.  It deals with the presumptions with regard to paternity.  It seeks to insert a new section in the Bill which would be subsection (4) in the relevant section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to seek to assist the court in establishing the issue of paternity.  It would be of assistance in the situation which Deputy McCartan described where a couple are living apart but might not have got a decree of separation or might not have concluded a separation agreement.  The wife may now be living <Col N="1164" /> with someone else and may have lived with that person for three or four years and a child is born to them.  As a result of this provision the man with whom she is residing would be presumed to be the father of the child and in a sense this approaches Deputy McCartan's problem from a different basis.  It also ensures in those circumstances that the husband of the woman would not be presumed to be the father of the child even though a decree of <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or a deed of separation has not been obtained.</P>
    <P>This presumption is identical to a presumption which has been enacted in the law of a number of other countries and it would facilitate the establishment of paternity in a wide variety of circumstances. The fact that a couple neither of whom have ever been married are cohabitating for ten months prior to the date of the birth of a child would give rise to a presumption that the man is the father of the child.  Where a couple are cohabitating for ten months or longer and a child is born to them and where one of the couple is married to someone else, it would be assumed that the man in the home is the father of the child born to such a couple.  It is an evidential matter and it is not a matter which would bind the court finally.  It would raise a presumption that someone is the father of a child where it appears largely to be the case that he would be adjudged to be the father.  Nevertheless if the man says he is not the father he would in those circumstances have the opportunity of disproving paternity in the courts and would have the full panoply of this Act available to him, including blood tests, to determine paternity.</P>
    <P>Having praised the Minister a few moments ago for coming some of the way with us on the previous amendment, I am disappointed he has not indicated he is going to accept this amendment also.  On Committee Stage he said he would consider this matter.  It is a practical provision to deal with an evidential matter and it will assist children in the establishment of the identity of their father and will also assist mothers, where there <Col N="1165" /> is a need to establish that someone is a father for the purpose of getting maintenance support, in establishing who is the father.  Where disputes arise over guardianship or custody of children born outside of marriage it will assist a person who is a father in securing a guardianship order or an access order to a child in circumstances where there is some doubts raised as to paternity.  I urge the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be exceptionally brief and I simply rise to say that this amendment is very worthy of inclusion in the Bill.  It clarifies yet another of the various situations in which the parties may find themselves.  It is desirable in the context that this section raises presumptions with regard to facts which exist primarily because we do not have divorce and the right of remarriage in our jurisdiction and we have to rely on what is a second best, but which nonetheless is a very essential and important consideration, and that is this presumption which has been put before us by Deputy Shatter.  I hope this will be the last amendment we will discuss in this momentous legislation.  It has been an honour to take part in this debate in this House on the various Stages of the Bill.  It would be a singularly fine gesture by the Government, which would appreciate and reflect not just this very good debate but the excellent debate in the Seanad where the Bill was approached in a very constructive way on an all-party basis, if the Minister would make one small concession to those of us who are here in the interests of seeking to bring the legislation up to the standard which it should be at.  I am not in any way reflecting on poor workmanship but this is an important, though small, amendment which covers an area which may not have been considered important at the time because of a oversight.  It is something which we should pursue and I ask the Minister to consider it.  As a gesture of magnanimity I hope that he accepts the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed.  As I pointed out on the last group of amendments, for a legal presumption to be of any practical use, it must arise out of readily ascertainable facts and itself be of general application without the need for further evidence. The presumption of paternity arising out of marriage satisfies these criteria and is of practical value both to the courts and in everyday life.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with trying to create a presumption based on cohabitation other than married cohabitation is that it is not readily provable that a man and a woman have been living together as husband and wife.  Take, for instance, the common case where a father and daughter, or a brother and sister, are sharing a home.  If the woman has a child, is the existence of the legal presumption proposed by the Deputy to cause the finger of suspicion to be pointed at the man who is sharing the house with her?  It cannot readily be said with certainty they were not living together as husband and wife nor can it readily be said they were living together as husband and wife.  A presumption of paternity is useless in such circumstances since the facts on which it is sought to base the presumption are too vague and indeterminate for that purpose.  At most, one could draw no more than a inference from them.</P>
      <P>The example I quoted illustrates the difficulty that arises with a proposal of this nature.  Similar problems arise in relation to any two people of opposite sexes who share accommodation without being married to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering today's proceedings it is not unfitting that we conclude on a comical note.  The amendment which I have tabled is identical to a provision &mdash; again I refer to it as it is one of the seminal Acts in this area &mdash; in a New Zealand Act relating to the status of children where a presumption arises with regard to paternity on a similar basis as we have where a couple have resided <Col N="1167" /> together as husband and wife.  The Minister asks, does that mean that where a man is residing with his daughter and if the daughter becomes pregnant there will be a presumption that he was residing with his daughter as husband?  I would imagine that a man residing with his daughter would be presumed to be residing as father and not as husband, just as if I was residing in my home with my elderly grandmother I would be presumed to be residing with her as grandson as opposed to residing with her as husband.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan as usual was being an optimist but one learns the longer one is in this House not to have any great expectations as to what response one may receive on any particular issue.  A magnanimous gesture in accepting this amendment would have sent us all home in a state of shock but nevertheless it is unfortunate that the Minister should produce such a comical reason for not accepting the amendment.  I would hope, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that if you ever find yourself on holidays with your daughter, if you have a daughter, it would not be assumed that both of you had gone off on holidays to reside together as husband and wife.  Indeed, I do not think anybody in this House would impute such behaviour to you or to any other Member of this House.  That illustration shows just how comical and nonsensical is the Minister's objection to this amendment. The purpose of this presumption is to assist in the establishment of paternity. In some instances it would be in the interests of the mother to rely on it, in others it would be in the interests of the father and in others it would be in the interests of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a matter of great difficulty for this presumption to arise.  The Minister says you could not have proof that a couple who are not married had been living together for ten months or more. It is relatively simple.  Where a dispute arises a man will go into the witness box in a court and will agree that he was living with the woman for the 12 months before the birth of her child and the woman <Col N="1168" /> will agree and say that he was.  Then the presumption arises.  If the man says he has not been living with the woman and the woman says that he had been, the presumption could not arise unless there was irrefutable proof they were residing together.  If such proof is established and these are matters which are dealt with on a daily basis in our courts, a presumption would arise.</P>
    <P>I do not see this as a matter of great complexity and clearly the Minister does not either because he produced what has got to be the daftest objection we have had all day to any of the amendments which have been tabled.  That is the way things happen in this House.  Possibly in the future this amendment will be used by a Government of a different persuasion as a means of improving what we are now going to enact into law.  It is clear from the Minister's response that we are not going to enact this amendment, and that is regrettable.  It would facilitate the courts where disputes arise about paternity in establishing paternity, nevertheless if the Minister will not accept the amendment it is clear that the amendment will not succeed.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the fact that we have accepted a number of amendments today which came out of the Committee Stage debate, some of which will improve the Bill, it is regrettable that a large number of amendments which could have improved this Bill greatly, including this amendment, have not obtained the Government's support.  I hope that during the lifetime of this Dáil as we mature politically we will find a more cooperative response from the Government in dealing with legislation particularly in the social area, in introducing reforms and in future accepting amendments that are of a constructive nature and which seek to improve legislation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, enacting this Bill will be a milestone in our social legislation.  The legislation was introduced into this House by my party, by a colleague of mine in the last Government.  I welcome the fact that this Report Stage debate will now conclude.  I am sorry that the Minister cannot make the gesture of accepting this <Col N="1169" /> amendment.  I invite him, by way of a one line response and as a final gesture in the direction of what were most important Committee Stage and Report Stage debates to which a large number of Deputies have contributed, to acknowledge the importance of debates such as this and to indicate that he accepts that this House has some relevance in the enactment of legislation and amending it so as to improve it, by accepting the amendment as tabled.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the Bill as a milestone and Deputy McCartan referred to it as a very major development. I agree entirely with them.  It is most important social legislation.  I would like to thank the Deputies genuinely for their co-operation in the passage of the Bill.  It will remove from our law a wide range of discriminations against persons whose parents have not married each other.  I appreciate greatly the contributions the Deputies have made in the course of the debate on this Bill.  Because the legislation we are dealing with is complex and has very many ramifications into other areas of law, their contributions were very constructive and helpful.</P>
      <P>By enacting this legislation in a spirit of unanimity concerning the basic principles underlying the Bill we have demonstrated our commitment to equalising the status of children.  The enactment of the Bill will ensure that this country will be in a position to ratify the European Convention on the Status of Children Born out of Wedlock.  I assure this House that once the Act is in operation, which at the outside will be six months after its passing, steps will be taken early to ratify that convention.</P>
      <P>The rules committees have already been asked to consider what rules of court will be necessary to give full practical effect to the Bill.  All possible steps will be taken to ensure that the rules of court and other subsidiary legislation will be in place so that the Act can be brought into force if possible sooner than six months after its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing this Bill the Oireachtas and the politicians have led the way in providing <Col N="1171" /> for the rights of children whose parents are not married to each other and in removing discriminations which are there at present.  It is a very major step and one major feature of it is the fact that any future legislation must carry these provisions.  That is provided for in section 3 which enunciates the general principles central to the Bill that for the purposes of this and future Acts relationships are to be determined without regard to whether the parents of any person are or have been married to each other unless the contrary intention appears.  This is a major development not just in this Act but in the context of all future Acts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the passing of the Bill.  I thank the Deputies for their assistance in having it passed at this stage and I look forward to it coming into practice and being implemented at the earliest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a few moments ago, the passing of this Act is a major milestone in our social legislation.  The Bill was first brought into this House by my party in Government.  We had been committed to it for some years and the Fine Gael Party had been in the forefront of those pressing for law reform in this area for a number of years before we came into Government.  I should pay tribute at this stage to Young Fine Gael who pioneered what I would describe as the political work on the political stage in this area when they produced a draft Private Members' Bill in 1979.  Major organisations concerned with children and unmarried mothers such as Cherish, the Federation for Unmarried Mothers and a number of others have long sought this legislation.</P>
      <P>This legislation will put the majority of children, whether born inside or outside marriage, in a position of legal equality. That is to be welcomed.  The passage of this Bill has on occasion seen the Members of both Houses acting as legislators and there have been considerable changes and improvements made to the Bill to deal with many technical and legal issues which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> I hope the Minister will not regard me as begrudging if I remark that the Bill could have been enacted in an even better form.  We have left unnecessary gaps and failed to tackle some issues which we could easily have confronted.  We have left a number of children outside the scope of this measure and we will have to return in the not too distant future to the forgotten children of the Status of Children Bill.  I refer to those children who are conceived and born as a result of some of the major medical and scientific advances which have taken place in the past few years and who are effectively excluded from and ignored by this Bill.  I sought to have these children included within its scope, with the support of some other parties in this House, so that no children would be left outside the provisions of the Bill.  Some children are left uncatered for, but nevertheless the vast majority of children born outside marriage who have been the subject of discrimination for many decades will now find themselves, generally speaking, in a position of legal equality with children born within marriage.</P>
    <P>We will finally be able to become a party to the European Convention on the Status of Children.  With the enactment of this Bill, we will finally meet our international commitments as a State which is already party to the European Convention for the Protection of Fundamental Freedoms.  This State has already been found to be lacking in the context of the European Convention in a decision made by the European Court in Strasbourg because of our failure to provide protections for children born outside marriage equal to the protections for children born within marriage and because of our failure to extend equal protections and rights to the parents of such children.  With the passage of this Bill, we should be able to redress the position whereby we have for some time been in serious breach of a major international convention on fundamental rights.  It is correct at this stage to refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>I hope this will be the first of a number of Bills enacted in this House across party <Col N="1173" /> lines with all-party support, tackling some of the many social issues which have for many years been ignored, including many issues that relate to the family and family life.  Some of these issues we have been very prone to talk about at length but we have been unduly lethargic when it comes to getting involved in legislative action.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the remarks he made about the constructive nature of the debate.  I appreciate that some of the amendments we have sought have been accepted.  I had hoped others would be accepted but we may have to come back to them on another day.  This House has done a good day's work in the enactment of this Bill in the context of the many children who look to this measure to put them in a position of legal equality, to protect their rights and to extend to them the same rights as children born within marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. MacCartan Mr. MacCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and Deputy Shatter in marking the significance of the legislation we are about to pass into law.  It is a major step forward in dealing with a social problem which has been with us for decades and it is an achievement for us as legislators that we have at long last got rid of one of the most invidious discriminations that has existed in law since the foundation of the State.  We have moved very far ahead of the climate that existed up to the early seventies when the best we could do for children born outside marriage was to provide them with the meagre sum of 20 shillings for their maintenance on the basis of a putative or supposed father. We have come to the stage when we can for the first time recognise our international obligations and can say with some dignity to our European partners that we have caught up with them.  We should never forget how long it has taken us.  We should remember it with some degree of shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mark the particular contribution made by Cherish, the organisation which in the early seventies started us thinking about the position of the child born outside wedlock and the <Col N="1174" /> position of single mothers having to toil on behalf of such children.  To them and to all those others in the community who campaigned and kept this issue to the forefront tonight's achievement will be a source of particular gratification.  I have no doubt the legislation will be of use to them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to do something about the appalling state of the legal aid facilities for people who must undoubtedly have recourse to legal advice and assistance to gain access to the courts in order to establish many of the rights being made available to them under this Bill.  It is pointless unless there is some measure of improvement in the area of legal aid to make matters easier for people.</P>
    <P>Many important issues have been raised in the course of the debate, such as DNA fingerprinting and children born as a result of artificial insemination. These matters have been highlighted during the debate and inevitably we will have to return to them, as well as many other issues thrown up in the discussion. I hope the Minister has taken cognisance not just of the narrow provisions of the Bill but of many other contributions made by Deputies on this side of the House and that he will ensure that legislation in all areas concerning children is kept up-to-date.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence.  It was a particular pleasure to have been involved in this debate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann conscious of the serious effect of projected 1988 expenditure allocations on many public services currently provided:</P>
      <P>&mdash;and in particular the unacceptable increases in class sizes at primary level through the worsening of the pupil-teacher ratio and the consequent weakening of the entire educational system;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and also the difficulties for many public service employees arising from the operation of the redundancy and redeployment schemes;</P>
      <P>notes that the cost in 1988 to the Exchequer of the Draft Agreement on Pay in the Public Service will be an estimated £70 million while the reductions through staff shedding are similarly estimated for 1988 at £70 million (before the cost of redundancy and lump sum payments, not yet disclosed):</P>
      <P>&mdash;calls on the social partners forthwith to return to discussions so as to achieve a better balance between continuation of public services, public service employment and public service pay;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" />&mdash;and in the context, requests the public service unions to suspend all further action on the current 1987 draft Agreement on Pay in the Public Service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All Members of the House are conscious of the adverse effects on the delivery of public services contingent on the projected 1988 expenditure allocations. There is scarcely a service provided by the State which is not being cut back severely, with very serious consequences for our people.  We know of the long waiting lists for essential operations in our hospitals, of the discharge of the old and the ill from hospitals and homes, of the hardship caused by the £10 charges in public wards and the closure of local hospitals.  We know of the reduced services provided by the Department of Social Welfare and the hunting and the hounding of people off the live register by the Jobsearch scheme.</P>
    <P>We know of the effects of the cutbacks in the Department of the Environment resulting in our roads being pockmarked with potholes and not likely to be resurfaced for 25 or 30 years, depending on which county engineer one is talking to. We know that house repairs cannot be carried out by local authorities, that the local authority building programme has been slashed, that local authority houses will not be built, that the housing list is growing again and that all grants have been abolished and the consequential results of that.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is scarcely a service being provided by the State whose delivery will not be reduced in effectiveness by the 1988 Estimates.  From all that menu of desperation &mdash; I do not intend that to be a complete list &mdash; we have chosen to focus our motion on the cutbacks in primary education which will result in larger classes in our primary schools.  We believe that this is the most unkind cut of all and cannot be justified on any objective grounds.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, while moving resolutely to put the country's finances in order, not only did not cut <Col N="1177" /> primary education but increased the allocation for that sector, each year we were in Government.  We increased the number of remedial teachers each year. A new £2 million allocation for primary schools in disadvantaged areas was approved and a special pupil/teacher ratio in deprived inner city schools was agreed.  There was also an increase each year ahead of inflation in the capitation grant for every school in the country.  At the end of our period in office, for the 1985-86 school year, we have achieved a pupil teacher ratio of 26.8:1, a reduction from the ratio of 28:1 in the 1981-82 school year when we took office.  According to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, the pupil/teacher ratio will now revert to the 1979 position when the PTR was 29:1.  Thus, the progress of a decade has been wiped out by one atrocious decision by the Minister for Education and the Government in which she serves.</P>
    <P>The effects on our children will be very serious indeed.  We are all aware that a PTR of 29:1 results in numbers in classes of a much greater magnitude.  I have no doubt that many children in our primary schools in future will be in classes in the high forties, if not in the low fifties.  This is not only deplorable but unjust and, most damning of all, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of large classes in primary schools.  When I began teaching in 1963 I was asked to teach a third class in a primary school with 56 students in it.  Any teacher who has experience of teaching a large class, or any parent who has a child in a large class, knows the difficulties that arise. The brighter pupils and those with the more supportive family backgrounds are least affected and the weaker pupils and those with disadvantaged family backgrounds are the most affected.  There is a direct relationship between large classes, such as those we had in primary schools in the forties, fifties and sixties, and the high incidence of adult illiteracy in our population.  I do not think we should now be sowing the seeds in our primary schools of another wave of adult illiteracy <Col N="1178" /> in 25 or 30 years time.</P>
    <P>The cuts in primary education are unnecessary and they arise from the Government's agreement with the social partners so inaptly called the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Minister for Finance informed the House that the public service pay agreement will cost £70 million in 1988.  He has also informed us he envisages that the whole menu of items which are designed to reduce the number of public servants in 1988, including voluntary redundancies, will achieve savings of £70 million.  Surely we cannot believe it is a coincidence that the two figures are so matched; that the agreement costs £70 million and that he must get £70 million in savings?  Is it a coincidence that the figures happen to be the same coming out of the same computer?</P>
    <P>It is usually futile debating which came first, the chicken or the egg, but in this instance it is clear what came first.  When the pay negotiations were completed, the Minister for Finance calculated the total cost for 1988 at £70 million and decided then that £70 million was the amount he needed to save by reducing public service numbers through the redundancy programme and the other methods he has announced.  A decision was taken subsequent to agreeing to pay out £70 million to achieve the same by redundancies and the non-filling of posts in the public service. We are familiar with that device in the private sector.  We are all accustomed to unions going into factories and negotiating agreements for greater productivity which result in 50 fewer workers and the payroll being reduced or remaining the same.  The approach of the Minister for Finance, and the Government, has been the payroll approach: give extra pay but do not increase the payroll; as long as they keep the payroll the same to hell with the service; the service does not matter as long as the cost is kept right.</P>
    <P>In Education the unfortunate Minister had to achieve savings amounting to £10 million and that had to be found through not filling teaching posts and redundancies. The mathematical calculation was made that the pupil teacher ratio had to be increased by three points to reduce <Col N="1179" /> the number of teachers so that payroll costs would not be increased as a result of increased pay.  We end up with our children in very large classes, paying the remaining teachers slightly more and we have the Government pretending there is no alternative.  Of course there is an alternative.  If the Government did not have to claw back on Tuesday what they spent the previous Friday we would not be in this position.  We continue to train 1,750 student teachers in our colleges of education at a cost of almost £6 million a year.  We are training them for teaching posts the Minister has abolished and she pretends there is no alternative to that either.  The INTO call meetings all around the country to inform the parents of the disastrous consequences of the reduction in teaching numbers, to inform them of the disastrous consequences for their children being educated in very large classes, and they pretend there is no connection between the paltry increase the teaching unions negotiated for their members and the quite devastating consequences for education in reducing the number of teachers in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of alternatives and the clear alternative is the one we are suggesting in our motion.  The alternative is that the 1988 pay bill in the public service be reduced by £10 million so that class sizes remain at the same level as this year, that the number of teaching posts remain at least the same and that teaching posts are filled.  Our motion calls on the social partners to return to discussions to achieve a better balance between a continuation of services, public service employment and public service pay.  We call on them to deal in the first instance with the problem of primary education and to continue in other areas of the public service where the delivery of services is threatened by the combination of pay increases and redundancies.</P>
    <P>Other countries when faced with financial problems not dissimilar from ours had a pay freeze for a number of years, or an actual reduction in public service pay.  The example of Denmark <Col N="1180" /> is frequently quoted as the yardstick by which we should set out economic objectives. In Denmark they did not cut public services but they had a long pay freeze. When their economy came right, all their services were intact and they were able to run them properly.  They were not involved in decimating their services as we are.  When our financial position improves in four or five years time we should be able to pick up the pieces and put them back together again.  I am not calling for a public service pay freeze.  I am calling for a renegotiation of the public service pay agreement to achieve balance between delivery of services, pay and employment as advocated in our motion.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the teaching profession to bear the burden alone.  There is a misconception abroad which suggests that Fine Gael are asking teachers not to take any pay increase so that the teachers who are made redundant under the policy of the Minister for Education will remain in their jobs.  We are not saying that.  We are saying that all public servants, the whole 187,000 of them, including Members of the Dáil and Seanad whose pay is tied to public service pay agreements, should agree that the education of our children is a national priority, and consequently take a slightly smaller pay increase next year.</P>
    <P>A reduction of the increase envisaged for 1988 by less than one third of 1 per cent would bring about the necessary saving.  I believe teachers, civil servants, Garda, prison officers, judges, nurses, local authority officials, TDs and Senators are prepared to sacrifice what is, in net terms after tax, the price of a pint of Guinness a week.  That is what 187,000 people need to do to keep classes at the same size and maintain the level of service for our children in primary schools, as well as maintain the same number of teaching posts.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession have provided an excellent service to all of us and our children over the years.  The standard of education in our schools is extremely high and I believe this is due to a great extent to the dedication and high professional <Col N="1181" /> standards of our teachers.  They will not be able to continue the high quality service to which we have become accustomed if the classes are so large that an inordinate amount of time is spent on disciplinary matters.  The leaders of the teaching unions who played such an important part in the negotiation of the national pay agreement, with the other social partners, should reopen discussions with the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to the amendments to our motion.  The first amendment is in the name of the Minister for Finance.  I think it is sufficient for me to say again what I said when the Estimates were debated in this House. The so called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is neither a plan nor a programme and will not lead to economic recovery.  It is a public service pay agreement dressed up to look like a national plan.  Because the Minister for Finance is insisting that savings equal to the amount conceded in the agreement have to be found by reductions in public service numbers, the programme is having a devastating effect on the delivery of all services, and a particularly disastrous effect on primary education.</P>
    <P>There is no difference of any consequence between the amendments put down by the Labour Party, The Workers' Party or the Progressive Democrats.  All of them simply call for the withdrawal of the Department of Education circular 20/87.  I am not in the least bit surprised at the Labour Party amendment or the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party.  The Labour Party have always had their heart in the right place but are again basing their approach on the crock of gold school of economics.  This particular economic theory allows one to propose all sorts of worthy objectives without suggesting how a particular scheme will be financed and if pressed and asked a direct question, who is going to pay for them, they have no difficulty in referring one to this crock of gold which is uncollected taxes, wealth tax or the bank levy.  The old crock of gold is dipped into time and again for any scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> I must say I am extremely surprised that the Progressive Democrats are now attached to the same school of economics. The original motion put down in the names of Deputies Quill and Desmond O'Malley, motion 57 on the Order Paper, is very much along the lines of our motion and is worth quoting:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann finds the proposed reduction in the provision of services in primary education unacceptable; in particular, it deplores the proposed reduction in the number of primary teachers, with the consequent increase in the already high pupil/teacher ratio; Dáil Éireann calls for the retention of the existing number of primary teachers, and is of the opinion that these should be paid for within the limits of the Estimate for Primary Education for 1988 maintaining salaries for teachers, and other public servants at their present level.</P>
    <P>I would like to call on the Progressive Democrats to stick to their original motion, to stick by the strategy outlined by their party leader in the course of his conference address recently and not to take the easy option of the left wing parties. If the strategy we have outlined gets the support of the majority in this House, it is a strategy which the Government can implement very easily.</P>

      <P>On 16 June I spoke in this House on the earlier Fianna Fáil cuts in education in 1987 which amounted to £11 million.  I used the occasion to detail by quotations the broken promises in each area, scrapping of computerisation, cuts in school transport, cuts in curriculum reform work, cuts in training colleges, cuts in vocational education committees, cuts in illiteracy provision, cuts in adult education, cuts in the special fund for disadvantaged schools at primary level, cuts at third level, the abandonment of the transition year, etc.  I illustrated each cut with a corresponding promise made by the Minister and Taoiseach when in Opposition and up to the day of the election, all of which led to the banner headline in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16 February last &mdash;&ldquo;Haughey pledge on school cuts welcomed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education were fully in possession of the financial facts and circumstances of the economy when they made these famous promises because Fine Gael made sure <Col N="1184" /> that every single relevant figure was published in full.  There are no excuses, no hiding places in the whining of Fianna Fáil Deputies at mass meetings around the country when they say that the economy was in a terrible state when they came to office and that they had to do something.  Fianna Fáil knew full well what they were doing when they led the country up the garden path with calculated and cold-blooded promises. Tonight, we contemplate an education system which has been rocked to its foundations by the Government and the Minister who have cut a swathe through the hopes of parents by announcing a giant step backwards for our primary system. They have been the cause of growing anger, resentment and bitterness among parents, managers and teachers who rightly feel outraged by the most regressive decision I can recall in any Government's dealing with education.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what has happened since the Minister informed the House on 8 April that she would give special priority to primary education.  The record of the Dáil is littered with such assurances but the record of the deeds in which this sorry Government have been engaged is one of crisis management, running scared and turning on the weak to placate the strong.  I have a leaflet here which contains a full selection of Fianna Fáil promises in 1985, 1986 and 1987 on primary education, which I understand was compiled by the INTO.  The quotations are choice but I will not detain the House by going through them all because I have already used them in various speeches.  Of course, each one of those statements was made with full knowledge of the exact financial circumstances of the country.  Speaking at the INTO congress this Easter, the Minister said that the improvement of the pupil/teacher ratio was indeed high on her priorities.  In referring to the problems of illiteracy, the Minister said in April 1985 in the House that the problem, no matter what angle we view it from, can be related back to the unfavourable pupil/teacher ratio.  Last month, when the Minister was asked why she changed her <Col N="1185" /> position on all these promises said that of course she was in Cabinet now.  That was last month, when the full realisation of the dimensions of the confidence trick played on the parents was hitting home to them as circular 20/87 dropped through the post boxes of school managers.</P>
    <P>The Official Report of 6 February 1986 would be amusing if it was not so sad.  A former Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, in the heat of debate, made the following statement:</P>
    <P>A Government without honour is a Government without support.  This Government have no honour left.  They have no word.</P>
    <P>I can only say to the Minister and to the Government that if the cap fits they should wear it.</P>
    <P>Looking at the record of Fine Gael in Government between 1982 and 1987, in Coalition with our Labour partners we gave priority to primary education because we knew and we acted on the conviction that primary education was underfunded, classes were too big and the financial burdens too heavy for most parents.  We created 92 extra teaching posts under our scheme for disadvantaged schools, we increased capitation grants to relieve the burden of raising endless money to meet basic school needs.  However, this Government have now frozen that rate in 1988, on top of the freeze in 1987.</P>
    <P>We established the first special fund which bought books and materials, paid off crippling debts, established special training courses for teachers and helped the weakest in society.  It grew to £2.5 million under our stewardship.  It is being cut again by Fianna Fáil in 1988 who already cut it in 1987.  Each and every such initiative, when brought to the floor of this House, was grudgingly welcomed by Fianna Fáil but always with accompanying loud calls for greater spending.  For example, in 1986, when I had increased the fund by £250,000, the present Minister called for a bigger increase saying that while the amount had increased so had the problem.  Now it is time to ask the Minister and the Government <Col N="1186" /> to stop for a moment to contemplate the problems they will cause throughout this country, problems which will particularly affect the weaker, slower child who needs help and attention.  I am sure every Fianna Fáil Deputy has been inundated &mdash; as I have been &mdash; by calls to their offices and clinics from angry and bewildered parents who fear the worst for their children.  They have every right to fear the worst because the facts are so grim as they emerge.</P>
    <P>As 1 January approaches, teachers are being told they must get ready to go on the panel, move to other schools or go on the dole.  They are being wooed with the carrot of a redundancy package not yet finalised to get them off the payroll altogether.  There is widespread confusion about the total number to be lost but the Minister says she hopes to save £10 million on the worsening of the PTR in 1988.  Schools are bracing themselves for a massive reorganisation of already large classes; smaller schools are contemplating a future with no principal to organise the whole school, to see parents, to look after sick or injured children and to advise and help teachers on disciplinary problems which are, unfortunately, crucial today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confused as she set the figures on the numbers of teachers to be lost originally at 1,300 but it is creeping upwards at each pronouncement.  She is in direct conflict with the INTO figures which are well above 2,000.  Whichever is correct, the results will be dire for schools which will see children herded into classes which will have to be much larger than before.  The amount of remedial work possible will plummet and the gains made in recent years by dedicated teachers and parents working together will be set at nought.  All this will affect the child's progress through primary school, particularly the weaker child, and, therefore, affect the whole education of the child who depends on the start he or she gets at primary level to see her or him through second level education and, for the fortunate few, to third level.  How was this extraordinary <Col N="1187" /> decision made?  How could the Minister and the Government have impaled themselves upon this hook which sees their Deputies wriggling on the end of it at every mass meeting across the country? The explanation is simple and Deputy Noonan mentioned it earlier on, simple in its cause but very nasty in its effects.</P>
    <P>As negotiations went on during the summer to reach a pay agreement with the public service unions, the price of that agreement clocked up more and more millions with every percentage point conceded. The unions, naturally, were doing their job and doing it well.  How are they to know that over at Merrion Street in the Cabinet room every Minister was chopping away at the public service, getting rid of civil servants, agricultural specialists, An Foras Forbartha but, most seriously and cruelly, getting rid of teachers to match the rising cost of the pay bill?  The area they hit on was the softest target &mdash; or so they thought &mdash; that of primary education.  The figure to be saved there was £10 million, the biggest staff cut in any area.  The announcement was held over for five days after the £70 million extra in pay was conceded.  It took considerable questioning and probing to establish that £70 million was also exactly the sum to be clawed back from cutting staff right across the public service.  Delay or no delay, it was immediately apparent to me and to my colleagues that a desperately bad bargain had been struck. The group in society put first in the firing line and paying for this was children.  I said that on 13 October and I have been saying it again and again ever since.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have had the courage to point out something the Government are afraid even to contemplate, that they went massively wrong in balancing pay and numbers in that deal.  The circular known as 20/87 carries a price tag of £10 million.  Any call for its withdrawal immediately cuts £10 million and costs £10 million and the taxpayer must know where that will come from.  The Government and the Minister know they have tripped up and made a very costly blunder. The public service unions now know <Col N="1188" /> that they were hoodwinked.  Ten million pounds is one-seventh of the £70 million pay deal.  Will the Government have the courage to ask the social partners to look again at the pay figures so that the disastrous cuts affecting vital areas like primary education can be put right, so that circular 20/87 can be withdrawn without breaching the financial targets set by the Government and without involving more taxation or more borrowing?  All of us who are paid out of the public purse are to benefit from the infamous bargain cooked up by the Government and put across on the unions.  There is no alternative method of finding £10 million within education, an area which has been stripped bare by the second massive attack on it in one year to the tune of £97 million, an area where all of our student numbers are still growing each year and where facilities are wildly overstretched in every area.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion has two main characteristics.  It is responsible and it is workable.  All it needs it goodwill from Government and unions.  Hardship need not be caused by some adjustments in the pay deal while untold damage to children above all will be caused by the Government's proposal.  We do not propose to insult the intelligence of parents by pretending that £10 million can be easily found.  We are putting forward the logical and consistent way of finding it.</P>
    <P>I am mystified by Deputy Quill's announcement this morning that it could be found by scrapping the building of a veterinary college.  There is not a veterinary college to be built.  There is no money for any veterinary college.  As far as I can ascertain neither is there any money earmarked for a dental hospital in 1988.  That pronouncement is an example of a desperate casting about and it illustrates the collapse of the Progressive Democrats under the first serious pressure they have encountered. They went to these meetings around the country and decided they wanted to be the heroes of the parents by throwing away all their principles in one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>I hope that as this debate goes on <Col N="1189" /> serious thought will be given to the enormity of the wrong which is being done to primary school children in order to give pay increases to us.  I hope this House will unite to direct the Government to sit down again and find a way out of this morass into which they are plunging the educational system.  This is 18 November; there is time to call a halt to this disastrous process.  I hope that all parties in this House will support the motion before the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;affirms that the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> including the Draft Public Service Pay Agreement and the analogous Draft Private Sector Pay Agreement, negotiated between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industries, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Cooperative Organisation Society and Macra na Feirme represents a concerted and balanced approach, unique in our history, to the grave problems facing the country and an equitable sharing of the burdens which have to be borne by the different sectors of the community as well as providing a sound basis, agreed between all economic and social interests, for increasing growth and employment; in that context it endorses the contribution made by the trade unions particularly as regards pay in the formulation of this type of participative economic programme long sought by the trade union movement.</P>

    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represents a concerted effort by the Government, in agreement with the social partners, to confront the major problems, economic and social, which currently face us.

      <P>I did not get it when the Deputy was speaking, nor did I ask for it.  However, I will ensure that the Deputy gets a copy of this.  The economic and social problems now facing us did not suddenly appear overnight &mdash; they are more the end product of a steady deterioration in our position over a long number of years.  The huge growth in our national debt in recent years and the unprecedented levels of unemployment are only two of the more obvious manifestations of this deterioration.  In late 1986, the National Economic and Social Council produced a report, <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i> which set out the basic principles which it saw as being necessary for a recovery strategy. The most striking aspect of the report was that all the interest groups represented on the council &mdash; trade unions, employers and farmers &mdash; endorsed the four pronged strategy envisaged.</P>
      <P>This strategy involved integrated macro-economic policies, tax reform development policies and a more equitable society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the report was formally <Col N="1191" /> accepted by the new Government on coming to office in March of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the tax reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Central to the recovery process is the pursuit of a budgetary policy which faces squarely the financial realities.  In that regard, the stabilisation of the ratio between the national debt and Gross National Product has been identified as a key step.  If this fundamental relationship was allowed to continue to deteriorate, the servicing of the debt would absorb an increasing share of resources, leaving less and less for other purposes.</P>
      <P>To tackle this problem in an optimum way, policy actions must be mutually consistent. We believe we have achieved the correct balance in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; the various elements of the programme will act in a mutually reinforcing manner to curtail borrowing and reduce interest rates, making possible faster economic growth and increasing employment.  The stabilisation of the debt/GNP ratio in the course of the programme will involve a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP, depending on developments in economic growth and interest rates.  The proposals for public expenditure in the coming year, reflected in the recently published abridged Estimates volume and in the Public Capital Programme, dovetail into this strategy, while the next stage, the 1988 budget itself, will have the objective of consolidating the adjustment process now begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the motion before us, I cannot understand what its terms are intended to mean.  Is it being suggested that the Government reopen a fundamental feature of a programme which has been concluded voluntarily with the social partners after a protracted period of difficult negotiations?  Is it being suggested that we set aside the process and the results of ballots which have just been <Col N="1192" /> concluded in good faith throughout the length and breadth of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>More particularly as far as the education system is concerned, is it being suggested that we set at nought the outcome of the teachers' ballots on the draft pay agreement, which, according to media reports, has been substantially in favour of the draft agreement on pay in the public service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore is it then being suggested that the Government return to the negotiating table with a revised strategy that would exclude pay increases for public servants over the next three years and then realistically hope to conclude a revised programme?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.  If any or all of the foregoing suggestions are implied in the Fine Gael motion, I can only conclude that the proposers of the motion are in cloud cuckooland, blindly refusing to face reality.</P>
      <P>The draft public service pay agreement provides for increases in basic pay as follows: 3 per cent on the first £120 of basic weekly pay and 2 per cent on any amount of basic weekly pay over £120.  Where the application of this formula would result in increases of less than £4 per week in basic pay for full time adult employees, the increases shall be adjusted to that amount.</P>
      <P>In the public service the first increase is due for payment on 1 January next, a full six months after the expiry of the 25th round agreement.</P>
      <P>As regards the general increases proposed, I would have to reject any criticism of their level &mdash; about 2½ per cent per annum over the next three years &mdash; as both unreasonable and unrealistic.  The levels of the increases are moderate by any standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Over the years the ICTU in their guidelines on round claims, have regularly sought provisions to improve the relative wage income of the lower paid.  While some such provision was included in the various National Agreements during the seventies the position of the lower paid did not attract special consideration in recent years.  For this reason I am glad that the pay provisions of the programme will facilitate a genuine improvement in the lot of the less well off over the period of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>But primary education will be less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the fact that the Government know clearly in advance the level of pay increases for a long period ahead is of crucial significance for the purposes of economic and social planning.  Given the size of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill and the fact that it constitutes the greatest single element of current Government expenditure, the value of knowing this and the certainty it gives to planning public service pay costs cannot be overstated. The fact that this has been achieved by consensus with the social partners is especially noteworthy.</P>
      <P>To return to the problems facing us on our return to Government, our first priority had to be to address the basic problem &mdash; excessive public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1987 budget was the first phrase in implementing our strategy and significant progress towards our objective of reducing dependence on borrowing was made.  In the very short time available to us significant public expenditure reductions totalling £120 million were made on the expenditure allocations made by our predecessors.  These expenditure reductions were, <i>inter alia,</i> intended to ensure that the 1987 budget would be seen as the turning point in the restoration of the economy.</P>
      <P>Even then, though, it became crystal clear that the progress made would only be the initial step on the road to recovery. The scale of our problems was such that we realised that the process would have to be continued into 1988 and beyond if order was to be restored to the public finances and our economy was to be got moving again.</P>
      <P>The Government, therefore, set about preparing their expenditure plans for 1988 immediately after the budget.  The first step in this process involved an in-depth review of all existing spending programmes. This exercise was the most rigorous and searching review of Government expenditure that has ever taken place in this country.  Priorities were reassessed, programmes and schemes which were no longer relevant or which had outlived their usefulness were identified and ended, and waste and duplication were eliminated.  The result has been that savings of £412 million have been secured for 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1988 Estimates show that the Government have succeeded in their main objective of finally arresting the <Col N="1195" /> upward spiral in public expenditure. Expenditure has been reduced &mdash; in cash terms &mdash; for the first time in almost 30 years.  Major cuts have been made while at the same time, ensuring that an adequate level of service is maintained, particularly for those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The overall full-year effect of the non-capital reductions made in the 1987 budget and the 1988 Estimates combined, has been to reduce expenditure in 1988 by about £650 million below what would otherwise have been the case, that is a cut of about 10 per cent in real terms. This is a very significant achievement in anyone's book.</P>
    <P>The package of cuts affects all areas of expenditure.  It was considered that while no one section should have to bear the brunt of expenditure reductions neither should any areas be exempted.</P>
    <P>At times of major expenditure adjustments there is a particular need to consider the interests of the less well off. The package of measures produced is a genuine attempt to spread the burden of adjustments where it can best be shouldered and to protect the less well off members of society.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Our concern for the less well off is clearly demonstrated in both our actions since coming to office and our published commitments for the next few years.</P>
    <P>For instance, we paid this year's welfare increase from July instead of from November as had been proposed by our predecessors.  This helped to ensure that welfare recipients would not fall behind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not totally irrelevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, we maintained the Christmas bonus for welfare recipients despite widespread concern that it would be reduced or abolished. Up to 920,000 recipients and dependants will benefit from this bonus.  We also extended the equal treatment alleviating measures so that beneficiaries could not suffer a sudden drop in their welfare <Col N="1196" /> incomes coming up to Christmas. Another notable achievement was the more equitable use of existing resources. I refer here to the free fuel scheme where, by a small reduction in the length of the heating season, we are able to extend its coverage to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it in order for the Minister to speak about a free fuel scheme in a debate about education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubtless Deputy McDowell will have an opportunity, if he wishes to avail himself of it. In the meantime he must desist from interrupting or leave the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am asking why the Minister should refer to a free fuel scheme in a debate about education.  It is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy persists with further interruption I shall insist on his leaving the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the motion before the House he might understand why.  Obviously he is concerned only in a narrow sense.  This is a wider debate than that intended by his party.</P>
      <P>Finally, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> safeguards welfare recipients generally with its commitment to maintaining the overall value of their payments.</P>
      <P>In summary, therefore, our deep concern for those on welfare has been translated into decisions to keep welfare programmes largely intact despite significant reductions on all other current expenditure programmes.  It will and must remain firm Government policy, however, to keep all programmes under constant review with a view to more equiptable and efficient targeting of benefits and the avoidance of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the health area the strategy initiated last year of reorganising the health services to deliver a more efficient service is being continued.  Cost containment units <Col N="1197" /> have been established to ensure that hospitals and other institutions are run as efficiently as possible while reviews of the various schemes for the supply of drugs will be undertaken to ensure that they are operating in the most efficient way possible.</P>
    <P>Our major concern continues to be the provision of adequate public care to those who need it and sufficient resources are being made available to the health services to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I turn now to education and I hope Deputy McDowell will listen very carefully to what I have to say.  I want to spend some time on what precisely is happening in the education sector given that the motion and the other amendments refer specifically to it.  Currently, 6.5 per cent of GNP is being spent on this sector.  Before 1979, we were spending less than 5 per cent of GNP on education. In 1986, 16.5 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services was spent on education services.  In 1988, even with the savings measures proposed, £18 out of every £100 expenditure will go on education services.  With the many other demands on the public purse, we simply cannot afford to divert a larger slice of our resources to education.  Given the size of the education budget and given our public finance problems, there was no way in which the education sector could be exempted from contributing to the corrective action needed in the public finances.</P>
    <P>In 1988, we will be spending £1,129 million on current services in education. This appears to represent a reduction of 2.8 per cent on the 1987 provision. However, this is not the case.  Because January 1988 begins with a bank holiday and a week-end, a pay issue for national teachers which would normally fall in 1988 will be a charge on 1987.  This means we need about £37 million less to pay the same salaries in 1988 as in 1987.  When account is taken of this one factor, the £1,129 million to be spent in 1988 represents a decrease of less than 1 per cent on what was provided for 1987 and in fact represents a small increase of 0.4 per cent <Col N="1198" /> on the outturn now being projected for 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In real terms it is less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew Deputy McDowell would not like that.  I do not think this has generally been adverted to or appreciated.</P>
      <P>In examining the scope for savings in the primary sector &mdash; which appears to be the principal concern of the proposers of this motion &mdash; the House should note that in the present year, 1987, over 90 per cent of the current cost of running the primary education system goes on pay and pensions.  The pay and pensions bill comes to £386.5 million out of a total of £428.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the high proportion of total spending that goes on pay and pensions, the proportionately smaller segment of non-teacher expenditures could not sustain reductions in funding of an order large enough, <i>in toto,</i> to yield the savings that were necessary.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, there was no alternative but to consider a significant reduction in pay costs.  Realistically speaking, this could only be done by reducing numbers in the teaching force. This, as the House knows, is being done through two measures, the increase from 35 to 38 in the number of pupils required per teacher and with withdrawal of specific provision in the schedule of average enrolments in respect of non-teaching principals.  The increase from 35 to 38 does not necessarily mean an extra three pupils in every primary school class, nor does it mean that the pupil/teacher ratio goes from 35 to 38.  Average class size is approximately 30.5 at present.  When the measures proposed have gone into effect, average class size will rise to approximately 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, it is estimated that the measures will result in 1,800 posts becoming surplus.  The teachers holding these posts may, in the general case, opt to have their <Col N="1199" /> names placed on panels for redeployment. It is expected that some 500 teachers will be redeployed through vacancies arising in the normal way through leaving the service other than through redundancy and so on.  This will leave an estimated 1,300 teachers, who it is envisaged, will apply and be accepted on the basis of the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>The reason we hear of very large classes is in fact the choices schools make for organisational reasons.  Through organising class groups in a more flexible manner, a change advocated by my colleague the Minister for Education, over large classes could be avoided.  The new schedule need not lead to the over large classes that have been alleged if schools are willing to give due consideration to matters of organisation.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have been told that the changes which Government have been forced to adopt will cause severe damage to the education system and to the children going through it.  This is a proposition that needs to be looked at critically.  The House may not be aware that the pupil-teacher ratios which will obtain when the changes are in place will be virtually identical to those that obtained as recently as 1978.  Contrary to what many people would have us believe, the Government are not proposing to reintroduce the Dark Ages.</P>
    <P>We are also told that the changes we are now making will make it impossible for teachers to teach the new curriculum. However, the House should know that the new curriculum was introduced in 1971 and was taught until 1974 under pupil-teacher ratios that were less favourable than those we have now decided on. I think these points should be made to ensure that Members of this House are fully informed of all the relevant facts and that consideration of the issues involved is not clouded by emotive arguments.</P>
    <P>Our concern with reducing public expenditure has not been limited to cutting schemes and programmes.  The <Col N="1200" /> streamlining and reorganisation of the public service administrative machinery to ensure a cost effective provision of essential services was a response to a clear need to rationalise State agencies and services.</P>
    <P>Cumbersome and overlapping structures have grown up over the years in the State agency sector.  It appeared to us that some of the functions being carried out by the State sector could be more economically and efficiently performed as normal functions of the parent Department. Similarly in other instances the task for which specific State bodies were set up had been accomplished.  In other areas there was basic duplication of effort.  The elimination of duplication, overlap, waste and non-essential activity in the State sector was therefore a serious objective in the formulation of the Estimates for 1988.</P>
    <P>To this end the 1988 Estimates allow for the continuation of the general ban on recruitment to the public service, thus improving the efficiency of the central administration and include measures to reduce allocations for travel expenditure by Government Departments and State agencies, the merger of various State agencies to eliminate duplication, and reduced grants to other State agencies, to ensure that only priority activities are funded.  Redundancies are an unavoidable and necessary consequence of this objective and to cope with this the voluntary redundancy scheme has been introduced.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the motion to difficulties for public service employees arising from the operation of the early retirement-redundancy package.  I am not aware of such difficulties.  In fact, the widespread interest being shown by so many public servants in the options on offer confirms that the Government's approach has been a reasonable one in the prevailing circumstances.  Given the absolute necessity to curtail public expenditure programmes and the consequent need to reduce public sector staff numbers, the Government are endeavouring to secure this reduction in the fairest way possible.  In the first place, the package is <Col N="1201" /> a voluntary one.  Secondly, it contains a number of elements &mdash; redeployment, career breaks, job-sharing and financial terms for early retirement &mdash; and thus provides a range of methods for reducing numbers in a constructive manner.  Natural wastage will, of course, also contribute to this process.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial terms, the various options on offer reflect existing distinctions between categories of public sector staff as regards Social Welfare and Redundancy Payments Acts entitlements. While it would not be feasible, because of these distinctions, to offer precisely the same terms to each group concerned, the terms on offer are designed to ensure that broadly equal benefits are conferred on each group.  In this way inequities are avoided as much as possible.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve the necessary impact, the voluntary early retirement-redundancy package is designed to apply over the entire public sector, excluding the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána. At first the measures were implemented in areas where staff surplus to requirements had been identified.  While this process will continue, the Government have recently decided to give added impetus to the programme by extending the arrangements to staff aged 50 and over in the Civil Service, health boards and non-commercial State bodies. Acceptance of the financial terms by such staff will, of course, make it possible to provide the necessary public services with a reduced staffing complement. Redeployment will naturally be employed to this end.  I am satisfied that no loss of efficiency will be entailed in this rationalisation process, especially as management will retain the right to refuse the terms to key personnel.</P>
    <P>An argument underpinning the Fine Gael motion appears to be that if there is no public service pay increase in 1988 there will be no need for the shedding of any public service jobs.  This argument appears to be based on the assertion that the pay savings achieved by shedding jobs in 1988 amount to £70 million.  I must assume that this estimate is based on a <Col N="1202" /> simple comparison of the figures for the 1987 and 1988 Exchequer pay and pensions bill contained in the abridged 1988 Estimates volume.  However, such a comparison fails to take account of the fact that the £70 million saving is a net figure, consisting of the savings arising from job losses offset by a range of factors such as increments and instalments of approved special pay increases.  The net effect, therefore, is that the Exchequer pay and pensions bill would be increased by much more than £70 million if no jobs were shed and, therefore, the simplistic argument that the absence of a public service agreement would fully fund the retention of public service jobs does not stand up.</P>
    <P>Since this is a voluntary redundancy scheme, it is not possible at this stage to predict precisely how many public servants will avail of the scheme and from what categories, organisations and grades they will come.  Similarly, it would be futile to attempt to give a precise figure as to the eventual cost of lump sums and additional pensions, as these depend on the salary levels and length of service of the people who apply for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of The Workers' Party suggests that better tax collection procedures would remove the necessity for expenditure cuts.  As was made clear by a Minister for Finance in the previous Government there is no crock of gold in uncollected taxes which can solve our public finance problems. The Government are nevertheless committed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to ensure prompt payment of taxes and measures to improve the situation are under consideration. Already in the 1987 budget the Government have introduced a task force on tax collection and a withholding tax on certain professional fees.  Both of these measures are making a significant contribution to improving compliance with tax obligations.</P>
    <P>The Government are already committed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to reviewing capital taxation and investigating the scope for increasing the yield from capital taxes in the context of the 1988 and subsequent budgets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> The Government have decided and are supported by a massive weight of economic opinion that controlling and curtailing public expenditure is the best way to balance the budget rather than increased taxation or borrowing.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will endorse the Government's action to date and acclaim the outstanding achievement of the social partners in the formulation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  For my own part I would like to pay tribute again to the responsible and realistic approach of the social partners in achieving a comprehensive programme which will constitute a milestone on the country's path to economic recovery.  I would hope that the Opposition, when replying to this debate, would acknowledge the significance of the programme and the importance of its contribution to tackling the country's social and economic problems.</P>

The belief has been abroad for some time, and it is finally confirmed for us this evening by the Minister's presence, by the absence of the Minister for Education and by the tone and content of the speech made by the Minister for Finance, that there is no education policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which has already been tabled will be moved later and its purpose is to unite all the Opposition parties in the hope that we will succeed in our object, the retention of the pupil/teacher ratio at its existing level and the withdrawal of the infamous circular 20/87.  Unless we in our position take a unified stand on this issue we stand to be defeated and all the fine sentiments spoken here this evening will be little more than window dressing for the folks back home.  We saw what happened to the motion on the Curriculum and Examinations Bill voted on in this House last evening.  I listened attentively to every word spoken in the debate.  I have not heard finer educationally-motivated contributions to any Bill since I came to the House.  But in the heel of the hunt, despite the fact that we in the Progressive Democrats took the whole issue so seriously, even to bringing back our Deputy Ann Colley who was in the Old Bailey to hear the trial of the Birmingham Six to ensure that we would have our full voting complement in the House in the hope that that Bill would be passed, the Bill failed and the score this morning for this House was Deputy O'Rourke: 1; Deputy Hussey: Nil.  That is a sad experience on top of all the other experiences that I have had since I came to this House where time and time again on a series of serious issues I have heard fine speeches coming from the Opposition benches but when the time comes to vote on the issues there has not been a united front, a common approach where issues matter.  Everyone went their separate ways.  Many times I have asked myself why this was so or when it is going to stop.  The punter has been tempted to say that when the time comes we will never get all the Opposition in Leinster House <Col N="1205" /> to combine because they are scared stiff of having an election.  It was my hope and the hope of my party when we put down this amendment that we could call upon the support of every Opposition Deputy in this House, that we could combine on this issue above all issues because we were prepared to take this issue of primary education very seriously.  I am not so sure from what I heard during the day outside the House that I have the same confidence now as I had.  However, I hope it is not too late yet.  I hope that our amendment when put will have support. Otherwise we are set to be as we have been since the Dáil met last March, a bit like Lanigan's ball, stepping in and stepping out again but never stepping out as Opposition people in unison.  I hope that is not going to happen this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey has been accusing me of casting around to find the money with which to compensate the additional teachers who need to be put back onto the pay-roll if we are to maintain the pupil/teacher ratio that was there before the circular 20/87 was issued.  If we had had a united front on the Ministerial Pensions Bill and if people who were in receipt of ministerial pensions in this House had been generous enough to give up their pensions and put that money into the Exchequer we could go a long way to funding the additional teachers needed to maintain our pupil/teacher ratio.  But we did not unite on that either and I can only hope that we will unite on this.</P>
    <P>My suspicion is that the Minister for Education will have the last laugh.  Long before Deputy Hussey's Bill was put on the Order Paper the 14 members of the Progressive Democrats put it on public record that they were quite prepared to forego their 2½ per cent in the hope of retaining the pupil/teacher ratio and they were going to do that in the same spirit and in the same manner as their leader and chairman gave up their pensions voluntarily some months ago.  That is on public record and I am glad to put it on the record of the House here this evening.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me refer to the fact that we have before this House three different motions tabled by the three main <Col N="1206" /> Opposition parties.  They all have one element in common, that is the retention of the pupil/teacher ratio.  After that they go their separate ways in regard to how the money is to be provided.  But they have that in common and that is the common ground from which we can go forward and on which we can work.  From that we can draw strength as an Opposition if we can agree.  If we do not agree, the fine words said here this evening will be lost up there again at the point where we all vote.</P>

      <P>Most assuredly the motions which we have taken one by one as they have been submitted will be defeated one by one by one.  That is why we have to put in this one simple amendment, an amendment that can command the support of every member of the Opposition, asking the Minister to withdraw circular 20/87.  This is an essential prerequisite to solving this serious problem. Unless the Government agree, all the fine stuff said during the debate will be little more than academic.  On the other hand, if we succeed in forcing the Government to withdraw that circular then we can sit down and, in a constructive and positive spirit, tease out fully how best the moneys can be found to enable us to retain the pupil/teacher ratio and avoid the inevitable consequences that will follow unless the circular is withdrawn.  If we do not do that, all the other motions will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must remind the House of a sad experience we had in this party during the course of our Private Members' motion on health when we argued logically for the reduction of the number of health boards and of the amount of money spent on the administration of health and for the putting of this money into patient care.  When the time came to put that issue to the vote, what kind of support did we get from Fine Gael?  Out of 51 members of Fine Gael, 23 thought seriously enough of that voting to come in and support us.  That has been my <Col N="1207" /> experience as an Opposition Deputy in this House.  It is a sad experience.  It becomes sadder when I hear hollow statements made in every constituency in this country from members of the main Opposition party about where they stand on health and what they will do about health.  When they had an opportunity to signal with strength to the Government and to combine behind us, what do they do?  They sat in their offices and they sat in the Library and they sat everywhere, but they did not come in to support us. One might well ask why.  Because whatever else is happening they are absolutely terrified that we might force any serious issue to the point of an election.  That is the bottom line for every voting intention in Fine Gael and it is the bottom line in this motion as well.  We see it for what it is and we will not be fooled on that one.</P>
    <P>We are not afraid of the consequences if this motion is defeated.  We have the freedom in our party to put the welfare of our children first.  We have a totally united party firm in its leadership with a membership that is quite prepared to do battle.  That is why we say to the Government, with all the strength that we command on these benches, that we are testing them on this issue.  We are quite prepared to put this issue to the Government. If we fail, so seriously do we take it that we will take the issue to the people.</P>
    <P>Our whole approach to this debate is totally consistent with everything we have said on education since our party was formed.  At our annual party conference last October we devoted all our debate on education to primary education, so important do we think primary education is.  During the course of that debate we called for more teachers, not fewer.  We called for more remedial teaching, we called for the provision of a schools psychological and guidance service because we saw these things as being absolute essentials if we were to maintain and develop our standards in primary education.</P>

The ink was not dry on that plan when our leader, Desmond O'Malley, spoke of it in his address to the party conference on 10 October with grave suspicion. He pointed out there that he was absolutely disgusted at the fact that any Government at this time could decide to pay all their public servants from the Taoiseach down, all their Ministers, Ministers of State, highly paid senior civil <Col N="1209" /> servants, county and city managers, an increase of 2½ per cent and on an incremental basis while at the same time young teachers, young nurses and council workers were being driven out of their jobs.  He was the very first person to say that.  I heard nobody else saying it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, what we are saying here in this amendment and what we shall be saying in our motion when it comes up is entirely consistent with what we have said about primary education and about standards in education since our party was founded.  We did not have to go out to hear what parents had to say and if anybody is in any doubt about that, let me read for the House and write into the record an extract from a speech made by our spokesperson on Finance, Deputy McDowell, on 20 October, 1987.  It is already in the record of the House but we shall put it in again because there is strength in truth and those of us who talk about education should aim to tell the truth at all times.  That is part of education, too.  I quote from the Official Report, 20 October 1987, Volume 374, column 689, when in the course of his reply to the Estimate for 1988 Deputy McDowell had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are individual features of the Estimates which have caused considerable concern to us.  Without going through all the Votes or through all the Estimates one which stares us in the face as legislators is the balance that has been struck in education cutbacks. The fact that primary education is to bear the brunt of the cutbacks in education <Col N="1210" /> is something which is hard to understand, particularly in view of the fact that for those who are least advantaged in our society and those who are likely to suffer most from cutbacks, it is the only education they will ever receive.  I stated, as a matter of conviction, that no-one can see a series of educational cuts which focus more heavily on primary education than elsewhere as being socially progressive, or as caring for those most disadvantaged in society.  It seems that the balance has been struck wrongly in relation to education and this party will more and more forcefully get across to the Government and to the people the injustice being done by attacking primary education in particular in the context of cutbacks in education.</P>
    <P>That was what was said by our party spokesperson on 20 October.  I am not just mystified, I am completely paralysed that it has now been suggested that we had to wait to go out and meet the parents and see what they had to say before we made up our minds on what steps we were going to take on primary education. There are many people who are not listening, I am afraid.  I have already spoken of what Deputy O'Malley had to say at our conference in October.  Time and time again during the course of a number of contributions I have made to this House on education, I have pointed out the damage that is being done to our children by our already high pupil-teacher ratio.  Prior to the issuing of this circular, we had the third worst pupil-teacher ratio in Europe.  There were only two countries with a less favourable ratio, Spain and Portugal.  Surely they are countries on which we have never sought to model our educational system?  Our education tradition is such that we have looked to other countries for standards but, equally, it can be said that other countries have looked to us because whatever our failing in the past we never fell down when it came to funding primary education.  The old national schools stood by the people well and that is very well known.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> In recent years and prior to the issuing of this circular that ratio has gone wrong, wrong in terms of the needs of the modern child because children coming to school nowadays are bringing with them problems that were never there when we went to school.  They are bringing with them a demand for attention and an education that was not there when I was at school.  Society is changing and changing rapidly, family life is changing fundamentally and all these changes are impacting on the children who now come to our schools.  At this time it is more teachers that we need, not fewer.  If we are going to attain to any kind of personal development, oral confidence, or any of the finer objectives that we preach in this House, we must have more teachers in our schools.  There is no getting away from that.  If we are going to set out to eliminate the problems that are already emanating from our schools, that manifest themselves in the large number of people who leave school every year who cannot cope with the ordinary skills of reading and writing, we must act.  The figures on illiteracy are quite well known and on record.  If that is not going to get much worse, we will now have to tackle our primary schools and the single most important key element in any school is the teacher.  If we cut down on the number of our teachers anything else that we will seek to do &mdash; and indeed I see no evidence of seeking to do anything else &mdash; will be set at naught.  That is the single most important element of our education. We must get the balance right between teacher and pupil.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to a very modest and very short contribution by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe from Cork South-Central on the issue of the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment Bill.  His speech did not prove anything one way or the other.  I could not make out at the finish whether he was for or against, but I found out when he voted what side he was on.  During the course of his speech he pointed out to the House that he was a teacher at third level and mentioned in <Col N="1212" /> detail the problems he encountered with pupils who go into third level, problems that stem from lack of oral competency, from a low standard in reading and writing. He wrote those problems into the record of the House last night.  If these problems exist among those who attain entry to third level education, and if they are there already in advance of the issuing of this circular, what will they be like when a new and worse pupil-teacher ratio is put in place?  That is one end of the scale.  What about those poor children, the early school leavers, who will never even sniff at third level education and many of whose futures have been determined even before they leave first level, those who embark on second level but who only mark time until they reach the age of 15 years when they can escape from that awful place called school? Nothing in school has any real meaning for such children.  What is to happen to them when this new pupil teacher ratio is put in place?  How much worse off will they be?</P>
    <P>The case has been made and we could argue the educational aspects of it forever. That is what we ought to do but in regard to our amendment let me say that we have adopted a deliberate strategy which we think will unite all of the Opposition parties and which we hope will unite all the Members of the Opposition with a view to signalling quite clearly and very strongly to the Minister and the Government that this kind of cutback is not acceptable to those of us who are in Opposition, that we will not tolerate it and are prepared to go to the ultimate if need be.</P>
    <P>What we are saying to the Government is that they go back to the drawing board and think the matter out again because this decision could hardly have been made with any thought for the quality of education.  We are pleading with the Minister to think about the implications of this cutback and to think of the overall and long term cost if this cut were to be implemented.  We are asking the Minister to listen to what we are all saying.  There has never been so much national consensus as there has been on this issue. <Col N="1213" /> We are asking the Minister to have the good sense and the courage to rescind this circular and do so now.  In the three weeks available to her, she ought to come up with some kind of economic strategy which would enable us to retain the pupil teacher ratio at the level at which it was prior to the publication of the Estimates for 1988.</P>
    <P>We have clearly and consistently put our option on the table and our preferred option is now as it was before we tabled our amendment which derives directly from what our Leader said in his address to the national conference.  That option is that the moneys to enable her to do this should be taken out of the public pay element in the national plan.  We say that everybody, except perhaps the very lowest paid workers, such as the low paid council workers, should accept a pay pause.  Some of these low paid council workers are paid little more than those on the dole.  We would not grudge paying them the 2.5 per cent.  In fact we would insist that they would receive the 2.5 per cent but from there on up every responsible person, given the option, would accept this pay pause &mdash; that is what we are asking for &mdash; rather than preside in silence over the destruction of our education system.</P>
    <P>You cannot destroy primary education which is the cornerstone of all education and say that you are going to maintain the other elements and maintain them upwards.  That is not possible because if you decimate the foundation, the edifice will crumble.  That is what is going to happen if this new pupil/teacher ratio is put in place and the ordinary people can relate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to sincerely thank a number of Opposition Members of this House for being prepared to put aside their own ideology, for being prepared to forego any previous plans they had and for being <Col N="1214" /> prepared to give support to this very simple amendment.  They do so in the belief that our children and their future are more important than any of us in this House and are infinitely more important than any divide which might exist between Opposition Deputies.  I want to sincerely thank those Deputies who have indicated quite strongly to me that they are prepared to support this amendment.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of leadership we do not often see in this House but when it does happen it is the kind of leadership which draws a blessing down on the Members of this House because for too long the electorate have seen us divide on very cultural issues.  The expectations of Members have been built up during the course of very fine debates in this House in which sentiments which appeared to be very sincerely held were put forward but when the time came to vote, by some strange kind of manoeuvring or headcounting the issue fell and nothing was achieved.  That has happened all too often since I came into this House and it has happened on issues which fundamentally affect the welfare of our people and the future of this country. I do not want it to happen where our children and the maintenance and development of primary education are concerned.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I appeal to everybody to forget about the election and not to be afraid.  I appeal to all the other Opposition Members to talk to their Leaders and to ask them to look at the kind of courageous and firm leadership which is being given by Deputy Desmond O'Malley, to take a leaf out of his book, to look at what he was prepared to do on the pensions Bill and to ask whether they are prepared to do the same.  Put your children first and act now.  If you do, not alone will the children of this generation and future generations thank you but you will have done something which will stand to your own eternal credit as legislators in this House in very bad times.  There has hardly been a worse time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Whitaker report is regarded as a milestone in the history &mdash; if any &mdash; of penal reform in this State.  It represents the culmination of a campaign begun in 1972 by persons concerned with penal reform who pursued relentlessly an issue calling for the <Col N="1217" /> comprehensive investigation of our prison service.  It invited and received submissions from all quarters of society concerned with the question of our prisons and their modernisation.  It was welcomed on its publication in a short time. The committee of inquiry were appointed on 31 January 1984 and published their report in July 1985.  The report has been with the Minister and his Department since then and it was circulated to Members of this House this year.</P>
      <P>Its conclusions are very comprehensive and the way in which it dealt with all aspects of penal reform was welcomed by all parties and persons concerned.  It represented a careful, considered and monumental contribution to the history of reform in our penal system.  When it was presented to the Minister of the day, Deputy Noonan of Fine Gael, he agreed to proceed with one of its most central and important provisions, namely, the appointment of a medical director to supervise and advance health services within the prisons.  It was agreed that this would be embarked upon without delay in advance of Department consideration of the full implications of all the report's provisions.  That consideration is ongoing, and it accentuates the great need for the appointment of such an officer.  Irrespective of whatever came out of the Government's deliberations about the Whitaker report or what fundamental changes, if any, would be introduced into our prison system, one position that needed to be filled as a matter of urgency was that of medical director.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look briefly at what was suggested by way of definition of the role of the medical director in the report. I refer to the <i>Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System,</i> briefly known as the Whitaker report, at page 66, paragraph 7.20.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure the provision of an adequate overall health service in the prisons and places of detention, we see the need for strong central direction. We recommend that this should be provided <Col N="1218" /> by a Medical Director.  His/her primary responsibility should be to ensure that the health needs of all prisoners are met adequately.</P>
    <P>Its final paragraph in the area of health services on the next page, paragraph 7.21, says:</P>
    <P>On balance, we believe that the Medical Director should be a highly qualified psychiatrist with experience in forensic psychiatry.  The Director should be located in the central administration and be accountable directly to the Director of the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>It proceeds then to salaries and other matters.  The clear intention was that this person would be very central to the whole development of the prison service and in particular the medical services.  The reasons were outlined in the report in brief.  I quote now from page 65, paragraph 7.15:</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the well-being of prisoners and to their personal development is the provision of adequate and effective health care.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to highlight the areas that need development and attention.  It indicates the need to develop psychiatric services for prisoners, to look after the requirements of below average intelligence prisoners, to rehabilitate drug and alcohol abusers, to treat and rehabilitate sex offenders and, finally, the most urgent recent development, to deal with the problem related to the increased detection of AIDS sufferers and carriers of AIDS antibodies among the prison population.  The report highlights the growing problem of medical-related discontent among prisoners being exacerbated by overcrowding, lack of educational facilities and lack of facilities to train and keep prisoners occupied.</P>
    <P>These problems were central to Dr. Whitaker's recommendation that a medical director was essential.  The problems have continued and have created even greater challenges for the prison service since the report was compiled.  Prisoners carrying AIDS or AIDS antibodies <Col N="1219" /> initially were moved to Arbour Hill. Problems developed there with regard to prison staffing and the prisoners then had to be moved back to a unit within Mountjoy Prison where problems arose with regard to, for example, their proper dental treatment.  An issue then arose in regard to the use of the unit at Dundrum. Would it be used for the purposes of the Department of Justice or of the Department of Health?  This multi-million dollar facility is still unused.  The decision on when to open Wheatfield Prison is in part influenced by the difficulties the Minister has in finding proper medical staff to look after the inmates who will ultimately be detained there.</P>
    <P>The report also identified the problem of the conditions under which medical officers work.  It recognised that many of the medical officers then employed by the prison service were attempting to cater for all the health needs of prisoners and to establish adequate liaison with professionals in associated services with whom they seldom had contact.  The appointment of a director with overall responsibility would make matters easier.</P>
    <P>Central to the whole issue of caring for prisoners is the aftercare follow-up service. Prisoners with personality, psychological and medical problems should have a follow-up service outside, working in liaison with the medical officers and their staff.  The report called for a director who would give strong central direction to the improvement of the health services.</P>
    <P>Clearly the case was urgent and it was responded to with a sense of urgency. What has happened in the meantime? Apparently two attempts were made by the previous Government to fill the position. Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers and interviews took place but no suitable person was found. We have never had a full explanation as to what exactly went wrong.  Did too few people apply?  Were the wrong kind of people canvassed?  The report stated it would benefit the service if the holder engaged in some medico-legal practice <Col N="1220" /> and had a link with a university department.</P>
    <P>The committee believed the appointment of a competent and committed director with leadership qualities would go far to promote a high level of morale in the medical service and bring about a significant improvement in the overall standard of health care throughout the prison system.  I wonder whether the salary is adequate to attract someone with an academic background and contact with a university department which is so essential to the whole idea of developing the criminology and penalogical notions behind the improvement of health services.  Such a person would have the opportunity to address these questions and plug into the research facilities available at that level.  The person appointed would also need a psychiatric background in view of the central role of that type of service in our prisons.  The report identified the need to develop all these areas and aspects of the medical service.  It is clear that no serious progress can ever be expected in any of these areas unless a director is appointed to bring forward in an ordered way the whole area of prison reform.</P>
    <P>The present situation is unacceptable. A Government with all their ingenuity and resources simply cannot come into this House and say they cannot find a person suitably qualified to meet the requirements.  They must offer the necessary terms to make the position attractive. It is crucial that the position be filled, no matter what salary is required.  It is up to the Government to make the commitment and to ensure that the resources are available.  It is incumbent on the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to make this appointment, particularly where they are providing a service for people who are detained against their will as a form of punishment.</P>
    <P>A disturbing factor is the general belief in the prison service and among some sectors of the community that the embargo on public service recruitment is impinging on this appointment to a greater extent than any non-availability of suitable personnel.  It is believed the <Col N="1221" /> recent Government decision to refuse to appoint new staff is impeding the appointment of a director or prohibiting any future consideration of such an appointment.  Is it the position that the Government have formally abandoned any efforts to find a person to fill this position?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the reply to my Question No. 52 on 10 November last.  I had asked the Minister about the death of a young man in St. Patrick's Institution.  It seems quite clear from the reply that the Minister is not in any way addressing the recommendations of the Whitaker report.  He suggests that because of the cutback in the workload of the chief medical officer for the Civil Service he is in a position to involve him in the role originally envisaged for the director of medical services within the prison service. With no disrespect to the person concerned, this man clearly has a very important job in the Civil Service and this type of transfer and part-involvement in the prison service is no substitute for the appointment of a director.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to clarify precisely the Government's position with regard to this appointment.  I would ask him to indicate whether the Government accept the urgency of the situation as reflected in the report and in the response of the then Government.  Are the Government prepared to make a serious effort to locate a suitable person, either inside or outside this country?  Will the Minister pursue the matter, recognising the urgency of the situation and aware of the increasing pressures which will inevitably build upon the medical staff in our prisons who are working under intolerable conditions?  They must be aided in the way envisaged in the Whitaker report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the comments made by Deputy McCartan on the Whitaker report, it is not correct to suggest that nothing has been done in relation to that Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.  Since it has been published <Col N="1222" /> its findings have been taken into account as appropriate in dealing with various prison issues, including the appointment of a medical director.  What tends to be overlooked is that many of the recommendations contained in the report, for example in the personnel area, were in line with developments already underway as part of the on going process of prison administration.  In considering the report, changing circumstances have to be accommodated.  For example, when the committee carried out their inquiry, AIDS-related problems were not a significant issue.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the committee set out a number of general approaches and principles which should be adhered to.  In saying that I am not criticising that approach, far from it, but it would be misleading to characterise the report as a detailed blueprint for the future operation of the prison service which simply requires a series of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; decisions on my part or that of the Government.</P>
      <P>In January 1986, the then Government approved the immediate appointment of a director of medical services for the prisons.  The background to the decision was the escalating medical problems among the prisoner population, especially following the identification of numbers of prisoners as being antibody positive to the AIDS virus.  The Whitaker Committee had recommended such an appointment in order to provide co-ordination of medical services at central level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post was advertised in September 1986 by the Civil Service Commission on the basis that an appointment would be on contract for an initial two year period. The Civil Service Commission indicated that they were unable to recommend a candidate for appointment.  The post was readvertised in January 1987 as a permanent appointment.  The Civil Service Commission were unable to recommend a candidate for this competition either. In view of the poor response to the two competitions, it is considered that there is no point in readvertising the post at this stage.  However, I will be keeping the <Col N="1223" /> matter under review.</P>
    <P>In discussions with officials of my Department, the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service has indicated that because of a reduction in his workload due to the decrease in recruitment and the lack of promotions in the Civil Service generally he is now in a position to take a more active role in providing medical advice to the prison service.  While it has always been part of his duties to act as medical adviser to the prison service his overall workload had been such that he could be of only very limited assistance in this area up to now.</P>
    <P>Medical officers and Governors were informed last month of the new arrangement and that the chief medical officer would be providing advice to the Department on medical and health matters as they affect the prison service and would be liaising between the medical officers and the Department.  I am pleased that the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer can now take a more active role in relation to the prison service.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult problems with which the prison service has had to contend in recent times has been the identification of a number of offenders as having come into contact with the AIDS virus &mdash; that is, that they have been found to be HIV positive.  I think it important to point out that the emergence of offenders with AIDS antibodies was simply a reflection of what had been happening in the outside community and, give the high number of drug abusers who are committed to prison by the courts, it was inevitable that AIDS-related problems were going to arise in the prisons at some stage.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, have been helpful if a director of medical services for the prisons had been in place to assist in devising strategies to cope with AIDS-related problems in the prisons. However, in the absence of such an appointment arrangements were made to ensure that the necessary expert medical advice was available, particularly in the initial stages of dealing with this problem. Specifically, detailed consultations took <Col N="1224" /> place with the deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health charged with dealing with the AIDS problem nationally.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a special doctor was appointed as medical officer to deal with the medical needs of HIV offenders and, obviously, where hospital tests or treatment is required, this is arranged.  The medical officer has indicated he is more than satisfied with the facilities which have been made available to him at the prison by way of surgery and equipment.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that offenders who find themselves in this unfortunate situation need a lot more than just basic physical care and, accordingly, a wide array of support services are made available to them.  These include psychological, psychiatric, welfare and chaplaincy as well as assistance from community-based groups such as Coolemine and Anna Liffey.  A multi-disciplinary approach is taken to improve the co-ordination of services to these offenders.</P>
    <P>From the outset, representatives of the various disciplines were brought together to devise effective strategies for dealing with AIDS-related problems and in October of last year over 200 people with a special interest in these problems attended a two-day seminar organised by my Department on &ldquo;AIDS &mdash; Implications for the Irish Prison Service&rdquo; which was addressed by medical experts from abroad, among others.  Since then attendance at various seminars and conferences which could prove helpful to the various disciplines in contending with these problems has been sanctioned regularly.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be clear to the House that, notwithstanding the difficulty which arose in relation to the post of medical director, all that can reasonably be done to deal with AIDS-related problems in the prisons is being done.  In this connection I am happy to say that there is fairly widespread acceptance among those familiar with the AIDS problem generally in this country that the level of services available to offenders at the very least match those available in the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> On the question of suicides which have taken place in the prisons the House will appreciate that the circumstances in which a person decides to take his or her life are varied and complex and, consequently, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot accept that the absence of a Medical Director would have been a factor in any of the unfortunate deaths which have taken place over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Allegations of overcharging for goods and services are dealt with primarily within the context of promoting greater competition throughout <Col N="1053" /> the economy.  For example, allegations regarding price differences between here and Northern Ireland were the subject of an urgent report by the Restrictive Practices Commission which I expect to publish shortly.  The terms and conditions of purchase and importing of specific products is the subject of a separate detailed investigation by the examiner of restrictive practices which is in progress at present.  I will be dealing with both of these aspects in more detail in reply to other questions on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I believe that greater competition and the operation of the market offer the most satisfactory means of ensuring fair price levels throughout the economy.  The Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before the House, is intended to improve the implementation of competition policy by strengthening the agencies involved and extending the scope of their activities.  A number of measures to this effect are already in hands, even in advance of enactment of the Bill.  The Deputy may be aware, for example, that a Restrictive Practices Commission report on the accountancy profession was published in the past week.  The commission is continuing with studies into other professions, covering issues such as the fixing of fees and other practices of professional bodies.</P>
      <P>In addition to the use of competition agencies, I do not rule out the use of price control where I believe that to be necessary to bring about more reasonable prices for consumers.  For example, I made a maximum prices order in respect of petrol and autodiesel in July last because I considered that the price levels then obtaining were not warranted.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill to which I have referred will bring together enforcement functions under various restrictive practices, consumer and prices Acts in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 27 staff are employed in my Department and the related agencies to which I have referred on competition and related duties.  This includes an inspectorate <Col N="1054" /> of seven staff assigned to the Director of Consumer Affairs who carry out inspection duties where necessary in relation to the prices of goods and services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in this country has been a source of concern to, and the subject of detailed consideration by, my Department and various committees of inquiry over the last decade or so.  Essentially the high cost of motor insurance is directly <Col N="1055" /> attributable to the numbers and levels of claims occuring here.  Strict price comparisons with other countries are not valid because of the varying market conditions.</P>
      <P>The incidence of claims has resulted in enormous underwriting losses for insurers here.  Stabilisation and reduction of premiums will only come about when the cost and numbers of claims are reduced.  Determined action is being taken by the Government to bring about these reductions.</P>
      <P>The Courts Bill, 1986, provides for the abolition of juries in personal injury cases.  The abolition of juries is expected to reduce insurance costs and thus insurance premiums.  The insurance industry have recently reiterated an earlier commitment to this effect, and they have specifically agreed to give a better deal to young drivers once the Courts Bill becomes law.  The Government expect that improvements will also be given by the insurance companies in employers liability as a result of the Courts Bill.</P>
      <P>The reduction of high insurance costs is an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premia will follow the introduction of an improved framework and I will ensure that they live up to their promises.  To this end the Department has the necessary premium statistics to monitor the position and to ensure that real savings are passed on to consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in my reply of 2 May I outlined the <Col N="1056" /> steps which I had taken to implement the objectives set out in the <i>Programme for</i><i>National Recovery</i> to restore Ireland as a location for foreign investment.  In that reply I stressed the importance technology and marketing would have on the development and promotion of a strong industrial base in the country.  Since that date, the many proposals contained in the programme have been actively pursued in my Department as I will now outline to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As far as the areas of export development and marketing are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Office of Trade and Marketing in my Department is currently preparing a national marketing plan which will identify a range of measures by which Irish firms can be supported in securing increased shares of the home and export market.</P>
      <P>In the case of export services, a special export services task force under the chairmanship of the Minister for Trade and Marketing will shortly be established to co-ordinate the national effort in this area and to give a major impetus to the development of opportunities in overseas consultancy.</P>
      <P>An area of particular importance is the need to increase the marketing capability and exporting activities of indigenous Irish industry, particularly smaller firms. The national marketing plan will contain a range of proposals to address these issues.  However, even in advance of the plan, a number of mechanisms have been put in place to assist in this area.  It is hoped that the recently enacted legislation on special trading houses will help smaller companies to get their goods on foreign markets without increasing the burden of acquiring marketing expertise. CTT itself is also successfully promoting its group marketing schemes in a range of sectors.  There are 17 schemes involving 54 companies in place at present.  In fact, I had the pleasure in June last of officially launching one such project in the Boston area.  Under this scheme groups of companies can get together to share what would otherwise be an impossible burden if left to one company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, the <Col N="1057" /> national marketing plan will also address the question of product identification to see what further new opportunities might be pursued in addition to those identified under the national linkage programme and through CTT's design and production development department.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to questions on 14 October last, the Government are anxious to further increase the return from State expenditure on all overseas promotional and representational activities. Consideration of proposals to strengthen the trade role of our diplomatic missions abroad is at an advanced stage.  I am also looking at the idea of housing Irish representatives in key markets in one central location in each market with a view to co-ordinating marketing efforts, ensuring efficient use of resources, eliminating duplication and overlap and generally enhancing the profile and perception of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of industrial development and improving employment prospects this is being developed primarily on a sectoral basis.  Selected sectoral strategies have been prepared or are at a relatively advanced stage in electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, textiles and clothing, plastics and mechanical engineering.  The strategies have drawn largely on the work of the Sectoral Development Committee in relation to how the efficiency and competitiveness of sectors could be best improved.  They address such matters as market research at home and abroad to identify development and employment potential; our natural resources; the new advanced skills in our workforce; the achievement of increased market share in selected sectors and markets.</P>
    <P>The sectoral strategy approach is one of a number of measures which should contribute towards achieving the objective of creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per annum in manufacturing industry over the next ten years.  The <i>Programme for National</i><i>Recovery</i> stated that the potential for joint ventures between the public and private sectors would be encouraged.  In this area, NET has recently entered into a <Col N="1058" /> joint ventures with the Imperial Chemical Industries subsidiary, Richardson Fertilisers Limited.  Irish Steel has been seeking a joint venture partner for some time, without success.  These efforts are continuing.</P>
    <P>In line with measures set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government has decided that the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards (IIRS) and those of the National Board for Science and Technology (NBST) will be combined in one organisation.  The establishment of the new body is subject to the enactment of legislation to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas during the present session.</P>
    <P>The Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and I expect to be in a position to present it to Dáil Éireann and circulate it to Deputies very shortly.  In line with the commitment to review the basic briefs of State bodies, the functions of SFADCo are being expanded.  In this regard the Deputy will recall that in July 1987 the Government decided that SFADCo should be given a more integrated and creative role in contributing towards national recovery in the mid-west region.  To this end the functions at present being exercised by the IDA and Bord Fáilte in the mid-west and southwest Offaly region will be carried out by SFADCo.  The necessary arrangements to give effect to this change of responsibilities are being put in hand.</P>
    <P>The Government has assigned particular significance to the development of financial services.  As the Deputy is aware work has proceeded apace on the development of an international financial services centre at the Customs House Dock site in Dublin.  The contract for the development of the site was recently awarded to a consortium comprising Hardwicks, British Lands plc and McInerneys.</P>
    <P>At the moment IDA have serious inquiries from approximately 46 companies &mdash; including companies from North America, Europe and the Far East &mdash; about setting up in the centre.  The IDA expect up to nine of these projects to be <Col N="1059" /> approved by year end.  In addition to this, five projects, with significant job potential have been approved, one of which is already in operation.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the development of new technology is essential to the developing needs of industry.  As proposed in the programme a Minister of State with specific responsibility for Science and Technology has been appointed.  A new science and technology development programme has already been initiated and, in this connection, an allocation of £3.1 million was made in my Department's Vote facilitating the launch of the following programmes: A National Biotechnology Programme; An Advanced Manufacturing Programme (AMT); Teaching Companies Programme; South-East Region Pilot Programme in Technology Development; Collaborative R &amp; D Programme; and replacement and upgrading of equipment in IIRS.</P>
    <P>A major priority of the Government is the need to reduce insurance and other costs to industry.  In this connection I can assure the Deputy that significant measures to tackle the problems of cost and availability of insurance for industry are already in train.  The report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Employers and Public Liability Insurance is to be considered by Government in the near future.  In June of this year I set up joint Government-insurance industry talks to concentrate on measures which will favourably influence the cost and availability of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The reduction of high insurance costs is an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Government will move quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs, by proceeding with legislation to abolish juries in personal injury cases, by introducing legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work and by promoting greater involvement by insurance companies in the areas of road and workplace <Col N="1060" /> safety.  The scope for promoting the publication of a Book of Quantum of Damages, for introducing a pre-trial procedure system and for reducing the level of legal representation in the superior courts to help reduce legal costs will also be examined.  Insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premia will follow the introduction of an improved framework and I will ensure that they live up to their promises.</P>
    <P>I would hope for rapid progress on most, if not all, of these points so that we can start to tackle and get under control as soon as possible these component elements of insurance costs.</P>
    <P>I am also examining other proposals which can be taken to simplify or abolish complicated or obsolete rules and regulations which impact on industry.</P>
    <P>In a broader context, the Government in line with the commitment given in their pre-election programme engaged in consultation arrangements with the social partners in the preparation of the recently published <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of independently-owned petrol retail outlets there are in Dublin city and county; if he has satisfied himself that no cartel exists in the ownership of petrol distribution outlets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The information available to me on the ownership of petrol retail outlets is based on the identity of the supplying company rather than geographical area.  Accordingly, I do not have a specific figure for such outlets in Dublin city and county.  However, I can inform the Deputy that at the end of 1986 the total number of independently-owned stations in the country was 2,924 compared with 451 company-owned stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the <Col N="1061" /> Deputy's question I am satisfied that no cartel exists in relation to the ownership of petrol distribution outlets.  In fact the legislation at present in force in this area prohibits any of the existing major oil companies who supply more than 20 company stations from increasing the total number of stations which they operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement showing the balance of trade figures as between Ireland and the other countries of the EC for each of the last three years for which figures are available, adjusted for inflation; and if he will make a statement on the trend indicated and the implications thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office have advised me that there is no conversion factor according to which the figures requested by the Deputy can be adjusted for inflation.  There are indices which relate to the whole of merchandise <Col N="1062" /> imports and exports but these are not appropriate for adjusting statistics for individual countries or geographical areas for inflation.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing actual figures for trade between Ireland and the other member countries of the EC for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 and for the period January/September, 1987.</P>
      <P>These figures are encouraging and show that Irish exports to the rest of the EC are increasing and the balance of trade with our European partners is steadily improving in our favour.  In the period 1984 to 1986 the value of our exports to the EC increased by 8.47 per cent or IR£527 million.  In the same period our imports decreased by 1.7 per cent or IR£98 million.</P>
      <P>Ireland's dependence on exports means that Irish companies must concentrate on the development of exports both to EC and non-EC markets.  With exports to the EC representing 72 per cent of total Irish exports in 1986, the importance of this market is clear.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the proposals if any, he has to improve the situation whereby approximately 80 per cent of small indigenous manufacturing firms do not export at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to my Department suggests that approximately 40 per cent of firms in the small indigenous manufacturing sector do in fact engage in some level of export activity.</P>
      <P>However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that even this level of export participation by our smaller native firms is totally unsatisfactory.  Since taking up office as Minister for Trade and Marketing, I have been particularly concerned to address this issue and indeed a number of very useful initiatives have already been taken.</P>
      <P>I recently issued new operating guidelines to CTT, among which was a requirement that CTT shift the focus of its attention to developing the exporting capacity of our indigenous industry, particularly smaller firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A particular weakness in small firms is their lack of expertise in the marketing area.  The recently enacted legislation on special trading houses is intended to address this very issue by enabling small companies to get their product on to world markets without having to acquire the costly marketing expertise which would otherwise be necessary for market penetration.  A further innovation aimed <Col N="1066" /> at overcoming marketing weakness of our smaller firms is the recently announced fostering scheme which is being operated by the Marketing Institute of Ireland.  Under this scheme, small Irish companies will be able to call upon the assistance and advice of experienced marketeers who have voluntarily offered their services and expertise in order to develop the exporting potential of more Irish companies.  All of these measures represent practical concrete action which has already been taken to address the undoubted problem to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is currently developing a national marketing plan and is undertaking a review of the small industries programme which will be concerned with all aspects of this sector of industry, including exporting.  The national marketing plan and small industries review will be completed in the near future and I hope that initiatives arising from both the review and the plan will do even more to improve the export performance of small indigenous manufacturing firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's consistent approach to the overall concept and the specific proposals involved in completing the community's internal market has been to consult with the sectors involved and to take all aspects into account in determining our position both from the point of view of increasing opportunities for our business people and for employment generally and to protect all our legitimate interests including employment.</P>
      <P>Irish exporters of goods and services may be expected to benefit by the removal of existing barriers to trade and the elimination of hidden protectionism which tend to be more entrenched on mainland Europe.  In addition, Irish participation in the process of completing the Community's internal market will enhance our long term attractiveness as a location for industrial investment for both indigenous and overseas investors.</P>
      <P>While we are anxious to eliminate obstacles to further export growth to the Community, I can assure the Deputy that in areas where we have difficulties, Ireland is already opposing to a greater or lesser degree the Commission's proposals or is seeking a derogation.</P>
      <P>The completion of the internal market is an end desirable in itself.  Great importance also attaches to the achievement of parallel, worthwhile economic and social cohesion.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a Dáil question on 4 November by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs wherein he was informed that &ldquo;since taking office, the Government have pursued a consistent policy of ensuring that the achievement of economic and social cohesion...is pursued in parallel with the completion of the Internal Market&rdquo;. I would also refer the Deputy to section 1 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which deals, <i>inter alia,</i> with our approach to economic and social cohesion.</P>

These codes lay down guidelines in respect of, among other things, advertising as it relates to children.</P>
      <P>I believe that the matter raised by the Deputy is one of those areas in advertising which are more appropriately dealt with by means of such codes of standards rather than my legislative controls and I do not therefore propose to introduce measures as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Insurance Act, 1953 provides that any amount required to meet a liability incurred by the Minister in respect of claims arising on foot of guarantees given in connection with exports, shall be advanced out of the Central Fund and shall be repaid to the fund out of money provided by the Oireachtas.  The subhead of my Department's Vote, to which the Deputy's question refers, is that under which the Central Fund is repaid moneys in respect <Col N="1069" /> of claims paid under the export credit scheme operated by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The main reason for the increase in the provision is as a result of the payment of two large claims totalling IR£6,224,000. The claims arose from defaults by two American companies on foot of contracts with an Irish company for the supply of capital goods. One of the American companies has ceased to operate while the other has filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is operating on a reduced scale. Detailed and delicate negotiations are taking place with the latter company in an effort to effect a recovery.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be preferable not to name the Irish or American companies involved while these negotiations in the US are proceeding.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the provision of IR£10.135 million in respect of claims paid under the export credit scheme relate to total insured exports of approximately IR£600 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 24 June, 1987, the Irish Government recognise the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  I also indicated the services provided by CTT to exporters wishing to trade with Taiwan and pointed out that our activity in this area is in line with the practice of the common commercial policy by the European Commission which also recognises only the Government of the People's Republic of China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While total trade between Taiwan and Ireland has increased from IR£14.2 million <Col N="1070" /> in 1980 to IR£57.4 million in 1986, the balance of trade, in Taiwan's favour, has increased from IR£4.8 million to IR£35.9 million in the same period.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years Taiwan has reduced tariffs on a large number of products. Nonetheless tariffs remain high on other items, many of which come from sectors where Ireland already has a strong export record i.e. agricultural and electronic goods.  Tariff barriers are only one factor affecting the level of Irish exports to Taiwan where a strict import regime, though liberalised somewhat, still exists. CTT and most Irish exporting companies regard Taiwan as a difficult market to penetrate.</P>
    <P>Logistical problems and the cost of breaking into and servicing such a market are considerable even for the most experienced Irish exporters.  Nonetheless, I recognise the growing potential of the Taiwan market for Irish exports.</P>
    <P>CTT constantly monitor the Taiwan market and provide market support services to Irish exporters wishing to trade with Taiwan.  CTT has made arrangements to be provided with essential market information on Taiwan and CTT can also arrange for the necessary support services during visits there by individual Irish exporters.  CTT will continue to devote an appropriate level of resources to this developing market and, in fact, two separate CTT organised trade missions visited Taiwan in the past three months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the operation of the Irish Goods Council; in particular, if he has satisfied himself that the council has adequate resources to promote a major import-substitution drive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for urgent progress on the import substitution front is well illustrated by the fact that Ireland's current imports of goods and services are <Col N="1071" /> equivalent to 53.4 per cent of GNP, compared to an EC average of 28.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government are determined to bring about a substantial reversal of this situation and the Irish Goods Council will play a key role in this regard.  It is estimated that import substitution opportunities represent annual new business potential for Irish firms worth £1.2 billion. I am convinced that Irish firms have the potential to service the bulk of this demand and it is my intention that, with the advice and assistance of the Irish Goods Council, our native firms will achieve this goal.  Indeed, an indication of what can be achieved is the fact that in 1986 Irish firms secured new orders worth £8 million in the grocery sector alone, as a result of initiatives taken by the Irish Goods Council.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council already provides a wide range of marketing support and industrial sub-contract services together with sectoral trade promotions and in-store retail promotions.  It is my intention that the Irish Goods Council should increasingly focus its efforts towards nurturing the development of a basic marketing capability in smaller Irish firms which currently confine their activities to the home market.  It is only by developing this marketing ethos, that smaller Irish firms will be able to mount a sustained challenge to the present level of foreign competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also anxious that Irish firms should be made more fully aware of the range of opportunities for import substitution which are available.  In reply to a question on 14 October 1987, I informed the House that I would be seeking Government approval for a number of initiatives aimed at assisting Irish firms to maximise their share of the home market.  I am confident that this combined approach of building the marketing strengths of Irish firms, coupled with mechanisms for alerting such firms to the opportunities which are available, will produce valuable and sustained results.  I am satisfied that the Irish Goods Council have the capacity to play a major role in achieving this very <Col N="1072" /> desirable outcome from the resources which are being put at its disposal.</P>

As the details would be too cumbersome to provide orally I intend to supply the information requested by the Deputy in the form of a list which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Proposed Legislation.</P>
      <P>1.  Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 &mdash; This Bill which aims to strengthen the Companies Act, 1963 and to introduce measures to curb abuses and malpractices in the management of companies is at Committee Stage in An Seanad.</P>
      <P>2.  Insurance Bill, 1987 &mdash; This Bill was introduced in Seanad Éireann on 8 October 1987, completed its Second Stage on 15 October and is awaiting Committee Stage.  The purpose of this Bill is to increase ministerial supervisory powers in relation to insurance companies, to facilitate the regulation of commission payments to insurance intermediaries and to introduce a system for the regulation of insurance brokers and agents.</P>
      <P>3.  Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987 &mdash; At Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The Bill aims to set up a new Fair Trade Commission to replace the Restrictive Practices Commission and to give wider powers for dealing with unfair trading practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1987 &mdash; The Bill confirms the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) <Col N="1073" /> Order, 1987 and is at Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>5.  Friendly Societies Regulations, 1987 &mdash; The draft Regulations are on the Dáil Order Paper.  They are intended to raise financial limits for loans and deposits and to require Friendly Societies to adopt stricter supervisory procedures.</P>
    <P>6.  Consumer Credit (Consumer Information) Order, 1987 &mdash; The draft Order, which will require that any advertisement or notice that makes reference to the cost of credit must show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge (APR), is on the Dáil Order Paper and hopefully will be approved in the current session.  The Seanad approved the draft Order last June.</P>
    <P>7.  IIRS/NBST Merger Bill, 1987 &mdash; The Government has decided that the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards (IIRS) and those of the National Board for Science and Technology (NBST) are to be combined in one organisation.  The establishment of the new body is subject to the enactment of legislation; to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas during the present session.</P>
    <P>8.  The Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1987 &mdash; This Bill aims to increase the penalties for breaches of copyright, specifically video piracy.  It also proposes to remove copyright protection from the drawings of functional objects.  The Seanad has referred this back to the Dáil for consideration of its amendments.</P>
    <P>9.  Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill (1987) &mdash; This Bill has passed all stages in the Dáil and has now been referred to the Seanad.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase NET's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee from £150 million to £180 million.</P>
    <P>While it is my hope to have items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 passed in the current session the Deputy will appreciate that all the above items are urgent and it is my intention to endeavour to have these dealt with as quickly as Parliamentary business will allow.</P>

      <P>The Retail Prices (Petrol) Display Order 1986 came into operation on 1 March 1987.  As petrol retailers would clearly need time to make arrangements to comply with its provisions, the order was not too vigorously enforced at the early stages.

Further action to rectify this situation is under consideration.</P>

    <P>I would, however, point out that, because of the apparent lack of price competition for petrol, the action I took in July last to reduce petrol prices was of more immediate benefit to motorists than the display order itself, which was made <Col N="1077" /> at a time when price control on petrol did not exist.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the National Micro-electronics Research Centre are primarily directed to the provision, for industry and for other third-level institutions, of a specialised research and development facility at the leading edge of micro-electronics technology. The centre also participates in the teaching of under-graduate students of University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>Thus, State funding for the centre comes from two sources, namely my Department and the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The contribution of the centre to the development of downstream industries arises in the following ways:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) through new product and process development resulting from its research activities; an example of this is the recent development of a new industrial material resulting from cooperative research between NMRC and a Dublin based manufacturing company.  The production of this <Col N="1078" /> material in Ireland would lead to new markets and new jobs;</P>
    <P>(2) its services are recognised both by electronics companies already established in Ireland and by potential new investors to be a necessary and very significant element of the infrastructure to support the establishment and continuing development of advanced electronics manufacturing projects; the availability of the services provided by the centre is important to the State promotional agencies for their marketing purposes;</P>
    <P>(3) along with other third-level institutions, the centre provides a pool of highly qualified graduates for management positions in existing or newly established electronics companies; these graduates are keenly sought by and widely placed in such companies in Ireland; an example of this has been the establishment of a software firm set up recently by two ex-NMRC staff. This company now employs about 30 people and expects to double its size in the coming years.</P>

The elimination of the grant-in-aid on a phased basis is designed to afford KDW some time to implement the measures necessary to achieve full commerciality. Extra share capital amounting to £225,000 was provided to the company towards this objective over the past 12 months and measures to expand commercial revenues have also been implemented by KDW.  Plans to reduce operating and administrative costs are now also in the course of being implemented by the company.

      <P>Industrial promotion and development is facilitated by Government expenditure and incentives in respect of many of which I do not have a direct responsibility.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to provide the information as sought by him, as the borrowing/liability situation of any organisation changes from day to day.  In addition the balance sheet of all bodies includes notes clarifying the borrowing liability situation, and without listing all such qualifications a totally distorted picture would be given.  In these circumstances I would respectfully refer the Deputy to the annual accounts published by the various State bodies where detailed information is available.</P>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the Deputy's question, he will be aware that in relation to NET the company has been totally restructured as it has now entered into a joint venture arrangement with Richardsons Fertilizers Ltd., a subsidiary of ICI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will note from NET's 1986 annual accounts that the company had a <Col N="1084" /> total borrowing commitment in excess of £170 million.  In order that NET will be in a position to service these borrowings and meet other financial commitments during the transitional period of the joint venture it was necessary for me to introduce legislation providing for an increase on the ministerial borrowing guarantee limit from £150 million to £180 million. This matter was fully debated in the House on 11 November, 1987 in the context of the passage of the final stages of the Bill through the Dáil.  Of course the question of restructuring the borrowing situation of all bodies is in the first instance a matter for their respective boards.  However, both my Department and myself are closely monitoring the borrowing situation of these bodies with a view to ensuring that the level of borrowing is kept at a minimum.</P>

Children of employers, working in the family firm, are not entitled to the benefit of the PAYE allowance because many such employees are not on an entirely equal footing as regards obtaining the employment, security of tenure, career prospects etc. with employees who are totally unconnected with their employer.  A further point is that when the allowance was introduced this exclusion was considered necessary to prevent a recurrence of a tax avoidance device which was widespread under an earlier provision in the income tax code, i.e. the creation of spurious employments for members of the family for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the extra allowance.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change this position.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned is liable to pay the amount in question, which was demanded from her by the Collector-General in September 1987. The amount demanded is in respect of the person's own liability for health contributions. It includes an estimated amount for the year 1986-87, which may be altered when information requested from the person by the Inspector of Taxes is supplied, but which is nevertheless payable pending such possible alteration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health contributions are charged on husband and wife separately.  A separate <Col N="1087" /> demand in respect of the person's late husband's liability was issued in March 1987 but the amount of this needs to be revised.  The Inspector of Taxes has requested information to enable him to make the revision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason an Office of Public Works pension is not being paid to a person (details supplied) in County Offaly who was refused redundancy terms in 1970, became ill in 1973 and subsequently had to give up work in the Office of Public Works, despite the fact that a pension scheme became applicable in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that following a brief period of employment in 1954, the person concerned (details supplied) was employed from 14 May 1962 to 15 November 1968 on the Inny drainage scheme.  Then, as an alternative to being made redundant, he opted for employment on the Brosna drainage maintenance scheme.  He was employed on the Brosna scheme from 25 November 1968 until 13 July 1973 when, according to the commissioners' records, he left his employment of his own accord.</P>
      <P>Under the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees only persons who were actually employed on or after 1 October 1975 qualify for payment of a preserved pension and lump sum at age 65.  The person in question does not fall into this category and therefore, does not qualify for a preserved pension or lump sum.</P>

      <P>As regards Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 10 November 1987, the Deputy had originally asked each Minister separately for costings of the draft agreement on pay in the public service.  While some Ministers might have been in a position to provide an answer in relation to their Votes &mdash; as in the case of the Minister for Education &mdash; others would have had major difficulties in compiling an accurate reply.  For this reason it was decided that the question should be dealt with on a global basis.</P>
      <P>The 1987 draft agreement on pay in the public service involves two different percentages and a &ldquo;floor&rdquo;.  The complexity of the increase makes the calculation of the precise costs involved more difficult than usual; I am satisfied, however, that the figure of £70 million is reasonably accurate for the total cost for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  Difficulties also arise in relation to the effects on individual Votes of the proposed reduction in public service numbers and the redeployment of staff.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position early in the New Year to supply the Deputy with the information he has requested.</P>

      <P>Following consideration by the Government of the suggestion in report No. 13 of the Public Service Advisory Council that the council be &ldquo;rested&rdquo;, it was decided at the beginning of September 1987 not to replace the members of the council (including the chairman) whose periods of appointment were completed. As a result the vacancy arose on the Top Level Appointments Committee and the Government decided that it should be filled by a representative of the private sector chosen by the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Minister for Finance for such a period as the Taoiseach might determine.  No appointment has yet been made.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 13 May 1987 (Official Report: Vol. 372, Cols. 1792 and 1793), the Law Reform Commission have undertaken an examination of the law on sexual offences, including the law on child sexual abuse.  In so far as any recommendations the commission may make, for a change in the law on child sexual abuse come within the ambit of my Department, they will be considered by me following the publication of the commission's report.  In that connection I will take into consideration the question of the arrangements for evidence being given by children.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not required to do jury service from 8 December, having been excused at his own request.  I am not aware and it is not a fact that he was at any stage informed that it was not possible for him to serve as he is confined to a wheelchair.  In the course of several telephone conversations on the matter the Jury Office made a point of assuring him that he had a constitutional right to serve on a jury but, quite properly, <Col N="1093" /> indicated a number of practical difficulties in the way of his doing so.  The main courtrooms, jury boxes, jury rooms and associated toilet facilities in the Four Courts are approached by steps making access difficult for a person confined to a wheelchair.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Office of Public Works to see if there are any practical steps which can be taken to remedy the position but I must point out that because of the design and layout of the Four Courts this is likely to present serious difficulties.</P>

      <P>An Post has been achieving improving financial results and last year the company made their first profit.

Within Ireland, the levy grant system operated by AnCO was designed to encourage employers to provide appropriate staff training.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports indicating shortages in various skill areas, including computer staff, in Britain.  The principal implication of shortages in Britain would be the enhancement of the career prospects of our young people with the necessary skills.  Some Irish specialists could be expected to emigrate, leaving openings here for newly qualified or trained young people.  In addition it would seem likely that salary prospects would improve for computing staff generally.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that the significant State investment in training is used for the benefit of both the individual and the country.</P>
      <P>AnCO are monitoring the situation and are currently studying manpower and skill areas for Irish people in the area, with particular reference to the financial services sector to be set up in the near future.  The training offered by the new manpower agency, FÁS, will therefore be geared to the country's needs.</P>

      <P>Retail pharmacies are reimbursed by the GMS (Payments) Board in respect of their supplying free of charge drugs and medicines reimbursible under the GMS scheme and prescribed for an eligible patient by his GMS doctor, on a properly completed GMS prescription form. These GMS prescription forms are only provided to general practitioners participating in the GMS Scheme.</P>
      <P>In cases where a consultant writes a prescription for a medical card holder, for dispensing at a retail pharmacy, the consultant's prescription is transcribed to a GMS prescription form by the patient's general practitioner.

The continuing care of the patient remains primarily the responsibility of the general practitioner, who has the benefit of specialist consultant advice.</P>
