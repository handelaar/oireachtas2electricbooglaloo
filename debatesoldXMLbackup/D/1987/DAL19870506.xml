    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on Government policy regarding the operation of the Law Reform Commission; if he will indicate the areas of law reform he has submitted to the commission for examination and when such reports are likely to be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are concerned to ensure that law reform is pursued in a sustained and systematic manner.  The Law Reform Commission have a valuable role in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (2) (c) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the previous Attorney General referred the following matters to the commission:</P>
      <P>(1) the reform of conveyancing law and practice in areas where this could lead to savings for house purchasers; (2) sexual offences generally, including in particular the law relating to rape and the sexual abuse of children;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) the law relating to sheriffs, the collection of taxes and debt collection; (4) the law relating to compensation in personal injury cases, including, in particular, provision for periodic payments and the making of provisional awards and the Statute of Limitations in cases of latent personal injuries; and (5) the following aspects of criminal law: (a) sentencing policy, (b) indexation of fines, (c) confiscating the proceeds of crime and (d) whether there is a need to revise or update the law <Col N="1071" /> relating to the various offences which are still mainly governed by pre-1922 legislation, including in particular the law relating to dishonesty, malicious damage and offences against the person.</P>
    <P>Because of the extent and complexity of the work concerned it is not possible at this stage for the commission to indicate when that work will be completed.</P>
    <P>I propose to send the Deputy, for his information, a copy of the text of a speech made by the new President of the Law Reform Commission at a press reception on 23 April 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Have this Government yet given any requisitions to the Law Reform Commission as to the area of law they consider needs attention?  In particular, would the Taoiseach consider submitting to the commission a request for the codification of the incredible mish-mash that exists in social welfare law?  Would he also consider submitting for examination any aspects of family law or insurance law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would read the president's speech and then communicate with me about those matters.  The list the Law Reform Commission have on hands is comprehensive and complex.  Whereas I am sure I could agree with the Deputy that the other matters need attention, it might be a bit much to add to the list which the Law Reform Commission already have on hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the value of it all?  They have presented many reports already.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when any of those reports will be implemented?  We see no sign of any implementation of the multifarious law reforms which have been advocated by the Law Reform Commission in these reports.  Is it a matter of further reports being added to the list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope not, <Col N="1072" /> though it was pointed out during the course of the press reception to which I referred that the situation the Deputy complains of does exist.  The Oireachtas has not been as assiduous as it should have been in dealing with the reports of the Law Reform Commission over recent years.  I would like to be able to promise the Deputy that this situation will improve considerably in the period immediately ahead, but there are other pressures.  I would like to think that this Government will get on with the programme of law reform as expeditiously as possible.  I feel that we might avail more of the Seanad in that regard.  Major pieces of law reform might commence in the Seanad and be dealt with comprehensively and in detail, so that by the time the legislation would reach this House we would not have all that much work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position.  Is it the case that the House could not expect to see any new amending legislation in the five areas referred to which are currently under consideration by the Law Reform Commission? If that is the position, could the Taoiseach indicate if he has received any indication from the chairman as to when they might be reporting on any of these five areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The president indicated in the speech to which I have referred that he will be looking at the programme to assess what priorities he might award.  At this stage I cannot give the Deputy any specific undertaking in regard to any of these five areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that we should not expect any legislation from the Government in these areas until they have heard from the Law Reform Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would not be the position.  The Law Reform Commission are really only in aid of the Government in this respect.  There is nothing to prevent any Government from <Col N="1073" /> going ahead with law reform legislation of their own.  The problem has been that reports of the Law Reform Commission have not got the attention from the Oireachtas in recent years that a zealous, reforming Oireachtas would have given.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Primary and Secondary Education Democracy.</Title>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education her plans to bring about a more democratic primary and secondary education as a stimulus to general community self government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that our education system has become more democratic in recent years.  During this time we have seen the formation of boards of management in more and more schools at first and second level and an increasing involvement of parents in the system.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue to encourage and to foster such developments.  As Minister for Education I have endeavoured already to meet as many as possible of the groups and interests involved in education. It is my hope and intention to approach the problems affecting education on a co-operative basis by maintaining clear and open lines of communication between myself and all the parties interested in our education system.</P>
      <P>It is important that a democratic society should do everything possible to develop its human resources as fully as possible.  We as a nation should identify, foster and nurture the potential talents, aptitudes and abilities of our young people.  We must develop the talents and creative potential of all our young people and ensure that the best possible use is made of our educational resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition schools will be encouraged to establish stronger links with the communities they serve and to work jointly with them in providing better educational opportunities, both in school and out of school, for young people to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for them <Col N="1074" /> to become active and well-informed participants in a democratic society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I question the Minister on that reply I take this, my first opportunity to do so, to welcome her to the House as Minister for Education and to wish her warmly every success in that very important portfolio.  Arising from her answer, would she agree that some new structures are necessary to bring the different kinds of second level schools and primary schools too, in any one area into co-operation rather than, as exists at the moment, second level competition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hussey for her very warm words.  I appreciate fully what she has said.  Let me in turn congratulate her on her appointment as Opposition spokesperson for Education.  The world is a funny place.</P>
      <P>In reply to the question the Deputy put to me on the matter of co-ordinating structures for education in order as she said, to bring about a more democratic way, I notice that she included primary schools in her question.  In the Department of Education Green Paper which she issued for discussion, primary schools were not implicity included.  I was of the opinion at that time, and nothing has changed my mind, that the democratic base as envisaged in the Green Paper was less than democratic in that the number of boards was reduced from 38 to 13 and I did not think that that in itself served the cause of democracy very well.  The present system of post primary education has served the country well.  We have an excellent system which, as I indicated in my first answer, has become much more democratic in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are the various boards.  We have the boards of management for community schools, comprehensive schools and Catholic secondary schools.  The Deputy knows about the national schools.  I and my Department are satisfied that in general the moves towards democratisation have been very positive in recent years.  Further, I am of the opinion that parental involvement in <Col N="1075" /> VEC boards of management is important and I have asked my Department to look into ways by which that might be brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the question of competition and the confusion which exists between second level schools in particular with five different kinds of second level schools all run under different kinds of management, often competing with each other to the detriment of some of the schools in the area and to the detriment of the parents. Therefore, I ask the Minister if she would agree that new structures are needed and that the structures outlined in the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i> had the virtue of bringing those groups together. She may disagree with the size of the units in the structure, but will she clarify for us whether she is throwing out all of those ideas in the Green Paper about co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not agree that there is confusion within the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found a very strong sense of commitment within all sectors of the Department since I took office.  With regard to the question as to whether the competing interests which serve second level do not serve the cause of education, I know that within my Department the greater move towards co-ordination within the planning of resources at second level has had great effect in the forward projections and planning for the provision of second level schools, and I am satisfied that this matter is being pursued vigorously.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third point the Deputy raised, as to whether I intend to throw out all of the proposals of the Green Paper, I intend to study very carefully all of those proposals and to come up in the end with my own proposals of whatever shade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her appointment in the Department of Education.  I wish her a very successful term of office and hope that education will thrive under her good stewardship.</P>
      <P>Let me ask one simple question in relation to the question on the Order Paper.  What fresh proposals has the new Minister to encourage parents actively to become more involved in every aspect of their children's education?  It would seem to me that to date very often when we are planning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question please, Deputy Quill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;parents are the very last people to be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for her courteous words of welcome to me and I congratulate her also on her appointment as spokesperson on Education for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>The question she put to me was about parental involvement and I addressed myself to that briefly when I answered Deputy Hussey.  At the primary school level I am satisfied that parental involvement in the boards of management is working satisfactorily.  The various moves towards democratisation in the area of community, comprehensive, Catholic, secondary and now &mdash; my own idea &mdash; boards of VECs will lead to a greater degree of parental involvement. I agree with the Deputy that parents for one reason or another are sometimes quite aggrieved that they seem to be one of the last groups to be asked for opinions but I am satisfied that generally that is a perception rather than the reality.  I hope during my tenure of office that parents will continue along the road on which they have started out because nobody knows a child as well as his or her parents do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister and wishing her well.  With regard to the Minister's point of view that democratisation of the <Col N="1077" /> educational system is desirable, can she explain why, when the very savage educational cuts which have been implemented were being put into force, the VECs, the most democratic of the educational systems we have at the moment, were most severely hit, to such a degree that some schools will not be able to buy chalk?  Within that cut the adult literacy &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; scheme has been abandoned.  How does this compare with the Minister's wish to have more democratic schooling systems?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dwelt at length on this question.  I want to make progress on other questions also.  I will allow the Deputy a very brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My questions are always very brief.  Will the Minister explain to the House how she can say that the Government of the schools is in any way democratic when the parents' representation thereon is confined to one or two parents on school boards of maybe 12, 14 or 16 people?  How can one say that is democracy?  Does the Minister have it in mind to increase the parents' representation on these school boards to a substantial extent that will give some meaning to the suggestion that democracy exists in the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for his good wishes but I regret the question he put was of another nature.  I hope we will have an opportunity to talk about it again.  With regard to what Deputy Taylor asked, the present democracy on school boards has existed for the past <Col N="1078" /> four years.  I have clearly expressed my wish to see parents play a meaningful role in education.  I will bear Deputy Taylor's suggestions in mind &mdash; although I am not saying I will implement them &mdash; when reviewing the operations of these boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The tender documentation for the extensions proposed for Lyreacrompane and Curranes national schools, County Kerry, has been completed.  The question of authorising the invitation of tenders will be considered in due course in the light of the availability of capital for the projects.  Because of the extent to which my Department's 1987 allocation of capital for the national school building programme had already been committed prior to my assuming office, I am not in a position at this stage to say when tenders may be invited in these cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed Nano Nagle school for the handicapped at Lixnaw, County Kerry, discussions have been taking place between officers of my Department and the authorities concerned. There is general agreement that the new school building should be located on a site to be provided at Listowel.  My Department are agreeable to this proposal and to grant-aid the new building. The physical planning of the building has not, however, as yet commenced.</P>

Would the Minister agree that it is not necessary to be a serving teacher to superintend examinations and that the system which operated under the old group certificate examinations, where vocational committees took on a great number of non-serving teachers and other non-employed people for superintending work, was a good system?  Does the Minister agree that one does not need to be a qualified teacher to superintend an examination and will she initiate a good scheme to take some people off the dole queues to do this work?</P>

      <P>I am very pleased with the standard which has been set by the superintendents and assistant examiners in the Department of Education.  They have served the country well.  I decry any attempt to question the validity of anybody involved in this process.  It has always been the practice in the Department to appoint some non-serving teachers as assistant examiners.  In 1985 a total of 32 qualified teachers who were either in part-time work or who were unemployed were appointed as superintendents. This figure was increased to 123 in 1986 and to 187 in 1987.  It is proposed to continue this practice each year in consultation with the teachers' unions.  The question of increasing the number of non-serving or part-time teachers who do this work will be continuously reviewed in consultation with the teachers' unions.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, would the Minister agree that it is not necessary to be a teacher to superintend examinations?  What is needed is a responsible person to do this job.  I am talking about widening the intake of people to do this work, many thousands of whom are needed every year in the summer, to include people who are not necessarily teachers.</P>

The system employed at present has served education very well.  The arrangements we have come to in consultation with the teachers' unions is satisfactory but it will be reviewed constantly, as are all matters pertaining to examinations.  The proportions we have achieved of serving and non-serving teachers has been brought about by a consensus and I intend to proceed on those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will introduce the teaching of a continental language at primary level, either generally, or as an experiment in some schools; and the research, if any, carried out on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not carried out any research on the matter.  At present continental languages do not form part of the approved curriculum for national schools.  The primary school curriculum is an integrated curriculum involving the development and use of two languages, Irish and English. I would be hesitant at this stage to take any formal measures to introduce a third language to primary schools without giving the Curriculum and Examinations Board an opportunity to examine in depth all the issues involved.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board was that a major review be undertaken of the whole of the primary school curriculum.  Having considered the matter carefully, it has been decided that there should be a rolling review of the curriculum having regard to the resources available to the Department and to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to learn the Minister does not intend to undertake <Col N="1083" /> any review in connection with the question of adding another language to the primary school curriculum.  In the context of the European society in which we live today, would the Minister not agree that our students leaving schools are not up to the required standard in not being able to speak European languages which probably is brought about because we do not begin to teach them European languages at a sufficiently young age? Would the Minister consider it essential that another language be added to the primary school curriculum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made an interesting point but I should prefer to await the rolling review of the primary school curriculum and see what emerges therefore.  Because of the nature of our primary school curriculum at present and the two language system operating within it, I cannot see how the curriculum could embrace another language.  If the rolling review incorporates a recommendation I will be prepared to consider the interesting point made by Deputy John Bruton and to which Deputy Cullen has now contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify her last remark.  I am sure she is not saying that the fact our young children learn Irish now and forever will prevent them learning a third language at primary level.  Is it Irish which is the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I might quote from Deputy Hussey's letter to Deputy Bruton of 29 July 1985 in which she said at that stage she would be hesitant to take any formal measures to introduce a third language in primary schools.  At the end of that letter the former Minister said that in so far as primary education is concerned her aim was to improve the quality of the teaching of languages &mdash; that is the two languages English and Irish referred to in the first part of her letter &mdash; so that pupils would be better prepared to take up new languages when they go to second <Col N="1084" /> level schools.  That was the reply the former Minister gave to Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see it as much a problem as apparently the former Minister saw it because in the opening paragraph of her letter to Deputy Bruton she ruled it out completely, saying it was because pupils were learning Irish and English.  As I told Deputy Cullen, in the light of the outcome of the rolling review and of the interesting suggestion he made, I shall be prepared to review the matter at that point.</P>

Funding for each VEC is made available on an annual basis by my Department.  Such funding is provided from available resources after assessment by my Department of each individual committee's financial requirements for operating authorised services. There is no basis, therefore, for any assertion by any individual that County Donegal Vocational Education Committee is owed money by my Department.

      <P>Deputy Cooney set up the working party and, in turn, accepted their recommendations.  It is up to a new Minister in a Department to accept, reject, modify or amend any decision taken by a previous Government which has not been enacted by legislation or has not received full consideration.  As the Deputy will be aware, his reception of the report of the working party and his comments on it came in the dying days of the former Coalition Government. Within two days of assuming office I met in the Department of Education with the Sisters and their legal advisers when we had a very full discussion on the matter. <Col N="1089" /> At that meeting I gave an undertaking to meet them again, which I intend to do within the next ten days or two weeks.

As I said, I have asked my Department officials to arrange within the next week to ten days the follow-on to the earlier discussion I had with the Sisters.  Perhaps within a very short period after that my views will be made known.</P>

If she did so brief herself, is she now saying to those who briefed her that she is going back on the commitment she gave when she said that when she got into Government she would reverse any decision not to have Carysfort College as a training college?

I welcomed her earlier reply that she regarded the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>, as less democratic than the existing system. May I ask the Minister who is the international consultancy group?  I did not hear her earlier words as there was a lot of shouting going on.  I would also like to know the purpose of the examination. The Minister will recall that the Green Paper contained various proposals in regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology which caused considerable turmoil within the institute and within the City of Dublin VEC and then left them in mid-air.  Will the Minister be in a position soon to give a firm decision in regard to the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>

    <P>The idea for this group was initiated by Deputy Hussey, who was then Minister, and was confirmed by the previous Minister, Deputy Cooney.  The views of this group are to be available in September 1987.  The international consultancy group are currently carrying out examinations. It would be pre-emptive of me to give any definite dates until I have the views of this group.  I will then have to deal quite urgently with the future of all the third level sector outside the university sector.  I agree that the DIT and all its component colleges were thrown into great confusion by the proposals contained in the Green Paper.  It is my intention that the confusion end as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the financial difficulties for some students in third level education and especially for students from lower income families.  To assist them in pursuing courses of third level education there are a number of schemes operated by my Department under which grants and scholarships are made available.  Despite enormous pressures on Exchequer resources, I am pleased to be in a position to inform the Deputy that the financial provisions of the higher education grants scheme and related student aid schemes will be improved in 1987 as follows: (i) the income eligibility limits for, and maintenance element of, grants and scholarships will be increased in line with inflation &mdash; 3 per cent &mdash; and (ii) the lecture fee element of grants will be increased for the academic year 1987-88 in line with the increases in fees &mdash; 6 per cent &mdash; for that academic year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's increase in grants, but has she any plans to explore other ways of financing third level students?  We all accept the restraints on the Exchequer but would she consider something like a structured loan scheme for third level students which would operate in conjunction with the grant scheme?  This has been successful in some countries and perhaps the Minister might acquaint herself with the reasons for its success and she might consider this as a possibility for the future.</P>

I was of the opinion then, and I have not changed it, that while the scheme of loans appeared attractive they would be difficult to maintain in the Irish scene.  This is a subject the Department and I will look at from time to time but <Col N="1095" /> as of now, I do not propose to introduce a scheme of student loans.</P>

      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I do not think it a waste of ministerial time for me to acquaint myself fully with all that has been done.  I regard that as a fruitful use of my time.  With regard to the second part of the question, I wish to pay tribute to the work of the interim curriculum board, to their chairman, executive and the members of the various course syllabus committees involved for all the work they have done.  Most of it has been done on a voluntary basis and they should be praised for what they have done.  The same applies to all the people over the past 10 or 12 years who have been involved in curriculum research and development.  It strikes me that people think the words &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; or &ldquo;change&rdquo; only came about in the past year or two.  I remember being involved <Col N="1101" /> with Deputy Hussey on a radio programme and her saying that the work of curriculum reform had gone on for a long period without people paying much attention to it and that she wished to pay tribute to the workers involved.  I also wish to pay tribute to these people and that is why I am acquainting myself fully with all the work done by curriculum development units attached in particular to the city of Dublin VEC and to the work of SPIRAL in Shannon and Galway.  When I have compiled a review of the work I will come to my own conclusions.</P>

      <P>With reference to the second part of my question, the board have already been charged to fully consult the groups which I mentioned in the question, parents, teachers, managers and a wide range of educational experts and interests who have been given official designated status and who are constantly consulted by the board.  I get the impression the Minister intends to consult all these bodies on curriculum reform although a board is already charged by the Department of Education to do so. Will the Minister again embark on a range of consultations with all these groups which the board have been consulting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct Deputy Hussey.  She charged the interim board with this review and I intend to charge them with my view when I have informed myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to assume from that answer that the Minister will not reinvent the wheel and that she intends to bring in the curriculum assessment board Bill which was printed and published and is ready to introduce in the House?  Is it the Minister's intention to introduce this Bill at an early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, the Deputy cannot assume anything.  I note the Deputy mentioned that the previous Government were all set to bring in this Bill.  It is interesting to note that Deputy <Col N="1102" /> Hussey set up the interim board in January 1984 &mdash; I praise her initiative in so doing &mdash; and it was to become statutory in January 1986.  That did not happen and the board continued as an interim one. The year went on and despite many replies to questions by various Deputies the legislation did not make its formal written appearance until November 1986 when the Bill was published.  At that time, on television, at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis and in the Dáil on three occasions the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, said that legislation would be introduced before the Christmas recess.  That did not happen and the former Government went out of office without introducing the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be extraordinarily reliant on records but in a very selective way.  Does she forget that she consistently pressed me and my successor regarding the establishment of this board?  She welcomed the publication of the Bill and seemed to be in a great hurry to have it introduced in the House. That urgency now seems to have been dissipated as the Minister has informed us she intends to conduct a personal review of the curriculum.  In view of the general interest in the educational world of undertaking a root and branch curriculum reform and renewal across the educational system, something which can be done with the goodwill of all the bodies, the experts involved on the board and the magnificent work which they have done, will the Minister forget the vanity of an incoming Government and have the humility to use the present Bill which was prepared by experts in her Department and which is ready to be brought before the House so that we can make this great step forward quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if humility is one of my virtues.  The records to which Deputy Hussey referred are very interesting and my perusal of files in the Department has convinced me that the less I commit to paper the better. However, they are very illuminating.  The Deputy said I should proceed with all <Col N="1103" /> possible speed but I should like to point out that she proceeded with the least possible haste.</P>

I am not sure whether Deputy Dukes would agree with me but I am not certain whether we should proceed with all the committees we had in the previous Dáil.  There was a feeling that there were too many committees and it was difficult for Deputies to find time to attend them all as they would wish.  However, that is something we might discuss, but I would be anxious that the Whips would now meet to discuss the matter and get on with the establishment of the committees.</P>

I fully support you in that and recognise that you may in your wisdom decide that the matters Deputies raised with you may not be in order and we should accept your ruling on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to issues which Deputies wish to raise in the House you should at least give us the opportunity on the Order of Business to ventilate the matters for your decision as to whether or not they are in order and for your decision subsequently as to whether or not to allow time for them in the House.  I ask you, Sir, with regard to the matter which Deputy Birmingham and another colleague wish to raise that you would at least hear them and then decide whether or not the matters are in order and, if they are, what course of action to take.</P>

      <P>You are about to make my point.  It is a matter of some concern to me, and I am sure the Taoiseach and other Members of the House, that we spend time on the Order of Business arguing about whether or not matters should be raised.

      <P>I will raise what I proposed to raise today on the Order of Business tomorrow morning.  I want to say briefly, by way of a point of order, that when you read the Order of Business I and a number of other Deputies stood up.  You called on the Leader of my party who made a point you found valid.  You then called on Deputy Sherlock who raised a point you did not find acceptable. At that stage you indicated that you were not going to allow any other Deputy to put a question on the Order of Business. <Col N="1153" /> It is my submission that what I wanted to raise was palpably within the traditions of what is proper on the Order of Business. It was a matter which I suspect would have been welcomed by the Taoiseach because it would give the Government an opportunity to state in a more leisurely and considered way their attitude to ESB strike.  I will not go into the merits of that now.  I will raise it on the Order of Business tomorrow morning.  I protest that it is quite unacceptable that you should decide arbitrarily at some stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a start in our effort to protect national monuments, archaeological objects or sunken treasure around our coasts but what is needed is a more embracing piece of legislation that will encompass the many different aspects of our national heritage.  Such legislation should not be confined to our national monuments.  However, I welcome the legislation in the spirit in which it has been presented by the Minister. I suggest that it is worth considering a broader view such as the establishment of trusts to allocate resources to protect historical buildings and monuments.  That would go a long way to help protect some of the finest of our historical buildings, particularly those in the capital city, from falling into decay.  One could cite many examples of historical buildings such as the George Bernard Shaw house in Synge Street, the Gogarty home and the Sean O'Casey home.  Many of those buildings are falling into rack and ruin primarily because they are outside the ambit of preserved buildings.  The Minister should consider widening the scope of the Bill to embrace those buildings which are a part of our national heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Legislation like this should regularise the activities of our city and provincial museums and safeguard treasures in our national and provincial galleries and in our libraries.  The Minister should give some attention to our historic buildings. Such a move would be well received by those who are endeavouring to preserve those buildings on a voluntary basis.  I advocated the establishment of a community watch over national monuments. I consider this an important way to safeguard national monuments in isolated areas.  Those living close to those monuments should be encouraged to watch over them.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that some counties have compiled inventories of treasures in their locality.  That is vitally important particularly if we are to prevent people taking away some of our treasures such as grave tablets or hacking artefacts from monastery walls.  We must prevent that type of pillage and for that reason it is important that local communities get involved in protecting our monuments in co-operation with the gardaí and, if necessary, the Army.  The Garda should have an inventory of artefacts and monuments.  They should have photographs of all objects of national importance because a photograph is the best way to identify treasure.</P>
    <P>A community watch system would not cost the State any money because many people are willing to engage in it.  It could be similar to the neighbourhood watch scheme which has proved such a success. It is important to realise that we are not talking about huge investments or wondering where the money would come from.  People in the community would be proud to come together and identify what they have in their streets or the environs of their community and to put these items under closer security in GAA establishments, the Macra organisation or whatever.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of what can happen due to vandalism and greed.  One speaker referred to the Carrowntemple monastic site in County Sligo which is unique and irreplacable.  The year before last the State withdrew a legal action in <Col N="1158" /> which a German national was appealing a District Court conviction relating to the theft of some carvings from Clonmacnoise. Three of those carvings have never been recovered.  It is abominable that such priceless treasures were stolen by some ruthless person either to sell or to hoard, interfering with this magnificant monastery at Clonmacnoise.  John Armstrong, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 October 1986, referred to stolen carvings ripped from the wall at the 7th century monastic site at Inishcaltra on Lough Derg.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>The carving &mdash; of an interlaced cross inset with abstract designs was ripped from steel brackets embedded in stone wall.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Board of Works said yesterday they were &ldquo;absolutely dismayed by this latest outrage&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;We will obviously have to re-examine our whole policy of leaving historic monuments in their natural environment in the light of this and other recent developments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>The director of the national Museum, Dr. Brendan O'Riordan, said yesterday he was &ldquo;horrified&rdquo; by the theft, and he appealed to people in the area to report any suspicious traffic between Lough Derg and the mainland to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This kind of vandalism has become a serious threat to parts of our national heritage.  The best defence against it is the vigilance of local people,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>That is the very point I am making about community watch and I urge the Minister to put all his energies into it.  No matter what legislation we pass, these types of incidents will continue unless there is co-operation between the public, the Garda and the Army to watch over these irreplacable treasures.</P>
    <P>Inishcaltra is one of the most important early christian sites in County Clare, containing the ruins of five churches, the earliest dating from the 7th century, and a round tower.  Brian Boru is said to have built one of the churches and the site <Col N="1159" /> was abandoned during the 14th or 15th centuries.  It later became a place of pilgrimage. Liam de Paor, an eminent man in archaeological matters who excavated the site in the seventies, is quoted as saying that it is now virtually impossible to safeguard monuments left in places where they had been perfectly safe for hundreds of years.  We must face up to what is happening and take practical steps rather than think only in terms of passing legislation.</P>
    <P>If items of this kind are stolen, invariably they are exported for sale on the British, Continental or American market.  This type of thing happens all the time.  The Minister might use his office to communicate with the principal British dealers, Christies and Sothebys, and ask them to keep a very close watch for anything of this nature.  Certainly this is done in a more sophisticated manner in the art world with regard to precious paintings and so on.  It is very difficult to pinpoint exactly what is happening in relation to archaeological treasures, in which this country is so rich.  Perhaps the Minister's office could establish some kind of alert system between the art galleries so that anything that turns up on the market can be quickly pinpointed.</P>
    <P>An example should be made of somebody who engages in this type of activity. I am not speaking about the uncontroled use of metal detectors but someone who rips the side of a monastery wall, steals treasures and sells them abroad.  That is a terrible crime and should be used as an example in our courts so that other people will be very slow to engage in activity of that kind.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the active involvement of archaeologists.  I referred to the dusty image the discipline of archaeology had, but we are moving towards a completely new attitude to archaeology.  New scientific techniques are being used.  There are very advanced systems of dating and x-ray photography. We have a developing team of young archaeologists who are willing and eager to get involved in the huge area of preservation of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> At this point it would be fitting to pay tribute to the recent appointment to the Seanad of Professor George Eogan of UCD.  He holds the chair of archaeology there and is a very eminent professor who has worked extensively on the digs at Knowth and Dowth and produced many learned papers on our twilight past and the marvellous gold industry which flourished in Ireland.  He has involved himself in a more updated approach to projecting archaeology to interest the populace and get away from the archaic image that the discipline had.  I offer my congratulations to Professor Eogan on his appointment to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would briefly refer to the fact that our capital city has no city archaeologist; neither has Cork or Galway.  The Minister should take this opportunity to appoint archaeologists for our principal regions, perhaps the four provinces to start off with and also Dublin.  These appointments could be made by restructuring staff readily available.  This would go a long way to regularising the position. People who engage in stealing treasures realise that effectively there are no controls.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider introducing the subject of archaeology as part of our curriculum at secondary level education and including it as part of the training of the Garda and the Army who have a prominent role to play here.  The Minister was the spokesman on Defence and he could have an input into this. An understanding and knowledge of our raths and monuments, not necessarily just by experts, would lead to the preservation of many of these great things and would deter JCBs from ploughing up fields and so on.  Here a sensitive appraoch is needed.  Ireland is unique in that it had universities before Oxford and Cambridge were thought of.  Monasterboice and Clonmacnoise were great seats of learning with wonderful books, shrines and chalices.</P>
    <P>Let me refer for a moment to the question of treasure found in Ireland.  A greater awareness of this subject should percolate through the schools and to the community generally.  A recent example <Col N="1161" /> is the finding of the Derrynaflan chalice. The very strange decision that came out of the High Court gave the father and son who found this chalice the option of keeping it or taking its value.  I never cease to be amazed at some of the decisions that come out of the courts, probably because I have not a sophisticated appreciation of things legal, but it strikes me as bizarre, to say the least, that somebody can come with a metal detector onto the grounds of a national monument or invade private property, unearth from that monument or property a priceless treasure &mdash; £5.5 million was the value placed on that chalice although I would regard it as priceless &mdash; and literally walk away with it.  I am sure that the Minister finds that bewildering.</P>
    <P>Suppose somebody comes along to Leinster Lawn with a metal detector, gets to work with it and unearths a few treasures, can that person walk out the gates with that treasure and later claim that he owns it?  If not successfully challenged in the Supreme Court this will open the floodgates to all sorts of strange things and people will be able to go into the back gardens or fields of others and wrongfully claim treasure of that kind.  According to this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i> the State is very anxious to have an appeal on this matter within, say, 14 days.</P>
    <P>The ownership of the Derrynaflan chalice is a grey area.  Let me suggest that that chalice once belonged to the churches. Anyone who is familiar with Irish history of the period when monasteries were being razed to the ground and monks, abbots, priests and vicars were being chased from their monasteries and had to bury hurriedly some of the treasure that has been found in the ground, in my humble opinion would hold that this hoard, the Derrynaflan chalice and paten, belonged to the principal churches of the time, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church.  If the three churches in question came together, claimed ownership of this chalice and donated the chalice to the State, a very strong case could be made for settling the matter in that way.  Certainly it appears to me from reading the <Col N="1162" /> history of that time that artefacts of that nature belonged to the churches.  Trinity College Library and the Library at Maynooth University house priceless treasures of books that belonged to the churches at that time and later to the State.  Therefore, something similar could be done in that area.</P>
    <P>There is some disquiet about the possibility that some of our artefacts have been copied and facsimiles and so on have been made.  The Treasures of Ireland Exhibition went on tour in America and included the Cross of Cong, the Ardagh Chalice, Saint Patrick's Bell and items of gold, and the exhibition projected abroad a superb image of Ireland.  Anyone who went to the National Museum and saw the exhibition there would agree that we can be enormously proud of it.  One can imagine that when it went to a country like America which has such a thin background of history the people there must have been in awe at the splendour of the history of 6,000 or 7,000 years of this country.</P>
    <P>I worry about reports that abound with regard to the Ardagh Chalice.  A person who is engaged in researching this area is expressing suspicion and that a copy was made of that chalice and that this copy is in a university in America.  A question must immediately arise as to where the original chalice is.  Is it in our museum or in America?  I do not want to raise any sensationalism by referring to that case, but it is being investigated.  I would like the assurance of the National Museum, who are so desperately stretched in their resources in coping with the amount of treasure that comes to them, that no facsimiles or copies have been made of our principal treasures.  If the information is available to the Minister I ask him to tell me in his reply if any copies have been made of our treasures for sale or for whatever purpose.</P>
    <P>Regarding reward for treasure, it is important that people who are enthusiastic and conscientious about preserving our heritage should receive ample reward or the market price for a treasure found and brought along to a museum, and that such people are not given some derisory <Col N="1163" /> figure which provides no incentive to them to at least bring to the museum items they have found which could be of interest to the State.  The museum is very fortunate in that it acquired many of its treasures, monuments and archaeological finds and hoards in the last century, thanks to the great work of those pioneers to which the Minister referred in his initial address.  A reasonable reward should be given to the people who bring items to the museum.  If it is a question that the museum are rich enough in their examples of certain artefacts, no harm is done and they need not take these items. They might well suggest that the items be retained in private collections.  If there are unique items not extant in the museum's collection, I suggest that a fair reward should be given to people who are prepared to come along and involve themselves.</P>
    <P>Sunken treasure around our coasts is a very exciting area.  It has recently been referred to in the daily newspapers in connection with the sunken treasure off the Wicklow coast.  This opens up a new and difficult area in preservation in maritime history.  I know that the Minister has a personal interest in familiarising himself in this area to try to provide some catalogue of maritime history around our coasts.  One of the great problems is that if information is given out too prematurely, people are only too willing to take away or interfere with history of that kind.  That is a shame.  Being an island nation, there is a lot of history of that kind on the sea bed and not in very deep water.  An example of that only two years ago was the treasure identified off the Sligo coast.</P>
    <P>Maritime archaeology is a very costly operation.  As the Minister has an interest, I would suggest that he might contemplate going down and seeing some of the treasure himself.  I am sure that would instil a lot of interest in that area and prompt a new awakening.  I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister take a dive down in a scuba suit, but there is equipment available for examining under-water treasure and the Minister <Col N="1164" /> could involve himself in that way.  This is an enormous aspect of our history.  These wrecks are monuments of battles or of archaeological treasure that was being taken away from the country when the country was at war at different times over the centuries.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the historic monuments museum is to be welcomed provided it has the best of input from experts who are willing to give their time. It also must involve the public.  We must involve our archaeologists and our people in identifying with their national heritage and all of our treasure.  It is very important that we cannot put a price on the wealth of treasure we have here but I suppose we could wipe out the national debt in one fell swoop if that treasure was to be sold on the international market.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity to engage in a vigorous campaign to do something about our treasure but it will not succeed unless the public are involved.  There is no other way forward.  We will have people greedily stealing unless they are being watched. If an example is made of them in the courts, and they are held up to the nation, that will be a deterrent, because we all feel that these items belong to us.  Who, for instance, does not feel that the Ardagh Chalice or the Book of Kells do not belong to us?  People are proud when they bring tourist friends to look at those great treasures.  Yet, they cannot be protected by the authorities alone.  I realise that I am labouring that point, but I am labouring it on the success of the neighbourhood watch scheme which has worked with tremendous effect in Dublin.  I am confident that it will succeed and I would appreciate the Minister attaching some merit to some of the suggestions I have made.  I welcome the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House since the Minister was appointed so I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success.  I observed the Deputy carrying out his duties in the House prior to his appointment as Minister and he discharged his duties honestly <Col N="1165" /> and efficiently.  I am sure he will continue in that manner.</P>
      <P>It is important that this Bill be dealt with expenditiously.  A number of Governments have tried to get this or similar legislation through but because of general elections or constitutional problems the measure never succeeded in getting through, although it is of considerable importance and deserving of the attention of the House and the people.  I am pleased that this Bill is before the House. I recognise the tribute the Minister paid to his predecessor in the Office of Public Works because she had a large input into the preparation of this Bill which was discussed in the Seanad.  This Bill is widely supported.  We are rich in national monuments, archaeological sites and in our traditions.  Our history and traditions because they go so far back are the envy of people in other countries.  We have been absolutely careless in the way in which we have looked after our national monuments and historical sites, allowing so much of our tradition and culture to be destroyed, indeed even exported.  For decades that was allowed to happen.  It is true to say that we have been totally negligent in this respect.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has described this Bill as an interim measure it is important. Indeed its introduction demonstrates our recognition of the fact that we have been negligent in this respect in the past and are now endeavouring to rectify the situation. That is not meant in any criticism of the Office of Public Works.  I know the staff, Commissioners of the Office of Public Works and the Minister's predecessors devoted great attention to this area.  The preservation of our national monuments and so on does not receive great publicity and, for that reason, tends to be put on the long finger.  However, in recent years an effort has been made to rectify that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that there is being carried on a full archaeological survey of all our sites and monuments, the Office of Public Works recording all of them in each county.  Indeed that survey is well advanced in several counties.  However, <Col N="1166" /> I am saddened that a limited number of qualified archaeologists were involved in that survey.  I appreciate that at times it may be difficult to obtain sufficient archaeologists but it is regrettable that very few qualified archaeologists were involved.  Those who were involved in many instances were dependent on the goodwill of local people in furnishing them with information, or on local historians. There are also some wonderful historical societies throughout the country who have co-operated in this regard. I know there is one in County Offaly and I am sure there are many others throughout the country.  That archaeological survey is continuing and has been very successful to date and I know the Minister will make every effort to ensure its successful completion.</P>
    <P>I know that in the survey carried out in my county and the neighbouring one of Laois the books produced were so extensive, and no doubt expensive, that the only copies made available were those supplied to the Offices of the county council and perhaps also the county library.  I hope the Minister and those involved in the Office of Public Works will endeavour to have duplicates produced, if at all possible, for furnishing to post-primary schools throughout the country.  I know that would be an expensive exercise and would take some time but there would be immense goodwill on the part of all concerned.  I am certain a number of public-spirited people would wish to be actively and positively associated with that endeavour.  Indeed I am sure that many companies would wish to participate in the promotion of those books for circulation to post-primary schools.  I understand ordnance survey maps have also been produced on which most of these historic monuments and sites are marked, something to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people who are not aware of our rich inheritance in an historical and cultural sense.  My reason for advocating the furnishing of archaeological surveys to post-primary schools is to encourage teachers, principals <Col N="1167" /> and others to interest their pupils, encouraging them to become involved in a study of our history, tradition and culture which are so rich and valuable.  It should be remembered that once the seed is sown in a child's mind it will flower so that the adult will continue to have an interest in his or her history and culture. We have to get the message of our rich heritage across generally.  I appreciate it may take a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there had been problems encountered in getting people to report monuments, forts, crannógs and so on located on their lands.  In far too many cases a bulldozer was used to level many such sites.  There are so many of our ring forts, mediaeval earthworks and buildings under threat it would be beneficial to advertise publicly the importance of preserving such sites.  This would, in turn, encourage members of the farming community to retain and preserve them.  In the past, perhaps for superstitious reasons, the fairyfort and the fairyring were never interfered with. With the introduction of electricity much of the superstition was done away with. A number of historical items are under threat.  The majority of members of the farming community who have valuable items on their lands recognise the historical connotations involved and are anxious to see these items retained.  We must be ever vigilant in the preservation of those items and in having them recorded.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Minister in regard to increasing the fines that can be imposed on people who are in breach of the regulations in this area.  This is necessary and important.  The vast majority of archaeologists spend their leisure time excavating sites.  I think I am correct in saying that up to 98 per cent of these people would not be looking for treasure trove or buried treasure but would simply be engaging in a hobby.  They look for information and they document that information for posterity.  That is to be <Col N="1168" /> welcomed.  We are all happy with that approach but it is necessary to ensure that penalties can be imposed on people who breach the regulations as set out in this Bill.  Some people carry out excavations in the hope of finding valuables in the soil.  This makes it very important that the appropriate penalties can be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought in a number of tightening up regulations in regard to the use of metal detectors.  I welcome this approach.  It is necessary and desirable that our sites and our countryside are safeguarded against the use of these instruments.  That is a matter we can discuss on Committee Stage but there is one item of which I would like the Minister to take cognisance now.  On occasions it may be necessary and desirable that metal detectors be used by Department officials or by archaeologists but their use, too, could be permitted in such exceptional cases as, for example, road widening.  There are many plans in existence in respect of road widening and of the by-pass of a number of towns.  These represent long term projects and it will take quite some time to carry out the work involved.  There will be at least hundreds of acres involved in this exercise. I have seen some of these plans which include towns from Naas right down to the south.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, to his officials and to the county councillors in the areas where this work will be carried out to give serious consideration to the matter of excavation, to check out those areas and examine them in a very detailed manner prior to the commencment of work.  In the case of road widening, we may assume that a considerable number of historical items will not be unearthed but will remain buried but smashed so will be lost forever.  I am most anxious that the Minister and his Department officials make every effort to ensure that some group will check out these areas before the work commences.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of land reclamation is carried out and in 99 out of <Col N="1169" /> 100 of these cases people do not recognise the value of the historical items that may lie under the soil.  Before land is reclaimed the Board of Works should have an opportunity of seeing if there are any historical items that could be damaged or destroyed.  I ask the Minister to look at this area because it is of importance.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am pleased that the Minister has increased the fines.  He gave the example of Carrowntemple graveyard in County Sligo.  Deputy Nealon, who is from Sligo, was concerned about that matter as was everybody present in the House.  In that graveyard one grave slab was damaged and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, the only fine that could be imposed in that case was £50.</P>
    <P>Clonmacnoise is one of the most famous historical sites in Europe, dating back to 548 AD when it was founded by St. Kieran.  Slabs were stolen from the site by a German.  Luckily one of the staff, Mr. Thomas Moore, and a local garda, James Rogers, detected that offence and managed to apprehend the culprit.  He was charged in court and the items were returned.  I understand there are about three items missing from that site, although I am not certain of the actual number.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Brady's absorbing speech.  He spoke of the neighbourhood watch schemes as they affect these sites but the problem with Clonmacnoise is that it is in a remote rural area with only a limited number of houses and it would be very difficult to provide total security there.  The Office of Public Works' staff at Clonmacnoise secure the majority of these items at night but in any area where there are historical items people will find a way to steal them. To a large extent we have to depend on the goodwill of and detection by many people.</P>
    <P>Any person found guilty of interfering, damaging, destroying or stealing from an historic site should have a mandatory jail sentence imposed on him.  Unless we do this, we will not be providing a sufficient deterrent because the monetary value of <Col N="1170" /> some of these items in London, Europe, and more so in America, is enormous. A person who successfully steals one of these items can obtain vast sums of money for it.  As I said, the only way to safeguard these items is by imposing a mandatory prison sentence on the person found guilty of stealing or damaging historical items.  In most instances I would be very reluctant to take this step but in this instance it is a step we should seriously consider.  This is something we can discuss on Committee Stage because it is very important.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the National Parks and Monuments Service published a very good pamphlet setting out our history and culture. There are many other excellent publications and pamphlets giving full details of our historical sites.  We should be very proud of our heritage and make every effort to maintain our historical monuments.  I feel very strongly that we should provide a sufficent deterrent to prevent people from damaging our historical monuments or sites.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the setting up of the Register of Historic Monuments under section 5.  This register has been needed for very many years.  Under section 5 the name, location and a brief description of the historic monument must be entered in the register.  Archaeological details must also be mentioned.  Under section 18 these items will be entered on the land certificate or folio.  Such a measure is long overdue.  I welcome the fact that it is the intention to register these items as a burden affecting registered land.  Some people may be concerned about this step but I do not believe it will interfere with the sale of a property. Since this burden will be entered privately on the folio, the purchaser will be deemed to have knowledge of the historic site prior to the purchase of the property.  It will take time to have all these monuments registered because I understand the Land Registry has been considerably understaffed for the past number of years and this is a sizeable job for them to carry out.  In the interim, the Minister should publish a list of national <Col N="1171" /> monuments in the local newspapers and also register them with the county registrar of each county, with county councils and the planning office.  In that way, a solicitor acting for someone purchasing land could see if there was a national monument on a farm in the same way as a person selling a farm would check to see that the buyer was solvent.</P>
    <P>I know this is not strictly under the aegis of the Minister's Department but I should also like to refer to our historic houses and medieval buildings.  I do not know the Minister's plans in this regard but they are part of our heritage, history and culture and they should also be registered under section 5.  Many of these old buildings have been destroyed and it is essential to ensure that the remaining buildings are included on the register. When the economy improves the Minister should consider introducing an incentive for restoration work on a number of our medieval and historic buildings.  I do not know if the Minister has had the pleasure of visiting Ballymacegan Castle, County Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This building was used for housing livestock and it was a total ruin.  The staff of the Department had carried out tasteful and picturesque restoration work on buildings in Portumna and, on completion, they commenced work on restoring Ballymacegan Castle. Anyone who wishes to see at first hand top-class craftsmanship and expertise should visit Portumna Castle and Ballymacegan Castle.  They will be justifiably proud of the work carried out in restoring these castles.</P>
      <P>There are some old style buildings in Geashill, County Offaly, and the local authorities have placed preservation orders on many of them.  I hope the Minister's Department will encourage the maintenance and retention of these buildings because the village has retained its character over the centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The malls in Birr, Westport and Ballina <Col N="1172" /> are very important.  In some cases there are preservation orders on the houses but an effort should be made to try to ensure these buildings are all retained.  Elderly people may not be in a position to maintain these buildings and they should be given some incentive to do so as it would be a great pity to see such buildings fall into disrepair.  Oxmantown hall is well over 100 years old and I am sorry it has fallen into disrepair and decay over the years.  If that building disappears from the mall in Birr the town will be the loser. I understand that a very active group are interested in this hall and I hope that they will succeed in maintaining it.  In matters of this kind, the Department have powers at least to make sure that such buildings are preserved without interfering with the ownership.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the legal definition of a monument but it is a long, comprehensive definition.  Under the 1930 Act, a national monument is defined as a monument or the remains of a monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching thereto.  I know that our woods are not national monuments but they contain beautiful oak and beech trees.  We have all heard of Coolattin Woods and of Derryguinnon Woods, Derryclure and Clonard Woods in County Offaly.  It took hundreds of years to grow those trees and they were a paradise for wildlife.  They were also of tremendous historical interest and a great attraction for tourists. Many people travelled to see them but, sadly, they are now treated as nothing more than a cash crop.  Trees are being felled out of hand although I understand that replacement trees will be planted. What is happening to Coolattin Woods is like amputating part of a person's arm or leg and the same applies to the other woods to which I referred.  They are being wiped out although it took generations for those trees to mature.  A saw is wiping out our history and culture in one fell swoop.  The Planning Acts should be amended to prevent this happening in future.  The Minister's advisers should <Col N="1173" /> study this point closely to see what can be done in regard to woods.  I know they cannot be classified as national monuments but their preservation is essential.</P>
    <P>The preservation of woods such as Coolattin is also essential.  It saddens me to see woods being felled in County Offaly.  There are Deputies in this House from Counties Kerry, Wexford, Dublin, Sligo, Galway and Offaly.  In each of those counties there are beautiful woods with oak and beech trees which are under threat of being wiped out.  We cannot sit idly by in this House and allow those woods to be felled.  By felling those woods we are wiping out a piece of our history. These magnificent and beautiful woods are popular local amenities and have been responsible for attracting tourists to this country.  As they have taken hundreds of years to grow, we as a nation must act immediately to preserve them. It is a crying shame to see the way in which they are being felled at present.  I ask the Minister to see whether the Office of Public Works can save this part of our history.  This may mean that the planning laws may have to be amended.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party has very positive ideas and is considering introducing a Private Members' Bill on this issue.  If he does so, he will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.  I am certain that all parties are anxious to see the preservation of these woods.  I want to place on record my dismay, disgust and disappointment on seeing Coolattin Woods and woods in my own native county being destroyed before our eyes. We in this House must make sure that those woods are preserved.  The Minister also referred to wrecks off our coasts. These wrecks are of immense importance and many safeguards are necessary.  If people enter these wrecks they should be obliged by law to report what items they find and the Minister's board should have an opportunity to assess their value and ensure their preservation for posterity.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred, as did Deputy Brady, to the Derrynaflan hoard. The position in regard to the Derrynaflan hoard concerns me.  Early in December 1986 Mr. Justice Blayney awarded the <Col N="1174" /> sum of £5.5 million to Mr. Webb and his son who found the Derrynaflan hoard while using a metal detector.  That decision, as we are all aware, is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  A date has now been fixed for the hearing of that appeal next month.  In the meantime written submissions are being made.  I appreciate that this matter is before the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I feel sure the Deputy will be very careful as the matter could be deemed to be <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and therefore I will be very careful about what I say.  Irrespective of the particular case in point, one thing that concerns me is that our Constitution does not provide for treasure trove.  In Britain, treasure trove is deemed to belong to the Monarch. Therefore, all gold and silver objects hidden in the ground in England belong to the Queen.  There is no similar provision in Ireland.  In Britain if treasure trove is found the finder is rewarded and my understanding of the legal position there is that the finder is paid its full market value.  I would be against the payment of the full market value in this country. I would be totally opposed to the taxpayer being obliged to pay the full market value to the finder of treasure trove discovered in the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if we do not pay some reward to the finder of a valuable treasure a valuable item may be concealed or damaged or, even worse, smuggled out of the country.  In fact, a large number of historical items have been smuggled out of Greece and Italy to Britain and America. We must provide some incentive for people to acknowledge that they have found an item and to report it and we must pay them some compensation or give them a reward.  If we only give an infinitesimal reward for the finding of a particular item it will encourage people to smuggle that item out of the country. We will have to consider the amount and type of reward which we should pay to finders.  In my view the reward paid <Col N="1175" /> should be reasonable and logical and should have regard to the value of the object found and the difficulty and trouble the person had in discovering it. These are matters the court would have to take into account in deciding the amount to be paid to the finder of a particular object.</P>
    <P>At present there is an appeal to the Supreme Court in regard to the Derrynaflan hoard.  Whether this House could have acted beforehand is debatable. We have three options, the first of which is to await the decision of the Supreme Court.  The second option could be the bringing in of legislation to prevent such an amount of compensation being paid and the third option could be the bringing in of an amendment to our Constitution on this matter.  Those were the three options which faced the previous Government and which now face the present Government.  The Minister of State referred specifically to this in his speech.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Blayney stated in his judgement that the people involved were actually not trespassing on the land but that they had not permission to dig on the land.  That was quoted at the time in the newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if there were no reference to persons outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not make any further reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to valuable items of treasure trove, a common-sense practical approach could be taken.  If people could be rewarded a practical and logical amount for discovering these objects that would be highly desirable. It is absolutely essential that people be encouraged to report such finds to the State.  Otherwise, if the items are not handed over to our National Museum we face the danger of their being smuggled <Col N="1176" /> out of the country.  If the compensation took account of the value of the object found, the situation would be met.  The Minister should treat this matter with extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>Local authorities around the country have a major responsibility in regard to the protection of our national historic monuments.  We must be vigilant.  I ask the Minister, his Department officials and the Commissioners of Public Works to keep an eye on the local authorities concerning their approach to these matters. I believe 99 per cent of our county managers, officials and public representatives are very careful and diligent in safeguarding and looking after our historic monuments and treasures.  On occasions when houses or office blocks are being built local authorities make important decisions.  Wood Quay in Dublin is a classic example of a local authority making the wrong decision, which when once made was carried through regardless.  The buildings of the office towers on the Liffey is now history, but it was a great tragedy nevertheless. When one sees the view across the river towards Christ Church Cathedral being obstructed by these office blocks one cannot but regret that this building, one of the most magnificent, not just in Dublin or in Ireland but in the world, has been spoiled.  The original view will now only be remembered by the old people of Dublin.  It is a great tragedy that such development went ahead on that site, building upon national treasures for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal now to replace Nelson's Pillar in Dublin but I have reservations about that.  There has been much controversy about the statue to surmount this monument.  If I had my choice I would choose Father F. X. Martin to be remembered there.  He showed courage, initiative, grit and determination in carrying on a continuous fight for our history and culture and in trying to preserve the Wood Quay site.  It was a great fight but, unfortunately, he lost.  He fought that fight right through the courts, on the streets and in every way possible.  He tried to alert the public to the danger to <Col N="1177" /> our history and our culture.  People like him awaken public consciousness.  They give us pride in our history going back over the decades.  He is a shining example of those who are interested in our history and our culture with regard to the safeguarding of items which took so many centuries to build up.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and look forward to a discussion on Committee Stage.  The Minister can be assured of our co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be as brief as possible, because there are a number of Deputies offering to speak.  First, I compliment the Minister on bringing in this Bill and wish him well in his position as junior Minister in the Department of Finance.  The Bill is to be welcomed. Over the past 30 years the failure of successive Governments to take action in combating the rape and destruction of our monuments and archaeological sites has had dire consequences.  It has deprived the Irish people of at least 30 per cent of their heritage and traditional monuments.  It took the Derrynaflan crisis and the uproar over the use of metal detectors to ensure that the Government of the time work up and took action.</P>
      <P>I wonder if this Bill is too little, too late.  I have seen in my own area and around the country the destruction of valuable monuments and sites through development and building.  The majority of these acts of vandalism were carried out by well educated people whom one would expect to have a more caring and responsible attitude.  Progress and the quick buck were more important to them than preserving those treasures for future generations.  Despite repeated requests to Government, nobody seemed to care or at least nobody seemed to be capable of taking action.  Those monuments, artefacts and archaeological sites belong to the Irish people.  The Government of the day have a duty and a right to protect them and to provide the finance and the manpower to ensure their protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county which has often been described as &ldquo;historic Wexford&rdquo;. Deputy McCartan comes from the same <Col N="1178" /> county but he now represents Dublin, his adopted county.  The songs and stories of Wexford all relate to its heritage, culture and past, for example, we have songs and stories about Vinegar Hill, Boolavogue, Banna Strand, and the landing of the Normans.  Monasteries, friaries and castles are also mentioned in songs and stories.</P>
    <P>I am glad Wexford County Council have recognised that Wexford is a valuable tourist attraction.  They have erected a new heritage park at Ferrycarrig.  This park cost over £1 million and it will be opened by the President very shortly.  It is expected that this heritage park which dates back to the Stone Age will attract many tourists from abroad and from different parts of Ireland.  Most of the-work on the heritage park was undertaken by young people on the youth employment and social employment schemes.  This proves that young people have a role to play in our society.  The park provided very worthwhile jobs for those young people for the last two to three years.  I commend the county manager and his committee who worked so hard and tirelessly to ensure that this heritage park will open in June.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas mentioned by the Minister are dear to the hearts of Irish people.  Up to the middle fifties and the early sixties Ireland was not a prime tillage country in the sense that most work on the land was done by the horse and the plough.  It was only when modern machinery came in that much of our cultural heritage was desecrated.  As a result many ancient monuments have been lost. I do not blame the farmers because at that time many of them were not aware that there were valuable relics of the past on their land.  Many farmers had the desire to make a decent standard of living for their families and they did not realise that by using new machinery they were carrying out such desecration.  The Government should have ensured that farmers and other people up and down the country were educated about the importance of those monuments and archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>An educational process in relation to <Col N="1179" /> monuments and archaeological sites should be implemented through our schools.  There are attractive booklets available covering many national monuments. I want to stress the importance of the booklet <i>Irish Field Monuments</i>.  This well-produced coloured booklet gives a concise and readable description of monuments throughout the country.  I think that at some stage in the past samples of that booklet were sent to schools. The Minister should try to reawaken interest in the area of national monuments through our schools.  Teachers and the people involved in the running of schools should ensure that students are made aware of the importance of our monuments, our heritage and the historical sites that exist in each county. Nowadays many teachers bring their students on nature trips and give nature talks.  It is important that they should also include visits to monuments.  I am happy to say that this is happening in some areas.  However, there are schools where teachers do not seem to be interested in this area of education whereby young people would grow up with a caring attitude and continue to look after our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have identified tourism as an area of great potential for growth.  In this regard national monuments are one of the main attractions.  When one looks through tourist publications one cannot but be struck by the number of monuments which are featured.  Our monuments are of particular interest to continental countries and to our European counterparts, especially the French and the Germans. Our monuments, heritage and culture will play a major part in developing tourism in the future if we are prepared to sell them in such a way as to attract tourists.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are making every effort to provide facilities at major monuments but unfortunately there seems to be a lack of finance.  I would like to see a development between the Board of Works and local authorities, in particular county councils, in mapping <Col N="1180" /> out and developing sites that would be major attractions.  What has been done in Wexford is a prime example of what can be done without having to spend huge amounts of money.  The Minister should look at the role of local authorities in conjunction with the Board of Works in ensuring the protection of those monuments and sites and that they are brought to the attention of tourists.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier on to metal detectors.  If the Derrynaflan crisis had not arisen would there be any talk about metal detectors today?  I welcome the action the Minister has taken in section 2 in introducing new regulations to combat metal detectors.  I would not agree with what Deputy Enright said.  If the general public are not going to be allowed to use metal detectors the Board of Works should not be allowed to use them either.  Many of our relics would be better left lying in the ground if the same crisis we have had over the past few months in relation to the Derrynaflan hoard were to occur again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in fines in section 17.  Fines were too small up to now Many people may feel that £50,000 is excessive but it is important that there is a deterrent to people entering on to lands and trying to steal valuable relics.</P>
    <P>The register of historic monuments in section 5 is very important.  The register will ensure that all monuments are documented.  It will make it easier for whoever has control of the register to take action against people who are not authorised to interfere with such monuments. I commend the Minister for making this provision and I hope it will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I hope the Historic Monuments Council are not going to be regarded, no matter what Government are in power, as jobs for the boys.  Too often in the past we have had boards and councils set up by Ministers and Governments of the day. In most cases those organisations consisted of people who were not capable of carrying out the work required of them. Most of the people appointed to such boards since I entered politics could not have <Col N="1181" /> coped with the job of running a huckster's shop let alone the important boards and councils they were appointed to.  It is important that those appointed should know what is involved and have a caring attitude to historical monuments and artefacts.  Appointments should be on the basis of ability rather than the political party they support.  It is important that we appoint councils consisting of people who are interested in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister for support for county museums.  We have a county museum in Wexford which contains many historical reminders of the county's and the province's past but, because of inadequate finance, those involved are finding it difficult to carry on.  Visitors are charged a small amount and that goes towards the cost of the upkeep of the museum which is run by local people on a voluntary basis.  Enniscorthy Urban Council make a small contribution towards the running costs but for such worthwhile projects county councils and the Government should make grants available.  It is important that the work of local people in protecting their local heritage is recognised.  I am not making a case solely for Wexford but for all counties that have gone to the trouble of providing a local museum.</P>
    <P>In all major cities and towns beautiful old buildings have been allowed to fall into decay, were knocked down and replaced by high rise office blocks.  It is wrong that there should be such destruction of mediaeval layers, historic buildings and Streetscapes.  Some of the buildings erected in Dublin in recent times are nothing more than monstrosities. They were badly designed and are not in keeping with the local landscape. The architects involved in some of them should have been jailed.  They have not enhanced the appearance of the city. All historic buildings should be protected. I should like to wish the Minister well with the legislation and I hope that money and manpower will be made available to implement its provisions.  I hope the Office of Public Works will co-operate with local authorities to ensure that its provisions are complied with.  It is my <Col N="1182" /> wish that the legislation is not left lying idle while our monuments are destroyed and artefacts stolen, thus depriving our children of valuable evidence of our past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  The Worker's Party welcome any legislation that seeks to update any law.  The Bill before us seeks to update legislation that was passed in 1930 and 1954, the legislation governing our national monuments and historic sites.  In introducing the Bill on 28 April, the Minister indicated that this was an interim proposal.  It appears from what he said that it was the challenge of a case currently before the courts that compelled the Government to act on an interim basis.  We reject that view.  The House can always go about its business in the manner it deems fit irrespective of the activities of other arms of the State. It is accepted that there is no point in our legislating here if we run into difficulties with the courts in their normal functions but it must be clear that there is no impediment on the House proceeding with legislation in the legal sense if we decide to do so.  For that reason the Bill before us is disappointing because it does not face up to the central problem surrounding the preservation of our national historic and archaeological monuments and sites.  I am referring to the whole issue of treasure trove and the right of the State to claim ownership of items of historical or archaeological importance discovered within the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the High Court in July, 1986 &mdash; I appreciate that it is currently under appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; clearly establishes that the old notion of treasure trove which was found as a prerogative in England when we were governed by that country does not apply here since our State was founded in 1921-22. It is the view of the High Court that there is not right to trove residing in our State as formed and constituted under our law, subject clearly to the views of the Supreme Court when it decides on the issue.  It would seem that the view of <Col N="1183" /> the High Court is a sensible one and is founded on firm principles.  I am sure the Minister has been advised of this by his Department and by the Attorney General's office.  Therefore, it is up to us to take action in this regard whether by legislation &mdash; it may be possible to include a provision in the Bill at a later stage to cover the matter &mdash; or by way of an amending provision to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody does not yawn every time the question of a referendum to amend our Constitution is raised in the context of important social issues. However, a problem exists in this area and it has been recognised by the Minister. In the past legislation was knocked back at various stages along the way because of constitutional impediments.  If they exist we must confront them and take corrective action.  In the national media today it was reported that a reason to expedite the hearing of the action before the Surpreme Court was the urgency arising from the invasion of many of our archaeological and historic sites by people seeking to exploit the legal situation.  That problem will persist after the Supreme Court has handed down its judgement.  In any case it is incumbent on the Minister to address the problem now and to realise that irrespective of whatever might be decided judicially by another authority, there is no impediment on this House getting on with its proper business.</P>
    <P>The Bill, because it is an interim measure, attempts in the first instance to address the immediacy of our problems relating to the use of metal detectors.  It is our view that until the law relating to treasure trove is clarified and the situation resolved to the satisfaction of the common good there should be no licensing of the use of metal detectors.  It would be absolutely impossible to police the licensing of metal detectors as a means of exploring or inquiring into sites of archaeological or historical interest. Most of our historic sites are in remote locations.  Often they are unclearly marked or specified.  We are seeking in the policing of the provisions set out in <Col N="1184" /> section 2 to rely on a very much overworked and extended police force or persons of good intention.  Reference was made in earlier speeches to neighbourhood watch projects.  We have to be realistic in considering this matter.  There are huge incentives for using these machines.  The sum of £5.36 million is potentially available in one instance alone by reason of the use of these machines.  Counsel on behalf of the State reported to the Supreme Court that many of our sites were being invaded by people. As long as the potential for commercial exploitation of finds exists, it is unrealistic to hope that we can police the type of licensing system which the Minister proposes in section 2.  On Committee Stage we will propose an amendment prohibiting absolutely the use of metal detectors until such time as the law relating to treasure trove has been resolved to the satisfaction of the common good and the State.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance showing why we are concerned.  About 1980 two men went to a remote site in this State.  Some of the buildings there carried signs erected by the Office of Public Works warning that the site was preserved and was given protection under the law.  Despite this warning, they proceeded with the permission of the local landowner and in time their excavations uncovered a very valuable hoard.  They stand to gain massive moneys if their claims are sustained. Nobody knew these people were there. Who is to tell the Minister in these types of situations what is going on?  This can also happen in places which are not so remote where a person passing by could confront somebody using a metal detector to excavate.  Under the proposed legislation there is facility for the licensing of individuals and for that licensed person to have agents working on his behalf in the carrying out of excavation work.  There does not appear to be any requirement that these agents be named on the licence as issued.  Neither does there seem to be any restriction on the number of agents who can work on behalf of the licensed person to carry out archaeological inquiries.  One can imagine the <Col N="1185" /> kind of slick answers that would be given if a concerned person or a garda asked a person whether he was working on behalf of a licensed person or if he held a licence himself.  The inquirer would have to go away to check, but by the time he returned the person earlier confronted would not easily be found if false information had been given.  This is a particular problem when the incentives are so great.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party appreciate that in many instances the work of the amateur explorer can be very valuable to the State.  Deputy Enright referred to some instances where motor by-passes have to be built or site clearance has to take place and a person may come with a detector to see if anything of interest or value can be recovered.  That is very commendable. We appreciate that there are well-intentioned organisations who are concerned to maintain standards and police the use of metal detectors.  We would envisage that in time the type of scheme the Minister has included in section 2 should pass into the corpus of our law but we are again trying to emphasise that this is not the time, particularly when the law is in a state of flux and we cannot be sure that massive incentives will not be the order of the day once the Supreme Court has handed down the results of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 presumptions are laid down in law for a person found with a detector in or about an archaeological site.  It is presumed that the person is acting illegally under subsection (6). These presumptions do not work as well as it might seem on paper.  How does one not allow an immediate rebuttal by a person who is simply found walking around a site with a detector activated? Surely the person must be found in <i>flagrante delicto,</i> either with a site opened up and an item retrieved or some clear indication that the person having found an item in the ground intended to keep it.  As I understand the regime which has been suggested by the Minister in section 2, there is no interdict on the use of metal detectors for purposes other than archaeological exploration.  Therefore, a person can claim that even though in the <Col N="1186" /> vicinity of or on an archaeological site he or she is not particularly interested in finding anything of that importance.  I see great difficulties in trying to police this kind of regime.  We should give serious consideration to the position that exists and consider prohibiting entirely the use of metal detectors on a general basis until the law has been clarified.  For example, there is a prohibition under section 2 (1) <i>(c)</i> on promoting, &ldquo;whether by advertising or otherwise, the sale or use of detection devices for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects.&rdquo; That is well intentioned, no doubt, but we must recognise that by reason of events in the course of the past few years detectors and their value to the unscrupulous person are well known and entering this into legislation at this time is tending to bolt the stable door long after the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>In respect of the notion of licensing as envisaged under section 2, a question must be asked about the type of people the Minister has in mind.  All excavation work in the State in the future should be carried out under the direct responsibility of the commissioners.  It is important that there be a direct line of responsibility back from the people on site to those carrying the overall responsibility for policing and maintaining our national stock of archaeological and historical sites. Many people in the State and from abroad will seek to explore and carry out excavations.  These people should be licensed as agents of the commissioners and be directly responsible to them.  We are concerned that there seems to be no limit to the number of agents in turn whom these licensed persons can employ, nor does there appear to be any necessity to include on the licence issued the names of agents who would be employed.  If the regime is to proceed that should be clearly laid down in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The provision for an application for a licence being deemed to be granted if there has been no response one way or another within three months after the making of the application is worrying because there may be very good reasons why the Minister or his officials would <Col N="1187" /> want to inquire into the alternatives which would require longer than three months.  While on paper it looks a reasonable period of time, experience of the whole area of planning applications has shown that the fixing of a period of time for a response to a planning application has often led either to oversight or simply inability to get to the correct decision quickly enough to planning applications being granted because a response was not given within a fixed time.  Why should people who want to apply for permission to explore and excavate sites that do not belong to them be entitled to an answer within three months if there are good and sufficient reasons that the reply be given after a longer time?  I have referred to the planning area.  In a planning application at least the owner of property is applying for permission to develop his or her property but in the situations we are discussing an explorer or a person excavating will have no legal title or interest in the property beyond the wider interest of archaeological exploration.  Why the need for the three month rule?  Is the Minister satisfied it will work to the better advantage of all in the long term when we being to put these provisions into effect?</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to wrecks and demarcation of areas of importance at sea must be welcomed, but here also we see that three months rule for people who wish to explore and the same questions arise.  In this context also the Minister has fixed a period of 100 years.  There is an onus on a person exploring to report a wreck found of 100 years or more.  I do not wish to be facetious but what of a wreck that is 98 or 99 years old?  Who is going to argue with a person who is down there exploring as to whether he or she knew the age of the wreck that he or she interfered with?  We suggest the Minister should consider making it a general obligation on all persons exploring underwater to report all wrecks to the local authorities, the Garda Síochána, the commissioners, or whoever is envisaged under the Bill so that it be for them to decide on the significance, the age and the importance of the wreck.  Too much <Col N="1188" /> leeway would exist if we maintained the definition of a wreck as being something 100 years or more old.  Many wrecks in the waters around our island less than 100 years old would be of historical importance and should also have the protection of our legislation.</P>
    <P>On a general point, we hope the Bill will proceed but in the way I have outlined. It makes no provision with regard to powers of the Garda Síochána.  Time and again this is overlooked.  The power of arrest, the power to search the vehicle or conveyance of the person who is found involved in illegal activity, the power to question or to seize items used by the person involved, do not seem to be addressed in the Bill.  I will accept the advice of the Minister if those are adequately covered in the two Acts I have referred to.  However, I must admit I doubt whether legislation passed in 1930 or 1954 would carry all the powers the Garda Síochána would need to police properly, the type of regime the Minister seeks to introduce in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provision in respect of the register of monuments and historic sites is most welcome.  It is important that money be made available to ensure that it does not become a register in somebody's office somewhere but that it is promulgated widely in the schools, in local authority buildings such as libraries, in Garda Síochána stations and in other public places as prominently as possible.  It must not merely be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> There is a major educational role in the whole area of making people aware of the importance of our heritage and of the significance of preserving our heritage in its locale.</P>
    <P>Section 7 proposes to remove national monuments in time to a museum or other facility.  It will have to be conceded by all of those concerned that often this means the removal of the artefact or item to the museum in Dublin or to some place of safe keeping in the city.  It does not appear in the legislation that there is any intention to consult with the local authority in relation to what the commissioners would decide to do with an artefact where it was deemed necessary <Col N="1189" /> that it should be removed to a museum. These items can have great tourism importance in the locality and it is exceptionally important that local authorities be consulted so that a scheme for housing artefacts in the location or on a site in the next village would be fully considered.</P>
    <P>I know the Government have plans with regard to the decentralisation of our bureaucracy.  We should also work towards decentralising our artefacts and archaeological finds so that they are on display as near as possible to the place of their original location and are available to local communities as an opportunity to generate tourist interest in the locality. I do not see anything in this Bill that allows for that amount of local democracy. I am afraid that many very important items and artefacts would, with all the best intentions, find their way to Dublin where they would rest on display in the gallery or else, would be transferred to such unlikely places of safe keeping as Daingean Reformatory.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of an increase in penalties, there can be no doubt that this is a welcome development. In response to a point raised by Deputy Enright there should not be a mandatory penalty in criminal legislation. The importance of leaving it to our Judiciary to decide, on the facts, on what should be done cannot be underestimated. The penalties included in the legislation are adequate to enable an active and concerned Judiciary to deal with a person who trespasses and desecrates or interferes with our heritage.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  It is updating out of date legislation.  It is seeking to bring up to date an interest but it is interim legislation.  Once it is there it will be hard to dislodge.  It would be difficult for the Minister to find the enthusiasm and energy of this House to enable him to come back and address the wider issues once we have what seems to be adequate legislation for the time being on the books.  That has been the experience of the House over the decades.  I am anxious that the Minister should between now and the next Stage address the whole central issue to any serious development <Col N="1190" /> in the area of the protection of our heritage, that is our treasure trove.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the setting up of the Historical Monuments Council, I am concerned about its composition in so far as that we have a very rich and valuable labour history and tradition in this country and I notice that the only academic institutions that are honoured with inclusion in the board are the universities. I invite the Minister to consider including in the list a member of the Dublin Institute of Technology which, in Dublin is second in size to UCD in terms of the numbers of students for which it caters. Would the Minister also consider it advisable to include a member of the Irish Labour History Society?  The Minister for his own reasons fixed the importance of wrecks found in the sea at 100 years, but our labour history is longer than that. There are institutions and facilities of importance to that tradition that should equally be considered.  I am anxious that whatever body is established these institutions would be fully advised and consulted in this whole area.  I recommend that idea to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair and Deputy Foley.  I join with other Members who have contributed here and in the Seanad in what is now a chorus of welcome for the National Monuments Bill. I welcome the fact that it has been given a priority in the early legislative work of the new Government.  The Minister of State obviously deserves credit for that. <Col N="1191" /> I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment.  I hope that the early passage of this very worthy Bill will be the prelude to a very successful period for him in office, in an area that generally transcends politics, expecially now that the arterial drainage of the Dunkellin River in his own constituency and of the Owenmore and Arrow Rivers in my constituency has been moved to another area.</P>
      <P>The nature of this welcome all party support for the Bill is through an accident of timing emphasised by the fact that one administration introduced this matter in the Seanad, steered it through that House and that now the present Government have with enthusiasm taken it on board unchanged.  I am very pleased also that some important amendments generated in the Seanad have been incorporated, resulting in what is a considerably better Bill.  Too often Ministers come to this House and to the Seanad with a very fixed idea about their Bills, with closed minds and resisting amendments.  It would be a very good thing if the attitude towards this non-controversial Bill, were adopted to controversial Bills.  All amendments should be looked at and considered on their merits and not in relation to whether they may cause delay to a Minister's legislative schedule.  That approach would give us better legislation and would make all Members of the Oireachtas much more interested in the debates and perhaps a little less interested in constituency work than is the case at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Bill's purpose is to further protect our archaeological heritage.  We all have a serious and immediate obligation to provide all of the possible legal muscle towards that end.  Unlike other spheres our failure to act immediately, or our negligence in this area cannot be remedied, or made good in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the marine archaeology section of the Bill dealing with historic wrecks and arterfacts found off our shores; indeed also the section dealing with artefacts found <Col N="1192" /> in land under water.  There is a necessity for clarification of the law in this respect, for a further strengthening of the law, putting it beyond all ambiguity or the chance interpretation of a court.  We must establish permanently and absolutely the State's rights in this area.  In the immediate past we had a rather cavalier approach to the whole area of marine archaelogy.  It is not so long since there were advertisments in the papers telling people of the great adventures awaiting them if they came here to explore the shipwrecks off our shores in our clear, cool and inviting waters.  That was the kind of approach adopted until relatively recently.  Through lack of concern for such wrecks, through lack of involvement by the State we allowed important artefacts and treasures to be taken away, lost now for all time.  It was a totally neglected aspect of our heritage at official level.  In very recent times only did the State take official cognisance of what was taking place.</P>
    <P>This new interest followed the claim of the discovery of three Armada shipwrecks at Streedagh near Grange in County Sligo.  I understand these may turn out to be the most important Armada wrecks found in recent times with the ship's manifests in Spain indicating that there may be more than 50 cannons present on the three wrecks.  Of course the timing of the discovery was good, coming in advance of 1988, the 400th anniversary of the invasion by the Spanish Armada.  Of course the location itself is a beautiful area of County Sligo. That is all that was good about this discovery, claimed by a group of British divers who had obviously proceeded with their work without permission from anyone.  The first official news or notification that any of the State's agents received was when a cannon was being taken off one of the wrecks.</P>
    <P>As is the case in most of these discoveries, the attitude of the divers was unashamedly commercial.  They were not drawn to the areas as archaeologists, as historians, or indeed as subaqua people engaging in pleasure diving along our beautiful coastline.  In my opinion they <Col N="1193" /> were there for what they could get out of it.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that as long as they do not further their commercial aims at the expense of our State.  As far as I can gather from their attitude it appears that they claim they own what can be taken off these sunken ships off our coast.  Of course that could amount to millions of pounds, taking into account the type of cannons and their value.  It should be remembered that they came onto our territory without anybody's permission.</P>
    <P>They now have their back-up legal team firing the occasional salvo in our direction from London.  Their general attitude appears to be that if they remain good boys they might get in on part of the action.  Fortunately, in this case my understanding is that we are well protected by some of the Maritime Acts on our Statute Book.  It is also my belief &mdash; and this can be substantiated &mdash; that in working where they were those divers were in breach of the foreshore Acts. Contrary to many people's opinion the foreshore extends from our high water mark &mdash; not to low water mark &mdash; to three miles out to sea.  The discovery of these wrecks was well within that area.</P>
    <P>The position of the State's rights is being further underpinned by the provisions of this Bill.  It is important that all such salvage work is done in accordance with well established archaeological principles and under proper supervision.  The National Museum has a trained archaeologist who has now trained as a diver as well so that she will be able to supervise the work going on there.  Before the change of Government I made arrangements for moneys to be made available for the excavation work soon to begin off Streedagh.  I hope a considerable amount will have been done for the 400th anniversary of the Spanish Armada.  I hope also that in due course a museum will be established there.  It is important and conforms to current thinking, that when artefacts of this nature are found they should not all be taken to a national collection but, as in this case, a specialist Armada museum should be established near the site of the discovery.  I have been <Col N="1194" /> involved in this exercise.  I chaired an interdepartmental committee specifically involved in dealing with the Armada discovery. Previously there had been great neglect in this area.  Indeed, I might praise the work and dedication of that committee.  The provisions of this Bill will have a lasting benefit for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Another area being dealt with in the Bill is land under water.  We encountered potential difficulty in that area recently with the discovery of the Lough Kinale book shrine, a treasure which can rank among the six or seven greatest treasures in the National Museum collection.  It would rank alongside the Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch, the Cross of Cong or the Derrynaflan Chalice.  This book shrine was discovered in a lake on the Longford-Westmeath border.  But for the prompt action by the State on that occasion, we could have been embroiled in interminable legal proceedings about another of our great treasures.  The provisions of this Bill will help in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take a very keen look at the definition of land under water. I can easily foresee that, if the price were right, some people searching for such artefacts could engage in quick arterial drainage to ensure that what was land under water would suddenly become dry land.  This is an area warranting careful study and thought between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the sections of the Bill designed to counter the menace of metal detectors.  Undoubtedly rigid control is needed if we are to avoid further pillage and destruction of our national monuments by these predators. However, it should be put on record that there are honourable, decent people using metal detectors at present, people who regularly report their findings and deliver the products of those findings to the National Museum.  I might issue a warning, or an alert, in this area of licensing of metal detectors.  Archaeologists are excellent people but they can be overpossessive in this area.  I have often thought that great discoveries would be considered even greater had they been <Col N="1195" /> made by the archaeologists themselves.  I suspect that archaeologists will oppose the granting of metal detector licences to anybody except trained archaeologists, that is, themselves.  In other words, I suspect that an applicant will be asked to produce their degree at a Garda station before being granted a licence.  I am sounding that warning.  I agree that a metal detector should be used only by trained archaeologists in the vicinity of a national monument where excavation should be carried out in a systematic manner and where it is expected that valuable items may be found.</P>
    <P>However, there is another very involved provision in the Bill.  It will be an offence to be in possession of a metal detector without a licence where the purpose of having it there is to search for archaeological objects.  Furthermore, the Bill allows for presumption that the device was being used for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects, unless proved otherwise.  The implications of that are extraordinarily sweeping. For instance, the Lough Kinale book shrine which I mentioned earlier was probably found with the aid of some such device.  Are we to wait for the one archaeologist in the country, who can also dive, to search the lake beds of our country? Would a person operating in those areas with a metal detector or with some similar device be regarded as being beyond the law in those cases?  This is something that needs further evaluation between now and Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will give some indication of the kind of people he feels might qualify for a metal detector licence for archaeological purposes.  Perhaps he might consider two types of licence, one for operations in or near national monuments and the other for what I might call wild cat exploration.</P>
    <P>This Bill does a lot to strengthen our laws to protect our heritage but it does not do everything.  As the Minister said, it is an interim Bill.  He said there are certain matters before the courts and because of that the introduction of a comprehensive Bill is inhibited.  I do not <Col N="1196" /> believe in that kind of reasoning.  We are entitled to make our own laws.  If necessary we should take pre-emptive action rather than wait for the outcome of particular cases.  The whole area of the rights of ownership of recovered buried treasures on land or in water is a legal minefield, fully primed and with the exits barred by skilled lawyers doing their job for their clients.  I am absolutely convinced that what we really need is a provision in our Constitution, or an amendment to our Constitution, or a combination of both, with appropriate legislation that would put beyond all doubt and beyond all courts the State's total and absolute right to certain clearly defined recovered heritage objects.</P>
    <P>There is a certain ambiguity in regard to this matter.  We all saw the results of the treasure trove case in the High Court concerning possession of the Derrynaflan hoard.  We also saw the subsequent spectacle on television of a champagne celebration of that victory, the celebration of the confiscation of property which rightfully belongs to us.  Confiscation might be too strong a word because I am sure the people who were celebrating, if they got £5 million, would gladly hand it over to us for our own property.  The matter of the Derrynaflan treasure now goes to the Supreme Court and I know the State's legal experts are very confident of success.  However, I strongly believe that the only way to prevent further court cases in the future is by way of constitutional change.</P>
    <P>We had the discovery of the Lough Kinale book shrine which I mentioned earlier.  It was only the prompt action by the State, by myself, that prevented a repeat of the difficulty we had with the Derrynaflan hoard.  In that case an agreement was reached, in a very short period of time, with the people who found the Lough Kinale book shrine.  It was a harmonious and an equitable agreement and a reasonable payment was made.  Without attempting to make a pun, a water-tight arrangement was made as far as the legal elements were concerned.  There could have been a repeat of the Derrynaflan case.  We would have had the <Col N="1197" /> same legal embroilment were it not for the prompt action we took.  I was very involved in that action and I would like to pay tribute to the officers of the State who carried out the negotiations.  They are often criticised for reasons that may be the fault of their masters.</P>
    <P>There will be other discoveries.  With much more sophisticated search methods, licensed or unlicensed, we can expect many more discoveries in the years ahead.  Archaeologists believe that other great discoveries like the ones I have mentioned, the Derrynaflan hoard and the Lough Kinale book shrine, will be made on a fairly regular basis in the years ahead.  As sure as those discoveries are made the legal problems will follow unless we put these issues beyond all doubt through legislation such as this.  A change in the Constitution is essential.</P>
    <P>As I said, we should not wait for various cases to develop.  We should take pre-emptive action and we should take the initiative in this case.  The constitutional change I am talking about should have been sought by referendum on the same day as the referendum on the Single European Act.  It could have been very simple.  Much of the legal work has already been done in this respect.  A referendum on this matter could have been held for an extra £50,000 on top of what the coming referendum will cost.  We could put this matter to the people and I am sure the result would be an overwhelming 99.9 per cent &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to give the total and absolute right to recovered heritage treasures to the State.  That opportunity is now gone.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste clearly indicated that they believe it may be necessary to hold another referendum arising from the Supreme Court decision.  I urge very strongly that that occasion be availed of to deal with the State's right to recovered treasures.  I welcome this Bill as an interim measure, as described by the Minister.  It is a significant advancement and it deserves the support of everyone within the House and outside it.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill and I <Col N="1198" /> wish him well in his new appointment. The Bill before us proposes to amend and extend the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954 and to make further provision for the protection and preservation of national monuments.  The items included in the Bill are long overdue, especially the measures dealing with the use and possession of detection devices such as metal detectors.</P>
      <P>The Bill has excellent points: (a) provision for the protection and preservation of historic wrecks; (b) the establishment and maintenance of a register of historic monuments; (c) the setting up of a historic monuments council; and (d) penalties in the principal Act are increased and new penalties are to be introduced. Many of our national monuments have been damaged in the past few years.  The use of electronic detection devices has created many problems.  They have made it possible for amateurs to dig at random in places where there may or may not be articles of value from the past and tremendous damage has been done.</P>
      <P>One issue has come to light from all this and that is that the control of these electronic devices is a must.  This is well covered in the Bill.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill with regard to increased fines.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue my contribution on this very serious and most important social issue, I would like briefly to reiterate the Government's position in relation to this legislation.  We are most anxious that the Government's intentions be made perfectly clear so that there can be no misunderstanding in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agree in principle with the general thrust of this Private <Col N="1199" /> Members' Bill.  However, as I indicated in my contribution to the debate last night, I am of the view that, because of the complex constitutional issues surrounding the proposal, it would be more appropriate that legislation along the lines envisaged would be brought forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, and I have already been considering Deputy Desmond's Adoption Bill, 1986, and the various comments and submissions made following its publication last November.  I said last night that any legislation of such major significance to children and to families required the most careful consideration which, given sufficient time, can, I believe, best be provided by the full machinery of a Government Department and the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The position indeed, as stated in the House last night, is that a Bill had been prepared by Deputy Desmond when he was Minister for Health.  He had at the time the advice and guidance of experts in the Department and in the office of the Attorney General.  This is yet another reason that the Government of the day should steer the legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A valuable team of advisers with recent experience in the matter, is available to the Minister, and myself, in framing the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, last night, mentioned that there were a number of options which we were considering.  We will, of course, be availing of the expertise within the Department of Health and the Attorney General's office in taking decisions on the options to be included in the Government's Bill.  My comments are not intended in any way as a reflection on Deputy Shatter or on Private Members' time.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the contributions from all sides of the House to this debate will be of considerable value to us in framing appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>What I am saying, however, is that this legislation requires the most meticulous <Col N="1200" /> attention to detail and careful scrutiny by a number of legal, administrative and other experts before it can be assured of meeting the most strict criteria necessary if it is to be in accord with the relevant articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to some of the comments made in the House last night about the proposed legislation.  Deputy Harney referred to Deputy Shatter's Bill as cumbersome.  She cited the provision which suggests that the onus of proof of neglect by natural parents lies with the prospective adopters.  She also referred to the provision that a child should be resident with foster parents for at least a year and that it will be necessary for the High Court to be satisfied that failure on the part of the natural parents will continue until the child attains the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Deputy that the Bill, which attempts to achieve a long overdue social reform, has to embrace very complex conditions.  Deputy Shatter's Bill is, or course, in almost all respects identical to the Adoption Bill, 1986, which was introduced by the previous Government.  Sections 2 and 3, which contain the main provisions of the Bill, remain virtually unchanged.  I can assure Deputy Harney that having examined Deputy Desmond's Bill in detail I am now acutely aware of the many complex technical considerations which led to the final draft of the Bill as introduced in the previous Dáil.  These considerations sprang of course from the interpretation of the relevant articles of the Constitution in so far as they refer to the twin issues of the rights of the family and the natural rights of the child.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, had it been possible, that Deputy Desmond would have been more than happy to introduce a short Bill to allow for the adoption of legitimate children.  I can now fully appreciate, however, that this was not possible in the light of the constitutional considerations. In so far as the descriptions of &ldquo;complex&rdquo; and &ldquo;cumbersome&rdquo; apply, these are but a reflection of the intricacies of the Constitution in these vital areas.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Minister and I will be <Col N="1201" /> giving further thought to Deputy Desmond's Bill, we would envisage that the fundamental framework will remain intact for the very reasons I have outlined. We will indeed be considering whether the provisions need to be strengthened further to take account of the rights of the family as enshrined in our Constitution.  We will be doing this in close consultation with our own advisers and the legal advisers in the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the options under consideration by the Minister and myself, one to which the Minister referred last night and which I would like to touch on briefly in this contribution, is the option that health boards should be the applicants in each case taken under the proposed new legislation.  The suggestion that health boards would be most appropriate as applicants came from a number of individuals and organisations following the publication of Deputy Desmond's Adoption Bill, 1986.</P>
    <P>Some of the reasons given for proposing this amendment were as follows: It is very important, in the interests of good practice in foster care, that there should be a positive relationship between natural parents and foster parents.  Even where natural parents are no longer in contact with these children, foster parents should not assume a negative attitude to them.  It could be argued, however, that the provisions in both Adoption Bills already published might create an unnecessary adversarial scenario by virtue of the fact that foster parents would be making the appropriate applications to the High Court.  Deputy Harney, in her contribution last night, referred to this dilemma when she said that she was not in favour of the provision in Deputy Shatter's Bill which put the onus of proof on foster parents concerning the failure of natural parents.  As I have said, somewhat similar views were expressed in comments made following the publication of Deputy Desmond's Bill last year.</P>
    <P>A further point was also made which is that health boards are the primary agents involved in placing children in foster care. <Col N="1202" /> Such placements are, in fact, covered specifically by regulations made under the Health Act, 1953, which are known as the boarding out regulations.  Furthermore, in any case where legitimate children are taken into care by health boards, because, for example, of neglect or ill-treatment, there will have been intensive case work carried out by health board personnel over a considerable period of time.  In an exceptional case where it was considered that a child in such a situation might be the subject of an application for an adoption order, the case work would, of necessity, be very thorough.</P>
    <P>If the foster parents were to be the applicants to the High Court it would seem to follow that they would require to have the maximum amount of information covering the natural parents. Much of the information would in all probability be in the possession of the health board already.  I do not, however, consider that it would always necessarily be appropriate, or indeed desirable, no matter how meritorious the application, that all information in relation to the natural family should be made available to the foster parents.  This is one of a number of sensitive areas which, as I have said, the Minister and I will be considering in the context of our Adoption Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that I have taken note of the comments made in the House last night to the effect that health boards should not be in a position to veto applications by foster parents.  I have, in general, every confidence in the health boards in the discharge of their duties relating to child care.  Indeed, given the limited resources at their disposal in this area of the social services, they have in many instances, through their social worker staffs, made very impressive advances over recent years in the whole area of foster care and other forms of substitute care for deprived children. However, I have been considering whether in the interests of all the parties involved some additional appeal provisions might be appropriate.  I can assure the House that it is a further matter on <Col N="1203" /> which we will be consulting with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>One final point I would make is that in the event that health boards are the applicants the question of costs will not arise for the foster parents as the prospective adopters.  Deputy Shatter's Bill provides that the Adoption Board would be charged with meeting the full legal costs in cases which would arise under the proposed new legislation and in cases which arise under current adoption law and which are commonly referred to as section 3 cases, that is, section 3 of the 1974 Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>These latter cases arise where adoptive parents apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with the final consent of a natural parent or guardian of a child adoptable at present.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with this proposed new practice which would place the Adoption Board in a completely new position.  It would have implications for their unique and special status as an independent statutory authority with a central role in the whole adoption process.  The Minister and I will be discussing this issue with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure the House that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I intend in the coming months to devote time to considering in depth the recommendations of the Review Committee on Adoption Services which was referred to a number of times during the course of last night's debate.  As indicated in a reply to a Parliamentary Question last week, it will be our intention to introduce comprehensive legislation as soon as possible which would take account of many of the committee's recommendations.  We must, however, with the range of pressures on us from all fronts adhere to a priority list of legislative proposals in my Department.  It is the Government's intention at this time to introduce the first new adoption Bill as quickly as possible.  The Bill will encompass the main areas covered in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  There will be no undue delay on our part in ensuring that this is achieved at an early date.  When <Col N="1204" /> this legislation is brought forward we will be seeking the full support of the Oireachtas to have it passed as quickly as possible because we are very anxious to see it on the Statute Book.  The Minister, as already announced, intends to introduce a major new Children (Care and Protection) Bill which will update and extend the provisions of the 1908 Children Act.</P>
    <P>We will also be pursuing the necessary groundwork for a comprehensive adoption Bill as time permits.  As I stated last night, the Department are extremely busy and it is difficult to concentrate on the necessary legislation.  I assure Deputy Shatter and others interested in this legislation that it is our intention to put the Bill through as quickly as possible.  In the circumstances, the Bill should not be pursued at present because there are so many constitutional issues involved.  The right of the family is a fundamental part of the Constitution.  The adoption of legitimate children is a highly sensitive area and, therefore, it should have the full rigour of the Attorney General's office to decide on its merits from a constitutional point of view.  We do not want to see legislation of this kind held up in the Supreme Court and then perhaps found unconstitutional.  It would be preferable to have the Bill prepared by my Department and scrutinised by the Attorney General.  The wishes and views expressed on all sides of the House will be considered when the final draft is prepared and approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the genuine concern expressed here by Members of the House in relation to this area.  The future of many children will be affected by this legislation; we are their voice and the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I will give this matter a very careful and thorough examination with the approval of the Attorney General.  The former Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, realises how important it is to have legislation scrutinised by all sections of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that at <Col N="1205" /> long last a Bill dealing with these important and sensitive matters has come before the House.  I am told &mdash; I cannot guarantee the veracity of the statement &mdash; that no Private Member's Bill has been passed in this House since 1930.  Certainly, I cannot remember such a Bill being passed and it leads one to ask why we have provision for a Private Members' Bill if matters which are totally non-political, of a non-party political nature not affecting a huge political vested interest or lobby groups, cannot be dealt with by the House and not by the Government.</P>
      <P>One of the main causes of the problems besetting the country is that the Government take on too much.  They must do everything and that was the thrust of what the Minister for Health said in his extraordinarily brief contribution yesterday. He treated this House and the subject to five minutes of contempt.  His Minister of State has spoken at greater length but in a repetitive manner.  He repeated that we should leave this matter to the Government because it needed the rigorous attention of the Department of Health and the office of the Attorney General.  However, later on in the speech he said that the Bill is the same, more or less, as that which came before the House last November from the Department of Health and the office of the Attorney General.  Presumably, it had already been given rigorous consideration by the Department of Health, the parliamentary draftsman in the office of the Attorney General and then by the legal side in the Attorney General's office. That is the procedure which has to be gone through before Bills are introduced in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister of State contradicting himself?  Why will the Government not admit that this is an issue affecting a very small, politically insignificant, group?  They are a voiceless group with nobody to represent their interests and they have been in Limbo in orphanages for years.  There are hundreds of children who, if we delay much longer, will be too old to be adopted. Many children have been denied, by the <Col N="1206" /> lack of attention to this matter, the comfort and safety of a secure and loving home.  There is no reason for further delay.  As consideration has already been given to this matter by the Department of Health and the Attorney General's office, it is clear there is agreement in principle on the Bill from all sides of the House.  Second Stage is about agreement in principle with the main objectives of a Bill.  Why not pass Second Stage and proceed to Committee Stage where the detailed attention to which the Minister and the Minister of State referred can and will be given so that all the very important and sensitive issues will receive microscopic attention.  That is how we should proceed.  If we have to wait for another Bill, clearly we will not have it before the House this side of the summer recess.  When the House resumes after the summer recess, there will only be a seven week session to the Christmas recess.  Are we going to have the Bill before Christmas?  In the New Year, we will have the budget debate.  That is how matters of great importance to a small number of people can be delayed for years and years.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that we have allowed this matter to be delayed so long.  As Deputy Shatter has pointed out, we are the only country in the EC who do not make provision for the matters now proposed in this Bill.  I plead with the Minister to forget the out-of-date practices of this House in matters of this kind.  There is no need for legislation on matters of social concern and on which there is general agreement to be sponsored by the Government.  In fact, a great case can be made to encourage more and more Private Members' Bills on important but non-contentious issues of this kind not only from the Opposition benches but also from the Government backbenches. There is a great need to involve more Members of this House in its legislative and parliamentary practices.  The days should be gone when a Minister feels he has to sponsor every Bill affecting areas covered by his Department, to defend every dot and comma of such Bills and to <Col N="1207" /> allow for no improvement on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me not to accept that the subject matters of the Bill before us are ones of great sensitivity affecting very basic rights and issues.  I agree that we should go to great lengths to avoid making errors but if we should err we should err on the side of the defenceless child.  We adults can speak for ourselves but there is no one to speak for the child or to represent his interests.  During the past 20 years I have had a great deal to do with two orphanages and I have admired the wonderful work which has been done in those institutions by the religious orders and staffs concerned.  It is right that we should compliment the health boards also for their work in this area.</P>
    <P>It has grieved me all those years to see those orphanages peopled by innocent children.  It has grieved me to see prospective adoptive parents, their names on long waiting lists, waiting to adopt children and being denied the opportunity because of the lack of children to adopt.  It has grieved me to see young children growing into older children and older children growing into adulthood having spent all their lives unnecessarily in institutions.  That is because the Oireachtas has failed to legislate for the matters this Bill seeks to legislate for. This is urgent legislation.  If we do not enact it speedily more young children will grow into older children and more older children will grow into adults and still be in institutions while we languish in old, irrelevant and uncaring ways.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to break away from the old ways and be the first to grasp new ways, to say that this Bill is urgently needed, that he fully agrees with its principles and that we can trash out any differences in detail on Committee Stage.  If he takes this attitude there are a couple of thousand young children in orphanages at present who will be eternally grateful to him and there will be many more thousands of young children in the future who will not even know that they have cause to be thankful to him as they will not <Col N="1208" /> have to languish in orphanages but will have access to the comfort, security and happiness of loving and caring homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Shatter for drafting this Adoption Bill and for the contribution he has made on this most important issue.  Also, it is only fair that I pay tribute to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, for introducing an Adoption Bill in November 1986.  Unfortunately, that Bill lapsed when the Dáil was dissolved.  The Minister's approach is reasonable and correct. While I appreciate what Deputy Mitchell had to say, it is an interesting statistic that the last time a Private Members' Bill was successful was in 1930. In my short experience of the workings of this Dáil and having watched the constitutional problems which have already faced this Dáil, I feel that this approach is correct.</P>
      <P>The principal concern of this House is, no doubt, the bar on legitimate children being adopted.  So far as I am aware, we are the only country in Western Europe where this position prevails.  I have been impressed by some of the positive developments in the adoption services in recent years, in particular, the transfer of responsibilities in this area from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health in 1983.  That was a positive and correct development.  The review of the adoption services initiated by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, was a very positive move and the review committee recommended the adoption of legitimate children.  I would like to see these positive developments being extended.  While we must always be concerned with and aware of the needs of childless couples and of the rights of unmarried mothers in legislation which comes before this House we must place particular emphasis on the needs of the child.  The adoption services and others have also made this point.  It is a good one.  We must introduce child-centred legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill is almost identical to the Bill introduced by the previous <Col N="1209" /> Government but the Minister for Health, has already suggested one change which might be made in relation to the procedure for applying for an adoption order so it is obvious that there are differences in this Government's approach.</P>
    <P>The two Bills already published provide that the foster parents with whom a child has been living for a continuous period or for at least one year could apply for the necessary order for his adoption. The Minister said he believed it would be more appropriate if the health boards were the applicants in every case.  I would be inclined to agree with his viewpoint. It is appropriate that the Government introduce the Bill without delay.  I wish to put on the record of this House my own sincere anxiety that there be no delay in bringing forward a new Bill.  I accept the assurance given by Minister's yesterday that there will be no undue delay in bringing appropriate legislation before this House.</P>
    <P>It is an important constitutional matter and the Bill must be carefully drafted.  I am aware that many submissions have been forwarded to the Department of Health on the former Minister's Bill.  The Minister will obviously take account of these.  The Government agree in principle with the main provisions of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  Members of this House will accept that a considerable number of children are being deprived of the opportunity to be adopted because they are legitimate, as Deputy Mitchell has quite rightly pointed out.  Whether they are children in long term foster care, in residential care, or foundlings &mdash; in other words, children who were simply found on the street &mdash; these children will not thank us if we do not legislate quickly to accommodate their human needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government Bill will be tested constitutionally in the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution, as suggested yesterday by Deputy Shatter.  Since becoming a Member of this Dáil, I have noted the continuous reference in the House to the Constitution.  It could be said that it has become essential bedtime reading for <Col N="1210" /> Members; I have seen many copies of the Constitution around the House being referred to continously and quite rightly so.  One shudders at the consequences of an adoption that is not legally watertight. It would obviously be shattering for adopted children and their new parents if it were found that the adoption process was unconstitutional.  In any case, the review committee on the adoption services recommended this course.</P>
    <P>Over 34,000 children have been adopted since the first Adoption Act in 1952.  I urge the continuous development of family support services which would prevent or diminish the need for parents to part with their children.  I should like to acknowledge the work of Dublin County Council housing department, of which I am a member, and that of the Eastern Health Board.  I acknowledge the support they give unmarried mothers in housing estates.  Recently they established a back-up service in the new council housing estates.  In Ballyboden, where there are 900 county council houses and in a new housing estate, the Eastern Health Board have allocated one house in which they can advise young parents on child care and provide much needed play school facilities.  They are there as a very important back-up service at all times.  This is important for young married couples and single parent families.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing reduction in the numbers of adoption applications as indicated in the Adoption Board report.  This reflects the continuous decline in the number of children being given up for adoption.  Nevertheless, there are legitimate children who have been abandoned or ill-treated, children whose parents are unfit to care for them.  The Government have stated that they agree in principle with the proposal to provide for the adoption of legitimate children in exceptional circumstances.  It should be carefully drafted with, I stress, the back-up of State services to accord with the Constitution. This is a reasonable approach and in thanking Deputy Shatter for his contribution to this debate I ask him to accept that the Minister will bring a new Bill before the House without delay and also <Col N="1211" /> to accept that this is the correct approach to this most important area of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said with much truth that silent suffering evokes little sympathy in our time in our society. This statement is especially apposite when applied to the issue of adoption. Because of our difficulty as a people in dealing with adoption in the past, a great deal of suffering has been caused to the people involved, the children, the natural parents, the adoptive parents but, above all, to the children.  In short, because of our inabilty as a people and a society to confront this question, we have been responsible for much unnecessary suffering, hardship and injustice.  It is for these and many more reasons that I support the Private Members' Bill brought before the House by Deputy Shatter. Indeed, I would go further and say that not only is this Bill long overdue but it is an attempt to come to terms with an issue which has been a problem in our society for a very long time.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been influenced and informed by a good deal of compassion and intelligence.  It could be said that it is an indictment of and a reflection on successive Governments who have failed to come to terms with the need to introduce a civilised adoption code.  In my philosophy a child is a child for all that, to paraphrase Robert Burns.  This viewpoint should influence and inform the thinking and policies of all parties and politicians in dealing with the issue of adoption. Such an attitude permeates this Bill.  Our record in this field is not a good one; indeed, we have much to be ashamed of in our refusal to deal with this issue in a constructive and comprehensive way.  We have adopted a piecemeal, cautious and cowardly attitude to it.  Despite the noble, high sounding and even grandiose claims made in our Constitution about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, we have failed dismally children who have not been able to speak and act for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I speak of the contents of the Bill, I should like to look briefly over the <Col N="1212" /> past 35 years and our efforts as a people to put into place adoption laws.  Adoption legislation was first enacted here in 1952 and it provided for the adoption generally of children born out of wedlock and of orphaned children.  The only legitimate children who can be adopted currently are orphans.  Consequently, if a married couple abandon their children and if they are taken into care due to the parents' total incapacity to look after them, even when such a couple cease to have any contact with the children and fail to support them or even inquire after them, they cannot be adopted under our present legislation.  It is sad to note that Ireland was the last country in these islands to provide for legal adoption.  The provision of adoption laws was originally opposed on the basis that to permit the adoption of children born out of wedlock would lead to promiscuity and that to permit the adoption of legitimate children would encourage married couples to have children for the purpose of selling them.  It was also suggested that the adoption of such children was contrary to Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is much more that I could say but I promised to be brief to allow Deputy McDowell to follow me.  I am not too impressed with what has been said by Ministers and others who have spoken on behalf of the Government.  Deputy Shatter's address covered many of the points made by these speakers.  There is an element in the attitude of the Ministers and other speakers of playing for time and kicking for touch.  It has been said in the course of the debate that the Government Bill would improve on Deputy Shatter's Bill and Deputy Leyden, the Minister of State, today said that same thing.  It is said to be a very sensitive area which needs time for the bringing in of a proper Bill.  We have had all this before in the past 35 years and I for one am not taken in by that.  There has been ample time for the Fianna Fáil Party in Government and the Coalition to bring legislation before this House.</P>
    <P>The Government have been influenced in their attitude by that of the previous Government and of Deputy Desmond.  I <Col N="1213" /> am not impressed at all by the delaying tactics of the Government.  This Bill is before this House and should be given a good passage through it.  It should not be thwarted by pernickety and dishonest arguments.  It should not be distorted by anything that is happening outside.  It is not generally known that a foundling infant left in a basket in a doorway cannot be adopted if it cannot be established that such a baby was born out of wedlock. That is nonsense and it reflects on us as a people that we should allow such nonsense to influence our attitudes to adoption.</P>
    <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's reply to the debate.  If we are foolish enough to allow this Bill to be put on the sideline it will be a long time before a similar Bill is introduced because I do not think it would get the urgent attention it deserves by the Government.  The Minister of State said that this is a sensitive area.  Of course it is a sensitive area but this is no reason for running away from it.  Many sensitive areas in our society have been run away from in the past by various Governments.  It is all the more reason to deal with it because it is sensitive. I urge the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government to pass this important Bill.  It deals with a problem that will not go away.  In many parts of our society there are people who cannot speak for themselves, who have no clout and who do not represent vested interests.  Sadly for all of us vested interests have ruled our society for a very long time.</P>
    <P>As a lone Deputy in this House I support this Private Members' Bill.  It is a very compassionate and civilised response to a problem which has existed in our society for a very long time.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter on his initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  It is a genuine attempt by him to close up the gaps which have appeared in the area of adoption during the last number of years.  It is a well structured Bill dealing with the extension of categories of children who may be adopted, the making of the necessary <Col N="1214" /> changes to take into account the recent decision in T.O'G.<i>v.</i> the Attorney General and Others and the recent Age of Majority Act.</P>
      <P>This country was slow, in comparison with other western countries, in bringing in adoption laws.  The Adoption Act, 1952, was the first piece of legislation in this regard.  It has been amended on a number of occasions to take into account the problems which have arisen from time to time.  All in all the adoption laws, taken together, have served this country very well.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four thousand children have been adopted since 1952.  I should say at this juncture that great credit must go to the various agencies involved in the adoption system whether they be health board, religious or voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>Articles 41 and 42 of the Irish Constitution deal with the family and education, respectively.  Articles 41.1.1º states:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>Article 42.1 states:</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
      <P>These Articles form the whole basis of the family and parents in society.  Article 42.5 states:</P>
      <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis during the last number of years has changed from the position that <Col N="1215" /> adoption was a means to provide a childless couple with children around to the view that it was a means to provide a child who has no parents or whose parents have neglected it with a proper family to grow up in.</P>
    <P>We hear much about the phrase that the &ldquo;interests of the child are paramount.&rdquo; This phrase has become the norm in legislation dealing with children during the last number of years.  It is important that this trend continues, bearing in mind that the natural parents also have rights.  The report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services which was published in 1984 recommended that all children should be eligible for adoption irrespective of their parents' marital status.  They also made a number of other suggestions which are not in this Bill.  The Minister in his speech stated that there were a number of other areas which he would like to examine before he would bring forward a Government-sponsored Bill.  I ask him to look very carefully at the recommendations of this report because it is quite detailed and goes into the various aspects of adoption.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presented clearly shows that it has the best interests of the child in mind.  It proposes to allow a child who has been permanently abandoned or a child who has been neglected by its parents to be legally adopted.  At present these children have no chance of living a normal life: they are destined to be institutionalised for the rest of their minority. Surely this latter situation is not in the best interests of the child.  All efforts should be made to change it.  Efforts have been made during the last number of years to change this but these have failed for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this type of legislation might be contrary to the Constitution.  I do not agree with this. Article 42.5 of the Constitution deals with this.  It does not make any distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children. In the case of G. <i>v</i>.  An Bord Uch-tála, Justice Walsh confirms that legislation allowing for the adoption of a <Col N="1216" /> child would not be contrary to the Constitution provided the natural parents, for physical or moral reasons, decide to abandon their position as parents.  Why then should there be a distinction whether children are legitimate or illegitimate?</P>
    <P>Justice Walsh also referred to the fact that guardianship laws allow a member of a family to pass out of that family.  I note that Deputy Shatter has suggested that if this Bill is to be passed into law it should be examined by the Supreme Court as to its constitutionality.  I agree with this because it is important that whatever law is passed, whether it be Government or Private Members, that it be copperfastened into our legal code so that there would be no bad cases coming before our courts.  Such cases are not in the best interests of the child and also not in the best interests of the parents.</P>
    <P>This Bill as presented to the House is not detailed enough to prevent a situation which could arise whereby the parents knowing full well that this legislation is in being could indulge in collusion with proposed adoptive parents so as to feign neglect and abandonment.  The Bill further erodes the concept of free consent of parents, a process which was first started in 1974.  There is a very thin line between the best interests of the child and the rights of the parents.  We would not want to go too far over to one side of the line.  While the child's interests must be the paramount consideration, we must also bear in mind the anguish that has been experienced by natural parents over the years in the placing of their children for adoption.  I can foresee, if the Bill is accepted, hearings before the High Court with the natural parents being brought before it in frightening circumstances to give evidence.  I have come across cases, mainly in the area of guardianship, where mothers have fought hard to keep their children rather than have them institutionalised by a health board or fostered out.  Will that type of scene be the norm after the passing of this legislation?</P>
    <P>I do not think there is enough regard in the Bill for the rights of natural parents.  An official who feels that a child <Col N="1217" /> is being neglected could push through an adoption order.  That may turn out to be a travesty of justice and because of that we should proceed with great caution. The Bill seeks to take care of the problem that has arisen out of a recent decision of the High Court in the case of T. O'G <i>v.</i> The Attorney General and others.  In that case a couple obtained custody of a child expecting to get an adoption order once the mother's consent was granted but before the adoption order was made the wife died and the plaintiff &mdash; the husband, as a childless widower &mdash; was no longer a person who could get an adoption order despite the fact that all evidence showed that he would have been a very good parent.  It was held in the High Court that ineligibility of a childless widower to adopt a child already in his custody was unreasonable and unjust and that the proviso in section 5 (1) of the Adoption Act, 1974, was repugnant to Article 40.1ºd of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill before us provides for the required changes to take into account the court's opinion.  I do not think anybody can argue with that change.  The rationale behind section 9 is to be applauded.  The effect may have far-reaching consequences particularly in view of the tight budgetary position we are in.  We have often heard of ambulance chasers in America, and I wonder if we will have adoption chasers if this section is adopted.  It may be that the best way to deal with this would be to leave it to the court to decide the issue.  The section would have the effect of giving free legal aid to prospective adoptive parents in particular situations and I have no doubt that the Government will want to examine that closely.</P>
    <P>Primarily, because of the implications of the Bill in regard to the extension of the categories of children who may be legally adopted, we should have a more indepth look at the whole area.  I suggest to Deputy Shatter that he withdraw his Bill and allow the Government to bring in a more comprehensive Bill taking into account some more of the recommendations in the report on the adoption services.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in calling on the House to support the Bill. I should like to compliment Deputy Shatter for bringing it before us and for his work in this field.  He has been committed to this area for a long period.  The Minister of State suggested that Deputy Shatter, and his party, might wish to reconsider the Bill but I suggest to him, and the Minister for Health, that they should reconsider their position in view of the fact that there is a unique consensus in regard to it.  It appears that a majority of Members are in favour of the Bill.  A sizeable body of opinion has been clamouring for this reform since a consensus developed in 1980.  Groups such as the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, St. Anne's Adoption Society, the Association of Workers with Children in Care, the Irish Fostercare Association and the Adoptive Parents Association since 1980 have consistently sought to have this reform implemented.  Those groups have indicated that it is unacceptable that children should be deprived of the right of being part of a stable family or should be neglected after they have been abandoned by their natural parents.  That principle has been accepted in the House.</P>
      <P>A lot of work remains to be done in the area of adoption.  Deputy Shatter is seeking to focus on a small area in a comprehensive and intelligent piece of legislation.  His attempt to deal with it in a compassionate fashion deserves the support of the House.  We should not play games with this issue and I appeal to the Minister not to abide by the sad and often irrelevant traditions of the House that lead us into disrepute with the public.  In many cases this is an initiative he should accept and we should move to Committee Stage where further improvements can be made.  The position is very bad and must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State told us that there are, unfortunately, and will continue to be unhappy, abused and neglected children from inadequate and broken families with multiple problems and I took it that in that statement he was referring to <Col N="1219" /> the need for short term care.  The Minister should follow the care he has expressed through to its conclusion and allow us to act now.  I am perturbed by the impression he has given about the way he proposes to deal with this matter. I understand that in the first week of the new Dáil Deputy Shatter asked if it was the Minister's intention to reintroduce the Bill produced by the Department of Health under Deputy Desmond and that the answer given on that occasion was in the negative.  Why did the Minister decide not to proceed with that Bill which was a product of the Department of Health?  Had he adopted that measure there would not be any need for us to table the Bill before the House.  I wonder what great knowledge has emerged in the past three months that will be incorporated in the next Bill.  It is my belief that the Minister does not appreciate the urgency of this matter.  Tonight the Minister of State asked us to appreciate that the Government had to deal with terribly pressing problems and were up to their necks in dealing with cutbacks and so on. He gave the impression that he did not want us to expect him to give too much time to this issue.</P>
    <P>The reply given by the Minister to a question by Deputy Shatter on 30 April indicated that he had no sense of urgency about this matter.  After the Bill was published the Minister said he intended in the coming months to study carefully the changes in the present adoption laws proposed by the review committee with a view to introducing appropriate amending legislation.  With all due respect the report of the review body was available since 1984 and I am sure that in Opposition the Minister's party gave consideration to social legislation and to this area.  If the Minister is commencing his study now, and if it took the Department two years to study the matter, the indications are that we will not see any Government legislation in the near future.  The Minister has also indicated that his Department will be tied up with other matters for a long time.  The whole <Col N="1220" /> area of children's law has not been legislated on in any substantial fashion since 1908.  Since 1982 the Department have been struggling with the Children Bill.  It was originally intended to be a single comprehensive Bill to deal with all areas under the care of the Department of Health but it has emerged in two tiny snippets, namely, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1986, and the Adoption Bill, 1986.  This indicates that the task of carrying out reform in children's legislation, without taking from the excellence and commitment of the staff, is too much for a Department who are hard-pressed in supervising, managing and overlooking an enormous health service. Indeed they need help and if help is forthcoming from those on the backbenches, the middle benchers and the front benchers of this House it should be accepted. There should be more avenues for using those talents constructively.</P>
    <P>When I was a junior Minister in the Department of Health for a brief six months in 1981-82 I was in the unique position of being given direct responsibility for the children's area.  I was able to meet twice weekly, or even more often, with the officials in the children's section.  At that stage in this House I indicated there would be a Children Bill before this House in the following session which would include all the areas of concern. I believe that could have been done but I do not believe it can be achieved in a Department without some concentration on the area involved.  Indeed, in any further reorganisation of responsibilities this matter should be given priority because it is quite clear that without concentration, without somebody specialising in it, nothing will happen other than in a piecemeal and unsatisfactory fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems in legislating adequately in this area to protect the children of this nation and to give them the legal supports which they need is our Constitution.  I am keen to see this issue resolved openly.  If this Bill goes to the Supreme Court and it is found that we need a referendum I would be pleased to have a referendum which would, for once and for all, establish the rights of children <Col N="1221" /> in our society.  This would ensure we would not have, as happened when dealing with the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1986, a watered-down Bill. In the end it achieved very little of what we set out to do which was to ensure that children's rights and welfare were legislated for adequately.  By this I mean welfare in the broadest sense and a proper environment in which they can develop and grow as full human beings intellectually, emotionally and socially. The odds are against unfortunate children in our society as a result of the inadequacies of our laws.  This is one glaring example and we have shown no ability to deal with it.  It is not the Minister's responsibility &mdash; that responsibility goes back to the previous Government as well &mdash; but the indications from the Minister of State in his speech tonight are that we have more important matters to deal with at present and we should not expect this matter to be given much time.  That is the attitude and the reality because of the demands on the Department.  Therefore, I suggest we make this small step.  I would argue that the Minister of State could do this and continue to work towards the further improvements which are required.  During the election campaign we were lobbied &mdash; as I am sure the Minister was also lobbied &mdash; by the Adoptive Parents' Association to ensure that the Adoption Bill, 1986, would return to the Order Paper.  Those most concerned were anxious when the Dáil resumed after whatever changes might take place that the Bill would remain on the Order Paper.  That Bill is necessary but it is quite narrow.</P>
    <P>In 1980-81 following a review, Father John O'Mahony who was secretary to St. Anne's Adoption Society at the time, made a submission which went to the review body and was taken into account. In it he said:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but there are a considerable number of children in the care of the State, either in institutions or in foster homes, who could benefit considerably from adoption if it was legally possible to have them adopted. <Col N="1222" /> Such a proposal tends to be resisted as it appears to be taking children away from their parents, but the question has to be asked, have these children anything more, in some cases, than parents in name.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, may know, in many cases the parents may not be in this country, or may not have seen their children for many years.  Yet, we continue to argue for their rights over the needs of the abandoned child.  We are failing to act.  The Minister appears to be indicating he will continue to refuse this opportunity to act in this most major area of reform for children in need.  I will quote further from Fr. O'Mahony's contribution where he talks about children who have what is termed; &ldquo;no meaningful contact with their parents and are unlikely to have such for their whole childhood and adolescent life&rdquo;.  He states:</P>
    <P>It must surely be wrong that parents have such absolute control over their children that they can prevent anybody providing the children with a family life.  It must also be said that if the concept of illegitimacy is abolished&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is another issue we are waiting to deal with and it must also be dealt with in the adoption area.  If children are to be treated equally in this one area, it is the children who are currently defined as legitimate who are being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and fathers are given equal rights, the numbers of such children in the care of the State will grow considerably unless there is a legal means of dealing with such consenting parents.</P>
    <P>Fr. O'Mahony further indicates that when he carried out a survey on behalf of the Federation, he got case histories from social workers of children who had spend their whole life in care and who had never seen their parents, but under no circumstances, would these same natural parents allow the foster parents rearing these children to legally adopt them.</P>
    <P>Those points cover a couple of areas <Col N="1223" /> but it indicates the great level of need there is and this Bill deals with that narrow area.  If the Minister is concerned about the area of adoption, this Bill could be allowed to go through and still have years of work to do in the adoption area. Based on the findings of the review committee there remains a great many decisions to be taken in the adoption area.  I suggest the Minister should let this Bill go through and get on with the very valuable work that needs to be done. Do not have it that the next stages of that reform will take place from the backbenches of the House.  The Minister should let it go through and encourage and support it and work with it.  What is really important is that the laws should be reformed in the way that is required.</P>
    <P>The issues that still have to be considered in the area of adoption and the areas on which the Department can concentrate knowing that this Bill on which there is a clear agreement in principle is going through the House, are who may adopt, and one element of that, the problem of widowers, is dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, there are other persons who may have unique relationships with children, and who, if the principle of the welfare of the child is to be the guiding principle of all children's legislation might, though not falling within the category of relative, be the correct person to be the adoptive parent.  That is a whole area to be considered.  It is something that the Department could usefully spend time considering rather than trying simply to outmanoeuvre the Opposition and delay the legislation for months longer, which is clearly the implication of turning down this Bill tonight or next week.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with the machinery of adoption and that whole area is a minefield which needs to be examined.  There are many submissions with the Department, many of which were heard by the review body, about the slow, cumbersome, repetitive nature of adoption procedures.  There is anachronism that one society has entirely <Col N="1224" /> different rules from the other and if you have contacts you may do better than if you have not.  It is an area of conflict and confusion.  There is a major need to look at that area to try to bring into it some coherence and fairness in relation to parents.</P>
    <P>There is also the very important matter of the need for information about natural parents both by the adopted person and by the adoptive parents.  Developments are taking place in this regard which could do with legislative support.  Information about the natural parents has become crucial in relation to medical history. Decisions on whether a child should be given various injections, which may have a bearing on whether they live or die at a future stage, must be made without adequate information about the natural parents.  At a minimum there should be an obligation on adoption societies to have medical records.  That sort of thing is being done more and more but it depends on the way the adoption societies approach the matter.  This is entirely unsatisfactory and must be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is the very difficult issue of how much information young people who have been adopted should be entitled to and how to balance the right to privacy of the natural parents in that situation. Where adoptions are successful this is less important to the adopted child but where they are not successful it can mean a great deal to the happiness and security of the adopted person if he or she can explore the possibility of developing a relationship with the natural parents. There is also the whole question of birth certificates and whether there should be access to the full information.  All of this work remains to be done in the adoption area.  In view of the fact that so many major reforms will have to be dealt with, I find it difficult to understand why this Bill might not be allowed go forward to Committee Stage.  The issue of constitutionality must be faced.  I believe the people would respect the rights of children to proper care and a proper home environment and would vote for that in a referendum, if required.  More and more our Constitution is tripping us up and we <Col N="1225" /> must have it corrected by referendum almost each year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the welfare of the child is the primary consideration in this Bill.  I firmly support this principle and strongly believe that the whole emphasis in our Constitution and our legislation is seriously defective in achieving a balance between parents' and children's rights.  It goes overboard in favour of the parents and children are sacrificed in many ways throughout our society as a result.  I do not see it as a matter related to religion or to constitutional law.  It relates to the needs and rights of children. It is a matter we will have to address otherwise, legislation dealing with children will barely touch the essential problems children face.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with major areas, all of which I would be happy to support. Certain people have expressed reservations about details but we could deal with these on Committee Stage.  Section 5 deals with the important matter of the adoption of older children.  Children in this category are becoming more and more available for foster care and a special scheme is being run for them. Clearly it is desirable in the long term that they should have the option of a stable home with adoptive parents.  The provision allowing a widower to adopt is clearly an improvement of the scheme. The improvements regarding costs are also welcome.  The setting out of the arguments in relation to the constitutional issue is welcome.  I support entirely the interpretation referred to by Deputy Ahern and Deputy Shatter.  They referred to Mr. Justice Walsh's judgment, which could be interpreted as indicating that there is a duty on the State pursuant to Article 42.5 to provide for parental care for children where the natural parents have failed to provide that care.  Although we are not dealing with it here, we would all agree that the ideal situation is that children are cared for in a natural family environment.  We are talking about exceptional cases which have been clearly specified &mdash; cases of need and abandonment.  Nobody should <Col N="1226" /> oppose moves to deal with these problems. I believe the issue should be dealt with along the lines set out in the Bill before us.  The other issues I would commend to the Minister's attention are decisions about persons who may adopt, the adoption processes and the question of information.  The Minister might discuss with his colleagues in the Department of Justice the question of family courts.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to make a particular plea for reforms which will recognise the need of adoptive parents to have a certain amount of leave from work at the point where they take on the care of an adopted child.  Parents who have none of the psychological preparation which natural parents have during the nine months pregnancy are suddenly landed with an infant.  They have had very little training and have not been given classes in a maternity hospital in how to change nappies and so on.  They have to cope with it all from scratch.  The six weeks' post-natal leave which is available for natural parents should be available for adoptive parents.  This is something which could usefully be taken up by another Department.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the pressure his Department are under in trying to deal with legislation of this scope.  If the Minister were to go outside to seek expert help he might go to somebody like Deputy Shatter.  In that context he could usefully trust this House to allow this Bill to go through Second Stage and not to oppose it.  I am satisfied that it has the support of the majority in this House from indications of support since its publication and during the debate.  In that context he would be wise and democratic to proceed to Committee Stage, to initiate such amendments as he sees appropriate and to allow the Members of this House to participate fully in seeing this Bill passed in this House and allowing children who up to now have had no opportunity to have a permanent family home to have that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lawlor for making time available to me to speak <Col N="1227" /> on this Bill.  At the outset I join with other Deputies in complimenting Deputy Shatter for bringing this Bill before the House but I do not want to do so in an empty way as was done by each of the Government speakers.  I believe this is an extremely well thought out Bill which has already gone through the process of honing and refinement which many Bills introduced in Private Members' Time have not gone through.  It has already been produced in major part by a Government Department in the term of the previous Dáil.  It has had useful additions made to it by a person of Deputy Shatter's intelligence and experience in this area which are worthwhile changes to the previous Government's Bill.  No feature of this Bill gives rise to major anxiety.</P>
      <P>I turn then to the attitude betokened by the Minister's response yesterday.  As a Deputy of only a few weeks' standing in this House I wondered what his reaction would be when he came in to speak after Deputy Shatter had opened the debate. It seemed to me that there was no logical basis on which any person who was in broad agreement with the principles of this Bill &mdash; as I think nearly everybody in this House is &mdash; could say it should not be proceeded with now.  To my disappointment, having gone through the few statutory compliments to Deputy Shatter, the Minister disgraced himself by suggesting that there were some problems with the Bill, none of which he could articulate or define at all.  That was what worried me.  He was willing to stand up in this House and make vague reference to difficulties, none of which he was willing to outline either because the advisers who prepared his script for him were not willing to articulate them or because he was not sure he accepted those reservations himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with a proponent of a Bill who had the experience and intelligence to meet any reservations, if the Minister genuinely entertained them, all he could do was put up a smoke screen of ifs and buts which meant nothing when I heard them delivered and some of which left <Col N="1228" /> me boggle-eyed.  Although I have not the same experience of family law as Deputy Shatter has, I have spent a few years as a practising lawyer.  Some of the remarks the Minister made yesterday demonstrated a degree of legal confusion which I found bewildering.  I could not follow them, and I should have been able to follow them.</P>
    <P>The Minister came up with a very remarkable suggestion which should not be a reason for rejecting this Bill on Second Stage which was that the Department had been throwing around the idea amongst themselves apparently and had convinced the Minister, not that it was a good idea but that it might be a good idea, and therefore nothing should be done until he was convinced to the contrary. The suggestion was that an application to adopt a legitimate child should be made by a health board rather than by the couple concerned.  That is a remarkable suggestion because, stripped of all the nonsense that the Minister spoke, with all due respect to him, it means that it is not for a would-be pair of adopters to persuade the High Court that they are suitable people and that it is in the child's interests to be adopted. First of all they must go through a court of first instance, that is, an anonymous health board official or committee.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain, having listened to the Minister yesterday, that he suggested that all applications should come from a health board.  That means that if the health board do not agree, no application at all occurs.  Therefore, if the would-be adopters cannot persuade a nameless official, a statutory body with no character or responsibility at all in the issue, of the rights of their case they fail <i>ad limina.</i> They can go no further with their proposal to adopt a child and to offer that child a home.  That is a silly point for the Minister to bring up.  It is based on what I can only say is totally misguided advice. I do not mean any insult or injury to the people involved, but only a bureaucrat of many years' standing could come up with that suggestion as an objection to Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>

I do not believe it was written into the Fianna Fáil programme that only health boards should be allowed to make these kinds of applications.  I am surprised that the Minister has in his own ingenuity thought up this peculiar objection to Deputy Shatter's Bill.  Irrespective of whether the convention of the House is forcing me to make an error in this matter, if that is a legitimate change to make in this Bill there is what is called Committee Stage.  When we are not discussing high points of constitutional law we are supposed to consider reasoned amendments and even foolish amendments such as the Minister is apparently minded to bring if the matter goes to Committee Stage, and that is the time to deal with that kind of point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Desmond addressing the House on this Bill made a very good point that, with the best will in the world, if the Minister has not yet had a Bill prepared no Bill will be ready <Col N="1230" /> in 1987 and it will be well into 1988 before any Bill can be produced even if the Minister has the wording of a Bill now in contemplation.  It seems that the words Deputy Mitchell spoke here about the urgency of this matter and the suffering it is designed to obviate and end are falling on very deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The law on adoption has been characterised by extreme conservatism.  A good deal of it has been religious conservatism arising from religious worry as to the implications of adoption laws.  The wording of the Constitution which places so much emphasis on the family should at least be turned on those who use it as a conservative weapon on this occasion.  If the family is so important, if it is the basic unit group of society, a moral institution with inalienable and imprescriptible rights, then why, oh why, are we denying membership of such a valuable and important institution to children who through no fault of their own are cast into orphanages?  Why, if it is all that important, do we suddenly say that some people will be excluded from it through no fault of their own?</P>
    <P>A great deal of humbug is spoken on this and much humbug has been spoken on it tonight.  All the epithets and plaudits given to Deputy Shatter are shallow and hollow because there is no real determination to put through a Bill on this matter.  There is a determined effort to stamp on this Dáil the disgraceful attitude that Opposition TDs have no business in bringing valuable legislation before this House and to force us into the position other Deputies often occupied in the past, that is, the position of being mindless and foolish opponents rather than constructive legislators.  That is a disgraceful situation.  The people do not want it.  They do not want the Government to have a monopoly on the introduction and passage of legislation.  The Government in attempting to break down Deputy Shatter's Bill are deliberately contriving to prevent Opposition Deputies from having any constructive role in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to air this very controversial and difficult issue that has arisen with respect to the proposed closure of St. Vincent's District Hospital, Tipperary town.  But for his position, the Chair as an ordinary member, would have been in the forefront in the campaign for the continuation of this hospital and the very fine medical services in south Tipperary.  I recall with pride the Chair's valuable contribution for many years as a public representative in the building up of these medical facilities for the people of south Tipperary.  It is regrettable that we are now seeing the dismantling of these magnificant services.  When the news broke out in Tipperary town last evening that as a result of a 13 to 14 vote of the health board committee, the hospital was to close, there was utter confusion, consternation and anger.  In my 14 years as a Dáil Deputy and 20 as a public representative I have never witnessed such anger, frustration and disillusionment in the people of Tipperary town.  They were aghast that such a suggestion should emanate from any health board that their local district hospital should be closed.  I understand that tomorrow morning there is to be an emergency meeting called by the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board to overturn that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against that background that I appeal to the Minister of State to get in touch with the CEO and ask him to stay his hand and not to take an irrevocable decision tommorrow or encourage the board members to do so.  I doubt the legitimacy of a decision to be taken tomorrow.  In most local authorities and councils it takes a two-thirds majority to overturn a decision taken by the council. Will the Minister clarify if a simple majority prevails and if a decision went against the proposals, would that be a legitimate decision?  I understand that in most cases a six month period must elapse before a decision taken can be overturned. <Col N="1232" /> Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify that.</P>
    <P>St. Vincent's District Hospital has been in existence for 100 years.  It was built by the British forces as part of their military barracks and when the British withdrew in 1922, the remainder of the barracks was burned by so-called Irregulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the local medical officer prevailed on them and they had the good sense not to burn to the ground the very fine district hospital which we now have.  Ever since then, under native Government, and under the care of many matrons and staff the hospital has served the medical needs of Tipperary town and its hinterland which has a very large populace.  Indeed it has served people as far away as County Limerick, the borders of Cork and people from north Tipperary. The hospital has 42 beds, 21 male beds and 21 female beds.  It has a staff of 26 comprising ten nurses, ten domestic staff, one cook grade 2, one male ward orderly, one groundsman, one ambulance driver and one relief driver and so on.  It is a small industry.  Tipperary town has just about held its own in the recent recession but the loss of those 26 jobs would be disastrous for the town.</P>
      <P>I attended a public protest meeting in Tipperary last Monday night and it was the largest attended protest meeting ever held in the town.  The crowds overflowed into the yard of the local hotel and a public address system had to be put up so that people could listen to the business that was being transacted inside.  The crowd consisted of young and old, of all political persuasions and creeds.</P>

      <P>Did Deputy McCarthy attend that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCarthy apologised for his non-attendance.  He was invited as were other Members of the Oireachtas but they apologised for their <Col N="1233" /> non-attendance.  The crowd were incensed at the thought that their hospital would be swept away without due consideration and they will attend in force at tommorrow's meeting to overturn the decision.  On Friday night the Tipperary Urban District Council met in emergency session and took a unanimous decision that this hospital should not be closed.  A telegram was sent to both the Minister for Health and to the CEO conveying the feeling of that emergency meeting.  On Sunday there was a meeting of the staff of St. Vincent's and local doctors.  It was a pitiful meetings, because those dedicated staff, who had given loving care to the people of Tipperary town and its hinterland were totally disillusioned that their jobs could be swept away at the whim of the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board.  Their futures were being swept away.  They beseeched the public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas to bring this to the attention of the Minister and Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case for the retention of St. Vincent's Hospital on either social, economic or medical grounds.  The hospital is 24 miles from the nearest acute medical centre in either Clonmel or in Limerick.  Limerick city, as we all know is in the mid Western Health Board area, and the South Eastern Health Board dissuade their doctors from sending patients outside of their own region due to the increased costs.  Last year they paid £14 million to other health boards for the services given outside of their area.  St. Vincent's Hospital contains 42 semi-acute beds with a greater than 84 per cent bed occupancy in 1986, the average stay being 15.3 days or approximately half the national average for a hospital of its kind. According to Department of Health statistics produced in 1985 the average cost per week per occupied bed in St. Vincent's Hospital is £232 compared with £410 in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the South Eastern Health Board and indeed the Minister should be aware that £10,000 was collected in a brief six weeks shortly before Christmas last to raise funds for the equipping of the physiotherapy unit at St. <Col N="1234" /> Vincent's Hospital.  This unit is now fully operational, with a saving to the South Eastern Health Board of large sums of money on three counts.  First, there is a saving on transport to and from Cashel and Clonmel for physiotherapy.  Secondly, there is a reduction in the use by doctors of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or cortisone which constitutes a large saving.  Thirdly, there is a reduction in the overload of patients requiring physiotherapy at Cashel and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>On a ward round this week, on 3 May, the doctors medically assessed patients present in St. Vincent's Hospital, when there was a full complement of 42 patients.  Of those, two-thirds require acute treatment, were not fit for discharge and would require to be transferred either to St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel&mdash;which is also to lose a number of beds&mdash;or to the Regional Hospital in Limerick, which would cost additional moneys and be outside the South Eastern Health Board area.  One might well ask what about the remaining one-third? They would have to receive home care or home help necessitating many visits by local doctors which would amount to quite a sizeable sum.</P>
    <P>The closure of St. Vincent's Hospital in Tipperary town cannot be justified on medical or economic grounds.  We must insist that, before the South Eastern Health Board take this decision &mdash; which is totally premature &mdash; they examine every other possibility.  They should examine every single possibility before embarking on the irreparable step of closing either St. Vincent's Hospital or reducing Our Lady's hospital in Cashel by 20 beds, with six posts going at a saving of £90,000, or reducing St. Joseph's Medical Hospital, Clonmel by ten beds, with 3 posts being lost, at a meagre saving of £50,000 or indeed reducing St. Joseph's Psychiatric Hospital by 87 beds, the saving in respect of which I am not aware.</P>
    <P>We recall with pride that about a year and a half ago the then Minister for Health, now present in the House, opened a magnificent extension to St. Luke's Hospital in Clonmel at a cost of <Col N="1235" /> £1.5 million.  Barely 18 months later, 87 of those beds are to be closed down. Where are we going as regards psychiatric care or medical attention in South Tipperary?  Indeed on that occasion the Minister was practically assassinated by groups of anguished people from other hospital areas coming to protest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be in conflict with the Chair but the matter I wished to raise on the Adjournment was the proposal of the South Eastern Health Board to reduce services and costs in 1987 with specific reference to the proposal to close down St. Vincent's District Hospital and to reduce the number of beds in many other hospitals; that was the exact wording, Sir.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your guidance but I still disagree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister of State to get in touch with the Chief Medical Officer of the South Eastern Health Board before tomorrow's meeting to ask him to explore every other avenue available to him &mdash; and there are many, for instance, the collection of all outstanding levies due to the South Eastern Health Board, the obtaining of funds on account of insurance claims, many of which have been settled, and the selling off of any assets of the South Eastern Health Board.  I know they have a number of assets in Tipperary town, such as building sites and land.  No doubt there are such assets in every other town and hospital area within the South Eastern Health Board region.  Of course an obvious solution would be for the Minister to <Col N="1236" /> increase the allocation which he has reduced substantially this year to £91 million whereas the figure required to maintain the same level of services as last year would be £100 million.</P>
    <P>I would beseech the Minister to listen to the pleas of all shades of political opinion in Tipperary town and to reconsider the closure of St. Vincent's District Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond has asked me to allow him to contribute to this debate and, with your permission, Sir, I will give him the remaining time available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Griffin for giving me this opportunity of contributing to this debate.</P>
      <P>I would preface my comments in relation to the proposals of the South Eastern Health Board by saying that it has been evident that an attenuated budget of the nature allocated by the Minister to the South Eastern Health Board inevitably would result in proposals of this nature by the chief executive officer.  The blunt fact is that the budget allocated to the South Eastern Health Board simply will not allow them to maintain the 1986 level of in-patient and out-patient services in 1987.  The consequence of the Government decision not to provide sufficient resources is the proposal which will be before the South Eastern Health Board tomorrow. Unquestionably responsibility must lie with the Minister and the Government for their failure to allocate sufficient funds to the health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I understood he was intervening in an Adjournment debate, the subject matter of which is the proposed closure of St. Vincent's Hospital, Tipperary town.  I cannot allow an extension of that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure arises from the fundamental inadequacy of the budget allocation by the Minister for Health to the South Eastern Health Board for 1987.  There is now this major change of hospital bed usage whereby <Col N="1237" /> in this hospital, two-thirds of those who were medically assessed only this week are not fit to be discharged and would require direct transference to either the Regional Hospital in Limerick or St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel.  The extremity of the cuts now proposed, the lack of planning, indeed the lack of consultation with the Department of Health and the phasing of rationalisation have brought about this proposal.  We did this quite effectively in relation to Roscrea, resulting in no loss of jobs, no major dislocation to families and no distress to patients.  We succeeded in doing that by effective rationalisation.  This is not rationalisation.  It is blunt elimination of services.  We must oppose the virtual amputation of these 42 semi-acute beds in St. Vincent's Hospital, with no alternative being provided by way of day care facilities, substitute facilities or alternative arrangements for the admission of acute patients in that catchment area.</P>
      <P>On those grounds, I am strongly opposed to the proposal.  I would urge the Minister and Minister of State to go back to the Cabinet table and get an extra £10 million, £15 million or £20 million for 1987 and to allocate that money on a rational basis to those who require it.  If that is done, the chaos now visited by the Government on the South Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health can be substantially alleviated and the closure of this hospital avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying I must say I am rather surprised at the intervention of the former Minister, Deputy Desmond in this debate.  Deputy Desmond, when Minister for Health, allowed a run-over in the health services of £55 million in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 1987 he walked away from the problems in the Department of Health and like Pontius Pilate washed his hands.  We now have to pick up the pieces left by him and his Government.  Deputy Desmond left an <Col N="1238" /> over-run of £5 million in the South Eastern Health Board.  I am stating those facts because of the hypocrisy of the former Minister who comes into this House and complains about situations that are arising as a direct result of his inability to deal with the problems when he was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain the arrangements which have been made to determine the measures necessary to ensure that the 1987 budgetary decisions in respect of the health services are implemented.  The Minister and I met with the chief executive officers and chairman of the health boards on 2 April when the Minister handed them their letters of allocations in respect of 1987. Each health board were asked to submit details of the manner in which they propose to spend their allocation in the current year.  I have also arranged for senior officials of my Department to meet with the management of each board and to draw up a detailed picture of the services and staffing implications in respect of all boards.  A number of other teams are having similar discussions with representatives of the voluntary hospitals.  I expect these meetings will be completed early next week and I will then be in a position to evaluate fully the overall situation having regard to the reports submitted by officials of my Department and the formal submissions made to me by the health boards and hospital authorities.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the decisions in relation to the manner in which the individual health agencies cope with the allocations and the embargo on recruitment are matters, in the first instance, for these agencies.  Our concern will be to ensure that the available resources are deployed so that essential services are maintained at an acceptable level of quality and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to St. Vincent's Hospital, Tipperary, the Deputy will no doubt be fully aware that the South Eastern Health Board voted on 30 April not to accept the package of proposals submitted to it <Col N="1239" /> for approval by the chief executive officer.  The matter is to be further considered by the board at a special meeting tomorrow.  I do not, therefore, have any proposals before me in relation to how the board will organise their services to live within their approved allocation in the current year.</P>

    <P>I understand that Fota House, the Arboretum and the grounds which are now open to the public are not in fact to be sold but are to be the subject of a lease to the developers.

    <P>With regard to the part of the estate which is to be sold the position is that the Charter granted to University College Cork under the Irish Universities Act, 1908, gives power to the College, <i>inter alia</i>, to sell real and personal property.

Assuming that the sketch scheme establishes that the required accommodation can be provided at acceptable cost in the manner indicated, the development of the project through its various architectural stages would take some time.  It is unlikely, realistically, that provision of a capital allocation for the project would arise before the end of the financial year 1988 or the financial year 1989.

This grant is payable on the condition that a local contribution equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the State capitation grant must be lodged each year in a bank account in the name of the school.  As is laid down in the Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure &ldquo;this sum required to meet the local contribution shall be provided by the parish community or other appropriate analogous community or body from general funds at the disposal of such community or body and there shall be no levy on the parents of children attending the school&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that boards of management, in general, are familiar with the above rules and bring no undue pressure to bear on individual parents with regard to the making of financial contributions.</P>
      <P>Because of the very serious budgetary situation, it was not possible to increase the capitation grant this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to post-primary schools I would like to state that it is a fundamental principle of the free post-primary education scheme that no charge be made in respect of (1) instruction in any subject listed in the general school programme; (2) recreational or study facilities of which all the pupils are expected to avail themselves as part of the school programme; (3) any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
      <P>Voluntary contributions by parents towards the elimination of old building debts, or charges for optional extras over and above those provided in the general school programme, are permissible under the free education scheme, provided that it is made clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay, and that there is no question of sanctions against pupils whose parents choose not to make such contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department receives telephone inquires from time to time seeking clarification of the Department's policy in regard to the levying of charges by secondary schools.  A very small number of written complaints have been received in recent years and these have been investigated. Where appropriate, the schools <Col N="1110" /> in question are reminded of the obligation to adhere to the principles of the free education scheme.  My Department is not aware of any case where a pupil has been denied access to a school in the circumstances outlined.  In regard to the rate of <i>per capita</i> grant, the current difficult financial situation does not allow for an increase at present.</P>

However, this Government believes that greater emphasis should be given to the creation of voluntary youth service councils at local level.  Consequently the whole question of future <Col N="1111" /> structures for youth service at local level is under review at present in consultation with interested organisations.  On the general question of national youth policy as indicated in the document &ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo; I can confirm what was indicated in the budget speech i.e. that the whole question is being re-examined and further development will take place in line with available resources.</P>

Enrolments at the school have not, however, yet reached the level which would warrant the appointment of a sixth teacher.  My Department is carrying out a review of enrolment prospects with a view to settling the amount of permanent accommodation which would be required in the long term and will communicate further with the school authorities as soon as possible with a view to reaching final agreement on the sketch plans and proceeding with the detailed planning of the necessary extension.  My attention has been drawn to the report of the director of community care recommending the replacement of the existing school.

      <P>I would not favour the introduction of a national objective externally monitored assessment process for children of primary school age.  The experience of the primary certificate in the past was that it had the effect of limiting the focus of the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would not like the Deputy to have the impression that no assessment of attainment levels is carried out at primary level.  Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning.  It is part of the work of all teachers in primary schools who use a variety of procedures both formal and informal for assessing pupils. National surveys on randomly selected pupils in certain classes in primary schools have been conducted by the curriculum unit of my Department at regular intervals over the past number of years which give general information on the levels of achievement in languages and mathematics.  These tests yield results which provide useful data for the allocation of special resources on a national level.  In addition, a school report containing an assessment of the organisation and work of each school as a whole is furnished to the Department by my inspectorate at regular intervals of approximately four years.  The reports refer to the environmental factors which influence the effectiveness of a teacher's work; the organisation, atmosphere and general programme of work in operation <Col N="1115" /> in the school; and the general development of pupils and their progress in the various areas of the curriculum.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association has drawn up a list of suggested criteria for selection boards for the filling of posts as assistant teachers and principals in Catholic schools which includes the requirement that teachers be practicing Catholics, and I am aware of the INTO's opposition to this.</P>
      <P>The schools in question, like the vast majority of primary schools in the State, are conducted in accordance with the religious beliefs of the patrons and boards of management of those attending them. The denominational nature of the national school system is explicitly recognised by the State in pursuance of the provisions of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution.  The concern of school authorities with regard to the religious standing of the teachers and principals they appoint clearly derives from the denominational nature of the schools, and the fact that as well as teaching secular subjects, the teachers are also teachers of religion which is a fundamental part of the school course.  The requirements in the matter of religion for teachers who teach in denominationally controlled schools are a matter for the school management authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has raised the question of whether the &ldquo;practising Catholics&rdquo; requirement on the part of the managers' association is appropriate when the State pays the teachers' salaries.  The point is that the requirement derives from the denominational structure of the national school system, a system which has been <Col N="1119" /> denominational in structure since the 19th century, which was inherited when the State achieved independence and a fact which was taken into account in drafting the Constitution.  There is no evidence at present of any serious desire on the part of the country's taxpayers to have this system altered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>A special grant scheme for mature women students was operated by the office of the Minister of State for Women's Affairs in 1985 and 1986 and was designed to help the successful candidates for the 1985-86 and 1986-87 academic years respectively.</P>

    <P>It was recently decided that this activity should be transferred to my Department <Col N="1122" /> as the Department with specific responsibility for the provision of higher education.

    <P>While I am sympathetic to the idea of a general scholarship scheme for mature students and am presently examining the possibilities in this regard, the final decision will have to be taken in the context of the present financial constraints affecting all areas including education.</P>

    <P>Note &mdash; Departmental/Professional grades are grouped on the basis of salary maximum.</P>
    <P>While the tables show that women are under-represented in the higher levels of the Civil Service, the proportion of women serving in the higher grades has increased significantly in the past decade. The figures show that, today, over 23 per cent of assistant principals, the main middle management grade in the Civil Service, are women.  This compares with 4 per cent in 1972.  In the grade of higher executive officer, the comparable figures are 33 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>The Government as employer is committed to equality of opportunity and fuller participation by women throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A number of major initiatives have been taken by my Department in the area <Col N="1126" /> of equal opportunity.  Since January 1984 a section in the Department has been designated with specific responsibility for women's affairs.  The section serves as a focal point for the co-ordination, development and implementation of policy in this area.  It is involved in negotiations on a wide range of claims on equality and family issues with staff side interests under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. Another significant development has been the introduction of more flexible working arrangements which are of particular importance to staff wishing to combine a career and family responsibility. These include the schemes of career breaks, job-sharing and flexible working hours.  For women in management grades, the Civil Service Training Centre has designed and launched a new course &ldquo;The Woman Manager&rdquo; which is specifically designed to encourage women employees to develop and enhance their management potential.</P>
    <P>Equal opportunity policy and guidlines for the Civil Service were issued in July 1986.  These were drawn up in agreement with staff interests and in consultation with the Employment Equality Agency. The guidelines deal with equality in relation to recruitment, placement, training and promotion and are designed to ensure that the advances made by women in the Civil Service to date will continue.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy, that there should be no discrimination against women in the Civil Service.  All staff have an equal opportunity to advance on the basis of merit and ability irrespective of sex or marital status.  In this way the talents and potential of all employees can be utilised and developed.  Against this background it is not considered necessary or appropriate that there should be reserved positions for women in the senior levels of the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Child dependant increases are payable with most social welfare benefits and pensions in respect of children up to the age of 18 years.  In the case of widow's pension, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance and unmarried mother's allowance, however, child dependant increases continue to be payable in respect of children up to the age of 21 years provided that they are receiving full time education at either second or third level.  This extension of the age limit which also applies to widows receiving invalidity, retirement or old age contributory pensions was introduced in recognition of the special needs of widows and other one-parent families.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that child dependant allowances should be payable to age 21 with all long term social welfare payments where the child is in full time education and this recommendation will be considered in the context of the examination of the Commission's report. Having regard, however, to present constraints on the public finances there are no immediate plans to extend the scope of child dependency payments.</P>
      <P>Information is not available which would enable precise calculations to be made of the cost of extending child dependency payments in the manner suggested in the questions but it is estimated that it would be upwards of £3 million per annum.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether the overall level of road grants to local authorities was (a) reduced from that provided in the estimates published last January; (b) if he will give details of those authorities whose allocation has been reduced or increased in the revised allocations made by him; and (c) the reason for such changes.</P>

      <P>A total provision for road grants for 1987 is £165.95 million, which represents a reduction of £1.85 million on the provision made in the January estimates. On the other hand, the 1987 provision for local improvements schemes (which relate to non-public roads) is now £4 million, which represents an increase of £1.85 million on the provision made in the January estimates.</P>
      <P>The changes in the amounts of road grants allocated to individual local authorities in April compared with the January allocations are set out in the attached schedule.</P>
      <P>The main reasons for the changes in the road grant allocations were as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) The sum of £1.85 million was diverted to the Local Improvements Scheme;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> (ii) The total grants allocated for county road strengthening were increased from £10 million to £15 million. The revised allocations were made on the basis of the mileage of county roads in each county, which is a more appropriate basis than the basis adopted in January;</P>
    <P>(iii) The provision for major improvement projects on national and major urban roads was reduced by £7.2 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the amounts of statutory redundancy payments due to these employees have not been determined because of a dispute with the liquidator of Waterford Stevedores Limited regarding their wages and periods of service, on which their entitlements would be based. Accordingly, the employees appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the tribunal heard the appeals on 8 May 1985.</P>
      <P>I am informed, however, that certain information with regard to the wages and service was not available at the hearing and that the two sides were asked by the tribunal to engage in discussions in the hope that they could reach agreement on the details, which would enable the tribunal to issue its decision.  I understand that the information required by the tribunal has not yet been forwarded to it and that until such information is received the tribunal cannot finalise its decision on the individual entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the amounts of statutory lump sums due have been determined by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the employees may apply to my Department for payment from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund, if the employer has refused or failed to make the payments.  Any such application <Col N="1144" /> received by my Department will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
