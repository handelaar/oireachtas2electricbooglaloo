I respect your advice about the response from the Minister's office that he did not consider himself responsible because these are all privately owned houses.  I suggest that it is a matter that could be discussed on the Adjournment. There are some houses at Seagrange which are still the property of the local authority and occupied by tenants.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported last night we were discussing an amendment in my name which contemplated that before exemptions would be granted the Minister would consult with the relevant trade unions.  I indicated then that I would think about this overnight. Having slept soundly on the matter, I am more than ever convinced of the correctness of my position.  There are those who will always be of the view that there is somehow or other a tension between the desire to pursue profits and a desire to adhere to the highest possible standards of safety.  In general terms that is an erroneous view.  From the studies conducted by the Barrington Commission it emerges very clearly that it is an erroneous view.  That commission made the point that a progressive employer who is genuinely interested in profits is genuinely interested in adhering to the highest possible safety standards. There are people who see that potential conflict in positions of authority in other jurisdictions and it is not inconceivable that at some stage those may obtain positions of influence in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving a Second Reading to this Bill the House indicated its belief that the inherently hazardous activity of offshore exploration should be subject to statutory control.  What the Minister believes &mdash; and I share this belief &mdash; is that there is a need for some form of an exemption procedure.  We seek a procedure whereby the Minister and future Ministers should <Col N="1449" /> consult the relevant trade unions before exercising that power.  In his contribution last night the Minister for Labour said I had spoken in terms of the need to clear things with the trade unions.  If he was suggesting that I was contemplating that the unions should have any kind of veto, I most certainly was not: no more than operators should have an automatic right to exemption, the unions should have no possibility whatsoever of being in a position to exercise veto.  All I seek is that they should be consulted and their views heard.  As people who clearly have a material interest in whether their place of work will be either within the Statute or excluded from the provisions of the Statute by reason of an exemption order, they have something to say.  The purpose of my amendment is to give them that opportunity to be heard.</P>
    <P>In arguing against the amendment the Minister indicated that there could be occasions where a very urgent request for an exemption would be submitted and that the obligation to consult would make it difficult to respond.  I do not know what those circumstances would be.  On thinking about it I find it hard to imagine what they might be.  In so far as that possibility exists I am perfectly happy that the legislation should cover that and would allow that the Minister in emergency cases would not be obliged to consult.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions last night I asked if the Minister would indicate the nature of the procedure he sees being followed.  He did not respond in any detail to this request.  If the Minister could indicate the various steps &mdash; beginning with the decision taken by an operator somewhere off, say, the Cork coast that he is going to acquire an exemption from some or all of the provisions of the legislation &mdash; on how applications will be processed we would be in a position to make progress.  There is not a great deal between the Minister and myself in relation to this.  We both accept that there is a need for flexibility in an area like this and that certainly there should be no undue bureaucracy.  We both accept also that unions have a material interest in <Col N="1450" /> this and, if possible, that is an interest which should be recognised.  I repeat my request to the Minister to bring us through the procedures.  For example, to whom will the application be made in the first instance?  Will it be made to the inspectorate?  Is it contemplated that the inspectors would then inspect or would they be able to make a decision from Mespil Road?  Will it be made by an individual inspector and passed up the line? Will it in practice, as distinct from a matter of form, be a question of specific ministerial decision?  It would be worth knowing how this procedure will be handled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate some of the points made by the previous speaker in relation to exemptions. It is important that the procedures whereby exemptions would be granted should be spelt out.  There could be some concern on the part of the industry that this might be a bureaucratic and time consuming procedure.  It might be very inappropriate that such a procedure should exist when it might be possible within the scope of this Bill to list installations that would be permanently exempted.  In this regard I am thinking of offshore installations such as unmanned installations or rigs that have been mothballed or a pipeline.  There is a requirement in the Bill that if such an installation is capable of being manned it should in theory have an installation manager assigned to it.  Would it be possible to list specific installations that would not have to go through the procedure of seeking exemption because this could be very cumbersome and time consuming? The industry would welcome such an exemption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provision being made for the consultative process.  Like Deputy Birmingham, I see the need for consultation.  Without repeating what I said on Second Stage I feel that unless there is some means of implementing standards and ensuring that those standards are maintained the purpose of the Bill will be defeated.  We <Col N="1451" /> are essentially talking about the safety, health and welfare of workers.  While I understand Deputy O'Malley's concern lest the bureaucracy should take over and that this would be a deterrent or an obstacle in the way of the company, the primary function of the legislation is to ensure the safety of the workforce.  For that reason consultation alone is not enough.  If the unions are not happy with the consultative process and there is conflict, who will arbitrate on the outcome of the negotiations?  If consultations break down between the unions and a company who will have to give a decision as to whether an exemption should be granted?  My primary concern is that there are operators who would take short cuts in the interests of profit and thereby put their lives at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Birmingham I have been examining what was said during the course of our discussions yesterday.  One point I made yesterday has been brought up again today in the contributions of various Deputies that is, that while we want to make sure that the principle of the Bill &mdash; the safety, welfare and health of the workforce &mdash; is maintained &mdash; we must be realistic.  In other words, we must not get into any position of bureaucracy that creates long delays either within the Department, so far as the inspectorate or the Minister are concerned or with the other side, the employers and trade unions.  For this reason I argued yesterday that we should have an informal consultative process if the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure will be that an application in writing for an exemption is sent by the owner to the Department and then passed to the inspectorate for detailed examination.  I want to assure the Deputies that an exemption will be granted so that we do not cause undue delay and unfairness and at the same time allow flexibility.  The inspectorate will not recommend an exemption if they are not absolutely happy that the safety, health and welfare of the workforce are <Col N="1452" /> ensured.  Exemptions will be granted only in cases where the inspectorate are totally happy that there is no alternative but to give an exemption.  They should be involved in whatever informal discussions are necessary, whether it be with the owners or with representatives of the workers.  The inspectorate, we would all agree, do an excellent job under all the legislation to ensure that the interests of workers are protected.  There is no vagueness.  I do not think it would be possible, even if the Minister wanted to, to overrule the inspectorate.  It would be the recommendation of the inspectorate. If the Minister wished he could perhaps further consider that recommendation but this would be a highly technical area and the power to overrule would not be open to the Minister to use or abuse. I cannot accept Deputy Birmingham's amendment.  The process of consultation can be informal to ensure that what Deputy Birmingham is rightly pointing out should be undertaken.  At the same time I am noting Deputy O'Malley's points about not getting into undue bureaucratic delays.  The section is as it is to allow for the necessary flexibility.  I would ask the Deputies to agree to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>How many exemptions have been granted?  If we could have this figure we could have some idea of the extent of the problem and what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>None.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that in practice this will be a matter for the inspectorate, that one could not imagine their views being overruled by a Minister.  I am not really sure that that is right.  Any application would involve some obligation to balance interests, to balance potentially conflicting factors. There is no doubt that in an ideal world every installation, however small and however few people are involved for whatever short period, would be subject to the statutory framework that this Bill would be providing.  There is an interest <Col N="1453" /> in staying as close to that as possible but there is a legitimate interest also in ensuring that in some cases a degree of flexibility will be present.</P>
      <P>When an application becomes live and goes in the first instance to the inspectorate and then to the Minister, the person making the decision at each level will have to review the position and decide where the best balance lies.  That is not purely a technical decision.  It certainly may require the application of technical expertise, but it may also require judgements that are of a non-technical nature as to how far one is prepared to rely on people's goodwill, to what extent one can allow people to take the short trap and so on.  It is in those circumstances that I am anxious that the views of the unions would be heard.  The Minister also spoke about the opportunity for informal consultation.  Could he say to the House that he will direct the inspectorate, as the people who will be the first line response to any request, that whenever they get a request they should, if feasible, ascertain whether the trade unions have any views to offer on the subject?  If so they should take those views into account when coming to a decision.  That would go a very long way towards meeting my concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>From the time he would receive a formal application for exemption, does the Minister have any time frame in mind in which such an exemption order would then be granted? That could be quite important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated yesterday that I thought an essential aspect of the section is that the Minister should be able to respond quickly to requests for any exemption.  That was one of the main grounds I gave for wishing the section to be passed as it is.  The Deputy will appreciate that if one delays people until the winter they can lose a whole season's work, so the answer to the Deputy's question is as quickly as absolutely possible. There will be a written application to the Minister, the inspection by the inspector, <Col N="1454" /> consultations and discussions and the decision by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Birmingham's point, the Minister would have the power to overrule the inspectorate but it comes to the circumstances that might arise.  Perhaps the granting of a particular exemption miight give rise to concern about the safety, health or welfare of the workers. On that base it would be wrong of the Minister to overrule the specialised and qualified expertise.  On Second Stage, a number of questions were asked in this respect and we satisfied ourselves that we have highly qualified people in that area. The Minister would not reasonably be in a position to overrule expertise based on safety.  Perhaps there would be some other aspects that could give rise to discussions or an exemption.  Of paramount importance would be the safety of the workers; the whole principle of the Bill is the giving of protection to offshore workers.</P>
      <P>I assure the House, and Deputy Birmingham in particular, that there would be consultation.  Several sections of this Bill are extended to allow for consultation. I am happy that the inspectorate, if not absolutely satisfied but without causing undue delay, would have the necessary consultations.  The matter might be very straightforward but urgent and the subject matter might be an offshore installation with which they were very familiar and so on which they would know the precise position.  We have, and I hope shall always have, competent inspectorate to regulate our other legislation and that would be the case here. The inspectorate would be requested by the Minister to ensure that consultation was carried out before they finally advised the Minister whether or not to give an exemption.  I hope this assurance will go all the way to satisfying the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is Deputy Birmingham's amendment.  However, I am not satisfied that it is going far enough. We are told that there will be consultations. There is nothing in the Bill that will ensure adequate protection being afforded to the operator.  One can talk until doomsday but unless the inspectorate have the muscle to impose standards it will be all for naught.</P>

      <P>That is not correct.  The inspectorate are the people who would be advising the Minister whether or not to give an exemption.  If they, having examined the procedure or the application are not satisfied &mdash; being part of the Department of Labour and pro the interests of the workers because the legislation they are given to implement governs the safety and welfare of workers &mdash; the exemption will not be granted. They are always careful, as we all know, of the decisions they give.  If the owners of the installation cannot get an exemption they are defeated.  The power clearly rests with the inspectorate to examine fully the application and if necessary to examine the installation to ensure that they are totally happy about it.  The inspectorate have vast powers, through the Minister.  While the Minister will give the exemption in writing there will be a responsibility on the inspectorate to ensure that the regulations and conditions are adhered to.  What Deputies O'Sullivan and Birmingham are trying to cover is in fact already covered by the section.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b), line 50, after &ldquo;the Minister for Communications,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Tourism and Transport,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment to section 5 (1) (b) is a technical one necessitated by the Government's redistribution of functions between a number of Ministers on taking office in March last.  A similar amendment, that is No. 6, is necessary in regard to section 22 (1).  The functions described in subsection 1 (b) were previously matters which came within the responsibility of the Minister for Communications and these functions are now shared with the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for the Marine.  The amendment provides that where the Minister for Labour proposes to make regulations relating to the areas described in the subsection he shall be obliged to consult with the Minister for Energy and to seek the concurrence of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> In page 9, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) (a) Before making a regulation under this Act, the Minister shall consult such organisations or other bodies of persons representative of employers and such organisations or other bodies of persons representative of Trade Unions as he considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Once more, we are back on the subject of consultations and it is only right that I should say that consultation is central to this Bill.  If the Bill appears to be of a confused mixed parentage given the number of different Ministers and Attorneys General who have worked on it over the years, they all have accepted that we should seek to operate on the basis of consensus.  My amendment seeks to take that proposal a little further. It seeks to require the Minister, before making regulations under the Act, to consult with the organisations which are representative of the employers, the operators and the trade unions.  There is nothing radical about that proposal as there are similar obligations in a number of other areas.  Maternity protection legislation is one area which comes to mind.  Such a process of consultation seems to be inherently appropriate in this case.</P>
    <P>While all acknowledge the expertise of the inspectorate, and there is no doubt that they have served the State well over the years, it is the case that exploration in this country is in its infancy and that, by definition, exploitation is at an even earlier stage.  We ought to recognise that there may be wider expertise available beyond these shores and we ought to be big enough to recognise that that expertise may be available to the operators as they may have safety experts working for them who would be in a position to comment on the best practices which operate in other jurisdictions.  It may be that the trade unions through their international contacts would be in a position to bring particular knowledge and expertise to bear.  What I am seeking is to require the Minister before making regulations <Col N="1458" /> to enter a process of consultation.</P>
    <P>The legislation as drafted provides for a subsequent period of consultation and for the publication of the intent in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and giving an opportunity for people to have their say then.  Once the Minister has committed himself to a course of conduct and once he has stated his intent to act in a particular way he is less likely to respond favourably to views he might hear.  Those who are putting forward views at that stage will find themselves, at the very least, with the task of trying to persuade the Minister and his Department to change their minds and positions.  What I am trying to do is to bring them in earlier when minds are perhaps more open and when they would be of real assistance.</P>
    <P>The wording of the amendment, an amendment, I think, which would find favour with the industry, is borrowed from the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.  Given that consultation is central to this legislation and that we have accepted that it would be desirable that the area of safety and welfare should be imbued with the spirit of Barrington it is desirable that this amendment be accepted.  It is one which the Minister should accept.  It contains nothing new or radical and has many parallels in other legislation.  What it does is to make meaningful the offer of consultation which is already provided for by the legislation. All the interested parties will be consulted but my concern is that they will not be consulted at the optimum time, perhaps not even at a meaningful time, at a time when their views would be of most use and assistance.  What my amendment seeks to do is to give them the opportunity of being heard when minds are still open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment and particularly the point in relation to consultation with the industry.  We have no track record of any real consequence in this activity but this is no reflection on the inspectorate.  It is merely that we have not been participating in oil or offshore exploration to any great extent for any great length of <Col N="1459" /> time.  The industry is an international one and has major experience under its belt. It would be of benefit if the Minister inserted in the Bill a requirement on himself that before introducing regulations he would consult with the industry.  I also agree that the trade unions should likewise be consulted.  Acceptance of this amendment would give the Bill a better balance and make it more meaningful as the intention of the Bill is to ensure that there will be proper safety regulations in operation on these rigs.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I go along with what Deputy Birmingham said and I note the emphasis Deputy O'Malley puts on the role of the industry.  I accept that the people involved are of international standing.  I have a certain bias.  I am totally concerned about the welfare of the people working on these rigs in an extremely hazardous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted Deputy Birmingham's amendments.  The Bill proposed to make regulations with some exceptions with regard to the time within which representations concerning the regulations may be made.  It is similar to the provisions in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1975, the Safety in Industry Acts 1955 and 1980 and the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  This procedure of regulations is considered more suitable for a safety protection measure than consultation at the initial formulation stage. In anticipation of the Bill passing into law that preparation of regulations is already well under way so that the time scale for bringing the Act fully into operation will be as short as possible.  Having regard to the hazardous nature of the work connected with offshore installations, there is also the consideration that it is desirable that the procedure for the introduction of new regulations should be required to be expeditious.  I have considered the amendment and I am prepared to give an assurance to the employers and the workers' representative bodies that there will be the <Col N="1460" /> fullest consultation with them on an informal basis on the regulations to be made under the Bill in advance of the publication of the regulations.  The time provided for is not less than 21 days after the regulations are issued within which representations can be made by interested parties.  That is a minimum time which may be increased if the necessity arises.  The Deputy's point is valid in that this is a time when the lines are drawn but I give an assurance that consultation will take place before minds are closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has acknowledged the point in this amendment and that he has indicated it is a matter of practice that consultations will take place at the first stage.  Having done those things the Minister could go on to accept the amendment.  In arguing against it the Minister relies on the precedents of the mines and quarries legislation and of the dangerous substances legislation.  Both of those measures are measures of some antiquity and there has probably been some movement in thought since then and the fact that I could find this wording in more recent legislation substantiates that.  More significantly, in the case of the mines and quarries legislation and the dangerous substances legislation, they both relate to activities which are being carried on here for many years and there is expertise and experience in those fields that has been built up here among the operators, the workers and among those whose task it is to inspect.  Here we are talking about something quite different, about an activity which is still very new to our jurisdiction.  Many of the things we hope will be policed by this measure have not yet taken place.  In those circumstances it is common sense to recognise that the people doing those tasks probably know more about it than any inspector.  If one wanted to find someone who was an expert in drillings procedures or anything related one would not go to the Department of Labour inspectorate, however skilled they are, but would go to people who are experienced in this area.  There <Col N="1461" /> are such people among the operators and the unions are in a position through the various international bodies to which they are affiliated to bring their experience of what has happened in other jurisdictions to bear on this.  Given that the Minister has acknowledged the substance in the amendment, why can he not accept the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Labour inspectorate is an experienced body and nobody would argue about that. The Deputy has referred, for his case, to employment legislation but in all the safety legislation one will find this type of section.  In relation to the Deputy's request for consultation, I am now giving an assurance that informal consultation will take place at the drafting stage of the regulations and then there is a 21-day statutory period during which people can come back and challenge the regulations. That 21 days is not final, it can be increased.  There are three opportunities to negotiate and surely that is adequate time.  If we build in a further consultative process into the legislation it would delay the process which is already lengthy. There is no question of there being no opportunity to discuss the regulations.  I understand and accept the point in the Deputy's amendment that perhaps there should be consultation prior to people closing their minds and prior to the regulations being drafted and being perhaps difficult to change.  Having considered his amendment, I am prepared to give an assurance to the employers and workers' representative bodies that there will be the fullest consultation with them on an informal basis on the regulations to be made under the Bill in advance of its publication.  I think that satisfies the valid point which the Deputy has made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to worry away at this like a dog with a bone, but the Minister says that consultation is desirable and there should be the maximum opportunity for consultation. He also says there will be three opportunities for consultation.  There will be an opportunity, on foot of his undertaking to the House, for informal consultation at an early stage; there will be the opportunity within 21 days of the publication of the notice of intent to make regulations in <i>Iris Oifigiúil;</i> and if necessary there is the opportunity to pass that on a stage further.  He has all but accepted that the most valuable of those opportunities is likely to prove to be the earliest, informal consultation.  We might have produced a Bill that said nothing about the obligation to consult and the right to be heard by people likely to be affected by consultations, but we did not do so.  We thought it appropriate that there should be reference.  If it is appropriate that <Col N="1463" /> there be any reference to the right to be heard and the right to be consulted, then it seems the sensible reference should be that which will be of most use to the people involved, and that is the earliest consultation.</P>
      <P>The Minister when he was Government Whip and Opposition Whip won quite a reputation for himself because of the way in which he approached matters in this House in a somewhat non-partisan way, recognising that there was sometimes wisdom to be heard from different sides of the House.  I cannot but believe that what I am proposing represents an improvement on the Bill and I ask the Minister to accept it.  If he has any problems about the drafting, if he thinks that a more elegant phrasing is possible &mdash; I would not be the one to deny that possibility &mdash; then by all means let him see to that.  If we say there is to be consultation, let us put in what we want to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am repeating myself but the fear would be that to write it into legislation will only extend the period of the consultation process.  There is reference in the Bill to the period of 21 days which is a long period if we want to expedite matters and have some speed in the decision, as Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out.  After the regulations are drafted, put forward and issued in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> when all necessary consultation can take place, it is not less than 21 days and that allows for further discussions.  I have outlined also that there should be informal discussions.  That to a reasonable extent gives the Deputy what he seeks.  There are three processes.  The informal process will have to be real.  The employers and the unions will have to have the fullest consultation on an informal basis.  I have no doubt that that would lead to a better regulation.  If we got a better regulation at that stage then it might be less likely that there would be debate in the 21-day period or that we would have to extend the 21-day period. There are three fairly lengthy processes that would satisfy the consultation requirement.  I do not believe that putting <Col N="1464" /> it into the Bill could lengthen the discussion still further.  That point is being put forward and has been considered at some length and it is continually left as it is.  I am extending it further from what was in the legislation by giving the commitment to the House that this informal process will have to take place prior to the regulation being issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

      <P>The Minister's anxiety is that the process should not be unduly prolonged and I understand that. However, before any regulation gets to the stage of appearing in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> there would have been a substantial degree of preparation, so I do not see how holding consultations at that stage would prolong the life of the proposed proceedings.  All we are seeking is the right for these bodies to be consulted.  It is for the Minister to decide that he has heard enough of their views.  Neither side of industry is getting a veto, neither side is being allowed to hold things up.  I do not believe this is going to prolong proceedings. It is a net issue.  I believe this would improve the Bill and I would like to see it incorporated.</P>

If Deputy Birmingham wishes me to consider any further consultations prior to bringing the Bill to the Seanad I would undertake to look at that.

At present subsection (b) excludes from even the limited consultation procedure the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of a series of measures.  What my amendment sought to do &mdash; but which I accept would not have achieved &mdash; was to get rid of all those exclusions and simply to say that whenever one was providing for regulations one consulted.  In a Bill of this fundamental importance I thought it was not appropriate to start knocking things out and saying: consult generally but not in these cases.  What the Minister has done is reduce the number of cases in respect of which it will not be necessary <Col N="1466" /> to consult.  That represents sizeable progress.

    <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 38, after &ldquo;installation&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;who are <Col N="1467" /> subject to the control and authority of the owner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section deals with the obligation to provide information to the Minister.  As drafted at present it appears to be somewhat open-ended in terms of the information that can be required.  It is a matter of high probability that the only information likely to be required of an owner is that he furnish information in respect of those persons who are there, subject to his control or who are within his employment.  But that is not what the Bill says at present.  My amendment is a simple one and indicates what can be required of an owner.  It seems to me that what can be required of an owner is what he can be reasonably expected to give, which is that he gives information on those who are subject to his authority and control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that section 6 (1) should stand.  The qualification sought in the Deputy's amendment would have the effect of divesting an owner of responsibility to supply information in respect of persons employed in the neighbourhood of an installation but not under his control.  Attention is drawn to the terms of section 22 (4) and (5).  For example section 22 (4) (a) says:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may impose duties on concession owners, offshore installation owners, installation managers and contractors.</P>
      <P>Whereas section 22 (4) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>In addition for the foregoing, regulations under this section may impose duties on persons who are of a precribed class or description and who are employed on, in or in the neighbourhood of an offshore installation to which this Act applies.</P>
      <P>This section 22 (5) reads:</P>

    <P>The manager of an offshore installation shall notify the owner thereof as soon as practicable of any event which occurs on, in or in the neighbourhood of the installation and of the <Col N="1468" /> occurrence of which the said owner is under regulations under this section required to notify the Minister.</P>
    <P>The original thinking on the Bill proposed the concession owner as the person on whom the duty to supply information should be laid.  However, I have been advised that the installation owner is the more appropriate person.  On that basis I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the reason there is not an area inserted or referred to, to allow of consideration of what that area may be.  The Deputy asked for the definition of &ldquo;in the neighbourhood of an installation&rdquo;.  Five hundred metres would be the normal distance.  That is the distance mentioned in the Continental Shelf Act.  The reason a distance has not been referred to in the drafting of the legislation, I presume, is to allow flexibility, that &ldquo;within reason&rdquo; can be a negotiable point, without inserting a hard and fast distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that mean that there is the requirement to have an offshore installation manager on board an installation beyond a distance of 500 metres from another installation?  Is there an obvious requirement that there should be an installation manager on board such an installation if it is sited 500 metres away from a primary installation, or is there not?  If there is not, would this not lead to further confusion in the sections we have already debated as to whether there should be exemptions granted? Does it not throw into confusion many provisions of this Bill anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the installation manager is in charge of the installation and of the installations in a particular neighbourhood.  The reason 500 metres is not specified is that, if the installation manager is responsible for a number of installations within fairly close distance of one another, then it is a matter of being reasonable.  If the installations are sited substantially apart then it is a matter for negotiation.  The installation manager <Col N="1470" /> cannot reasonably be asked to be responsible for installations that are totally isolated. That would be a matter for prior discussion.  It is for that reason that distance has not been specified in the Bill. The installation manager is responsible for the installations within an area, without the legislation being very strict as regards distance.  That would be fairly obvious if there were two or three close installations, but he would not be asked, under the legislation, to take charge of two installations that were significantly apart.</P>

I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  If it is to be specifically the owner who will supply the necessary statistics on returns you could be providing a borehole, as it were, for some unscrupulous operators because many of these rigs are leased and the people who operate them are not the owners of the platforms.

      <P>He is generous in suggesting what my amendment is capable of achieving.  As I understand from the Minister, what he says is desirable is, for example, that he could put questions about the health and safety of people employed by contractors on the rig to the owner and that in so far as the owner knows anything about it he would then be under obligation to provide the information. Is that the reason the section is drafted in its present shape?  If so, I can see some sense in it.  Perhaps I lost the flow of the debate but I was amused at <Col N="1471" /> the introduction of the 500 metres.  From where did that come?</P>

The definition of &ldquo;the neighbourhood of&rdquo; in the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, is 500 metres.  The drafters of this Bill wisely left out that distance because if you confine it to a certain distance all kinds of difficulties would arise.  My definition of &ldquo;the neighbourhood of&rdquo; is perhaps a better one.  The Deputy is correct in regard to the question he asked me to clarify.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4b:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, subsection 3 (b), line 3, <Col N="1472" /> before &ldquo;in&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;subject to the consent in writing of the person by whom it is supplied&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section deals with the obligation to provide information.  There is a recognition of the fact that in this industry perhaps more than almost any other, confidentiality is vital.  The section states that information supplied on a confidential basis can be republished for statistical purposes but that the identity of the person giving the information should not be disclosed.  That sounds fine.  The reality is that we have so relatively few operators at any one time that it would be possible for someone looking at the journal in which the statistical information is provided to say: &ldquo;We know exactly who was the person who gave that information to the Minister so that he could provide it in his annual report&rdquo;. That would seem to cause a potential injustice to the person providing the information.  After all, to some extent the Minister thinks he can get a secondary benefit from the information provided. By all means let us have the publication of statistical information and so on but if information is provided it should be on the basis that it will not be published unless the person providing it gives his consent.</P>
    <P>The prospect of anonymity is unreal. For example, we were told during the course of the debate on the oil terms last week that it is proposed to drill only one well next year.  Suppose this Bill is in place and the Minister obtains some information from the operators and chooses to publish that information later in the year, the journal will not record who gave him the information but one would not need to be an Einstein to work out who provided the information.  While of course we hope there will be a greater volume of activity in that regard we will still be talking about a relatively small group of people.  It might often be possible for the informed to work out by process of exclusion who provided the information.  It is a reasonable safeguard that before information used is published for statistical purposes the consent of the <Col N="1473" /> person providing the information should be obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed from the amendment that there should be greater anonymity in respect of the operations but subsection (3) (b) of section 6 is in effect self-regulatory.  If a summary within the terms of the proviso in the subsection cannot be framed the disclosure of information in terms of the subsection cannot take place.  That covers the Deputy's point.  I am advised it is a technical matter.  The point the Deputy makes is valid and it is covered in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, the section certainly addresses the question of confidentiality but I am not sure that the way in which it does so is adequate. Let us consider what actually happens. There will be certain information available now within the Department of Labour and somebody, perhaps the industrial inspectorate or another Government Department, will propose to produce a paper on offshore activity and decide to publish it.  At present the judgment as to whether anonymity will be affected will be made within the Government service.  The information officer of the Department of Labour will look at this and say: &ldquo;That is fine, I can publish those statistics because they do not reveal the identity of a particular person.&rdquo;  It may be that the information officer of the Department of Labour would be substantially underestimating the ingenuity of the competitors of that operator.  It may be that he would be underestimating the effectiveness of some of the people watching what is happening in the Stock Exchange, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that the section addresses the problem and while it purports to have a self-regulating defence, an electric kettle type of operation, it does not completely cover the problem. It may well be that people will be quite satisfied that no information has been revealed that can be traced to its source <Col N="1474" /> but the source may know better and that is why the consent should be obtained. Alternatively, I would be happy if the Minister would tell the House that if information is to be published under this section, before the publication takes place the original source would be informed of their intention.  At least that way he may be in a position to put them on notice of things they would not otherwise be aware of which would disclose his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1) (b), line 11, after &ldquo;he shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whenever practicable,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All I am seeking to ensure is that unreasonable demands are not made.  I contemplate that all these things will happen whenever practicable, and I cannot believe the Minister would want notice where it was not practicable.  It is clearly desirable that the Minister should have maximum notice of likely developments but there might be cases where the giving of 21 days notice would not be feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> In a sense this is the reverse of the argument the Minister was putting on section 4.  He will recall that on section 4 where I was seeking consultation with the unions, the Minister's response was that things could crop up as a matter of urgency and an instant decision would have to be made and we could not have consultations procedures because they could slow things down.  That argument carried the day.  If that argument was valid as to why there could not be an absolute obligation on him to consult, then equally it is the case that there should not be an absolute obligation on the operators to give notice.  They should give notice wherever practicable since there may be emergencies when they would need to move fast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we are asking for notification, not necessarily consultation.  In this way the inspectors would know who is moving installations around in our waters.  The subsection provides that where the owner of an offshore installation intends to discontinue exploration or exploitation operations he shall give three days notice in the case of the exploration or 21 days in the case of exploitation to the Minister for Labour.  I consider that to be extremely reasonable and it will not create any difficulties.  All we want is that the owners inform the Department when they were moving, 21 days in the case of a major installation and three days on the exploration side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We approach this area in a practical way.  I believe there is a need for taking on board the points Deputy Birmingham made.  The Minister wants 21 days notice when an offshore installation is being established.  As Deputy Birmingham pointed out, an emergency might arise and it might be necessary to bring a second offshore installation into a certain area &mdash; it might be a crane barge or another rig &mdash; which might be ancillary to the work on which the first offshore installation is engaged.  What I am trying <Col N="1476" /> to do here is to eliminate bureaucracy to the greatest extent possible.  Deputy Birmingham's comments of only resorting to these provisions when it is practicable were well made and should be considered by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister and oppose the amendment.  What the Minister is requesting is reasonable. There is a high risk factor involved if the operation is adjacent to a shipping lane and, therefore, it is only right and proper that notice should be given.  My main concern is abandoned rigs.  At present there are rigs abandoned in the North Sea and I am very concerned that this might happen in our waters.</P>

      <P>I cannot see where an owner would not be able to give three days' notice in the case of exploration or 21 days' notice in the case of exploitation. What is involved here is notification. When an owner is leaving a development the inspectorate should have reasonable notice to make whatever arrangements are necessary.  This is a minimum period and I believe the inspectorate deserve that much consideration.  I cannot see that this would raise any difficulties since only notification is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is unanimity in the House that it is desirable that notice be given.  One would hope that in the majority of cases people would be very reasonable and give more than the statutory minimum notice of 21 days or three days.  That is what we should be aiming for.  The information available to me is that emergencies may occasionally arise and something will happen fast.  To that the Minister says his information is that there are no circumstances in which it will not be possible to give the three <Col N="1477" /> days or 21 days notice.  If that is so, my amendment is harmless.  If the Minister's information is right, it will always be practicable to give this statutory period of notice.  If I am right and if occasionally emergencies arise when it would not be possible to give the statutory notice, then my amendment is helpful.  At the very least, my amendment can do no harm because there would still be a statutory obligation on the owner to give notice whenever practicable.  If, as we are told, it is always practicable to give notice, then we are fine.  Therefore, my amendment can do no harm and in some circumstances it might do some good.</P>

      <P>The period of three days' notice applies where a rig which has been engaged in exploration is being moved and the 21 days' notice applies to a rig which is being moved out of an area where it has been engaged in exploitation. I understand that there is also a requirement to give 21 days notice if a rig is being moved to another area to get involved in exploration.  If there is a 21-day requirement in that instance it makes a stronger case for the acceptance of the amendment.  We must take account of the practicalities involved particularly in view of the requirement to give three weeks notice.  That would be very cumbersome.</P>

      <P>In case of an emergency where an owner has to vacate or leave an installation and is not in a position to inform the inspectors that person can make his case and if it is upheld no offence will be committed.  However, we must have some guidelines so that we will not have operators moving around our waters with equipment to carry out explorations.  In my view it is necessary to have the three weeks period.  To the best of my knowledge the Department of Energy will also be involved.  What is involved is a notification process so that the inspectors are aware of what is happening.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) In making regulations for the purpose of paragraphs (a) and (b), the Minister will take into account prevailing international standards and be conscious of the desirability that there should be no divergences between international standards and those applicable in Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is concern in the industry that the certification requirements contemplated by this section could represent a further disincentive to locate in our waters. Apparently, there are all types of recognised international certification procedures in existence and they would have been cleared in many instances before operators come here.  If there is a divergence between our standards and the generally accepted international standards it could mean that people will be obliged to go through what could be a lengthy and expensive process to obtain certification. That seems to be unnecessary.  My amendment states that in setting standards the Minister should take into account the existence of general international standards, that he should, except for a very good reason, accept that it is highly desirable that there should be a uniformity of approach between the Irish and the international position.  Any departure from that could serve as a disincentive to people locating in our waters.</P>

They will be carrying internationally accepted certificates as to their safety acceptability.  I am not trying to diminish the requirements to ensure that offshore installations function to the highest possible standards.  However, we should not insist on people having to comply with another layer of regulations.  It should be possible to detail standards which can be checked <Col N="1480" /> by a new operator and if that operator has complied with those standards in another country we should accept that as a valid certification to operate in our waters. There is a serious possibility that operators will not feel inclined to explore in our waters if they are confronted with a lengthy delay before they are issued with the appropriate certification by the Irish authorities although they may have in their possession certification from another country.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley that we should accept the standards tolerated in other countries. It may be in order to accept the standards that prevail in the North Sea where conditions are worse than an operator is likely to encounter in Irish waters but there are parts of the world where operators are not subjected to the same type of pressure and weather conditions as they would when operating here. Deputy O'Malley seemed to be putting the emphasis on the operator but I am far more concerned with the likely effects on the people working on the rigs which is the primary function of the Bill.  For that reason, it is legitimate to insist on the highest possible standards which would be accepted internationally instead of accepting standards which are not as high.  We must satisfy ourselves that the operation of the rig will comply with Irish standards.  We should not accept a rig which has passed a test in the Far or Middle East where weather conditions are not as difficult as in Irish waters.</P>

      <P>I take the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan.  I did not intend to convey that we should accept certificates, the origin of which we could not be satisfied with.  However, we should accept certification from internationally acceptable authorities and the Minister should decide what those authorities are.  British certification should be more than adequate for operators in Irish waters and it could be a serious disincentive if they had to get further certification to work here.  I do not accept that I am laying the emphasis on the operator, <Col N="1481" /> indeed I confirmed that at all times I am very keen to ensure that the safety standards on rigs should be in the interests of the operatives on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points made by Deputies.  We are interested in safety standards and that is why there must be a certification process.  There are five major internationally recognised certifying authorities and when they come into this country the IIRS will examine the certification procedures to ensure that they cater adequately for conditions in Irish waters.  That is the purpose of the regulations.  I am aware there is concern that certification standards might overlap between the Department of Labour and the Department of Energy and that technical certification procedures might be subject to different standards.  The terms of section 10 (2) of the Bill have been discussed and agreed with the Department of Energy and provide for certification procedures to be embodied in regulations.  The terms and regulations remain to be settled and it is envisaged that the IIRS will, in the case of exploration installations, certify acceptance of an existing certificate issued by one of the five internationally recognised certification authorities.  In the case of exploitation development platforms, it is envisaged that the IIRS will have a more extensive certifying role but one related to prior certification by one of the five authorities referred to.  The requirement in section 10 (1) for consultation with the Department of Energy before making regulations under the section will obviate any question of overlapping.  The Act will require notice of intention to make regulations under section 10 to allow representations to be made by interested persons.  Accordingly, the intention of the amendments is already met by the Bill.</P>

I am sure the Deputy will accept that when the courses were organised and commenced in conjunction with AnCO inspectors those people refused to participate.  The purpose of the course was to improve the standards and provide expertise for those people, who may very well have substantial knowledge.

      <P>My concern is that sufficient and suitable facilities will be provided on rigs.  We have not heard much about this provision but it does not seem to be controversial.  However, I have information that some of the conditions on board leave a lot to be desired. It is essential that the Department inspectors ensure that the highest possible standards be maintained.  Those on the rigs should not be asked to work in conditions less bearable than those provided in factories. Facilities on those rigs should not be so inadequate that there would be risk to health.  People have to work in confined spaces and due to lack of natural light and confinement it is very difficult to work in rigs.</P>

In a later section we provide that the equipment necessary for the workers cannot be denied to them.  The costs will be on the owners whose responsibility it is to see that workers are protected.  The inspectors will ensure that the facilities are adequate considering the dangers and the hazards of the job.  In the normal sense clothing would be of minor importance but here we are talking about clothing of sufficient quality to protect workers against the conditions of their job.  That is why this section has been inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan.  In a sense, most of the concern of the Bill is in the area of high technology and our <Col N="1487" /> anxiety that inspections will be adequate. However, is it possible that by concentrating on those areas we would forget about the more mundane issues dealt with in section 18 which are issues of the most fundamental importance.  The Minister should impress that on his inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to subsection (2) which empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing equipment, clothing and materials to be provided for the protection of workers.  The regulations may require the general issue of such items for certain processes or types of work.  It is not necessary to have regulations in all cases but when this Bill becomes law and when the inspectors examine installations and are unhappy that facilities there are not up to a high standard they can make regulations which can be enforced.  It would be better if that high standard could be implemented without having to make regulations on an individual basis.  The power to do that will be contained in the Act.</P>

      <P>This section with sections 19 and 21 are slightly curious in that they deal with very specific provisions and they do so in what is essentially a framework Bill.  I suppose borderlines can always be drawn but it strikes me as strange that these areas have been taken out and highlighted and not dealt with later in the Schedule, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to gas detection, section 20 seems to cover all installations.  Does this include all installations whether they are manned and whether they are anticipated to constitute a gas hazard?  I am slighty dubious about the wisdom of <Col N="1488" /> going into this degree of detail about some specifics and at the same time leaving other specifics to be dealt with later in the Schedule or by way of regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Birmingham.  These seem to be very specific provisions in what is essentially framework legislation. Presumably these could have been more appropriately dealt with by regulations made under the legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to gas detection, the requirement under section 20 is that all installations should have gas detection equipment on board.  Would this apply also to installations that are mothballed, not in production or do not constitute any kind of gas hazard?  Why is there incorporated in the Bill a very specific requirement which will be placed on the owners of such a rig if it is not going to constitute a hazard?  Why maintain a gas detection device in that case?</P>

Deputy Birmingham asked why these provisions are included in these sections rather than in regulations.  On Second Stage debate I gave statistics to the House on the number of deaths and serious accidents in offshore rigs off neighbouring coasts.  The inspectorate feel that these matters are too important to be left for regulations at a later date, that it is necessary to build them quite clearly into the legislation to avoid any ambiguities. That is why these detailed sections are written into the Bill rather than being left to be dealt with by way of regulations at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This section and the following sections combine to bring into the measure the approach of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, in relation to the notion of the appointment of representatives, safety committees and so on.  Some questions have been asked about the appropriateness of that approach and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this.  The point has been made also that what is involved here is a replication of the Safety in Industry Act and that at the time that Act was passed the construction industry were not regarded as appropriate for inclusion in it.  The argument was that if there were reasons for not applying these provisions to the construction industry, in so far as the offshore area bears any relation to any form of economic activity onshore, the activity to which it most closely relates is the construction industry.  If representative committees are unsuitable for the construction industry why are they suitable for offshore installations?  This is a question which should be answered. It has been commented on that what is involved here is a reproduction of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, but that that Act has been overtaken by the Barrington Commission but that that commission were less than enthused about the way in which some of these procedures were working and held the road open for a much more flexible and dynamic form of consultation.  It has been said that the thinking of the Barrington Commission is not reflected in here and that people have been content to rely on a safety in industry Act on which there have now been second and perhaps wiser thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 23 to 25 are based on similar provisions in the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, and deal with the safety representation required to be brought into force by regulation.  Section 23 allows for selection by workers of safety representatives and deputy safety representatives to represent them in consultations with the installation manager on safety, health and welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> Section 24 outlines the procedures for the selection by the workers if they so wish of a safety committee to assist the owner and the installation manager in securing compliance with all the safety provisions and regulations.  That is something I should like to see, a safety committee in which the workers are directly involved with the installation manager. We can then ensure the high standards that we seek in this legislation.  The committee may appoint a delegate and a deputy delegate.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 25 for the appointment by the installation manager of a safety representative or safety committee in default of any initiative in that regard by the workers, so in the event of the workers not appointing a safety committee the onus is then on the installation manager after a time which is laid down in the section to undertake that task.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) gives the Minister power to limit by regulation the application of the three sections mentioned above.  This permits flexibility depending on differences between installations with regard to the amount of work involved; secondly, the number of workers concerned and, thirdly, the duration of the work.  Sections 23 to 25 nevertheless have met with some opposition and Deputy Birmingham has asked some questions on these on the basis that the sections in the 1980 Safety in Industry Act on which they are based are criticised by the Barrington Commission as being unwieldy and inflexible.  A more flexible form is under consideration.</P>
    <P>These sections are based on the Act in existence.  If the Barrington Commission come forward with proposals it may prove the point raised in their criticism and there will be changes then in the law. In the meantime the legislation must be based on what is there, which is the Safety in Industry Act, 1980.  I give an assurance to the House that when the new framework is backed and if we then go away from the unwieldy and unflexible sections criticised by the Barrington Commission, we can strengthen this legislation.  That <Col N="1492" /> review will take place as soon as we are in a position finally to bring before this House legislation based on the Barrington Commission's new health and safety recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's response is adequate.  He categorises as inflexible and unwieldy the provisions in the Safety in Industry Act on which these sections are based.  Yet he proposes to reproduce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me just correct the Deputy.  That is what the provisions are accused of being.  I am not accusing them of being so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected on that point.  There is obviously a substantial volume of opinion &mdash; and I suspect the Minister might not dissent from it, either &mdash; that would categorise these sections as unwieldy and inflexible.  In those circumstances to incorporate them in mid-1987 strikes me as being less than wise, particularly if an alternative approach was open to the Minister given the greater wisdom we now have as a result of the Barrington Commission and given that we know there will be major legislation in this area in the reasonably near future.  It would have been possible simply to say that there will be provision for representation by workers in this area and that the manner of that representation and the rights and duties of those representatives will be determined by the Minister by regulation.  That would allow the Minister to incorporate into the measure the wisdom of Barrington.  No doubt as people attempt to put concrete shape on the thinking behind Barrington, our thoughts will develop as the legislation comes into the House and is teased out.  There will be a deeper appreciation of what is required.  To include the section just on the basis that it was what we had thought worthwhile in 1980 does not seem a particularly good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister comment also on the fact that the construction industry <Col N="1493" /> apparently was excluded from the Safety in Industry Act and that those who are unhappy with sections 23, 24 and 25 say that there appears to be a closer analogy between the offshore industry and the construction industry than anything else? Why exclude one and include the other?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the construction industry would necessarily be a good analogy with offshore workers.  If sections 23, 24 and 25 were to be excluded all the safety regulations in the Safety in Industry Act and the safeguards for workers would be excluded.  However, that is not the point that Deputy Birmingham is making.  His point is to try to have the most up-to-date legislation available.  After the discussions on the Barrington Commission report and when there is agreement on the Safety in Industry (Health and Welfare) Bill it will be possible to reach a conclusion on this, it is hoped, early next year.  The updated provisions for sections 23, 24 and 25 can be taken at that stage.  We can update this Bill at the same time to correct anything that is wrong according to Barrington. The only alternative at this stage would be to exclude them and that I could not undertake.  We would be excluding what are vital safety regulations for offshore workers.  They are based rightly on what is in the 1980 Act and on the present standards for safety regulations in all the other areas.  We have no option but to include these sections but I give the undertaking to the Deputy and the House that in the review of the Barrington Commission report which we hope to have completed within 12 months we will then be able to update this legislation without having to amend it.  In the meantime we must keep the best available.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance that there may be a need to update the legislation and that he will be quite flexible in that regard. With regard to safety on the rig there is reference to death on survival craft. Could the Minister inform the House as to the standards required of those survival <Col N="1494" /> craft?  Will the standards be by Lloyd's rating or something similar? What type of craft will qualify?  I see converted trawlers being used as survival craft in the port of Cork.  Is the Minister happy that the present survival craft available to us is adequate for the needs in relation to any emergency that may arise as a result of offshore activity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that the general structure of the Safety in Industry Act is the best available at the moment.  This is the legislation which should be incorporated on the basis that we can improve as further information becomes available.  Everything we know about what is contemplated in section 25 tells us that it does not work.  It is entirely appropriate that people should have the right to elect a representative, but to suggest that people have a duty to do so takes it much further and all of the evidence on the way in which the Safety in Industry Act has worked indicates that where this operates it is a dead letter.  If workers decide not to elect someone, having someone parachuted on top of them, selected by the operators, will not represent any advance.  People selected by their employers to represent the workers are most unlikely to enjoy workers' confidence. In this case what has happened is that having accepted that one goes to the Safety in Industry Act for a headline, the people copying it went too far.  Everything we know says that this procedure will not work.  We should just drop this section from the Bill and it would be much more sensible.  At the moment it is just a silly piece of bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to keep the three sections together, pending the review.  I do not altogether disagree with some of the points made by the Deputy. There is clearly a need to improve. Section 25 (2) says that there must be consultations so it would not be a question of forcing the workers.  I accept that there are some difficulties.  When we review this in the light of the Barrington legislation we will try to get some formula to overcome the difficulties.  I would ask that these three sections would remain and in the meantime we will try to improve the operation of this.</P>

Would it not be appropriate that the site of the accident be photographed and all relevant measures taken to ensure that all the details regarding the accident and how it occurred would be available to the Minister? I am not trying to minimise this in any way.  If a serious accident occurs of course it should be properly investigated and all the data should be available to the investigating authority but, particularly in the case of an emergency, it could hold up unduly the proper functioning of the installation.  Will the Minister consider waiving this requirement for the two day period and allow the installation manager to have the site properly recorded in terms of measurement and photographs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification on section 34 (4) which reads:</P>
      <P>In the event of the employment of a person in contravention of section 14 of this Act by a person other than the relevant installation manager, that installation manager shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the employment of under-age employees, person under 18 years of age.  If, for argument's sake, the owner <Col N="1500" /> of a rig employs a person under 18 years of age this section seems to be making the installation manager liable for the offence even though the employer is in charge of both the under-age employee and the installation manager.  Is there some sort of conflict there?  It appears contradictory to some extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is brought to his attention that the worker is under 18 the installation manager who is in charge of the installation is responsible for bringing that to the attention of the owner.  I assume that the responsibility is on him to do so, but the offence would be by the owner because if he has employed a person and has sent that person to the installation, all the installation manager can do is to highlight that the regulations have been broken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of owner is the management of the installation. That is quite clear, but if somebody under 18 is working on the installation then under this section the installation manager has the obligation to inform the owner that that is so.  That is his duty.  In a legal case the person responsible for breach of the Act is the owner if the installation manager has fulfilled his duty of informing him.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister conveniently to hand a summary of just what are the penalties?  I am sure they are provided here but I cannot put my finger on them.  Am I right in thinking that the maximum fine on indictment for any offence is £2,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> It seems that in many cases we are talking about a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment because the culpability will rest with the company rather than with any individual and by definition, you cannot put a company into prison.  In the case of a particular blatant, premeditated breach by, say, a very large company, it seems a penalty of £2,000 might prove quite inadequate.  Why has any maximum fine to be stipulated?  I understand why there is a need to provide that, in the case of a summary prosecution, there should be a maximum fine but in the case of a conviction on indictment why is there a need to include a maximum fine?  Why not leave this to the discretion of the court?  It is possible to envisage circumstances in which there would be an overwhelming case for swingeing penalties and those penalties could then be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by a number of Deputies during the course of the Second Stage.  In relation to the penalties for convictions for summary or indictable offences the jurisdiction of courts is prescribed by legislation, the most recent limits being laid down by the Courts Act, 1981.  I am advised that the arrangements prescribed in the Bill before the House are in accordance with the Courts Acts.  Section 39(9) of the Bill provides for continual offences and section 39(10) empowers a court to impose an additional six months prison sentence where an offence is likely to cause death or serious injury, to cause a dangerous accident or to endanger safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate sanction against a persistent offender, however, could be said to be section 42 which empowers an inspector to impose such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements as he considers necessary to safeguard safety and health and, in the case of any danger or risk of danger, to request measures to be taken to deal with it.  The inspector may also apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting continuance of activities carried <Col N="1502" /> on in contravention of an imposition or requirement.</P>
    <P>While the fines covered by the Courts Act, 1981, are not as large as I would like them to be, there is a power to impose an additional six months prison sentence where the offence is likely to cause death or serious injury or where an accident is likely to endanger safety.  It also covers powers of prohibition, restriction or requirement as are necessary to safeguard health and in the case of danger or risk of danger measures can be requested to deal with it.  The inspector may apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting the continuance of activities which are in breach of an imposition or requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction but I do not think the Courts Act can be relevant in this case.  The Courts Act as far as I can remember, deals with what can happen in the District Court where a case is heard without a judge and jury and because of the Constitution only limited penalities can be imposed.  Therefore there are lower penalties provided for wherever the conviction is a summary conviction.  What is contemplated here is a more serious offence that is tried by a judge and jury of the Circuit Court.  In the event of a conviction there I do not see any obligation to limit the discretion of the judge.  It seems it would be open to a fine at the discretion of the court so that in the worst cases very severe penalties can be imposed.</P>
      <P>In almost every case that comes before the courts it is much more likely that the culprit will be a company rather than an individual.  Even if the finger of blame can be pointed at some individual, in most cases that individual will only have been carrying out his duties, however incompetently.  One of the really serious offences that one can imagine would be a calculated decision by an operator to engage in a course of action that was dangerous.  If a court found that was the case I think they would want to impose severe penalties, and I do not see why, as an Oireachtas, we should prevent them from imposing such penalties.  I do not see any need whatever for the restriction.</P>

It is proper that we should pass this legislation but the fact that it took as long as it did means there have to be serious doubts about our capacity to legislate in this area outside the jurisdiction.  It is much better that that be put beyond doubt now than that if at some stage in the future there was a major disaster and a judicial inquiry was established it was to emerge then that the legislation was invalid for constitutional reasons.

These proposals will encompass the various levels within the education system and will primarily involve both short and medium term strategies for development and reform in the education process.  I will be outlining these to the Dáil when presenting the Estimates for my Department on Tuesday next.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that the Minister will be giving us the benefit of her deliberations next week. That is very good news indeed.  Might I ask her if, in the preparation of her priorities and programmes for education, she has studied the latest progress report issued by her Department in February on <i>The Action Plan for Education 1983-87</i> published a few years ago?  The Department have produced a regular report each year.  Has the Minister looked at that progress report because it is very comprehensive and indicates what has been done over the last few years and what is on the way to being done?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that everything in my Department written about education will be studied by me and carefully taken into account.  As I said on the last occasion when oral questions for my Department were taken I am not bound, nor are my Government, within any given Department, to any proposal of any Minister.  I will be making up my own mind, establishing my own priorities and strategies for dealing with educational matters in consultation with my departmental officials, taking all the available data into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks with such chaos and confusion being caused in the <Col N="1506" /> education world about the new cuts that are being announced all the time, does the Minister not think it would be very important to make a more comprehensive statement than simply a small announcement in an Estimates debate which, of its very nature, is rather brief? Would the Minister not agree that people in the education world need to know where they are going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely refute the allegation that there is chaos and confusion within the education system.  I am relatively satisfied that, since assuming office, I have conducted extensive consultations and negotiations with all interested parties in education.  Indeed I have been very heartened by the immediate and favourable response by the various interests with whom I have had such discussions.  It is interesting to note that in those discussions many interested parties have expressed the view that such discussions have constituted the first consultative arrangements that have been made by any Minister.  It is my intention not just to meet them initially but also to continue to meet them during my tenure of office.  Might I suggest that the question relates to <i>The Action Plan for Education 1983-87</i> and that I have made a statement on that matter.</P>

I recall that it took some considerable time for the previous administration to produce such an action plan.  I will be outlining, in the course of my Estimates speech next <Col N="1507" /> week, the broad strategies I will follow in what I hope will be a lengthy term of office.  In answer to the question the Deputy posed I can say: yes, most certainly the areas about which he speaks will be carefully borne in mind by me and my Department in establishing priorities.</P>

May I repeat my question as to whether the Minister, in saying that she is keeping these areas in mind and giving them priority, is reversing the announced decision to limit priorities to two other areas and not to extend priorities to these especially important ones?  I hope I have now spoken loudly enough for the Minister to hear.  I am sorry for being so far back but there are reasons for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the importance of removing barriers to gender equality in the education system is one of the Government's highest priorities.  My own Department are very conscious of the continuing need to highlight this problem and take every opportunity, through the inspectorate, special projects, inservice training etc., to draw attention to the problem in order to increase the awareness of all concerned &mdash; educators, parents and young people themselves.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that provision of £60,000 has been made in the 1987 estimates in order to promote a programme of equality of educational opportunity during the current financial year.  I feel that this allocation compares very favourably with the figure of £30,000 provided in 1986, while no special allocation was made for this area in 1985.</P>
      <P>We have planned, and already initiated, activities at both national and international levels for 1987 despite the critical financial constraints within which the Government are working, and of which the Deputy is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the national level, I have agreed to <Col N="1511" /> extend the scheme of pilot intervention projects in the physical sciences.  The aim of these projects is to increase the number of girls studying in this area.  In September 1987 the scheme will be initiated in two additional regions, viz. the south-east and in Cork city.  In effect this means that in the second year 1987-88 there will be six project schools each in a different region and about 15 associated schools, that is, schools acquiring advice /assistance from the project schools, within the scheme.  I arranged for my inspectorate to conduct a monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the scheme recently and the results to date have been most encouraging.</P>
    <P>Indications are at this stage that the Department are moving in the right direction with regard to the promotion of the physical sciences in girls' schools.</P>
    <P>All management training provided by the Department for senior school staffs will incorporate specific study of the role of school management in the elimination of gender inequality in educational provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming wholeheartedly the Minister's statement that this programme remains a priority, I would like to ask one question.

I have taken steps in my Department to reactivate the working group on equality and have requested the committee to report to me outlining possible strategies which might be implemented to bring about greater equality of educational opportunities.  In 1986 my predecessor expended the sum of £14,000 approximately on the equality programme and this year I intend to expend £60,000 on <Col N="1512" /> this provision and on the examination of equality opportunities.  This is a programme in which I have taken an enormous personal interest, which is evidenced in my reply.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that one of the major simplifications she could introduce would be to increase the grants available for those who find it difficult to get into third level education because of their means and who cannot afford to get into third level education under the present grant system?  Is the Minister considering simplifying the system to cater for students who may qualify for entry to a course at third level but cannot attend because the <Col N="1515" /> points they obtained in the leaving certificate do not qualify them for the grant?

Surely the Minister finds it incompatible with simplification of entry procedures to third level education to revert back to manual collation of results of the leaving certificate by cutting the £500,000 out of the Estimate for computerisation on which great progress has been made?  Will the Minister agree that it makes a nonsense of simplifying entry procedures to have staff collating those results manually and have the entire system out of kilter with the CAO who operate on a computer basis?

      <P>My question, No. 4, asked about the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to simplify the entry system to third level education.  There was no explanation in the manifesto as to what was meant by &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; and I assumed that what was meant was making it easier for students to get into <Col N="1517" /> third level education by reducing the fees or increasing the grants.  Does the Minister propose to do that before the next academic year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees, and the rate of grant, have been announced.  The Deputy asked about the simplification of the entry system and I pointed out that that matter is being considered by the task force.  I understood the Deputy to mean that he was concerned about the admission procedures to third level education.</P>

      <P>It was slightly mischievous of the Deputy to frame the question in the way he did.  The Deputy will be aware that the colleges and the DIT have a simplified system of entry.  They deserve great credit for doing that.  I hope the task force enlarges on a more coordinated type of third level entry system.  In my view this is a little premature because the task force are debating this topic.  We should all look forward to their report.  I accept that there is great public interest in this matter and I hope the recommendations of the task force are issued very soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My suspicion is that a number of school children are not aware of the grants that are available.  It is because of that I should like to ask the Minister to prepare a list of the grants and scholarships that are available and publish them in booklet form to be issued to school principals and career guidance <Col N="1518" /> teachers.  It is important that those who qualify for grants are aware of them.  I appeal to the Minister to issue that booklet early in the next academic year because I consider it a matter of fundamental importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of merit in what the Deputy has said and it appeals to a logical mind, which I hope I have.  It makes sense to have details of all grants and scholarships on one sheet.  I should like to tell the Deputy that that information can be obtained from the Department, VECs or county councils.  The suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that grants and scholarships are paid by many sources I should like to ask the Minister to consider paying them from one source.  Will the Minister accept that such a procedure will result in a saving? In my view it will eliminate bureaucracy and will result in all the money going directly to education.  I should like to ask the Minister a question in regard to the ERASMUS scheme of scholarships announced by the European Council of Ministers and adopted by them at their meeting on 14 May.  A figure of £65.5 million is involved but there seems to be no information as to how this money will be channelled through and how this grant will be made available to students.  There is basically a lack of information of any kind.  Will the Minister ensure that this vital information becomes available as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's desire that all grants should be subject to and issue from one admissions office, that may well be stage 2 of the deliberations of the task force.  We are awaiting the result of their deliberations of stage I which was the applications <Col N="1519" /> system.  It may well follow, taking cognisance of what they say, that the Deputy's idea could then be looked at.  The Deputy's second point related to ERASMUS; I was very pleased to be present at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels at which ERASMUS was decided upon and finally approved.  I cannot say it was because I was there &mdash; perhaps it was &mdash; but it was a follow-on to work done by previous Ministers and it was particularly fruitful for me to be present.  The amount of £65.5 million will be spread over three years to members of countries in the EC.  It will allow for the transfer of a young person, man or woman, between a third level institution in Ireland and the other countries or <i>vice versa.</i> It will not be an extension to a course; he or she will go for a period of their course and will receive credits from the third level institution to which he or she goes.  It will have enormous cultural, social and educational advantages for this country bearing in mind that we have the largest number of young people of student age.  A European committee and an Irish committee will be set up to deal with the co-ordination of the scheme and, in particular, to deal swiftly with the applications for the coming academic year because a certain proportion of that money will be devoted to such applications. The committees will be addressing themselves urgently to their task and the institutions concerned will receive notification in respect of the applications. The scheme was announced only recently and will require to be worked out. However, it is one of the good news stories from the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I understand that the pupil/teacher ratios for post-primary schools in Northern Ireland vary between 14.8 and 15.5 depending on the category of school.

The Deputy compared us with other European countries. Many of those countries achieved their more favourable ratios because of a drop of pupils and students in their classrooms.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education when construction of the new replacement national school at St. Paul's, Lisduggan, County Waterford will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position at this point in time to say when construction of the new replacement national school at St. Paul's, Lisduggan, County Waterford, may commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that a sketch scheme has been prepared for a proposed extension <Col N="1529" /> to the national school in question, and is regarded as acceptable in principle by my Department.  My Department expect, as soon as the usual check on enrolment trends at the school has been carried out, to be in a position to negotiate with the school authorities for a suitable local contribution towards the cost of the project.  The project can then be listed for preparation of the tender documentation.  My Department will be in touch as soon as possible with the school authorities about these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very unsatisfactory reply.  Is the Minister aware that this school serves 600 pupils and that there are 12 prefabs, six of which are at present unusable because they are falling asunder?  A new school is needed immediately.  Is the Minister aware that half of the prefabs are not fit to be used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of the situation with regard to this school and that it is far from satisfactory.  However, it is not any worse than the situation in many schools &mdash; far too many schools &mdash; throughout the country.  It is at an early stage of planning by comparison with quite a number of projects which are ready for tender at this stage.  The Deputy's Government allocated all the money available before they left office so it leaves me very little room to make any progress in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's party are the Government now.  It is their decision. I ask the Minister to visit this school because he is obviously not aware of the conditions.  I said that six of the classrooms are not fit to be used.  Will the Minister give us an undertaking that the new school project will be allowed to go for tender before the end of this present year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to projects for tender is that there are approximately 60 projects ready to go to tender at present and they must be dealt with first.  It is only when they are dealt with that we can move on to projects <Col N="1530" /> which are further down the line.  I am in agreement with the Deputy on the need to proceed with tender documentation for this school but, as the Deputy is well aware, the school is only one of several hundred.  It is estimated there is a backlog of perhaps up to eight years at present in school buildings which require to be improved.  The resources are limited but we are in the process of attempting to reduce costs in order to move that backlog faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is a major school in Waterford city and that the prefabs referred to by Deputy Deasy were built 20 years ago as an interim measure?  Twenty years later they are still there, six are unusable and the remaining six are fast approaching that point.  There will be no place to facilitate the students in the area.  The Minister mentioned 60 other schools going to tender.  Does he expect all those to go to tender in a short period of time?  What is the time gap?  Will this school not go to tender until all those schools have been facilitated?  Where exactly does a school of the size and importance of St. Paul's in Waterford stand with regard to the Minister's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The speed at which projects will go to tender will depend on the amount of finance made available.  I might remind the Deputy that this party's policy is to reduce the amount of finance to be made available for this kind of project.  It comes down purely to a question of the resources decided on for spending.  I did not notice a great degree of urgency over the past four years with regard to planning of this project.  It is not any more urgent now than it was four months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister attaches some importance to this question which I believe is extremely urgent for a great many teachers who will be unemployed in the next few years.  Is she aware that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in California has said that California will need 90,000 teachers in the next five years?  However, Irish teachers are not recognised for teaching in State schools in California. This strikes me as needing urgent attention. Secondly, I would like to inquire about the progress made towards gaining recognition abroad for the Higher Diploma in Education and, if progress is being made, will the Minister immediately enter into discussions with the universities to examine what is the problem regarding the Higher Diploma in Education and its recognition abroad?</P>

      <P>I said in my answer that I am prepared to accept in principle the report on this matter.  It now remains a matter for further deliberation between the board, the Department and, most of all myself, because this is a highly important matter.  It represents a huge change in the examination system and I am sure, a desirable one.  It is a change which will not be precipitated by me so that the correct procedures will not be adopted.  I regard it as a very meaningful and important step forward.  It is a change that must be investigated fully as to its implications for the school system.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister remains very much in charge of matters such as this.  I hope that my ongoing discussions with the Curriculum and Examinations Board will arrive at a conclusion so that the implementation date will remain as envisaged.  There are points which still have to be worked out.  The previous Minister and myself have accepted in principal the recommendations with regard to the proposed implementation dates.

This acceptance of the proposal was announced by the previous Minister on 11 November 1986 with a statement that discussions would be held in the Department. I would like to ask the Minister if the Department have written to the board or had discussions with the board on this question.  The board put back the implementation date from 1991 to 1992 so as to ensure that schools and parents were informed in plenty of time that this course would be coming on stream and that the children entering the junior cycle in schools in 1989 would be coming into the new system.</P>

      <P>I have already initiated discussions with the various interested parties.  Yesterday I had a very full and fruitful discussion with the joint managerial bodies with regard to the projected timetable for the implementation of this examination.  The previous Minister correctly took his time in agreeing to the proposal which was put forward by the interim board.  He took some months to come to an agreement as to whether he would endorse in principle the proposal the board had put forward in relation to a common examination &mdash; a general certificate of education &mdash; to replace the group certificate and the intermediate certificate.  I propose in principle to accept this proposal and to engage in very full discussions with all of the relevant bodies.  This issue does not involve only the Curriculum and Examinations Board, myself and the Department of Education: it involves the joint managerial bodies, the parents, the teachers and the young people who will sit the examination.  There are very sensitive and protracted negotiations to be held.  I remain satisfied that the overall parameters of the timescale as envisaged by the board are the ones which will be followed and which will then issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>An essential part of the movement to this new certification course is that assessment procedures have to go hand in hand with it.  I would like to ask the Minister if she is proceeding along the lines recommended by the board and previous Ministers that the assessments for the examination will be put under the direction of the Curriculum and Examinations Board at the first possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different question from one about whose aegis this examination will be carried out under.  It is a question to which I will address myself in due course.  With regard to the question of assessment, many of the subjects already lend themselves to an element of assessment.  Some subjects are more suited than others to such system.  The question of a furtherance of the component of assessment in the various subjects which are suitable for that remains one which will have to be correctly addressed.  There is a huge interest in this matter.  The wider public need to be reassured on every aspect of the examination and the correct procedures to be followed.  I remain very committed to the idea of the introduction of the common examination but I remain much more committed that it be done correctly with very full deliberation. Increased assessment remains one of the issues which will have to be dealt with at great length and authenticity if the examination in its final form is to emerge with authority.</P>

Does she see these boards as a model for future developments in that direction and does she see the participation of teachers and parents' representatives on these boards as being useful to the future development of education? Does the Minister see these boards as being mechanisms whereby the gap between the world of school and the world of work can be narrowed and as a useful way in which there can be a more integrated approach to the problems of discipline and sex education in our schools?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question impinges upon many areas.  I am satisfied that the boards of management are meeting the hopes and expectations. I agree that all the schools under the aegis of the Department of Education serves not just an educational but a community interest.  As a matter of interest, in line with my policy of meeting constantly with all of the interested groups I had a very fruitful meeting recently with the executive of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools.  We discussed many items of importance and I reiterated my interest in such schools.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barnes is not here.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill into the Dáil and to welcome the opportunity which we have awaited for a long time to see progress on treating all children of this nation equally as I know we are all in spirit committed to.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to introduce speedily this Bill before the House.  It had received substantial treatment in the Seanad.  I am glad there is a broad consensus on the need to reform this area of child law, and that all that remains is to work out the details of this legislation and implement it as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill has gone through the full process in the Seanad and some debate in this House, it is important to look at the reasons we are attacking this problem and the need there is to address it.  I was involved in 1979 with Young Fine Gael in their campaign to raise public consciousness and the commitment of our party to reforming this area of law.  At that time even to use the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; was considered rather forward.  It was something people preferred to forget about, a closet problem.  Times have changed substantially and attitudes and social practices have changed a great deal but the law remains the same.  The law is over 100 years old and reflects none of the changing attitudes.  To this day tens of thousands of Irish children are discriminated against under our laws because legislators have failed to act in this area.  We have a Constitution which delcares that all citizens shall be equal before the law.  For the full existence of this State to date we have accepted that a large section of our young people who were born innocently into a situation which is not covered by the laws which protect children born inside marriage <Col N="1577" /> were discriminated against fundamentally. It is difficult to know exactly how many children we are talking about, but an increasing number of children are affected by the disadvantages associated with being born outside marriage.  The figures in front of me show that in the seventies there was a steady increase in births outside marriage from 1,709 to 3,000 at the end of that decade, and in the six years of this decade the figure has increased to 5,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Our complicated marital situation which makes no provision for legal remarriage, while there is a provision in Church law for annulment and remarriage, has led to an increased incidence of children being born outside marriage to perhaps very committed and caring parents who within the limitations of the laws at present cannot have the full relationship of parent towards their children in the context of full guardianship and full inheritance rights without having to go through very complicated legal procedures. Therefore, that we are dealing with this problem is all the more welcome.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the debate we should consider exactly the discriminations these children are suffering from.  The discriminations range from status to very real legal limitations on their rights and entitlements.  It has been long accepted in our society, to our shame, that, while we have that wonderful aspiration in our Constitution towards all human persons as equal before the law, for too long we tolerated discriminations imposed upon innocent children whose accident of birth led them to be outside the law and outside the recognition and protection of society on so many fronts.  We simply accept that some are more equal than others.  At last here in this House is full consensus on the principles, and all that remains is to discuss the issues.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the many debates we have had on social affairs have led us to face up to what is often a hypocritical and doublethink approach to many of the issues.  If we are to value human life, this practice of discriminating against children on the basis of the circumstances of their birth <Col N="1578" /> over which they had no control is most reprehensible, least sensible and has done nothing to encourage the protection and nurturing of life which was expected of mothers who found themselves faced with the prospect of bringing up their children as second class citizens.  Their children would be considered less acceptable somehow than others.  Whatever legislative changes we make here today will not change entirely the social attitudes but the social attitudes themselves have been changing.  The legislative changes will be an important step in giving a lead to public attitudes and ensuring that at least in the letter of the law these children will have equal status and equal rights.  Therefore, I welcome many of the substantial changes that were made in the Seanad.  I would have been very unhappy to speak to the original Bill, but I commend the Minister for her willingness to accept amendments and I commend all of the Senators who contributed so substantially and moved so many important amendments to this Bill in the Seanad which led to legislation emerging from the Seanad very much more like the legislation I would like to have seen presented in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In relation to status it is important that two things were done.  The proposal to replace the words &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; with &ldquo;marital&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; was done away with and is gone from what is before us.  Let me draw the Minister's attention to what is perhaps an error in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill &mdash; unless I have read the wrong explanatory memorandum &mdash; where there is still a reference to the illegitimate child.  Later I will draw attention to the section concerned.  The second thing is the statement in principle within the title and in other areas that this Bill aims to ensure that from now on children will be treated equally regardless of the marital status of their parents.  That is part of all of the legislation in this regard in other countries such as New Zealand where this issue was tackled some years ago.</P>
    <P>We have made important strides, in that when we first discussed changes in this law many people suggested that the <Col N="1579" /> fabric of our society and the fabric and institution of marriage would be threatened. I am glad that that hysterical fear has been overcome, perhaps because of the extent and broadness of the debate in the intervening years and the fact that we had to face some very difficult questions about our attitude to social problems and the need to support the pro-life position that we have taken constitutionally. While status and attitude are of importance the most serious practical problem of the illegitimate child is that of its right to food, clothing, shelter and security which was until now threatened from birth.</P>
    <P>The child born outside marriage &mdash; the illegitimate child as exists in Irish law today &mdash; is discriminated against in substantial areas. The child is discriminated against, not just on the basis of status to which I referred and the stigma attaching to it, but in the area of maintenance, where it has full rights to its mother but very limited rights only to the father if an affiliation order is made.  It has full maintenance rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mother but no inheritance rights at all from the father and has limited inheritance from the mother.  There is no easy legal way of providing a relationship in any full sense with its father.  Even where there is a willingness on the part of parents to acknowledge their children, where they may have been living together in a longstanding relationship unable to marry because of our outdated and outmoded marital laws, they are not in a position to easily establish a legal relationship and responsibility for their children without going through complicated procedures.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the provisions of this Bill deal with all of those major areas.  The acknowledgment of the responsibility of a father to fully maintain his child and for the child to have rights of inheritance constitutes a very important step.  I am glad it is central to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the one remaining area of disagreement in regard to guardianship the balance in the Bill is moving broadly in <Col N="1580" /> the right direction.  I support the view that automatic, full guardianship rights sought by some people are not necessarily in the best interests of a child.  This is an area we can re-examine on Committee Stage.  Many of the amendments effected in the Seanad have facilitated a situation in which, in reasonable circumstances, it is rendered as easy as possible for full guardianship rights to be given to a responsible father who is interested in having that kind of relationship with his child or children.  Acknowledgment of the inheritance rights of a child born outside marriage is a natural corollary and is to be welcomed in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The need to move in this direction has been recognised by many bodies in our society, not least by the Family Law Reform Group of the Episcopal Council for Social Welfare who, as early as 1974, said that they regarded it as unChristian that children born out of wedlock should, as a result of the actions of their parents, be victimised by legal distinctions between them and children born to married parents.  This sums up the main argument for reform.  The provisions of the Bill before us go a great distance to achieving that and will be seen as a major chapter in child care legislation in this country.  This issue is one that has been argued again and again by all those involved in this area.</P>
    <P>Inevitably the provisions of this Bill and other legislation in the offing, the promised Adoption Bill, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill and what might be called the children's justice Bill &mdash; will involve more and more litigation within the courts system in relation to families.  The fact that children and families have to have cases heard in the current courts structure has long been seen to be totally unsatisfactory.  In the context of marital or family problems it has been viewed as a most unsuitable environment in which to resolve any of these sensitive issues.  It is intimidating for families, particularly for children; an environment which is hostile to agreement.  The adversarial atmosphere, in the company of <Col N="1581" /> criminals of all types, is a totally unsuitable environment in which to deal with such delicate problems.  All Governments in recent times have been committed to having a proper family courts structure established.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to ensure that any legislation which arises as a result of this and other Bills dealing with the family and children will mean that such cases can be heard in an environment that is more compatible and suitable to the proper resolution of these sensitive problems.</P>
    <P>I should also like to examine the section in relation to the establishment of paternity, the proofs that will be allowed in that area and the allowance for blood tests.  There has been quite an amount of development in recent times in tissue testing.  The provisions should be framed in a sufficiently broad manner to allow such tests to be utilised, rendering it unnecessary to effect minor amendments in the near future to allow for the full scale of tests which may help to decide a paternity suit speedily and rapidly.  Tissue testing has become more sophisticated and reliable.  It is clear there should be provision made for that in the Bill when we proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Most of the substantial amendments have been made in the course of the Seanad debate, which means we have a Bill before us proceeding broadly in the right direction.  We shall have an opportunity of going into detail on the various sections on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to reply in particular to the points I raised in relation to family courts, letting the House know his views on and commitment to them.  It need not necessarily constitute an expensive option, perhaps a co-ordination or streamlining of existing services, identifying particular members of the Judiciary who may specialise in that area, thereby ensuring the evolvement of a certain consistency. There is at present an outrageous lack of consistency in family and other cases, <Col N="1582" /> when there may be quite different outcomes depending on whichever judge one appears before.</P>
    <P>There is also the physical structure of the court to be taken into account.  Unlike the enormous, great old barracks of courthouses, a small suite of offices would be far more suitable and congenial to the handling of family law cases; indeed it would be far more suited to the handling of many legal cases.  Here I am concerned not so much with the outdated trappings of much of the overall courts system but rather with the unsuitability of such a formal and insensitive environment, such a negative and criminal environment, for the handling of family cases.  I make that case very strongly to the Minister and ask him to respond to it.  As we are at present engaged in so much legislation in this area there is a great responsibility on us to ensure that the environment in which such cases will be tested will be such as will improve the quality of life of young people and will not be as traumatic as many of their other experiences associated with whatever family, guardianship or other maintenance problem may have arisen.  I ask the Minister to respond to the overall issue of paternity.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the improvements in the area of registration of births and registration of fathers where there is agreement. Perhaps we could have done this even without the legislation and helped a number of families who are caught up in our failure to deal with the need for reform of marriage law.  That change was a decision of the Irish people and I campaigned strongly to have it brought about.  However, it leaves us with a consequential legal mess where many established couples live together in a totally unrecognised situation.  If this Bill will not sort out their problems in relation to each other, at least it will ensure that the children involved are not discriminated against.  For that reason it is very welcome. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on Second Stage and to further detailed discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am glad to contribute to this very worthwhile Bill.  As other speakers have said, it is probably one of the most enterprising and interesting pieces of family and social legislation to come before this House in the last number of years.  It proposes major changes in the rights of children born outside marriage and it tends to equalise the rights of children born outside marriage with those born within marriage. This legislation is in response to a change in attitude of Irish people towards children born outside marriage and also to the cohabiting of persons outside marriage. There is a general softening of people's attitudes towards people who are, to use the old phrase, living in sin and towards the products of a union of this kind.</P>
      <P>There has been a radical change in social attitudes even within the past ten years.  It is unlikely that a decade ago this Bill would have been welcomed and discussed as constructively as it was last year in the Seanad and also in the early part of this year.  I welcome this change of attitude.  It is a sensible, constructive and compassionate change.  It maintains our progress as a young, open-minded nation and is surely part of our moving closer to Europe and moving away from isolation and isolated attitudes.  This shift in thinking is due in part to the increasing number of cases where people are living together outside marriage either because they choose to do so or because by law they cannot choose any other status which allows them to cohabit legally.</P>
      <P>The number of births outside marriage has accordingly increased dramatically. This has forced our nation and the people in it to rethink on old attitudes.  The day when a child born outside marriage was regarded as a social outcast is now gone. Being born outside marriage does not attract the same stigma that was obvious in Ireland some decades ago.  It is good that the shift in opinion and the social attitudes should be reflected quickly by our legislation and this is what is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all well aware of what happened in other countries in relation to <Col N="1584" /> this type of legislation.  There was a demand for this legislation and it is good that legislation should be considered sensibly and without acrimony.  The passage of the Bill through the Seanad points clearly to the maturity of the Legislature in dealing with this type of sensitive legislation. The contributions of the Members of the Seanad were most enlightening. The debate was constructive and resulted in a number of substantial amendments being made to the Bill.  This certainly has relieved this House of much of the work which otherwise would have been necessary. As an aside, the debate in the Seanad shows the usefulness of that House as part of our legislature-making process.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing in one sense that this Bill could not succeed in abolishing illegitimacy altogether.  The reality is that the institution of marriage is enshrined in our Constitution, that it has a paramount importance in the Constitution.  All our attitudes are debated along the idea of the family.  Accordingly, there always has been a difference between the social position of a child born outside marriage and a child born within marriage.  We can do nothing here to change that social attitude but we can help to bring it along a bit further.  We must remove as far as possible all legal discriminations against children born outside marriage.  We should try to afford equal rights to children born outside marriage as are afforded to those born within marriage.</P>
    <P>We cannot do anything about the terms of abuse that are used against children born outside marriage or legislate to prevent such terms being used.  However, it is good that the emphasis nowadays is on caring about the child who is a competely innocent party in society.  This Bill reflects a new perception about the status of children born outside marriage and reflects a new perception of the position of children and their treatment in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers many areas including guardianship of children, maintenance of children and the property rights of children. It does not abolish illegitimacy but it amends the law in relation to it.  Part I <Col N="1585" /> of the Bill which includes sections 1 to 5 has been amended comprehensively by the Seanad.  It is welcome that the concept of marital and non-marital status was deleted during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad.  To have maintained this distinction would have been to maintain, in a most important piece of legislation, a distinction between children born within marriage and those born outside marriage.  Although there is still, and will be for some time, this distinction in people's minds it is good that the present Bill should pave the way in some ways to a change in the attitudes of society towards this distinction.</P>
    <P>If the social thinking of the last decade or so in relation to this legislation, and this legislation is a part of that thinking, is maintained we can look forward to the day when the distinction will be eliminated. I hope the social thinking of society will lead to this position.  The wording in section 3 in particular is clever.  It focuses on the relationship between a child and its parents and it declares that the marital status of the father and mother shall have no effect on the relationship between the child and its parents so far as the law is concerned.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the amendment of the Legitimacy Act, 1931.  The amendment has the overall effect that subsequent marriage of the parents of a child born outside marriage will always render that child legitimate irrespective of the marital situation of the parents at the time of birth.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with guardianship.  This part is one which has provoked much debate.  The debate centres on whether the father should have automatic guardianship. The argument in favour of automatic guardianship is that the father should be equally entitled to have the same rights of guardianship as the mother and that there should not be created a certain discrimination between the rights of the father and the mother in this respect.  The argument against automatic guardianship is based on the reality that outside marriage a child born of a relationship is normally looked after by the mother while in the majority of cases, the <Col N="1586" /> father avoids or disclaims his obligation or interest in the welfare of either the child or the mother.</P>
    <P>Within marriage there is an implied agreement between the father and the mother that they will work for the welfare of the child.  There is no such agreement implied within a relationship outside marriage. Bearing a child outside marriage can be a traumatic experience for many mothers and it is desirable that there should be no undue interference from fathers who may not be acting in a constructive and helpful manner.  It is desirable in all cases that the rights of father and mother should be equalised, but in this case a distinction must be made as reality demands it.  The welfare of a child in matters of guardianship is the first and paramount consideration.  A court, in considering the appointment of a father as guardian must bear this in mind. Again, the father's appointment as guardian by the court can be terminated on the application of the mother where the interest of the child demands this.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes further by providing that there will be simplified and informal procedures in appointing a father as guardian by the court where the mother consents and the father's name is on the birth certificate.  It has been argued also that the consent of the mother and the presence of the father's name on the birth register should be sufficient to have a father appointed as guardian without the necessity of going to the courts.  I do not accept this at all as it is the interest of the child that is at stake and a court must be satisfied that this is what is respected in any application to the court.  The mother's consent may be influenced by many factors, not all of which might be good, particularly when she is in a difficult and emotional period immediately after the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the section dealing with the position of the father of a child of a void marriage or of a voidable marriage which has been annulled.  It is proposed that the father in such a situation should be guardian of any children of the union jointly with the mother.  This does not seem to be consistent, in my opinion.  The <Col N="1587" /> father would seem to be maintaining a privilege that he never had in the first place and might only now have in certain circumstances proposed by the Bill.  It is desirable that there should be consistency between all relationships that are outside marriage.  It is inconsistent that a marriage that has been declared to be null and void by the courts should now be treated as if it were a marriage in this respect.  Another anomaly may be that children of a void marriage or a voidable marriage which has been annulled may attain rights in relation to succession after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Act deals with maintenance and the principal provisions relating to maintenance of a child born outside marriage are contained in the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, as amended by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  This part repeals the 1930 Act and replaces it with new provisions similar to the provisions contained in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, relating to children born within marriage.  This part is particularly to be welcomed in that it replaces the present law in relation to affiliation orders, the contents of which were repugnant to many people in their operation.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the affiliation order allowed the mother of a child outside marriage to name a man as the father thus allowing the payment of sums for the support of the child.  The evidence of the mother in obtaining the order had to be heard and, more importantly, corroborated. Accordingly, the procedure towards the obtaining of an affiliation order was a nightmare for most mothers in that she had to relate what in many cases was a sorry affair and, moreover, had to drag in third parties to corroborate her story.  Again, there were time limits within which a mother had to apply for an affiliation order.  This again was restrictive and unjust in my opinion, and it is to be welcomed that time limits for applying for maintenance are now abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> This part of the Bill puts the parent of a child born outside marriage on the same footing as the parent of a child born within marriage in relation to the maintenance of that child.  The working of this part is admirable and should go towards relieving the distress of parents left in the lurch financially.  The question of whether a man is the parent of a child is now to be decided on the balance of probabilities, the ordinary standard of proof required normally in civil proceedings. This is to be welcomed and is consistent with the general spirit of fairness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with property rights.  Normally property rights in this country are controversial.  The discussions in relation to property rights in this Bill up to now have been heated. Reading the Seanad debates one sees most of the discussion related to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Where a parent makes a will and does not appear to treat a child within the marriage fairly, the child can, under section 117 of the Succession Act 1965, apply to the court for just provision out of the estate of the deceased parent who did not make proper provision.  A person born outside marriage to this parent will have the same entitlement to apply to the court to have proper provision made for him or her.  Consistency is shown here. This provision is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>On intestacy, the rules of succession will now apply to all persons whether a person's parents were married or not.  So a child born outside marriage will have the same entitlement as a child born within marriage where a will is not made. Again, this is consistent and is to be welcomed. Up to now a child born outside marriage could not benefit under the rules relating to intestacy.  The only relieving provision contained in the Legitimacy Act, 1931, was that the sole child of the deceased intestate mother could take her share in that mother's estate.  This removes major discrimination against children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The one area which has proved quite <Col N="1589" /> controversial, and indeed remains controversial, is section 27 which states that the principle that family relationships should be treated without regard to the marital status of a child's parents should apply to all wills and other dispositions made after the commencement of Part IV except where the contra intention lies. If a person makes a will before the commencement of the Act and is deceased before the commencement of the Act, then the following statement in his will will be construed as applying only to children born within the marriage: &ldquo;I leave all my property to my children in equal shares&rdquo;.  If the will containing that sentence is executed before the commencement of Part V, but the deceased dies after the commencement of Part V, then the position is the same as the first example, that is, only the children born within the marriage shall benefit, despite the fact that the deceased may live for 30 or 40 years after the commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is argued in favour of the section that, as the Law Reform Commission on illegitimacy put it, to do otherwise would unsettle the law.  There has also been a warning that to do otherwise as is provided in this section would be unconstitutional. Against this section it is argued that if we are to be consistent in relation to the operation of section 117 of the Succession Act to wills, then we should be consistent in relation to this section of the Act and apply this section to all wills, whether made before or after the operation of the Act.  I wonder would this section, if it was applied to wills executed before the commencement of the Act, unsettle the law or would it be unconstitutional?  It may very well settle the law in people's minds if everyone was aware that this section applied to all wills no matter when made.  Personally, I would be against this suggestion because retrospective legislation, in my opinion, is to be avoided if at all possible.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of people in this country think that once they have signed their will they have automatically transferred to the beneficiary in the will what they express to be transferred on death.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> This of course is a completely erroneous perception, but nonetheless is still there. It must be made clear that a will speak's from death.  It is a worthless piece of paper having absolutely no effect until the testator dies.  It is very important that people realise that a will has no effect until death, that the beneficiary has no right to anything left to him in the will until the person making the will dies. However, again, I feel that to make this section retrospective would be a detrimental move and it would give a new meaning to wills already made.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the amendment which will be proposed to section 28 in relation to protection offered to trustees and personal representatives.  I agree that the provision is too wide and should put more of an onus on trustees and personal representatives on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that where a person whose parents have not married each other dies intestate the father of the deceased may be considered unworthy to share in the estate of the person on application to the court.  I would agree with this section so long as the operation equally applied to the mother of the deceased.  There does not seem to be any good reason why it should not equally apply to the mother and the father.  I will deal with this issue later.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with the declaration of parentage.  This area provides that an application can be made to the Circuit Court for the sole purpose of obtaining a declaration that a named person is the parent of the applicant.  At the moment this declaration of parentage can only be achieved as part of other proceedings not primarily concerned with the issue of parentage but concerned with other matters such as maintenance or succession. This is a welcome provision in itself although it is not clear how practically useful it will be.  Confidentiality in relation to the natural parents is maintained by excluding adopted children from the classification of persons who can apply under the new procedure.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Act deals with blood tests and has given rise to some heated discussions.  In legal cases involving <Col N="1591" /> parentage the blood test can be very useful, and with technological developments is very accurate, in establishing parentage but what should be done if a father refuses to give a blood sample? Part VII allows the court to draw whatever inferences it thinks appropriate from a refusal to give a sample.  This might not seem a very effective penalty but I can envisage a court using its power to draw inferences from the refusal very wisely and very widely.  It has been suggested that there should be a specific penalty as there is where a person refuses to give a blood sample in a drunk driving case. There is no room for a penalty of this nature in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 47 abolishes the presumption of legitimacy arising out of marriage and illegitimacy arising out of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> This is replaced by section 49 providing for presumption of paternity and non-paternity, that is where a married woman, or a woman whose marriage terminated less than ten months beforehand gives birth to a child, her husband will be presumed to be the father of her child.  In a case where the husband and wife are living apart under a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> for more than ten months before the birth the husband will be presumed not to be the child's father.</P>
    <P>The focus is maintained on the parent rather than the child.  Generally, I feel it is desirable that children born outside marriage should not only have access to the same maintenance provisions as children born within marriage but also their parents should have the same access to provisions such as barring orders and protection orders.  These are matters which are dealt with in the Bill.  They, perhaps, should be dealt with in another piece of legislation which I suggest should be looked at by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a number of other matters raised by previous contributors to this debate.  For instance, section 34 proposes to insert a new section 120 (a) into the Succession Act. I have to agree with the comments of <Col N="1592" /> Deputy Shatter, that this proposed section will in effect create a new discrimination in our family law system. Why should the provisions of this section be restricted to an &ldquo;unworthy father&rdquo;?  Is it being suggested that a mother cannot be unworthy?  Like Deputy Shatter, I am well aware of many cases of unworthy mothers both inside and outside marriage. This section must be changed in this regard and I concur with the suggestion that while we are at it we could also extend the &ldquo;unworthy parent&rdquo; idea to intestate children who are born within marriage.  Again, a suggestion which bears merit is that the father and mother of an abandoned child may also be unworthy to inherit the estate of that child who dies intestate.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago a Private Members' Bill dealing with adoption was defeated in the House after the Minister for Health undertook to bring in a new Bill in the near future.  The Minister should consider including in that the recognition of foreign adoptions.  I understand that because of the diminishing number of suitable children for adoption here childless couples are resorting to going abroad in order to adopt a child.  In such a case a question as to the status of those children arises.  Surely this is an opportunity to settle the matter once and for all?  The Bill, as drafted, does not deal with the ever-increasing incidence of artificial insemination by a third party donor.  That process may not be relevant in Ireland yet but I have no doubt it will in years to come.  We have an opportunity in the Bill before us to settle the possible complications concerning the status of such children.  I appeal to the Minister to try to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the rationale behind this Bill, the Law Reform Commission in its report on illegitimacy recommended as a basic proposal that it was unjust for the law to distinguish between children on the basis of the marital status of their parents.  This Bill has the effect of clearing up the distinction and possibly doing away with it altogether.  As I and other speakers have suggested, there are a <Col N="1593" /> number of areas that need to be looked at before the Bill can be regarded as a complete piece of legislation on the status of all children and, I hope we shall get our chance on Committee Stage to suggest possible amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Deputy McCartan and for that reason my contribution will not be long.  I should like to express my general support for the Bill which I consider to be a worthwhile and necessary attempt to put right an injustice that has existed long after the attitudes which gave rise to it have died out.  Undoubtedly earlier generations had a narrower, more precise and, if I may say so, less compassionate notion of what constituted a family and in many cases there was a genuine and praiseworthy desire to do everything possible to preserve and defend this notion of family. However, I have always felt a little uneasy about our approach to the subject. I have a strong feeling that many of those who professed a strong attachment to the family were at least as strongly attached to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the family, as the Constitution states, is the basic and, indeed, the necessary unit on which society is built but society is nothing more or less than the sum of the rights, duties and contributions of the individuals who comprise it.  It is of paramount importance that each individual in society be given the same access to justice, equity and fair play unless by some conscious act he or she is disqualified from enjoying full participation in society.  A child born out of wedlock, however conceived, is no less entitled to justice, equity and fair play than any other member of society.  It is an outrage to suggest that there is any basis in justice for restricting the rights of such a child because of the actions of parents.  All children of this nation are equal in the law and in justice and it is a pity that such a self-evident fact should need to be upheld in statute.  It is to our discredit that for generations we have played around in such a cavalier fashion with such fundamental rights supposedly <Col N="1594" /> so that the property rights of legitimate children, or indeed legitimate relatives other than children, could be assured.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill are less than satisfactory.  That may be of necessity or it may be that there is no better way of ensuring the rights of all children than the way proposed in the long and complex series of amendments to other statutes. It is a pity that a simple declaration that all children, irrespective of the circumstances of their conception, are equal and full members of society could not be formulated.  It appears to me that the Bill is a positive goldmine for lawyers, requiring as it does interpretation and definition of every paragraph.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a few specific points.  Part IX regulates the procedures for registration and re-registration of births.  I was of the opinion that the primary purpose of registration was simply to place on record the true particulars surrounding the birth of a child, the date of birth, the name of the parents and the name of the child.  All other purposes seem to be secondary to this yet we have a wealth of variations, conditions and exclusions.  It should be mandatory, in all cases, to record these details accurately and in full.</P>
    <P>If there is doubt or dissent regarding the identity of the father the procedures in this Bill for establishing paternity should be invoked and the name of the person identified as the father should be entered in the register.  If we seek to treat all children equally we must start at the beginning and record their entry into the world in a uniform fashion.  Not to do so is to commence, at this early stage in the child's life, a judgmental process which will continue to colour the whole future of the child.  I ask the Minister to consider whether it would be possible to further examine this point.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the anguish and distaste which results from such circumstances as rape and incest but a child is not in any way responsible for the nature and circumstances of its conception.  To conceal the facts of its parentage is a bad and <Col N="1595" /> unfair principle and is a more grave stigmatisation of the child than almost any other imaginable way of recording its birth.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part III of the Bill dealing with guardianship, I am concerned &mdash; as are the Government in promoting this Bill &mdash; that the interests of the child should take precedence over all other interests.  That is not to say, however, that other rights should not be considered. There is an inclination to disregard the rights and the very strong feelings of fathers in regard to the right of access and guardianship of the child, a point referred to by Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges that children of parents who are unmarried should, for all practical purposes, be treated in a similar fashion to all other children.  How can a child of an unmarried couple be treated in a manner equal to a child of a married couple if the law goes to such lengths to distinguish between married and unmarried parents?  There is a basic and serious contradiction here which the Bill fails utterly to address.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, as the Minister acknowledged when introducing Second Stage, recommended that all parents should be guardians of their children. The Minister suggested that the reason behind this recommendation appears to be a desire on the part of the Law Reform Commission for consistency. This is less than fair to the commission and I argue that a positive acknowledgement of the rights of parents lies at the heart of this recommendation. A clear and simply stated positive right to guardianship of a child is a much more satifactory basis on which to safeguard the best interests of a child than the negative proposals contained in Part III. Could the Minister not devise a simple procedure whereby both parents are required to take on the duties of support and guardianship while, at the same time, allowing the parent or any person with just reason, to seek in the Circuit Court to have the right to guardianship restricted or removed in such circumstances as <Col N="1596" /> the court deems appropriate?  We are, whether we like it or not, moving into an era in which more and more children will be born to parents who have stable relationships but who are not married to each other.  It is contrary to the general trend in social and family justice that a father in such a relationship should have to vindicate in court a right to guardianship over his own children.  It would be better if such a father could avail of a positive legal right to guardianship.  The Bill should contain a procedure to protect a child where there is hostility, unwillingness or danger.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that there are unmarried fathers who feel the same sense of obligation to the children as most unmarried mothers.  It would be a pity if this reforming legislation, which will undoubtedly be the basis of our approach to the status of children and parents for many years, failed to acknowledge the position of such fathers.  I urge the Minister to re-examine this section of the Bill with a view to implementing the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged for the opportunity on behalf of The Workers' Party to welcome the reintroduction of the Status of Children Bill, 1986.  It was a real fear that the change of Government would allow the opportunity for the forces of religious and social bigotry to exert their sinister pressures and to have this Bill consigned to the shelves and lost in the bustle of Government change over the last few months that have seen, so far, the loss of many fine reforming pieces of legislation of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated for reintroducing the Bill.  It must be noted that a number of personalities are no longer in the House and that as a consequence, we can expect a constructive and useful debate to ensure the safe passage of the Bill.  This must be assured as law reform in this area is long overdue. One could be cynical and say that the impetus is due in no small part to the ever increasing numbers of single and two <Col N="1597" /> parent families rearing children born out of wedlock, and to their increasing poiitical presence.  However, one can certainly say that were it not for the case the Johnson family brought against Ireland before the European Court of Human Rights this &mdash; or the last &mdash; Government would not have given to this social issue the attention it deserves and which it is now getting.</P>
    <P>Will it take the same action to have the Adoption Act brought back to the tracks as it is long overdue?  It should be noted that when the Government moved to defeat the Adoption Bill introduced in Private Members' time a few weeks ago, an undertaking was given that within a week of the end of that debate a Government Bill would be introduced but we have not yet seen it.  The delay must be condemned.</P>
    <P>The delay generally in respect of the reform of the law in regard to illegitimacy is also to be condemned; 1979 was the Year of the Child and the Government assured us that we would have not just a single Bill but a charter of legislation to cover all aspects of the rights of children. They said that such legislation would be introduced within the year.  It is remarkable that this simple Bill is stated to be the response of this House to a 1982 report of the Law Reform Commission. Can any of us be happy that the reforming process of this House turns so slowly and ineffectively, if at all?</P>
    <P>In the context of the delay, it should be pointed out that we are now seeking to legislate, not for a report of 1982, but in response to the campaign of Cherish who were established as far back as 1972. Great credit must be given to that organisation who have campaigned through thick and thin over 15 years for changes in the law and who, in the meantime, have provided much practical support and help to single parents in the last two decades.  Without Cherish and their campaign it is very unlikely we would have had this Bill before us today.  In addition, without the courage of Dr. Johnson and Janice Williams who took on the establishment in Europe, we would not be dealing with the Bill either.  The position <Col N="1598" /> of the Johnson family helps to amplify a very often forgotten point, that illegitimacy and all its insidious discriminations follow children right into the heart of the homes of two parent families and is not just confined to the single parent family.  The Johnson family is only one such example and it must be emphasised that until we bring all our laws &mdash; in the words of the Minister when introducing the Bill &mdash;&ldquo;in line with modern social justice&rdquo;as the Bill hopes to do, we will not finally secure the total abolition of the insidious discrimination against children born out of wedlock.  Clearly this House and the country will inevitably have to deal with the introduction of civil divorce as a right and remedy for people who have taken second chance marriages and established stable family relationships and who by current social justice as perceived by Government must be condemned to begetting children born out of marriage.</P>
    <P>This puts to the real test the commitment of Fianna Fáil as to the overall concepts of social justice they plan for all our children.  This and the delay of 15 years since Cherish first called for reform of the law highlights the shallow commitments given by successive Governments to real reform in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister wants to conclude the debate in order to assist in the quick passage of the Bill to Committee Stage, when I am sure many of us will have useful contributions to make, I will make a number of points briefly on some of the provisions of the Bill.  The House must reiterate its appreciation of the very good work undertaken by the Seanad when they considered this Bill in 1986. Many excellent contributions were made there in regard to tidying up and clarifying many aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As many Members have suggested, the Minister should consider the whole area of children born by way of artificial insemination.  Though this issue is not staring us openly in the face, it is no doubt a growing one that will be of far greater importance later.  This should be considered when we come to amend some of the provisions now in the Bill.  It will not <Col N="1599" /> require any major change.  In regard to tests for the establishment of paternity, the limitation of the section to blood tests alone obviously must be enlarged to cover the tests by skin scraping and DNA fingerprinting to which previous contributors have referred.  In time, that will be the emphatic way to put paternity beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his officials to consider the reinstitution of lump sum settlements.  It would be an alternative and useful provision.  Retrospective legislation dealing with wills has been referred to.  There will be difficulties but it is something we should address on Committee Stage.  In regard to the matter of testimentary provision, the protection of personal representatives is too restrictive and I hope it will be dealt with seriously on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I borrow from Cherish in their response to the 1986 Bill when they highlighted the need to give effect to this corpus of legislation through court procedures. Eventually, perhaps, there will be no way around that.  Constitutional rights are involved and must be dealt with.  The rights of individuals must be arbitrated through our courts system. Regrettably, lawyers will have to be involved some will say, but very useful practical steps can be taken by the Minister to deal with court procedure.  The introduction of proper courts and the proper environment in existing courts will be very important: we must engender a proper environment in our courts and more easy access for litigants who seek redress under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Legal aid will have to be looked at seriously as a means of ensuring that no one in any way will be inhibited or deterred from bringing applications before the courts because they have not got the money available to them.  The Government, in order to bring forward the spirit of what has been talked about &mdash; bringing up-to-date the concept of social justice in regard to children &mdash; should engage in a real programme of education so that we will not give just lip service to the whole issue but will ensure that at the <Col N="1600" /> end of the day, by reason of our actions and our legislation, all the children of this nation, irrespective of parentage, will be treated equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister wishes to reply this evening.  If he would like to reply I will not deter him. However, I understood this debate would be continued for some time.  I am glad we are being given the opportunity to deal with the subject matter of the Bill. It is unique in so far as it has the support of all parties in the House.  That in itself is a good thing because it shows the commitment of the parties to update legislation in relation to children, to remove from our Statute Book once and for all a piece of legislation that was degrading and insulting, particularly in a caring Christian country, in which so many people subscribe to the idea of a republic which cherishes the rights of everybody equally, irrespective of their religion or the circumstances of their birth.</P>
      <P>Illegitimacy has no place in that kind of society and it has been a stigma from which many Irish children suffered.  The parents of many adopted children felt embarrassed and angry when it came to their first communion and birth certificates were sought by teachers or the schools.  It had to be shown that children were in some way illegimate.  I know that caused much upset to many people.  In so far as we will remove from the Statute Book a symbol of something that was more relevant two centuries ago than ten years ago, I am very pleased about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate did not begin on this Bill: it began three or four years ago in various referenda.  Unfortunately there are still people in our society &mdash; I am glad they do not have support in this House &mdash; who believe it is right to discriminate against children on the basis of their birth.  I am delighted such people do not exert political influence in this House as they did in the past, that once and for all we politicians can come together on an all-party basis and show our recognition for the rights of children, a voiceless majority in Ireland, who do not have representation, who were not in a position <Col N="1601" /> to lobby or to stand outside the gates of this House during the course of the recent Adoption Bill to seek to have changes, to have their rights enshrined.  We are starting the process of introducing legislation in relation to children.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill was amended in the Seanad.  Although I believe in and support the idea that we do not need a second House, when Senators do good work they deserve our praise and our support.  In so far as Senators took this matter so seriously and saw to it that &ldquo;marital&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; were new words for &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; which have been removed substantially from the Bill, and, we hope, from legislation that will follow the Bill, I am delighted.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions in relation to the Bill.  Has he sought legal advice to ensure that the Bill will not in any way cause constitutional problems in regard to Article 41?  That Article gives inalienable and imprescriptible rights to parents in families based on marriage.  Will this Bill be open to any challenge?  I know everything is open to challenge, but does the Minister believe there is a realistic possibility that this Bill would be found in any way to be unconstitutional?  I hope that will not be the case.  The members of the Supreme Count who adjudicate on these matters are given flexibility to interpret the Constitution in a fair and responsible way, subject only to the common good.  I hope they will not find this Bill to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Though welcoming the proposal to recognise the rights of the natural father, I think section 11 does not go far enough.  It allows for a court application by the natural father with special rules for determining such applications, the mother consenting in writing and the natural father being registered as the father of the child.  Could we not go further and avoid the need for a court application by providing that the natural parents enjoy joint guardianship if the couple were living together at the date of birth and the father is registered as the father.  For too long we have allowed <Col N="1602" /> natural fathers in these circumstances to run away from their responsibility.  We have assumed they do not want to honour their responsibilities.  When they do, it should not be necessary that they would have in all cases, particularly when they are living with the mother at the time of the birth, to go through a very long and detailed court process.  I hope we can remove that particular requirement in relation to those fathers.  I shall be putting forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the case of intestacy, when a child dies and his parents are entitled to inherit his estate, it should not again be assumed that it is always the mother who honours the responsibilities and that there is never a case where a father does.  The father, in order to get the same rights as the mother, has to go through a different process and a different procedure.  I am not in favour of legislation that in any way is sexist either against women, and it usually is, or against men.  I would like to think we can have legislation that does not discriminate against anybody on the basis of gender.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points about which I am concerned but I shall use the opportunity of going into these matters in greater detail on Committee Stage which I hope we shall be dealing with shortly, whether before the recess or not. I hope the Minister will then be open to suggestions from other parties and willing to take on board worthwhile amendments made by Members, which some Ministers are not.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,595,945,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1987 is for a net sum of one thousand, five hundred and ninety-five million, nine hundred and forty-five thousand pounds <Col N="1604" /> (£1,595,945,000) pounds.  The Government are providing £49.6 million pounds or 3 per cent more than on last year's outturn.  This Estimate is the general taxpayers' contribution to financing social welfare expenditure this year.  It is equivalent to some 62 per cent of the total. Of the remaining expenditure, 26 per cent or £670 million is met by employers and 12 per cent or £310 million by employees through PRSI contributions. When account is taken of this and various other minor sources of income, the total social welfare bill comes to £2,600 million.</P>
    <P>Who pays for social welfare?  I would like to illustrate the contributions made by the different contributors to social welfare expenditure because I think that it is important to be clear about what money is coming in and where it is going. The situation can be illustrated as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> With regard to using resources effectively, the magnitude of this existing expenditure has to be borne in mind when considering improvements in social welfare. This specific point was made by the NESC (&ldquo;A Strategy for Development&rdquo;), which commented that the sheer scale of the social programmes is such that modest developments in social policies can have significant budgetary implications.</P>
    <P>Given the level of this expenditure, it is more important now than ever before that every social welfare programme without exception be examined to ensure that the resources involved are directed to those in greater need.  I am also concerned that all administrative costs are examined in detail and that areas where savings in administration can be made without affecting efficiency of the service are identified.</P>
    <P>With regard to broadening the social insurance base, expenditure is, however, only one side of the coin, the other being the income or revenue side.  Additional expenditure on social welfare can be financed only through additional contributions or through extra taxation.  I am examining the question of broadening the social insurance base to bring about a greater degree of equity in the financing of social security as a whole.  At present, the self-employed rely on means-tested social assistance pensions and on whatever private pension arrangements they may make.  This leaves many of the self-employed and their dependants without adequate insurance cover and having to rely on means tested old age and other payments.  The cost to the general taxpayer of non-contributory old age pensions this year is £286 million.</P>
    <P>Both the Commission on Social Welfare and the NESC referred to the need for broadening the social insurance base. The National Pensions Board are also at present examining this issue in the context of a report they are preparing for me on the provision of pensions related to earnings.  There are practical difficulties in this area but I am examining this area to try to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> As regards the economic climate, this year's budget was the first step in our <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We had to take tough decisions to ensure that a stable course was charted for the future. We have to accept the need to contain the overall level of public expenditure. This level depends on the performance of the economy and clearly our present levels of expenditure and debt could not be afforded and demanded corrective action.</P>
    <P>Total current Government expenditure has risen from less than 30 per cent in the early seventies to over 41 per cent in 1980 and to nearly 50 per cent in 1986. This resulted in an increase in the current budget deficit from less than 1 per cent of GNP in 1970 to 8.5 per cent in 1986. The decisive action taken in the budget will reduce this budget deficit to an estimated 6.9 per cent of GNP this year.  This action was essential to ensure the firm financial base which is a prerequisite for our <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement will be reduced from 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 10.7 per cent this year. Our approach is the only way when one considers that our national debt now stands at £25 billion and costs the State nearly £2 billion annually to service.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Government's strategy is to achieve growth in the economy and provide employment.  The fiscal measures taken in the budget to bring spending under control are inter-linked with development measures which will lead to faster economic growth.  There are already very definite positive signs of a response in the economy.  Exchequer borrowing is being reduced.  There are signs of increasing business confidence which will lead to a pick-up in investment. Inflation has slowed to around 3 per cent and interest rates have responded to the measures taken in the budget.  In addition, further improvements are expected in the level of our exports.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there is now a general level of awareness of what needs to be done.  We have set the scene for recovery and we are now vigorously implementing our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which will benefit the <Col N="1607" /> whole community.</P>
    <P>On the 3 per cent general increase, the major provision in the budget was for a 3 per cent increase in all weekly payments from July, at a cost of some £30 million this year.  In the present financial climate the scope for increases in expenditure is very limited.  Deputies will remember that the Coalition were not prepared to give a general increase until November with consequent hardship for the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>Our 3 per cent increase will maintain the real level of payments of over 700,000 social welfare recipients as it is in line with the expected rate of inflation in the year ahead.  It also maintains the significant increase in the level of payments which has been achieved over the last ten years.  Over that period there has been an increase of over 44 per cent in real terms in payments to the long term unemployed. Other long term payments have increased by over 50 per cent and short term payments by about 34 per cent.  All these are real increases and I might add that it was the increases given by previous Fianna Fáil administrations which contributed most significantly to the general level of real increase which has been achieved over the last decade.  It is my intention that adjustments in the social welfare area in the coming period will provide greater scope for improving the position of those on the lowest levels of payment.</P>
    <P>The second main improvement which I am making is in the family income supplement scheme, at a cost of some £1.5 million.  This scheme provides cash support for workers with families who have low incomes and who are only marginally better off working than if they were claiming social welfare benefits.  I am concerned to ensure that workers who are married with children and for whom the extra income from employment over and above social welfare payments is marginal, have every incentive to take up work by availing of the benefits under this scheme.  Having such workers productively employed is beneficial for the workers themselves, their families and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we expressed our commitment to this scheme.  I will be closely reviewing its operation, particularly with regard to the poor take-up on the scheme.  Only some 5,600 families availed of the FIS during last year despite the extensive advertising. To encourage wider use of this supplement I have substantially increased the amount payable from mid-July.</P>
    <P>The rate of supplement is being raised from a third to 50 per cent and there are also increases in the prescribed income limits for qualifying for FIS.  As an example of the effect of the improvements which I am introducing, a married man with five children on a weekly gross income of £135 and a take-home pay of about £114 will be entitled to £28.50 per week as a supplement from mid-July as compared with £15 at present.  This is clearly a major benefit to workers on low income who have a family to provide for.</P>
    <P>Another major improvement in the social welfare system which I am bringing into operation from October next is the extension of the treatment benefits scheme to dependent spouses of insured persons.  Under this scheme insured persons qualify for dental treatment, optical treatment and the provision of hearing aids.  The scheme is of tremendous practical benefit to insured people and provides a very visible return for the contributions which they pay.  I believe that the benefits of the scheme should also be available to dependent spouses, particularly women in the home and I am delighted to have been able to make provision for it this year.  I regard this step as a major and historic breakthrough especially for women in the home.  About 300,000 dependent spouses will be eligible for treatment as a result of the extension at a cost of £1.5 million to the social insurance fund this year.  Those who will benefit will include not only the dependent spouses of people who are actually at work but also the dependent spouses of unemployed people who were in insurance and of pensioners.  The wives of the unemployed and of contributory <Col N="1609" /> old age, retirement and invalidity pensioners will all become eligible for dental and other treatment benefits.</P>
    <P>This is a very positive move by the Government and there is widespread support for it in the Oireachtas and in the community in general.  There have been consistent requests for this extension from many groups, particularly those representing women who are working in the home.  Many thousands of these women have suffered too long because they have been deprived of access to State-funded services in the past, especially dental services.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the extension of benefit to spouses will involve the revision of the formal agreements under which dentists and opticians contract to provide these services to eligible persons. New agreements, providing for the extended eligibility, are being prepared at present and will be sent shortly for signature to the dentists and opticians on the Department's panels.  Other dentists and opticians who are not on the Department's present panels may, of course, also apply to enter these agreements and thereby become members of the relevant panels.</P>
    <P>This year's budget provided for significant improvements in the social welfare area &mdash; when viewed against the current economic climate.  Our record in this regard is consistent with the priority Fianna Fáil have given down through the years in good times and bad to safeguarding and whenever possible improving the position of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>As well as improving the level and quality of our services it is very important that we try to ensure that people who are forced to have recourse to the social welfare system are not locked into a situation of permanent dependence on social welfare payments.  People must be able to look with confidence to the future. The new Jobsearch scheme is a major initiative designed to help people who have become long term dependent on unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Up to now the attitude adopted by the State towards the unemployed was, <Col N="1610" /> generally speaking, a paternalistic and passive one.  It ensured that they had a certain basic income and it provided guidance and training services through the National Manpower Service and AnCO.  It was left largely to the initiative of the unemployed themselves to seek employment and to avail of the various facilities provided by the State.  These agencies are now giving a priority to the long term unemployed to enhance their capacities and prospects in an increasingly competitive jobs market.</P>
    <P>The concept behind the new national Jobsearch programme is that the resources in the State agencies dealing with the unemployed &mdash; my Department, the National Manpower Service and AnCO &mdash; should be used directly and actively, rather than passively, to help those out of work, especially those unemployed for some time, in their search for jobs.  This is the first time that the various agencies involved have come together in this way to help those who need them most.  The aim is that by the end of December next 150,000 of those on the live register, especially the long term unemployed will have been referred by my Department for interview by the National Manpower Service.  This interview will help each one to assess his or her qualities as a potential employee and assist in the search for work.</P>
    <P>To cater for those for whom it is not possible to find employment immediately, the programme provides that 40,000 manpower scheme opportunities will be made available for those interviewed together with 12,000 places on the new Jobsearch courses.  The Jobsearch course involves a four week programme of practical instruction on how to look for a job backed up by career advice, interview skills and assistance in self-presentation. There is free access to newspapers, telephones, typing and photocopying facilities, postage and travel allowance.</P>
    <P>This course was introduced on a pilot basis in three centres &mdash; Letterkenny, Tallaght and Limerick.  A survey of those who participated showed that they regarded the courses as helpful.  Over 80 <Col N="1611" /> per cent believed that they were worthwhile while 76 per cent stated that they got greater confidence in looking for a job.  These pilot schemes provided a basis for the design of the new scheme with 12,000 places now being made available as part of a national programme.</P>
    <P>The programme is fully operational and 26,000 people had been interviewed up to 5 June.  Almost 7,000 of these have been referred to job vacancies or to placements in social employment schemes or training programmes.  A further 1,538 have entered Jobsearch courses.  Over 3,000 have been referred back to social welfare for review and decision on their entitlements.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Jobsearch programme is to be of positive and practical benefit to unemployed people.  I accept, however, that there are some persons who are not genuinely available for work or genuinely seeking work and yet they continue to draw their unemployment payments each week.  Such persons will, of course, come to my Department's attention through refusing to attend the Jobsearch interview or to accept a job or a place on a Jobsearch course, or a manpower programme.  Those who put themselves in that position will have their claims reviewed by a statutorily appointed deciding officer who will examine each case in the light of the individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that this is the normal practice followed by my Department in all cases of that nature.  There is no way in which anyone can deprive a person of what he or she is statutorily entitled to under the Social Welfare Acts.  Where the deciding officer is satisfied that the statutory conditions as regards availability and &ldquo;genuinely seeking work&rdquo; are not being fulfilled, unemployment payments will be withdrawn.  However, as in the case of all deciding officer decisions, the normal right of appeal is available to the claimant.  I want to stress that Jobsearch is a positive help to those who are genuinely unemployed and seeking work.  They have a lot to gain and nothing to fear from it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> As well as making whatever improvements are possible in the quality of the services I am also very conscious of the need to examine closely the way in which the services are actually delivered to people.  This is important for a number of reasons.  First it is essential that the services my Department provide should be available to people in the simplest and most accessible manner possible.  People should be able to feel that the service is there for them and not the other way around.  Secondly, from the viewpoint of efficiency it is very important that the social welfare system should operate in a streamlined way and that any inefficiency in the way services are delivered should be identified and put right.</P>
    <P>The way ahead as I see it is to provide as much as possible of the services on a local basis in a comprehensive and integrated way.  I will shortly present my plan for the streamlining and regionalisation of the social welfare services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that many of the services of my Department are already provided locally to a considerable extent.  There is a countrywide network of 130 local offices whose main function has been to administer the schemes of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Means testing for the non-contributory payments is carried out by Social Welfare officers who are located at a total of 93 centres around the country.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is also means-tested, is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards through an extensive network of offices throughout the health board regions.</P>
    <P>While there is a good network of offices throughout the country the problem facing people seeking social welfare benefits is the number of different centres they may have to deal with.  Take, for example, a person who is claiming unemployment assistance.  He or she makes a claim at the local employment exchange which must be referred to the local social welfare officer to carry out a means test in the applicant's home.  This can take a number of weeks.  In the meantime, the applicant may be referred to the local <Col N="1613" /> community welfare officer of the health board with a view to payment of supplementary welfare allowance while waiting for the unemployment assistance claim to come through.  The community welfare officer generally carries out an on-the-spot means test and payment is made immediately.  I see a clear need to rationalise this situation where the client is in effect subjected to two different means tests in order to secure unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Discussions have already begun between officials of my Department, the Department of Health and the health boards with a view to rationalising this whole area.  The means tests will be examined in detail with a view to ensuring consistency in their application so that all groups are treated equally.  This examination will also identify the scope that exists for simplifying the criteria and the procedures in use.  This would make for ease of administration and at the same time make the application of the means tests more easily understandable to claimants.  It would in turn reduce the relatively high number of queries and appeals against decisions on means. These discussions will, in particular, cover the ways in which the duplication in means testing carried out by officials of my Department and the health boards can be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>In a number of centres the local employment exchange manager, the social welfare officer and the health board official now work closely together and they have reduced the time taken to process unemployment assistance claims from several weeks to a few days.  This has dramatically reduced the &ldquo;interim payment&rdquo; role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme operated by the health boards in these areas.  Another advantage of this local co-operation is that it provides better control across the various schemes in dealing with fraudulent claims.  I propose to extend this arrangement to other offices around the country as soon as the necessary accommodation and computer facilities become available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> I am also conscious of the need to provide as much information as possible in relation to the services through a nationwide network of information offices based at employment exchanges. I will be anxious to extend the computerised inquiry service which is already in operation.  My intention is to increase the number of points throughout the country at which individuals can receive comprehensive information about their claims and entitlements generally, including claims for persons and disability benefit which are processed centrally in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Developments in computerisation provide us with opportunities to improve the delivery of services.  Computerisation of the employment exchanges is a priority area.  We are also developing computer links to provide closer working arrangements with community welfare officers of the health boards who are often the first point of contact with claimants.  Ready computer access to up to the minute data on social welfare claims enables the community welfare officer to take the appropriate action.  Access has already been provided to the South Eastern Health Board and to some community welfare officers in five other health boards.  It is my intention that access will be available to all eight health boards before the end of the year.  The level of computerisation and of the development of telecommunication networks within the health boards themselves are key factors here.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to develop an integrated approach to the delivery of social welfare services generally through the introduction of &ldquo;One-stop-shops&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have in mind is that, in addition to the normal employment <Col N="1615" /> exchange services, clients would have access to current information on social welfare claims, general information on the full range of schemes and services provided by my Department, onthe-spot means assessments for unemployment assistance together with current information on job opportunities, placements and on the courses which are available through the National Manpower Service.  My objective is that, operating as a co-ordinated team, the various personnel involved would meet the needs of the client quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner at the one location.  A localised disability service where medical certificates could be keyed in locally has also been under consideration and I have made arrangements to introduce this on a pilot basis in Cork later this year.</P>
      <P>The ideal arrangement for the delivery of services at local level is to have under the one roof the employment exchange service including an information officer, the social welfare officer, the community welfare officer and the placement officer of the National Manpower Service.  This could be done fairly easily in areas such as Athlone, Dún Laoghaire and Newcastle West where all services with the exception of the community welfare officer are housed in the employment exchange.  We have identified some fourteen other towns where &ldquo;one-stop-shops&rdquo; could be introduced on a progressive basis.  These are: Ballina, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Thurles, Sligo, Mullingar, Longford, Cavan and Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a more co-ordinated service in the Dublin area presents particular difficulties because of the severe accommodation problems affecting almost all Dublin offices, the much larger numbers attending the offices, the widespread dispersal of community welfare officers around the city and the fact that the majority of clients have to travel to the city centre to avail of the services. However, I am introducing pilot schemes <Col N="1616" /> in a number of Dublin locations to provide the public with a much more integrated and speedy local response to their social welfare needs.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the need to ensure that all expenditure is efficiently used.  I am particularly concerned that advantage is being taken of these schemes by certain husbands who are in a position to support and maintain their families, or at least to contribute to their support and maintenance.  Once the benefit or allowance is awarded these husbands leave it entirely to the State &mdash; in other words to the ordinary taxpayers &mdash; to fully assume responsibility for the maintenance of their families.</P>
    <P>My Department do not have the power to pursue such husbands with a view to ensuring that they meet their lawful obligations. Under the legislation as it stands it remains the responsibility of the wife after the payment has been awarded to seek maintenance from her husband.  In practice wives have not been very successful in obtaining such maintenance. My Department have experienced great difficulty in getting wives to make greater efforts in this regard because of the effects this would have on the wife and her family who very often have more than enough to cope with living from day to day without a husband and father.  Our examination of the current situation has revealed that some deserting husbands have taken advantage of this situation to evade their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been taking place between officials of my Department and the Department of Justice with a view to bringing forward proposals for legislative changes which will give my Department the necessary powers to directly pursue the deserting husbands through the courts, if necessary, to ensure that they make an adequate contribution to the maintenance of their families.  Care will be taken to ensure that any legislative change introduced will not in any way impinge on the rights which the wife would have to pursue the husband for maintenance.  I hope to bring forward legislation in this complex area later this year.</P>

      <P>In April last I launched the first report of the National Pensions Board on the regulation of occupational pension schemes.  The board in their report made wide-ranging proposals for regulating pension schemes in the area of funding and financial security of pension schemes.  There are 520,000 persons or 61 per cent of employees covered by occupational pension schemes.  I am planning to bring in legislation in this area in the autumn and I have asked the various bodies involved to give their views to me by mid June, which is a fairly short time, but since there has been widespread discussion on this beforehand that should not be too difficult, and we should be able to bring legislation before the Government in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Combat Poverty Agency.  As Deputies will be aware, on Monday last I launched the agency's strategic plan which sets out a programme of work for the agency for the three years to the end of 1989.  I welcome the emphasis the agency are giving to community development as a means of combating poverty. This is something I have always believed in and I think that the agency can play a very important part in fostering and supporting the work of groups and organisations working in local areas throughout the country.  The agency are already deeply involved in this area through their involvement with the nine EC projects. In relation to the other aspects of their operations the agency are only getting into a position to begin to work.  I am particularly interested in the role of the agency in relation to research and in particular in the production of well thought out, practical and realistic proposals for action based on sound and authoritative research findings.  The agency will be undertaking or commissioning research in a number of important areas in the immediate future and I am glad to be in <Col N="1618" /> a position to announce that I am sanctioning the appointment of a head of research to be responsible for the research functions of the agency.  I am appointing also a research assistant.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length in my speech with my aim to ensure that social welfare services are delivered as efficiently as possible.  However, I would like to assure the House that efficiency in the delivery of services will not be at the expense of claimants who must receive their legitimate entitlement under the Social Welfare Acts.  One aspect we have to bear in mind is the question of the appeals system and I am undertaking work at the moment to bring new proposals on the appeal system before the House in the near future.  Certainly I will bring my proposals to the Government at a fairly early stage.</P>
    <P>My Department are the largest spending Department in the State and cater for a vast number of clients.  I have outlined some of the main areas but in the short time available it is not possible to cover all of the issues that arise.  I am revising the free fuel schemes with a view to rationalising the present system and removing anomalies.  I am also reviewing the disability benefit scheme and in particular the question of transferring part of the responsibility for the sickness benefit payments to employers.  These matters along with many others are under active consideration.  I look forward to the contributions from Deputies to this debate and commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for a very readable speech &mdash; readable but ungenerous.  The civil servants who wrote it for him deserve to be commended, for they did not write into it the ungenerous political egocentricity which claims all the credit for Fianna Fáil of any good that was ever done in the social welfare area.  It gives no credit where credit is due to the Minister's predecessors. That is something the Minister will learn about and which it will do him no harm to recognise.  He finished his speech by referring to the national Combat Poverty Agency and before that <Col N="1619" /> the National Pensions Board, two very important agencies.  He did not say that they were not set up by him.  He did not give credit for the fact that they were set up by his Coalition predecessor.  He talked about the Jobsearch programme, pilot schemes in Letterkenny, etc.  He did not say that they had been initiated by his predecessor.  He said that most of the growth in real terms in social welfare payments during the past few years was to the credit of Fianna Fáil.  That is not true.  There has been on the part of every Government in the past ten years a very strong commitment to social welfare which has resulted in very major increases in social welfare payments, as the Minister indicated in his speech.</P>
      <P>Having said those few words of criticism I want to get on to a more even, generous and co-operative tack.  The way the statistics are set out in the Minister's speech is helpful and readable and I congratulate him and his officials for presenting them in that way.  I am dissatisfied that we in this House late on Thursday evening for two and a half hours will look in a fleeting way at the Estimate of the biggest spending Department in the State and we will approve it on the nod.  I am very concerned about this procedure.  It is just not good enough that I as the major Opposition spokesman am allowed 20 minutes to comment on expenditure of £2.6 billion of which £1.6 billion is provided by the taxpayer.  It raises the question as to whether the procedures we follow in this House &mdash; or fail to follow &mdash; have contributed significantly to the growth in public expenditure and in the budget deficit which is such an affliction now and will be for some years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider, as I will, whether we should be proposing to our parliamentary colleagues different ways of vetting such an important and extensive Estimate.  I said in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill not so long ago that the Department of Social Welfare should be the Combat Poverty Agency.  Some people may not <Col N="1620" /> agree with me on that.  Some people think it is right that the Department of Social Welfare should be a money dispensing machine to all and sundry, which is what they are.  Certainly the impression one gets is that they do not see a combat poverty agency as their prime, principal and overwhelming role, but their role is to dispense money to some who need and some who do not need.  The Minister illustrates the point about the social insurance fund, a huge percentage of which is paid by the general taxpayer and not by contribution.  Therefore, the Minister comes in here and claims credit &mdash; he is entitled to a certain amount of credit &mdash; for bringing forward the 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments from November to July.  In that he is following the example and pattern of the last decade where on almost every occasion, with minor exceptions, Ministers for Social Welfare have come in here with across the board increases for all people entitled to one social welfare payment or another.  It is administratively convenient to have one across the board increase, I understand the administrative difficulties in doing anything else.  There were times when there was very little between long and short term benefits, a half per cent here or there.  The Minister is giving the same 3 per cent to those living on £36 a week unemployment assistance &mdash; as I said in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, people who are in dire poverty &mdash; as to a person drawing three and four pensions.  I can give plenty of illustrations of that type of person.  It is not fair, it is not just.  Administrative convenience predominates over a burning concern for the poor and for the relief of poverty which should flow daily from the Department of Social Welfare.  None of that came across in the course of the Minister's remarks.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the fact that the Minister has dropped what was in the Fine Gael budget, the special £3.50 living alone allowance for those on unemployment assistance aged over 45, the poorest of the poor.  When I raised this <Col N="1621" /> question in the course of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill the Minister dismissed it because, he said, it was conceded for political purposes to former Deputy Joe Bermingham.  Certainly the then Deputy Joe Bermingham highlighted this matter but he was no longer a Member of this House.  It was known he would not be a Member of this House even when the general election was called.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>And since he is no longer a Member of this House it might be better not to refer to him at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known that former Deputy Joe Bermingham raised this issue and it is to his credit that he did.  I raise these matters to emphasise the Minister's central challenge, that is the need for greater selectivity in his Department.  As he and I have said, his Department is the biggest spending Department in the State.  It is self-evident that spending of that level, given the constraints on the Exchequer, cannot continue and it is also self-evident that we must do more for the poor notwithstanding those constraints on the Exchequer.  Therefore, it follows there must be greater selectivity.  That means extra and sometimes difficult administrative procedures but they must be undertaken.  Undoubtedly such will be facilitated by the continued computerisation of the Department and its agencies.  The quicker a comprehensive network of computers is in place the better so that there can be greater selectivity in targeting the truly poor and needy for even greater help than they receive now and for ceasing to pay across the board increases to those who do not need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be popular with my wife for mentioning one matter which I regard as scandalous, that is children's allowances. We, a country in such dire financial straits, pay out children's allowances to what the late Deputy George Colley once described as well-heeled, articulate ladies, who drive to their local post offices every three or six months to collect their <Col N="1622" /> children's allowance to put into their bank accounts.  I know the arguments in favour of paying all mothers children's allowance.  I know well that most mothers view this as a very precious allowance, especially the majority who have no independent income.  On the other hand we must think of the greater good, the greater need.  It does not make sense. Certainly it is not socially just for us to pay social welfare each month to those who do not need it while simultaneously allowing those in dire poverty to go on needing in desperation.  That is no exaggeration. In my constituency &mdash; and I am sure in the vast bulk of constituencies &mdash; there are many people eking out a living on £35 or £36 a week.</P>
    <P>The inevitable constraints which will be imposed on social welfare spending, just as on all other spending in the State, require that there be greater selectivity. It should be remembered that much of the contributory part of the fund, in fact 11 per cent, emanates from employers. At a time when we have the highest ever unemployment figures, over 250,000, we continue to tax employment at 11 per cent.  That is not the only tax we impose on employment.  It really does not make sense, when we should be taking any and every step to make it easier and less costly to employ people.  It is one of the contributory factors leading to the black economy; it pushes employers into the black economy, to employ people nett of PRSI and tax while the same people draw the dole.  It adds to the bills, to evasion, to the theft and robbery going on and it subtracts from the amount of money available for those genuinely in need.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we are restricted in time this afternoon and therefore, I cannot develop in the detail I would like my views on many aspects of the Department's operations.  I spoke on the Social Welfare Bill about means testing.  I described the different sorts of hoops through which the poor have to jump to get their rights, often subjected to as many as six, seven or eight means tests in a matter of weeks.  The Minister described one or two in his remarks today.  I welcome what he had to say <Col N="1623" /> about the current examination of the whole means test area being undertaken by him in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Health, and the health boards.  I subsequently tabled a question to the Taoiseach on this matter, asking if he would designate one Minister responsible for means testing, having one means test in respect of eligibility for all benefits. The Taoiseach referred the question to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Finance requested me to table the question in another month.  This I have done and it is due for answer in a week or two.  I raise the matter here today because I welcome the movement evident from what the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>He does not, for instance, mention the Department of the Environment.  One area in which people are subjected to a means test is in respect of differential rents.  When a person becomes unemployed he must await notification from the Department of Social Welfare saying whether he is eligible for unemployment benefit or assistance.  He is subjected to a means test in the case of unemployment assistance.  He then goes to the community welfare officer in his local health centre when there is a means test conducted on the spot; sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to determine eligibility or otherwise if the relevant community welfare officer is unsure.  If the person applies for a differential rent reduction he is subjected to another means test by Dublin Corporation or the relevant local authority and is given another set of forms to complete.  If, say, he applies for free fuel or any other assistance, he will then be subjected to further means tests which means he can be subjected to as many as seven different means tests within a short period.</P>
    <P>Apart from the run-around which this means for those on social welfare and apart from the indignity which it implies it also must mean that a huge amount of bureaucratic time will be taken up in the health boards, in the Department of Health, in the Department of Social Welfare, in the local authorities, perhaps in the Department of the Environment and <Col N="1624" /> God knows where else.  I ask the Minister to consider extending his consultations beyond the Department of Health and the health boards and to at least include the Department of the Environment and the local authorities.  I see no reason why there cannot be one means test certificate issued by some agency, perhaps the health board, which should be sufficient for the corporation or the county council and which would hold good for a certain period of time.</P>
    <P>There is one other area which I want to address in the short time available to me and that is a dilemma which I frequently encounter in my constituency and which affects the unmarried mother's allowance and the deserted wife's benefit or allowance.  Very frequently we come across cases where young girls who have had a child or children would like to marry but marriage will mean for them losing their benefit or their allowance. Similarly, there are deserted wives who would like to make up with their husbands or sometimes, less happily, meet up with another man and start again but if they are found out it means they will lose their entitlement.  There is a big inhibition on them to make their lives happier. The alternative is not to marry in the case of an unmarried mother who wishes to do so or not to make up with her husband in the case of a deserted wife who wishes to do so.  It is either that or forego their entitlements or, alternatively, to defraud the system.  I have not got a solution to the problem but it is a problem and a bigger one than we might like to pretend.  These are areas of sensitivity and people who raise these matters can sometimes be liable to misrepresentation as having a lack of social concern whereas very frequently &mdash; it is certainly true in my case &mdash; it comes from a burning concern to do what is socially just and right not only for the individuals concerned but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in many of the things he is setting out to do, as expressed in his speech.  I hope he will take heed of the criticism which I have made and I also hope he will take encouragement from the fact that I broadly support <Col N="1625" /> the efforts which he said he is making.  I wish him every success in those endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that it is difficult for Members of this House to express their views on the whole structure of social welfare within 20 minutes and therefore I will confine my comments to a few points which I hope the Minister will answer and give a commitment to in his reply.  When the Dáil goes into recess Governments seem to avail of opportunities to make certain decisions knowing they are not answerable to the Dáil at the time and thus depriving Members of this House of expressing their views and reservations on some very important matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if it is the Minister's intention to extend the national free fuel scheme from 1 October next. Will the people who are at present in receipt of this service be guaranteed its continuation from October?  Any move to withdraw this service would be directed mainly at the most poverty-stricken people in our community and therefore I hope the Minister will give me some assurance on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister if he intends to continue the £20 per week transitional payment arising from the EC equality directive after November next when the transitional period ends.  If not, what action does he intend to take to cushion those people against the impact of a loss of £20 per week income?  In a reply to a question which I put down in the Dáil on 6 May last in connection with this matter the Minister informed me that temporary measures introduced in November 1986 to assist persons who suffer reductions in payment as a consequence of the dependency arrangements brought into force at that time are due to expire in mid-November 1987.  No provision was made in the 1987 Estimate for the continuation beyond that time.  The Minister said he was reviewing the operation of the present arrangement and would advise the Government on this review and that the question of extending these arrangements would be a matter of <Col N="1626" /> consideration in that context.  We should have some information now as to the Minister's views on what action he intends taking before next November. We all recall the confusion in this House last year on that topic.  In fairness to everybody concerned and to relieve or remove any anxiety which people may have, the Minister should now make some statement on that matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the Combat Poverty Agency which recently announced details of a three year strategic plan aimed at combating poverty and promoting community development throughout Ireland.  I understand this strategic plan applied to the period up to the end of 1989.  I hope a copy of the agency's submission to the Minister will be available to all Deputies in the House so that we too can play our part in ensuring the implementation of the plan.  I agree totally with the statement of the agency's director, Hugh Frazer, published in the Cork <i>Evening Echo</i> on Monday, 8 June in which he stated:</P>
    <P>The elimination of poverty in Ireland is an urgent task and must be the concern of everyone in society.  In spite of our current economic difficulties, Ireland remains a relatively wealthy country and the challenge for all of us is to ensure that the wealth is shared fairly throughout society.</P>
    <P>There is something worthwhile in that statement and it should be followed up by the Minister, by the officials of his Department and by everybody concerned with the less fortunate in our community.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his announcement that disability benefit to those in the Cork regional area will be administered locally from next September putting an end to the long delays experienced by many people in getting their cheques.  This should be the practice throughout the whole country and I have been advocating this for quite some time. What I fail to understand is why all benefits, non-contributory, old age, windows, and unemployment assistance, cannot be <Col N="1627" /> administered locally.  This is a very sensitive area.  The delay in payments has caused hardship to people awaiting decisions.  I cannot understand why this applies to disability benefit only, as stated by the Minister in Cork recently.  The Minister should have all non-contributory pensions administered locally.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some employers delaying payments of PRSI contributions. I know this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, but it is important that inspectors from the Department are fully aware of this abuse and that a co-ordinated effort by the inspectors and the Revenue Commissioners be made to eliminate it.  Many people are paying contributions but the employers are not submitting them to the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope the Minister, as he promised some time ago, will take the necessary action to bring this practice to an end.</P>
    <P>Any effort to change the present social welfare structures which are outdated and riddled with anomalies is to be welcomed. I believe this Minister should address himself to bringing about a very great improvement in the administration of the social welfare services.  There is an urgent need to overhaul our existing social welfare system because it is too complex and unwieldy.  We have too many schemes and too many regulations governing those schemes.  We have 19 social welfare payments and 12 social assistance payments.  I often wonder how the officials can administer such a variety of services.</P>
    <P>A possible approach to creating employment could be early retirement.  I am sure the Minister is aware of my views on this. No worker will consider early retirement without some very worthwhile incentives being provided. The Minister should examine the prospect of introducing special national insurance for early retirement.  I am asking the Minister to help those who might like to retire by giving them an incentive and providing worthwhile compensation so that such people can keep <Col N="1628" /> themselves and their families.  If we are to tackle our unemployment problem, we will have to look at early retirement.  I know the Minister is studying the pensions report at present but it will take some time to adopt my suggestion because of the many implications in the introduction of national insurance.  Providing an early retirement pension with the co-operation of the insurance companies would be a very worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss Jobsearch.  Like every other Deputy I welcome the introduction of any scheme which will create employment but I am afraid this scheme is being administered the wrong way.  If a person goes to a labour exchange, especially a married man with a young family, he is told that because he did not look for a job within the last few weeks his benefits are cut, without notice.  This is wrong. This is inflicting unnecessary hardship on a number of people.  Everybody is entitled to notice but what are we doing? We are degrading such a person.  He must then go to the social community welfare officer and plead with him to do something for him and his family.  What gains have the Government envisaged here? One section stops the money and another section is compelled to give him money, otherwise we would be inflicting unnecessary hardship on a married man and his family.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the procedures being adopted.  I suggest that when a person goes to collect his social welfare benefit he might produce, weekly, fortnightly or monthly, evidence that he has tried to find employment.  It is wrong to tell a man when he goes to collect his unemployment benefit that from then on his benefits are cut.  I ask the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention and to give a direction to those administering this scheme.</P>
    <P>A streamlining of the social welfare service is long overdue.  I have stood here and contributed to many debates on social welfare and on the Estimates in an effort to impress on Ministers the necessity to look at the social welfare structure. As I said at the outset, it is riddled with <Col N="1629" /> anomalies.  It is confusing and there is no point in directives being issued to the local labour exchanges and to the public, because nobody understands the social welfare service.  Many people have been deprived of their rights because they were not fully aware of their entitlements. There is a statutory regulation under which a person is entitled to an old age pension but because an old age pensioner was not aware of her entitlements, she is fortunate if she gets three months payments, when she was entitled to payments for two years.  If we continue to complicate the social welfare system, this is what we can expect.  Nobody will understand it.</P>
    <P>Public representatives meet people at their clinics who ask if they are entitled to this or that.  In every budget something is added and something else is deleted. This leads to confusion and the officials in the Department have my sympathy in trying to administer this system efficiently.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of dental treatment for dependent spouses.  Is the Minister ready to provide that service? Our present dental service is almost nonexistent. No old age pensioner could hope to get dental treatment.  There are thousands of children waiting for dental treatment, and now we are putting an added backlog of applicants on this service. I know many private dentists will be involved but I hope the Department are geared to provide this essential service. I compliment the Minister who assured us that this service would be provided next October.  It is worthwhile and long overdue.</P>
    <P>I would like to have had an opportunity to review all aspects of social welfare but it is not possible because of the time limit on the debate.  I appeal to the Minister when he is embarking on any study in connection with social welfare to keep the spokespersons from the other political parties informed.  Social welfare is the concern of all and none of us has a right to boast about what we may achieve. We should be concerned about the welfare of people and ensure that those entitled to benefits get them on time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> We all oppose abuse of the social welfare system because it deprives those in need of a fair income.  I appreciate the Minister's dedication to improving the system.  I appeal to him to outline his views on my suggestion for the introduction of an early retirement scheme.  I have no doubt that the officials in his Department have the ability to prepare a comprehensive scheme.  In my view it would present a tremendous opportunity to create jobs for young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a number of matters outlined by the Minister in his speech.  The Labour Party are pleased to note that the free dental service has been extended to the spouse of insured persons, something that is long overdue. However, I am disappointed that Members have not been given any information on how the scheme will operate. I understand it is intended to commence the scheme in October but those involved in the dental service have grave doubts that it will be possible to adhere to that deadline.  They do not think there will be sufficient staff to provide an efficient service.  In my view virtually all married women whose husbands are insured will seek benefit under it.  I hope the Minister will tell the House how the scheme will operate.  I can foresee long waiting lists because I cannot see how the service, as at present constructed, will be able to cope.</P>
      <P>Little thought has been given to many social welfare schemes.  The system is complicated and very few of us have much knowledge of it.  The more schemes that are introduced the more complicated the social welfare system will become. Many of the decisions in regard to the system are not properly thought out and insufficient information is given about new schemes in advance of their introduction. Trade union officials and those in industry get little opportunity to express an opinion on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome any move to create employment, I must question the Jobsearch programme.  In my view the only successful scheme to emerge was the social employment scheme.  However, <Col N="1631" /> through lack of planning and manpower in the Department that scheme did not succeed.  Many local authorities have financial problems because they must wait to be paid for jobs already completed. That scheme helped those on long term benefit and I was glad to hear the Minister for Labour say he had increased the number of officials administering it. The lack of co-ordination between the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare was very evident in that scheme.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch scheme is taking us down the same road.  Looking for jobs in County Louth at the moment is like trying to find hens' teeth.  Interviewing people and sending them out in search of a job in a county like Louth is no more than a practical joke.  The only thing people are getting out if it is a good laugh at the employment exchange when they are signing on or drawing their money.  The officials administering the scheme are more frustrated than those they are interviewing. We must bear in mind that there are 5,000 unemployed in Dundalk and 4,500 unemployed in Drogheda and I wonder how one can expect to find a job in those towns.  I have not seen six jobs advertised in any issue of the <i>Dundalk Argus</i> or the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> in the past 12 months and I do not see how an official from Dublin will find jobs in those towns for the people who are unemployed. The scheme is a laugh, a waste of public money.</P>
    <P>If we reduced the retirement age from 65 to 60 years we would create employment. We should transfer the payment of unemployment benefit to the payment of a retirement pension for a person who volunteers for early retirement.  If we do that we will be giving people who may have worked for 40 years an opportunity to retire and, at the same time, creating a job for young people.  Trade unions have been calling for such a scheme for many years but successive Governments have squandered money on schemes like Jobsearch.  That is nothing more than a waste of money.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, mentioned the figure of 26,000 people in connection with <Col N="1632" /> the Jobsearch scheme.  Who are these 26,000 people?  He said that 3,000 people had been &ldquo;referred&rdquo;.  I assume that means that 3,000 have been referred to deciding officers for reassessment.  Very often deciding officers are faceless people who are difficult to identify and they will obviously knock these people off unemployment benefit and assistance.  The person concerned may then appeal.  He must then get a letter from the unemployment exchange and he has to go to the other end of the town to the Department of Health.  He has to wait in another long queue to see a community welfare officer who is grossly overworked trying to cope with various categories of people. He decides by a means test on the spot how much money the person will receive; it could be £20 or £80, there are no criteria laid down in this regard.  A community officer on one side of the town with, supposedly, the same set of rules may make an entirely different decision from the one made by his counterpart at the other end.  People are utterly frustrated by the system.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration should be given to the amalgamation of those two services. I do not see any logic in refusing benefit to a man, allowing him to appeal and then sending him to another Department where he gets benefit eventually.  It would not happen in the wilds of Africa. Who thinks up these schemes?</P>
    <P>PRSI used to be of great value to those who were made redundant or unemployed for a period of time.  The Minister knows it has been cut by 15 per cent and, unfortunately, people do not understand that until they apply for benefits.  Then they now have to wait for five weeks to receive payment.  It would be much better and would reduce the Minister's headaches if that benefit was eliminated and incorporated in the basic payment.  If a person is unemployed for ten weeks, he or she is not paid for the first five weeks. They are paid for the second five weeks which means that not alone has the benefit been reduced by 15 per cent but it is further reduced by 50 per cent because they only receive it for 50 per cent of the period.  The net result is that a worker is <Col N="1633" /> paying 8.8 per cent in PRSI and is coming out on an average of £2 per week, particularly those in the low income groups.</P>
    <P>If I still held the office of a senior trade union official, I would challenge PRSI in the courts because the system has, effectively, become part of the PAYE system.  It is barefaced, deliberate robbery of workers because it is another deduction scheme which is easy to collect. The contribution has continued to go up while the benefit has come down. That goes back to the first Social Welfare Bill, 1982: it is robbing people who work hard for their living.</P>
    <P>The self-employed are paid £286 million at present in non-contributory pensions. The vast majority of them never paid into the system while workers who pay PRSI receive no benefits in real terms.  Some of the self-employed can simply transfer their businesses or farms to their sons, daughters or other relatives and after six months can collect a non-contributory old age pension in full even though they have paid nothing into the system.  I cannot understand why that has not been put right.  People in those categories should be brought into the system if, by using a loophole in the Act, they can receive old age pensions. However, it is much easier to get at the PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Another obvious change could be made and from an administrative point of view it would reduce expenses.  I refer to the area of retirement and old age pensions.  The idea of having a retirement benefit at 65 and an old age pension at 66 is ludicrous.  The system has been in operation for 20 years and no attempt has been made to change it.  When people come to the age of 65 they have to make an application and to go through a whole rigmarole to get a pension.  Then, three months before they reach their 66th birthday they have to do the same thing all over again to receive a benefit of a similar nature.  All that should be necessary in this case is to pay the old age pension at the age of 65 which would release staff who have to administer this scheme into other areas where they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> The same applies to invalidity pensions, disability benefit and disablement benefit.  There is no real difference between them as they all cater for people who are ill.  Some of the illnesses may be long term while others are short term but there is no basic difference between the three benefits.  Yet people have to transfer from disability benefit to disablement benefit to invalidity benefit.  After a certain time all payment of social welfare should apply on a continuous basis.  It is ludicrous that people have to continue to queue outside doctors' surgeries where little girls hand out their certificates signed by the doctor.  Many of them never see a doctor on a continuous basis and some of them have been on disability benefit for up to 15 years.  It is a huge waste of money and resources.  If people are on benefit for ten or 15 years they are permanently incapable of working. There should be no need to certify people every week as being unfit for work.</P>
    <P>There is also gross waste of time and effort in the administration of unemployment assistance on a rural and urban basis.  It always amuses me because I cannot understand how there can be a difference between a person living two miles outside Drogheda getting a rural rate and someone living in the town getting the urban rate.  I have been trying to figure out for the past 20 years what the difference is between the urban and rural areas.  Two pages of the social welfare booklet are taken up with an explanation but I still do not understand it.  There should be one rate of benefit for unemployment assistance irrespective of where you live.  If anything, the people living in the country should be getting more because they might need a bicycle, car or wheelbarrow allowance.  One end of the Department of Social Welfare does not know what the other is doing.  It has got so big with so many different sections that there is no co-ordination.  We as TDs and local authority members could tell the Minister all about it.</P>
    <P>I hope progress will be made in regard to the suggestion about transferring some of the responsibility for payment of disability benefit to employers, particularly <Col N="1635" /> short-term benefit.  I have seen it in operation in a number of areas.  Employers are better geared for this and many people on short term benefit would prefer to go to their employers.  If they were on disability benefit they could send their wives or sons to collect the benefit from the employer.  That would be much less degrading than having to queue outside unemployment offices.  These officers are no longer capable of dealing with the numbers of people they have to cater for: they have not the staff to pay out three, four or five days a week.  People have to queue in the streets of Drogheda and Dundalk and other towns because the staff are not able to cope with them. As many as possible of those payments should be transferred to employers, thereby giving relief to the people queueing outside in the rain.</P>
    <P>Much work could be done to try to improve and reform the social welfare code.  The Commission on Social Welfare made many wide-ranging recommendations but there is no evidence of any real movement towards implementing many of those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the system of appeals.  This is the most outrageous section of all in the Department.  One doctor certifies that a person is not incapable of work, but his own doctor locally tells him: &ldquo;I will not give you your final certificate to go back to work because you are not fit to go back to work&rdquo;.  You would not see the likes of it in the wilds of Africa.  Then a person goes for the first appeal.  One doctor says he is not incapable of work.  At the second appeal another doctor says he is not capable of work.  Then the person goes to an appeals officer, a layman, who is expected to tell the two doctors that they were wrong in the first place in telling the person that he was not incapable of work. That takes nine months.  Everybody knows that the person concerned could apply for unemployment benefit and get paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the time is <Col N="1636" /> short I do not intend to take the full 20 minutes.  There are a few matters I should like to refer to, particularly the speech of Deputy Woods this evening.  Deputy Mitchell spoke about the Minister taking credit for schemes.  As far as I am concerned the Minister has not taken half enough credit in his speech.  His speech shows that the Minister is prepared to look at the structures as they are and try to do something to change them.  All previous speakers have suggested changes and reforms in the social welfare system and I go along with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister deserves credit, in a time of such financial stringency, for securing such a large budget.  This is one of the few Departments that have not suffered and that is a credit to the Minister himself. Deputy Mitchell seems to have forgotten some of the things his Government proposed before they left office.  The budget has been criticised as being very severe.  The major difference between our budget and that prepared by Fine Gael is that it catered for those who are dependent on social welfare.  The proposals in the Fine Gael budget would have caused severe hardships if implemented.  The previous budget proposed to pay the social welfare increases from November instead of July.  Fine Gael's proposal on unemployment benefit was to cut the period to 12 months. We have retained it at 15 months.  There is now no increase in the waiting period from three to six days as was proposed in the Fine Gael budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was able to find money for a number of changes that will benefit recipients.  I welcome those, particularly in the stringent budgetary situation he was faced with.  I welcome the Jobsearch programme which has been subject to comments here and outside.  People outside have made attempts to undermine the scheme and have suggested that there are sinister motives in it.  It is very unfair that people have taken this attitude.  The main thrust of the scheme is to try to help those who are unemployed, to try to give them some confidence to go back looking for work, to face interviews again.  We are all aware that the longer a person <Col N="1637" /> is unemployed the longer and the more difficult it is for him to go looking for work.  It gets more difficult, as the person goes along, actively to seek employment, being so long out of the system.  I know from people who are operating the system in places that people who have undertaken the four-week course and other courses have nothing but the height of praise for them because it allows them to get back into the system, to seeking employment actively.  Therefore that scheme is very beneficial.</P>
    <P>Although I have said that the main thrust of the scheme is to help people to seek employment, one of its side effects will be the identification of people fraudulently seeking unemployment assistance and benefit.  I welcome that side effect.  For too long successive Governments have shirked responsibility in this matter.  I hope this Government will tackle that in a serious and determined way.  People working full time and drawing unemployment benefit are committing a crime.  First of all they are robbing the hard pressed taxpayer, and worse they are putting their hands into the pockets of the old and the poor and needy.  For too long we have cast a benign eye on those robbers.  We have encouraged them by our silence and by looking the other way.  It has meant that we have been slapping them on the back and congratulating them for fooling the system when they are doing nothing but robbing. The sooner we as a nation recognise that and try to do something about it the better it will be for all of us.  It is time that we as legislators took our responsibility seriously and did something about it.</P>
    <P>I would refer briefly also to the family income supplement and commend the Minister for his improvement to this scheme.  I have no hesitation in acknowledging that the measure was introduced by the last Government; it was one of the best schemes introduced by them.  It is to be commended.  It has been excellent and is a scheme that should be promoted strongly by the Department.  Unfortunately, for one reason or other, the uptake on it seems to be very low.  The Minister mentioned that he intended to <Col N="1638" /> try to promote this more rigorously and I for one would welcome that.  It is a scandal that people would appear to be better off in many cases by being unemployed than by being out working.  The family income supplement was introduced to try to assist people and encourage them to go to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks with regard to the rationalising of the whole social welfare scheme are very welcome and very refreshing.  All the Deputies who have spoken so far have talked about the need to rationalise, to try to make this huge giant of a system of social welfare more locally based, to provide the services that are more local or on a regional level.  The Minister's reference to the one-stop-shop concept and the extension of that scheme is to be welcomed.  Other Deputies have made some very valid points in relation to the necessity to have the schemes localised. I am sure the Minister will take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Minister's statement in relation to deserted wife's benefit and the pursuit of husbands, through the courts or otherwise. Again, this is something that every Deputy has faced at one time or other, where a husband has been barred from the family home because of violence to the wife or children and the wife then claims, after a period of time, deserted wife's benefit, but the Department tell her that she is not entitled to it because she has not tried to get maintenance from her husband through the courts.  When somebody has gone through the trauma of violence to herself and to her children and has succeeded in getting the husband barred from the house, the last thing she wants to do is become involved again with that husband, whether in a court of law or anywhere else.  The Minister is moving in the right direction in introducing legislation where the Department would be able to pursue the husband and get some maintenance.  The idea put forward by Deputy Mitchell in relation to a national means test certainly looks very attractive.  If it could be worked out it could be very good for local authorities, as he said, and indeed for the various <Col N="1639" /> Departments.  However, I see one problem. This could only be done on a limited basis and probably once per year but circumstances can change very rapidly and that would cause tremendous problems.</P>
    <P>A number of other speakers have mentioned the appeals system.  As has been said by the previous Deputies, the system is very cumbersome.  It is certainly not seen as being independent and my major criticism of it is the difficulty that even we, as public representatives, have in getting some kind of definitive information as to why appeals are dismissed or disallowed.  It seems that the only person who can get this information at the moment is the Ombudsman.  There must be something wrong with the system.  I notice that the Minister intends to try to do something about it.  I would point out to the House that in the Ombudsman's report of this year there were 2,788 complaints about the civil service and 1,717 of these were the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  That is an inordinately high number of cases dealt with by the Ombudsman.  There must be something wrong with the system, as I understand that under the Ombudsman's Act all avenues of appeal have to be finalised before the Ombudsman will take on a case.  If there were 1,717 dissatisfied people who took their cases to the Ombudsman, there is something wrong with the system.</P>
    <P>One case I would highlight in relation to personal experience is of a lady who had her claim for unemployment benefit disallowed on 3 March 1986 on the grounds of not being available for work. She appealed and the appeal was turned down.  When I contacted the Department I was told the reason was because she was not available for work.  I rang the Department on a number of occasions to find out on what basis this decision was reached because the lady told me that she was available for work and had said so at the appeal.</P>
    <P>I wrote in August looking for a review of the case and again asking how the <Col N="1640" /> decision was reached, the reasons for the decision and a justification of it.  The following month I got a standard reply that the Department had particular appeals procedures, that an appeals officer's decision was final and that a deciding officer's decision was final.  There was again no explanation.  No matter what I did by way of writing, including writing to the Minister, all I got was the same standard reply.  That is bad enough for me as a public representative &mdash; I was a councillor at that time &mdash; but you can imagine the frustration, anger and rejection that that person felt.  She was genuinely available for work, ready for work and could not get any kind of reason from the Department as to why she was turned down except that she was not available for work.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned in the course of some of the replies that there was a review procedure if fresh evidence could be given.  How can one give fresh evidence when one does not know on what evidence the original decision was based?  I have had several experiences like that but I felt because of the circumstances of that case that it was like banging one's head off a stone wall trying to get replies from the Department.  I am very pleased to see that the Minister is going to review the appeals system, that it will be independent of the Department and will be seen to be independent of it &mdash; and I hope independent of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed over the past seven or eight years that it was most difficult, in our country anyway, for women to get unemployment benefit, especially if they had children.  The usual reason given was that they were not available for work.  I wonder if the structures of the appeal section in the Department have anything to do with that?  I understand that there are 13 appeals officers working in the appeals section of the Department: one chief appeals officer, one deputy chief appeals officer and 11 ordinary appeals officers.  There is one woman only among those.  I cannot help but think that a certain <Col N="1641" /> amount of the attitudes we as males have may be manifested in the appeals system in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister not alone for the Estimate but for the fresh approach he has taken to reform the system.  He deserves the support of all sides of this House in his efforts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dempsey's eulogising of that nice man, Deputy Michael Woods, was apparently based on the belief that our thanks are due to the Minister for not cutting the £2.5 billion available in the budget for social welfare. I fear the time when this heartless Government turn their attention to the social welfare payments.  They have been callous in introducing horrific and horrendous health cuts.  They have been callous also in their dire proposal to charge the new poor &mdash; I do not mean medical card holders but the people in poorly paid jobs &mdash; who are now living in terror that some day they may have to go to hospital and pay for being sick.  When will the axe fall?  Will it be in this year's mini-budget which the Government will undoubtedly bring in or will it be next year?  It is only a matter of time until that happens. Therefore, Deputy Dempsey's eulogy to the Minister is somewhat premature.</P>
      <P>During the past few years I have raised, both in this Chamber and on the Committee of Public Accounts, the thorny problem of social welfare fraud.  In doing so I left myself open to the charge of misrepresentation.  I have been misrepresented by some of the trendy lefties of the Labour Party.  I exclude my friend and county colleague, Deputy Michael Bell, from that assertion.  These people have seized on my criticism of the fraud in the system to attack me on a very emotive issue.  However, that has not deterred me and I wish to reiterate some of the claims I have made during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism about the level of fraud in the social welfare system has been supported by Deputy Dempsey who also expressed concern about this problem. As a Deputy from a Border county I am <Col N="1642" /> particularly concerned about the scale of operations of fraudulent signing on by people from the Six Counties who are also working.  I can only describe these people as hustlers and bandits who have come over the Border in large numbers during the past few years and taken significant sums of money from the backs of the PAYE workers in the South.  These unfortunate PAYE workers who are burdened to the floor, are carrying these people on their backs.  The time has come for Deputies to face the reality that there is widespread abuse of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In 1984 a survey was commissioned by the Department of Social Welfare into fraud in the Dundalk region.  This survey was undertaken by the special investigation unit attached to the Department. They issued a report which categorically asserted that fraud in the region of £250,000 had been perpetrated in the Dundalk area.  The unit put much work into that report and identified the people who perpetrated that fraud.  These had County Louth addresses as well as addresses in the Six Counties.  That survey has been on the shelves of the Department for the past few years.  The then Minister, Deputy Desmond, seems to have been unaware that the survey, which had been commissioned by his own Department, was completed.  For whatever reason no action was taken until very belatedly when, due to a series of articles in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> particularly which clearly demonstrated the way in which social welfare fraud was perpetrated, a group of consultants were commissioned to produce a report on the extent of that abuse.  That report has not been published yet.  My mole suggests that the consultants found abuses of the order I had claimed and which the investigation unit found when they carried out their survey.  I look forward to the publication of that report.  I hope that instead, of charging poor working people who lie sick in hospital beds for health services, the Government will close the door on these hustlers and bandits whether they are from the Six Counties or from the <Col N="1643" /> South.  They are to be found in every county.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to look after people who are genuinely unemployed or disabled or who have lost their jobs due to redundancies or to the collapse of industries.  I know all about that because I come from Dundalk, a town with the highest unemployment in Ireland.  The national average for unemployment is 17 to 18 per cent but in Dundalk the figure is approaching 30 per cent.  The requirement regarding genuinely seeking work should be relaxed in the Dundalk area. As Deputy Bell said this is an area where unemployment is a fact of life.  Charlie Haughey would not be able to find employment there in the morning if he needed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, the Taoiseach. I would like to refer to the anomalies which are prevalent in the social welfare system.  Another anomaly is where a widower is worse off and is treated much more unfairly than a widow.  I had a case in 1984 in Dundalk, when a widower with four children came into my clinic and asked me if he could apply for a sex change operation.  I asked why and he said that he was £21 worse off than a widow in a similar situation.  So much for women's emancipation.  They seem to have outstripped the men.  I would ask the Minister to address himself to that problem.</P>
      <P>Another area that is given undue prominence relates to unmarried mother's allowance.  This is the only growth industry in the country.  I can understand any girl making one mistake or possibly two, but what about four, five and six mistakes paid for by the hapless PAYE worker? The time has come when payment in that area stops at the second child.  People in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance have in many cases more money than deserted wives who are genuinely deserted and living on very little money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> Another problem relates to the national lottery.  Up to last week £35 million was spent in the vain pursuit of winning a prize in that ill-conceived lottery. The chance of winning the star prize is in the region of 20,000 to one.  As a self-confessed gambler I am gravely concerned about the State embarking on this kind of lottery.  Apart from the fact that it encourages gambling which is a frightful disease on a par with our national problem of alcohol consumption, the people who are being attracted to this lottery are the poorest in our country.  That is evident every Friday morning in the post offices in Dundalk.  I have deep reservations about this form of gambling.  A sum of £35 million in five weeks certainly belies the suggestion that we have extreme poverty although one would not find the members of luxury clubs or golf clubs buying lottery tickets.  They are bought by the most vulnerable people, the people who have to go on a regular basis to the home assistance officers.  The home assistance officers in the North Eastern Health Board region are people to whom I pay tribute.  I have constant dealings with them and I find them very humane.  I have listened to criticism of the appeals system.  It is not unfair.  When representations are made and the facts are laid before the deciding officers they use their discretion and they are fair. That is one area where the Department can hold up their heads.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances were touched on here today.  The payment of children's allowances to many of the upmarket families in this country is ludicrous.  Why should the Smurfit family, for instance, be in receipt of children's allowances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to dissuade the Deputy from mentioning names of persons outside of this House. This is a privileged assembly and outsiders have no redress in regard to derogatory remarks made about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the Chair I withdrew that remark, although I would make it outside of the House if I got the opportunity.  There is nothing <Col N="1645" /> derogatory in what I said.  Well off people should not be paid children's allowances. I include myself in that.  A large saving could be made in that area and more money could be paid out to the people who are most in need; to the people who rely on that as their little nest egg.  The time has come for all parties to agree on that and to introduce a means test there.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the extent of social welfare fraud.  Every Deputy must know of the activities of people who are working and signing on.  It is indicative of the ambivalence in this country towards social welfare deceit that the problem has not been tackled in an honest straightforward way.  People who put their hands into their neighbour's pocket, the guy who is working down the road, who in many cases extracts large sums of money from his neighbour's pocket should be charged in a court of law and made repay the money.  We must introduce some deterrent, otherwise that will continue. My remarks about the social welfare fraud that undoubtedly exists are made because of my concern for the needy. The people who have lost jobs through no fault of their own and who genuinely seek social welfare payments are being robbed by social welfare hustlers.  I would exhort the Minister to spare no effort to close down those doors.  In doing so he would be helping the real poor the genuine social welfare recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the last number of speakers all came from the north east region.  I wonder has it anything to do with the social welfare system up there.  Deputy McGahon, Deputy Bell and Deputy Dempsey have spoken.  We are here to discuss the Estimate and just looking through the book one notes that nearly all of the headings have been increased this year.  When the Minister is concluding, would he let us know what the second heading, Consultancy Services, includes and why has it been increased by 56 per cent?  Under the heading, Postal and Telecommunications Services, the figure has been decreased by 1 per cent.  I note in the local exchanges in Louth the conclusion of the installation <Col N="1646" /> of a very efficient telephone system there recently.  It has helped contact with the local exchanges.  On numerous occasions I have been unable to get through to the local exchanges but because of this new system and because there are more direct lines into it, we have been able to make more contact with them.  I compliment the people who man the exchange offices in Dundalk and Drogheda.  They give excellent service and are very courteous and any time the general public, I or other politicians contact them we get a good response.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have mentioned the overall level of spending on social welfare which has been increased this year.  Not only has it been increased by 3 per cent, but the increase has been brought forward from November to July.  Therefore, the people in receipt of social welfare benefits will get that increase slightly earlier than was proposed by Fine Gael.  We have heard in the past few years about the extension of dental and optical treatment benefits.  This Government have taken upon themselves, as promised, to bring this in and it will be implemented in November.  It will be of tremendous benefit. I have canvassed during the past few years and at every door people ask when we are going to bring this in and they had got to the stage where they did not believe that we would do so.  Now we are putting our money where our mouth is and I congratulate the Minister on bringing this measure forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement, judging by the figures which the Minister has provided in the past few days, is not being taken up by the general public, partly, I suppose, because it has not been advertised properly.  Perhaps as a result of this debate people will become aware that it was increased substantially in the last budget.  I and other Deputies have had representations from many people about it.  I am told by soldiers in Dundalk who are earning a reasonable wage that many people living in the same estate receiving social welfare benefits are better off than they are.  This supplement will help people such as these soldiers and other low income people.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="1647" /> publicise the scheme more.  He has in the Estimate increased it by 57 per cent, obviously in anticipation of an increased demand.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch scheme was brought in by the previous Government and it has been extended throughout the country. As every Deputy knows, this scheme has been set up in various centres.  It has been set up in Dundalk and I would like to inform Deputy Bell that it will be extended to Drogheda in September.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Bell complaining about the scheme.  It is a genuine attempt to help people to get jobs.  If he saw what was being done in Dundalk in the CRV premises and the training the people are getting he might have a different view.  Obviously this will have a side effect and Deputy Dempsey referred to it.  He stated that perhaps people who are working and claiming dole at the same time will be caught out.  Quite rightly, they should be found out.  For too long politicians in general and even the public have stated that it is a disgrace, but nothing has been done about it.  This is one way of finding these people out.  In my town quite a number of people have not turned up for the Jobsearch course and that leads us to ask why they did not turn up.  We all have our ideas about it. Most likely if they go on this scheme they will not be available to do the work they should not be doing while claiming the dole.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is introducing one-stop shops.  These are a good idea and should be encouraged.  The idea is to have the dole office no longer just a place for people to go to for their weekly payment. It will be a place where people will go and, we hope, be provided with a job or some idea of where they can get a job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole idea of the one-stop shop is to get away from what I <Col N="1648" /> call a hand-out office where people every week went for a hand-out.  The Minister envisages that in the same building people may be diverted over to someone from AnCO or Manpower where something might be found for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon referred to children's allowances and I must agree with what he has said.  A number of people who are reasonably well off have asked me why we cannot take away children's allowances from them, that it was a nonsense and they should not be getting them.  I must agree with them.  I have spoken with the Minister about this and I would like him to make people aware of the difficulties of taking away this allowance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell referred to doctors' certificates, and again I agree with what he said.  This is an abuse.  Some suggestion has been made of another scheme whereby people could sign on or whatever rather than having to go to the doctor and get a certificate from the receptionist, as Deputy Bell said. However, his Government were in power for four and a half years and did nothing about it.  We have only been in power for so many weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will try to change that system.  Perhaps I misheard Deputy McGahon but I think he referred to people from Northern Ireland who came down to the Border counties as hustlers and bandits.  As usual he is on a hobbyhorse.  People living in my town, in Deputy Bell's town and every town on the Border find it necessary to cross the Border for one reason or another.  The vast majority of them are genuine and decent.  Deputy McGahon is not here at the moment, but he was in the House for only about a week and he was complaining about social welfare fraud. Deputy Barry Desmond &mdash; who interrupted the Minister incidentally &mdash; said that Deputy McGahon had stated in this House and in other places that fraud was going on left, right and centre in the <Col N="1649" /> Border constituencies.  However, he said Deputy McGahon had produced not one shred of evidence of that either to him or to the Fine Gael Minister for Social Welfare at that time to prove his point and they are still awaiting evidence from him.  We all know there is social welfare fraud, but the Government can only do so much to prevent that.  Anybody who condones social welfare fraud should not be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their wide-ranging contributions.  I appreciate the point made by a number of speakers that it is difficult to cover all of the areas involved in the Vote in the short time available.  It is difficult for me to cover them in that time also.  Consequently, I can only highlight some of my principal plans.  Needless to say, I re-echo much of what has been said by Deputies here.  I will endeavour to deal with some of the questions raised.</P>
      <P>As far as the Combat Poverty Agency is concerned Deputy J. Mitchell said I should not claim any credit for it because I did not set it up.  In fact I did set up the agency for the first time four and a half years ago when they were allotted a fairly substantial budget of £2.5 million.  We called it then the National Community Development Agency but the incoming Government decided to abolish it and the relevant legislation was set aside. Eventually, after a long interval, the new Combat Poverty Agency came into being last September.  They were asked to prepare a plan and strategy for the next three years; that formed part of their brief. They did so and presented it to me in the past week.  This agency, of course, will advise the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies contended that the Department should be the agency to tackle poverty.  I can assure the House I share that view.  I believe this House should be the agency to tackle poverty and I will listen very carefully to what Deputies have to say in that regard.  I believe the direction in which the agency are proceeding is the correct one, has been well considered and will result in a <Col N="1650" /> worthwhile contribution.  They are planning to engage in some research which will be helpful to me, as Minister, and to Members of the House.  I hope the results of such research will provide the criteria for the steps that need to be taken.  Sometimes we are a little afraid of taking such steps because we may not be sure of the factual position as it is such a complex area.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Mitchell thought there should be greater selectivity in the allocation of resources.  I agree with him there.  We will do whatever we can to identify and help those in greatest need. I made reference to this recently in a speech.  Deputy Mitchell recognised that such remarks can be taken up wrongly. The report which appeared in the papers and in respect of which I see there is a letter again this evening was about no more money for the needy, which, of course, was not what I said.  I was saying we had £2.5 million, a lot of money, and we must ensure that it was directed at those in greatest need.  Some sub-editor decided to put the caption on that &ldquo;No more money for the needy&rdquo;.  If one reads the <i>Evening Herald</i> this evening and probably for some time to come one will see many letters responding to that report which is entirely off the mark.  In fact, I was endeavouring to say what Deputy Mitchell was endeavouring to say here &mdash; and about which I am sure all Deputies would be concerned &mdash; that we do not have unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Mitchell also mentioned children's allowance and spoke about well-off people receiving such allowances. Several other Deputies, including Deputies Ahern and McGahon, mentioned the children's allowance scheme and the problems inherent in its proper administration.  First and foremost, I should say that people with high incomes do not have to apply for children's allowance; possibly some do not.  It should be remembered that the number in that high category is very small.  I would advise Deputies to be careful about that concept because there are some people who are very glad to climb on that band wagon. Invariably one finds that those who are <Col N="1651" /> supposed to be wealthy are those in the middle bracket because there will be not much revenue yield unless one digs deeper than the very small band on top. There is the problem that if children's allowances are taxed then all the people who do not pay tax are laughing again because they reap the benefit but are not liable to PRSI contributions or tax. Therefore, that must be borne in mind. Any time one endeavours to adjust children's allowances one finds it is the people in the middle bracket, who are paying a high rate of income tax and PRSI contributions, who end up being caught.  I will be very careful to ensure that does not happen but I will take note of Deputies' comments.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Wyse, talked about the Combat Poverty Agency.  Deputy Wyse may be glad to know that even before he finished speaking I had sent a message to the Combat Poverty Agency asking them to let us have copies here tomorrow of their strategic plan.  I trust they will arrive in good time.  I also took note of what the Deputy said about keeping spokespersons informed, ensuring that they are furnished with information about various happenings at any time.  I will follow it up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse also mentioned early retirement and its importance.  That was mentioned afterwards in relation to retirement benefits and the difference between retirement and old age benefits. Of course one is required to retire to reap the retirement pension.  The old age pension also carries benefits; it renders one eligible for various kinds of assistance. There is a cash problem in that area.  Deputy Bell raised that question also.  It is something that will have to be borne in mind in planning future developments.</P>
    <P>While several Deputies welcomed the extension of the dental benefit scheme they were concerned, as was Deputy Bell, that in practice it might be difficult to implement.  The Deputy will be aware that some dentists will not be very <Col N="1652" /> anxious to implement it but I should like to reassure the Deputy that notwithstanding any difficulties that may be encountered I am committed to its implementation.  Difficulties will be encountered but they will be surmounted. I know that Deputies on all sides of the House are anxious that the scheme should go ahead.  We will implement it as from 1 October next.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell spoke about pay-related benefit and was concerned about it.  As the Deputy will know, for some time past pay-related benefit is not payable for the first 18 days &mdash; not the first five weeks as the Deputy said &mdash; and it continues for 15 months.  There was a proposal to reduce it in the previous budget but it has continued for 15 months.  I regard it as important to maintain both the unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit right through for the 15 months rather than reduce it to 12 months.</P>
    <P>On the question of disability benefit and appeals, I agree with what Deputies said.  First a private doctor is involved, then a Department doctor, then a second Department doctor, an appeals officer thereafter and there can be specialists involved.  I will be examining that as a matter of urgency.  There must be some standard in relation to this area and the standard should be a technical one.  I accept what the Deputy said, that the matter should be fairly clear in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have noted the various points made by the Deputies and I will keep them in mind.  The question of computer consultancy for personalised old age pension orders was raised.  That will be dealt with later in the year.  I assure Deputies that that money is being well spent.  It is my intention to ensure that the resources at my disposal will be directed towards those in greatest need.  In the current circumstances I recognise it will be difficult to give great increases in this area and consequently we will have to direct the resources to those who need them most.</P>

      <P>The free fuel scheme is provided for in the Estimates.

As far as the EC equality directive is concerned the position will become clearer later in the year as to the amount of money required for an extension of that payment.  As the Deputy knows it is, to some extent, winding up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue in the Dáil today under Standing Order No. 30.  I understand from precedents this is quite a rare occurrence. It is indicative of the urgency with which the House views the doctors' dispute that it has been possible to achieve this debate here today.  The issues at the heart of this dispute concern basic trade union principles.  The fact that those who are taking industrial action wear white coats and have professional qualifications does not alter that fact one bit.  The non-consultant hospital doctors are employees who are in receipt of salaries and pay tax, PRSI, health contributions and so on, in just the same way as any other employees, and they have a right to be treated fairly in the same way as any other employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic issues in this dispute involve <Col N="1654" /> the principles that employers should be expected to honour agreements entered into, and that employees should not be expected to accept a unilateral decision to worsen their working conditions.  In February 1986 the Irish Medical Organisation on behalf of the non-consultant hospital doctors and the local government staff negotiating board, on behalf of the employers, signed a new agreement. The Irish Medical Organisation has made it quite clear that they will instruct their members to return to normal working forthwith if the Minister for Health instructs the hospital managements to adhere to the terms of the 1986 agreement. This is a reasonable proposal and I find it shocking that the Minister should be prepared to risk the health and possibly the lives of patients, by refusing to do so.</P>
    <P>The 1986 agreement represented an important advance for the junior hospital doctors.  Perhaps junior is a misrepresentation because in many cases these doctors have ten years experience, are in their mid-thirties and have families to support.  It was an important agreement in that it recognised for the first time that they should not have to work more than 80 hours per week.  Even with the implementation of the 1986 agreement the doctors were still working an average of 70 hours a week.  They now quite rightly fear that if redundancies go ahead at the level which has been demanded they will again be in the situation where they will have to work 80 hours or more per week.</P>
    <P>This raises two important issues.  First, as we approach the end of the 20th century it is surely quite unreasonable that any employee should be asked to accept a working week that is about twice the length of the average working week for other workers.  There is also the question of patient welfare.  Hospital doctors work under great pressure.  They must often make rapid decisions &mdash; decisions on which the welfare and often the life of a patient will hinge.  It is surely not in the patients' interest that doctors should be asked to make decisions like this, when they have been on their feet for 12 or 14 <Col N="1655" /> hours, or even longer.  No matter how well trained a doctor is, no matter how conscientious a doctor is, there is always a danger that someone who is asked to work such long hours will simply make an error of judgment through sheer exhaustion.</P>
    <P>This dispute must also be seen against the background of the savage programme of cutbacks and the inpatient and out-patient charges which have been introduced since the return to office of the Fianna Fáil administration.  These have led to considerable distress and inconvenience among patients and those awaiting treatment, and have been met with unprecedented opposition from staff within the health service.  The reaction of health staff at all levels has been so strong because they realise what many of the public have not yet recognised, that what we are now witnessing is not simply a series of cutbacks, but a systematic butchering of the public health system.  It must be clear that if this madness is allowed to continue, the entire public health service, which has been painstakingly built up over the years, will be dismantled within a short space of time.</P>
    <P>Despite the assurances given by the Minister for Health and his colleagues in Government, there is no doubt that the standard of patient care has fallen as a result of these cuts.  I am sure that many people were shocked by the sight of Dr. Matthews, head of the neo-natal intensive care unit of the Rotunda Hospital, saying on the television news last night that because of reduced funding from the Department of Health they did not have enough nurses and that they had to hope that two or three babies did not fall ill at the same time.  He said: &ldquo;We live on a knife edge and we keep our fingers crossed that two or three babies don't get sick at the same time&rdquo;.  I think it is appalling that these health cuts have led to a situation where the health and welfare of babies should have to depend on chance.  Despite assurances that the hospital outpatient and inpatient charges would be implemented in a humane way. I have had complaints from constituents <Col N="1656" /> whose children were refused treatment in the casualty and outpatient departments of Temple Street Hospital simply because they did not have the money with them to pay the £10 charge.  In the last two days a two year old child was brought to that hospital as a result of an accident in which he hurt his foot.  The child was refused care until such time as an assurance was given that the £10 would be paid.  On the following morning a nine year old child was refused outpatient care.  He had returned to the hospital with an arm injury which had been treated some time ago but was refused treatment because the adults with that child did not have £10 with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of course says that the decisions on the cutbacks are being made by the health boards and not by him: that he has simply decided on the level of money that can be allocated to each board.  But the Minister cannot be allowed to wash his hands like Pontius Pilate and absolve himself from responsibility for the savage cuts which are now taking place.  He has reduced funding to such an extent and in such an arbitrary fashion that the health boards and the hospitals have been left in an impossible position.  Neither the Minister nor the Government can escape responsibility for this dispute, which is a direct consequence of decisions taken by them, and they cannot escape their responsibility to seek a nationally negotiated solution to the dispute.  It is quite unacceptable that the Minister should refuse to negotiate with the IMO and try to force them into a series of local negotiations with particular hospitals.  There is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that all hospitals, financed from public sources, have a common and uniform personnel policy. The Minister has an obligation also to ensure that there is a common high level of patient care available at hospitals all over the country, and to achieve this it is necessary to insist that there will be a common level of working conditions for doctors, nurses and other essential health personnel.</P>
    <P>A common high level of patient care cannot be guaranteed if there is one level <Col N="1657" /> of staffing at one hospital and a different level in another, and if doctors in one area are expected to work 50 hours per week while those in another are expected to work 80 per week.  There are already considerable regional disparities in the standard of care available to patients. Local negotiations will simply widen the regional disparities that already exist. Again I quote an example of a man I met in the corridor today.  He told me he has to bring his child 200 miles from Ballina to St. Michael's Central Remedial Clinic, Dublin.  Clearly this is intolerable.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister has chosen to take on the non-consultant hospital doctors, who already endure very harsh working conditions and an unexceptional level of remuneration, but has done nothing about the pampered privileged position of the consultants.  Of course, the whole strategy of the Government in relation to the health cuts has been that the weakest should be expected to carry the heaviest burden.  Ordinary people who have already paid their health contributions and PRSI are now expected to pay for out-patient and in-patient services, while millions of pounds of taxpayers' money is used to subsidise the super-elite treatment for the privileged few in luxury hospitals that charge up to £1,200 per week.  Junior doctors, nurses, cleaners and other workers are asked to accept job losses and poorer conditions, while the drug companies are allowed to profiteer at the expense of the taxpayer and the health service.</P>
    <P>The IMO have already pointed out that expenditure on drugs is one area where significant savings could be made without jeopardising the standard of care for patients.  Dr. Brendan Cuddihy of the IMO Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors Committee was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 June as saying he saw no reason why the annual £60 million cost of drugs for the general medical service could not be trimmed by 20 per cent, as had been done two years ago in the UK without harming patients or restricting doctors' scope for prescribing adequate medicines.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that money was being spent on drugs which were in some cases <Col N="1658" /> useless, and claimed that private importers were importing drugs at up to 40 per cent less than the price charged for the drugs here, but the benefit was not being passed on to the consumer.  He suggested that the Department of Health should be involved in paralleled importing of drugs in a big way.  Of course there is little prospect of the Government doing this, as to do so would be interfering with what they regard as the absolute right to make profit.  It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil attach far more importance to the private profit ethic than to the ethic of a public health service.</P>
    <P>The proposals put originally to the doctors would have resulted in a loss of about 200 jobs among the non-consultant hospital doctors.  The doctors have said they are prepared to accept some level of job losses, but not 200.  I think, however, that putting doctors out of jobs is a false economy.  Those who lose their jobs are not likely to go into private practice, and many of them will have no alternative but to emigrate, and their services and expertise will be lost to the country.  The money spent on their training will have been wasted so far as the Irish people are concerned..</P>
    <P>The non-consultant hospital doctors are clearly resolute in their determination to fight their case.  Anyone who has any doubt about that should look at the results of their secret ballot yesterday, when they voted by 686 to 22 &mdash; a majority of 96 per cent &mdash; for a total withdrawal of services from all hospitals on Saturday.  The IMO have made it quite clear that they do not want to jeopardise patients' welfare and will provide cover to assist consultants in emergency cases. While I accept the IMO bona fides in giving this undertaking, I fear that the inevitable disruption and chaos that will follow from their action will end in tragedy.</P>
    <P>In an interview in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 25 September 1984, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey said: &ldquo;The health services have been reduced to dangerously inadequate levels, and I think that if it hasn't happened already, <Col N="1659" /> people will die because of the unavailability of particular services in certain areas&rdquo;.  That statement was made by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition. Is it going to take the deaths of patients to force Fianna Fáil from an even worse situation than existed a year ago, and from the disastrous course on which they have embarked?</P>
    <P>If a disastrous escalation of the doctors' dispute is to be avoided, the Minister must ensure that the 1986 agreement between the non-consultant hospital doctors and their employees is honoured, and he must open negotiations at a national level with the IMO.</P>
    <P>I understand that today tentative talks took place between the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the IMO &mdash; talks about talks.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us if any progress was made and if there is a possibility that he will meet the IMO to try to resolve this dispute before the weekend.  In the wider context he must halt this disastrous programme of health cuts and chaos which they are creating and enter into negotiations with all the parties involved to work out a planned and coherent development of the health services which will provide the highest quality of patient care in the most economic way.  It is not possible to do that under present conditions where, in 1987, the Minister has indicated arbitrarily the amount of money available and, in effect, is forcing severe cutbacks in the services available for people who need care.  The Minister and the Government must back off from the disastrous course they are on at the moment and seek to settle this dispute between the non-consultant doctors and their employers.  He should sit down with all the interested parties and thrash out the future development of those services.</P>

      <P>The Minister has brought the health services into a deep crisis.  Last night I got a phone call from a distraught mother whose child lies awaiting surgery in the surgical ward of a local hospital. She wants to know if her child should suffer more, or possibly die next week, for want of surgery.  I ask the Minister to call on the President of the Irish Medical Organisation to come into the Department and open negotiations on the problems that exist.  The Minister should attempt to sort out these problems before something serious happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poorly paid, overworked junior hospital doctors have contracts agreed at local level.  These contracts are negotiated with such bodies as the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the Minister now wants to hand the negotiating process back to the local health boards and hospital boards.  I put it to the Minister that he is opting out of his statutory responsibility.  He is seeking to avoid reality in his bunker in the Custom House, protected by men who do not leave their offices, who do not know about the pressures and the everyday life <Col N="1661" /> in hospitals, who do not have to work in casualty departments, in surgical units, in theatres, in coronary care units or assist the dying in their last moments.  The Minister has chosen the protection of the faceless people who have perpetrated a deep and grave crisis on the people of the country.  Is it too late to make an appeal to his better sense, to appeal to his compassion and ask him, in the interests of the people of the country, to desist from the policy path he has chosen and move instead to the pragmatic path of reality?</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister on leaving the House to contact the president and secretary-general of the IMO and ask them to attend a meeting with him in an attempt to resolve the outstanding matters that have caused this serious strike.  I suggest to him that he should spend the weekend working until such time as the negotiations have successfully resolved the matters at issue.  I appeal to him to do everything in his power to resolve this catastrophic strike which may escalate on Saturday.</P>
    <P>I should like to address an appeal to the president of the IMO and the junior hospital doctors.  If following this debate tonight the Minister agrees to meet the people involved in an effort to resolve these outstanding issues will they withdraw their strike action threatened for next Saturday?  On compassionate and caring grounds I ask them to return to work and continue to provide the very necessary care for all those in our hospitals and those awaiting admission. It is important that I should try to extract from the Minister a commitment to negotiate with the doctors and that they should decide to call off the strike if the negotiations take place.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister said that the negotiations are being left to the health boards and the hospitals concerned but I put it to him that responsibility and accountability for health care rests with him.  The disjointed, <i>ad hoc</i> way in which he has caused the crisis leads me to believe that the Taoiseach, who is present, should arrange to have him replaced.  The Taoiseach <Col N="1662" /> should consider inviting the Minister for Labour, or the chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference, to bring about an end to this strike.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to intervene to arrange such a conference, even at this late hour.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa gave details of the contracts the junior hospital doctors had signed and of the agreement reached in 1986.  There is no doubt that the terms of the agreement have been torn to tatters and discarded.  Deputy De Rossa pointed out that the local government staff negotiating board today attempted to bring the parties together in an effort to solve the problems.  I gather that those efforts were not successful but I hope further efforts will be made and that the Minister will get directly involved.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the issues in the dispute but the Minister has set out to misrepresent some of them.  I have met representatives of the junior hospital doctors and I am aware that they are not asking for special treatment.  They recognise the need for rationalisation of our health services but they insist that the 1986 agreement be adhered to.  They insist that there must be a limit on working hours.  At present it is economically attractive for the Department, and the health boards, to insist on a reduction in the number of junior doctors because they can put the remainder on overtime. They will only get one-third of the amount of overtime.  If they are put on a one-in-two rota they will be working a five-day week, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; every second night and every second weekend.  For example, if they are working at weekends they will have to work Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night and all day Monday.  In between they may get a few hours sleep. Can the Minister say that those doctors can give a comprehensive service to the public?  Surely the Minister will agree that the lives of patients are at risk under such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to direct the health boards to adhere to the 1986 agreement and to insist that his directive is binding on them.  Had the Minister adopted a planned and careful <Col N="1663" /> approach to the rationalisation of our health services, along the lines suggested by Deputy Desmond when he was Minister, we would not be in this position tonight. Indeed, had the Minister's party resisted the temptation, in the national interest, to make political hay at a time when Deputy Desmond was trying to introduce on a phased basis a rationalisation of the health services we would not be discussing this matter tonight.  I do not think any Members on this side of the House are responsible.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to respond to the Minister's suggestion in the House recently that the overrun of £55 million took place during the term of office of the last Government.  That overrun did take place during our term of office but it was done by health boards controlled by the Minister's party.  The Minister has been on the road to Damascus; he changed one morning from being a shadow spokesperson on health to a Minister for Health and in the change he became totally convinced of the need for fiscal rectitude.  I have put a suggestion to the Minister that would help resolve this dispute and I appeal to him to follow it up.  I should like to appeal to both sides to come together and have direct talks. Is the Chair in a position to tell me how much time I have left?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has until 8.03 p.m. but I gather that he is anxious to share his time with another Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be sharing my time. Next week I will have an opportunity, when considering the Estimate for the Department of Health, to make suggestions in regard to the health services. Nobody is anxious to spend time in hospital unless it is necessary and those who are ill should not have to worry about whether they will be cared for or if the medical support staff will be available to look after them.  I have been alerted to the special problems that have arisen in some of our smaller hospitals and of the difficulties that have arisen in specialist <Col N="1664" /> units in our larger cities where consultants have to cover a number of hospitals.  It is clear that next week people will die as a result of this strike, if it is not resolved.  As a medical practitioner the Minister should be conscious of that.</P>
      <P>I have found the IMO to be a responsible and reasonable group of people who do not wish to risk the lives of patients in hospitals or prolong the suffering of those in difficulty.  However, the Minister has driven them into a position where they must show that they mean business.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to reverse his decision and set up the structures to deal directly with the IMO. Those in hospital and those awaiting admission are worried that the strike may escalate on Saturday and that they will not get treatment.  I am satisfied that the strike can be stopped and that the issues can be resolved but for that to happen the Minister, and the Taoiseach, will have to be pragmatic and caring.  We have all experienced relatives and friends having to go to hospital at short notice and are aware that many people are queueing at casualty departments awaiting admission. We are all aware that patients are being discharged early while others are at serious risk.  We are all aware of the psychological pressure and the emotional trauma of fear and anxiety that people face when they are sick.  I appeal to the Minister to help people avoid those conditions by meeting the IMO for realistic talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Allen for giving me some time to speak on this matter.  Both he and I had put down a number of Private Notice questions today which have been subsumed in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Allen's plea to the Minister that he should enter into negotiations with the IMO to avert the general strike planned for Saturday with the resultant deterioration that would bring about in an already serious situation in the health services.  In the little time available to me I will concentrate on what I perceive to be the reason for this strike. <Col N="1665" /> This is simply one flashpoint and even if the Minister resolves this one speedily, as I hope he will, there will be others unless the basic problem is resolved.  It is quite clear that those in the front line of the medical services feel totally excluded from the decision making process in terms of rationalisation of the services. They believe that they are at least equal to any administrator and perhaps should be involved in the process of deciding how the medical services can be delivered in a more cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>There is a level of hostility at present which has never existed before.  In <i>The Irish Medical News</i> of 30 April Dr. Tim Collins described his view of what has been happening in the health services, that just because the country is in financial crisis it does not mean that all the executives of health boards and the Department of Health can send their brains out to lunch.  He said it does not mean that we have to dismantle and destroy our health services, both primary and secondary and make cynical statements about transfer of resources to primary care.  In <i>The Medical Times</i> of 10 April, Dr. Cyril Daly, a representative of general practitioners, referred to the Taoiseach and Minister MacSharry as two thoroughbreds &mdash; he was kind to them &mdash; and said they were like raging bulls in a china shop but that, unlike bulls in a china shop, they are not normally asked to pick up the pieces.  It is quite clear that at present we are trying to pick up the pieces in the health services.</P>
    <P>As I said, this strike is just a single flashpoint in the whole system which is in crisis and chaos and indeed in a state of shock.  It is important that not only should this problem be resolved but that there should be an overall commitment to entering into the kind of discussions to which Deputy De Rossa referred, round table discussions with all the groups involved in the provision of the health services as to how a properly planned programme of rationalisation can take place.</P>
    <P>On budget night there were gasps from this side of the House when the extent of the further cuts, over and above those <Col N="1666" /> already proposed in the January budget in the health area, were indicated.  In the following debate it was suggested that we were simply playing politics and scare-mongering when we indicated the kind of problems which would arise.  However, it was quite clear that the health services could not cope with cuts of the size implemented and maintain an adequate level of health service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and through him, the Taoiseach, whose presence is welcome, to think again very carefully about whether the health services are really the area in which they want to prove their serious intent in relation to the public finances.  They should meet the IMO to resolve this dispute and then commit themselves to a rethink on the extent of cuts in the health services proposed for this year.  They should get back to a rational plan which would have broad support in the House and outside it instead of implementing indiscriminate cuts which have led to this crisis.  They should engage in a process of consultation because lack of it is causing anger and frustration especially when fundamental changes take place without consulting the front line personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say on behalf of the Progressive Democrats that if the junior hospital doctors' strike is allowed to escalate to an all out strike next Saturday we will have the most terrible strike ever seen where life and death will be the real issues.  That must not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister must ensure that the health services are properly run.  He alone, with his Cabinet colleagues, carries the full and ultimate responsibility in this matter.  We fully accept the financial constraints on the health budget which the Government have imposed but it is all the more vital, in the difficult climate which has resulted, that the Government govern and that the Minister administers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The junior doctors' strike is but the latest and most dramatic symptom of the confusion and chaos which has resulted from the buck passing between the Minister <Col N="1667" /> and his Department on the one hand and the health boards and voluntary hospitals on the other.  The Minister set the budget but hides behind the health boards and the voluntary hospitals from the unpopular fallout inevitably associated with cost cutting.  The hospitals and the health boards then act unilaterally and crucial issues like the delivery of a proper health care service for those in need and other matters, like the junior doctors' contracts, fall foul of the black hole of confusion that has grown up between the Minister and the local health agencies.</P>
    <P>I have always personally admired the Minister.  He said recently that he cannot intervene while the strike is in progress. The Minister might take a leaf out of the book of one of his colleagues, the Minister for Labour who averted a major strike some weeks ago because of his actions.  The Minister is new to office but he would be well advised to take his own counsel in this matter and to seek an immediate solution.</P>
    <P>It is a firm belief of the Progressive Democrats that this strike of junior hospital doctors need never have happened, should not have been allowed to escalate and indeed could now be brought to an early conclusion were the Minister merely to direct that the February 1986 agreement, which was previously entered into, be now adhered to by hospital managements. Is that too much to ask the Minister to do?  The terms of employment of junior hospital doctors have been for a long time a bone of contention.  I recall pickets outside the Department of Health in the Custom House when the late Erskine Childers was Minister for Health in the early seventies.  The principal complaint then was the inordinately long hours which junior hospital doctors were expected to work.  In most of the intervening period this issue had not been satisfactorily resolved.  On occasions the doctors withdrew their services, limited them and threatened to withdraw them but their overall concern for the welfare of patients resulted in their settling for less than a satisfactory conclusion to their <Col N="1668" /> problems on all those occasions.  On the initiative of the Department of Health, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, the Federated Union of Employers and the IMO concluded an agreement on conditions of service for junior hospital doctors in February 1986 which was to be the basis for all contracts made between hospital managements and junior hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>One of the clauses in that agreement says that an intern shall not normally be rostered to serve more than 70 hours in any one week.  In another clause relating to house doctors the same provision applied, and in another clause applying to the post of registrar the same provision also applied.  Yet we now have a situation condoned by the Minister as a result of indiscriminate cuts where these same junior hospital doctors are being asked to accept a reduction in numbers and to sign new contracts which, in many cases, will result in their having to work up to 120 hours per week.  The dispute is about the number of hours that junior hospital doctors have been asked to work.</P>
    <P>The 1986 agreement is being thrown out the window and we are back to the situation that had an earlier generation of doctors picketing the Custom House in the early seventies.  The junior hospital doctors have another grievance about rates of pay for overtime work where they are paid less than the hourly rate. That is a genuine grievance but it is not the issue in this dispute.  I have been informed on numerous occasions by representatives of junior hospital doctors that they recognise the need to reduce the overall cost of providing health care. They have indicated a willingness, if consulted, to identify and make suggestions on how greater cost efficiency can be achieved and substantial savings made &mdash; savings of as much as £35 million have been mentioned.  Indeed the willingness to suggest areas for savings has been a consistent message from different groups employed in the health services if only adequate and full consultation had taken place.</P>
    <P>I merely wish to make the point that, as I understand it, the junior hospital <Col N="1669" /> doctors are willing to shoulder their share of job cuts but not to the extent that hours worked would be in breach of the 1986 agreement.  That is what it is all about.  Having fought such a long battle to get rid of archaic working hours, who can blame them for protesting at the blatant breach of a solemn agreement that is now being attempted?</P>
    <P>The public should know that a young doctor caring for them in a hospital ward, casualty department or operating theatre is expected to start his week at 8 a.m. on Monday, work and be available for work right through to 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday evening when he can return to his home. He must start work again at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, stay on duty overnight in the hospital before returning home.  He is back again on Friday morning, on duty overnight in the hospital, working all day Saturday, all night on Saturday and Sunday, all day on Monday and cannot return home until Monday night.</P>
    <P>This level of work for up to 120 hours a week, every week, continues for the duration of the six-month contract.  These hours are worked jointly by two doctors who alternate the nights between them. This rota is known as the &ldquo;one in two&rdquo; and it is what caused all the difficulty before the agreement was reached in February 1986.  That agreement provided for a &ldquo;one in three&rdquo;, with the addition that a locum would be available to do duty if any of the three was not available, and resulted in an average of 80 hours per week.  If the present cuts are applied many junior hospital doctors will be back to the old one in two rota.  Some junior hospital doctors have been told they can get employment for six months but that they will not be paid.  They have been offered free accommodation, free meals, free white coat, but no pay &mdash; I understand that offer was made in Holles Street.</P>
    <P>At present we have 33 hospitals affected by the strike with 60 more likely to come out on Saturday &mdash; 93 of our major hospitals being affected.  We know the calamitous, disastrous effects that will have on our health services and the danger to life.  The IMO have made several <Col N="1670" /> conciliatory moves.  In the statement issued yesterday they indicated that the solution to this strike would be the issuing of a directive from the Department of Health to all health boards and voluntary hospitals to implement in full the February 1986 agreement on conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The strike would be very unfair and unreasonable on those hospitals that had reached agreement with their junior doctors, and that begs another question, namely, some hospitals and health boards are unable to honour the 1986 agreement on contracts.  It is obvious that the grievances of the doctors are justified and understandable but in the context of the damage their strike will cause, literally putting life at risk, their action must not and should not go ahead nor is there any need for it to proceed.  It is reasonable for the junior doctors to ask for the implementation of an agreement conceded to them.  Would the hospitals and health boards take such unilateral action with regard to agreements and contracts with others, with powerful groups such as other trade unions, or professional groups?  Would the Minister or the Government allow it to happen if major agreements were torn to shreds in the manner of this agreement?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the buck stops with the Minister for Health because he is charged with ultimate responsibility to deliver a health service to the Irish people.  He must now discharge that responsibility and not behave merely as a messenger boy for the Minister for Finance. I understand that this afternoon the management at Temple Street Children's Hospital called in 29 junior hospital doctors and informed them of the crisis looming in their casualty section if this strike is allowed to go ahead on Saturday. A very difficult situation will have been arrived at with the obvious danger to health, with each side digging in.  With views hardening, the prospect of finding a suitable solution will become more and more difficult.</P>
    <P>I have known the Minister a long time. I consider him to be very reasonable, a sensible and wise person.  I appeal to his <Col N="1671" /> sense of justice.  I appeal to him to ensure that this horrible event will not be allowed to happen.  I appeal to him to give the directive to ensure that the conditions of employment under which these doctors understood they were employed be adhered to.  That is a simple, reasonable request.  In a dispute each side says things about the other and the longer the dispute goes on the more difficult it will be to resolve it.  Between now and Saturday is the time when all efforts must be made to find a happy and sensible solution.  It is not a major difficulty.  It does not involve a massive amount of State funds.  It does not mean the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  All that is required is the application of common sense and in the past the Minister displayed plenty of that.  I hope he will apply it to the present case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by setting the current industrial action by the non-consultant hospital doctor members of the Irish Medical Organisation in context.  In doing so I refer both to the existing level of action in certain health boards and hospitals and also the planned escalation of this action from Saturday next.</P>
      <P>The context in which this action must be viewed is that of the overall state of the nation's finances.  It is now accepted by the vast majority of the Members of this House that urgent remedial action was unavoidable if the financial integrity of the State was to be preserved.  Acceptance of this fact dictated that the unsustainably high level of public expenditure which we have tolerated until recently could no longer be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It flows from this that the areas of most concentrated public expenditure, including health care, had to be forced to make significant economies.  As the Minister responsible for the health services I recognised that it was not possible to implement these economies painlessly. My approach was, and is, to make every effort to ensure that the inevitable consequences of this very necessary policy should not bear heavily on those for <Col N="1672" /> whom the health services should care most: the sick, poor, the handicapped and the elderly.  In this regard I refer to the statement of the Bishops' Conference recognising the need for reductions in health expenditure and stating the principles which should obtain in applying these reductions are principles to which I am fully committed.  I have also sought to ensure that reductions in staffing are kept to a minimum and are distributed equitably across the whole range of health care personnel.</P>
    <P>Unlike some Members of this House I cannot afford the luxury of, on the one hand, demanding that the economy be prudently managed while, at the same time, insisting that the various public services remain untouched.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies Allen and Molloy that both their parties supported us here in the House three weeks ago that expenditure should not exceed £1,314 million, yet tonight they are suggesting we should be spending more than that.</P>

      <P>The tough decisions of resource allocation which we now face within the health services on a daily basis can only be made and sustained if they are seen to apply fairly to all of the various interest groups which constitute the health service workforce.  I said earlier that equity demands that I not be seen to favour one group more than another.  I might well add that logic also demands that approach.</P>
      <P>I cannot reasonably expect that health care workers generally, and their representative bodies, will lend their support to policies which result in job losses, reductions in premium pay etc., while one group is seen to be protected from making its contribution to the general effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I now turn to arrangements for <Col N="1673" /> the provision of services during the proposed strike?  I think it is necessary, first of all, to put the difficulties in context. Although the 1,821 non-consultant hospital doctors may be on strike, about 2,900 doctors will remain available to provide services to the public.  There are 1,800 general practitioners providing a country-wide first line service.  I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the public to make the maximum use of their general practitioners and to seek service in hospitals only in cases of genuine emergency.</P>
    <P>All the consultant staff in general and psychiatric hospitals will continue to be available.  It will not, of course, be feasible or advisable to attempt to provide a full hospital service.</P>
    <P>Those who are already in hospital will continue to receive all necessary care. Arrangements are being put in place for the provision of a consultant staffed accident and emergency service throughout the country.  My Department will remain in touch with health boards and hospitals throughout the strike and the position will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>I am happily in a position to give an assurance to this House and to the public that an adequate service will be available to meet accident and emergency cases which present during the course of the strike.  I regret, of course, that routine hospital admissions will be delayed but should any emergency arise with any patient who is awaiting admission to hospital, it will be possible to deal with it quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In cases of emergency, patients should make contact with their general practitioners, who will make all the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the absolute importance of using the general practitioner service rather than resorting directly to hospitals.  The public's co-operation in this matter will greatly facilitate the ability of hospitals to provide a good service to people who genuinely need the service that can be provided only in hospitals.  Indeed, if there was no strike &mdash; and I speak as a general practitioner &mdash; this is how the service <Col N="1674" /> should always be utilised.</P>
    <P>I recently met with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation and discussed the proposed action by non-consultant hospital doctors.  Following this meeting officials of my Department contacted each of the voluntary hospitals and health boards requesting that each agency invite local medical staff to participate in discussions.  It was envisaged that these meetings would explain the implications of decisions taken affecting non-consultant hospital doctors and would also explore any possible ways of ameliorating such decisions through revised rostering arrangements, cutbacks in overtime etc.</P>
    <P>It has been established that there was widespread consultation at local level and in many instances both in the health boards and the voluntary hospitals, this consultation proved successful.  For example there were no problems for the non-consultant hospital doctors in Sligo and Letterkenny General Hospitals, in St. Conal's Mental Hospital and St. Columba's Hospital, Sligo, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, the Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street or in the Coombe.</P>
    <P>Following local negotiations it was possible to reach agreement in the Mater Hospital, the Meath, the Adelaide, Portiuncula and the Mercy and South Infirmary in Cork.  In fact almost two-thirds of public hospitals in the country are functioning without disruption at the moment.</P>
    <P>At all times I have consistently urged that local discussion should continue, despite the fact that I am aware that in certain areas directions to local non-consultant hospital doctors have prevented agreement being reached or the discussions having any real purpose.</P>
    <P>In a further effort to prevent the dispute officials of my Department met with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation last Friday night.</P>
    <P>This meeting lasted some five hours and a variety and combination of options were explored by both sides, unfortunately without positive outcome.</P>
    <P>It is singularly disappointing that in <Col N="1675" /> areas previously unaffected by the dispute, or indeed where agreement had been reached, the escalation of the dispute will result in the hard work already completed being negated.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that all efforts were made by local management and my officials to resolve this dispute.  I have regretfully no option but to conclude that a small group of non-consultant hospital doctors were always intent on precipitating this action, regardless of the efforts of local management or my Department.  Indeed, I understand that informal contacts are still continuing to see whether a basis can be found for negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute.</P>
    <P>Over the last few weeks much has been made of the supposedly poor pay and conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors following the implementation of cutbacks in individual areas.  I would now like to put these claims in context.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years the conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors have improved significantly and they currently enjoy a very attractive remuneration package, as well as other valuable benefits. A non-consultant hospital doctor who obtains his medical degree and obtains a post of intern receives a basic salary of £9,965.</P>
    <P>On completing his intern year, he moves to the house officer grade for a further period of 2 to 3 years.  A third year house officer receives a basic salary of £13,052.  When two years' experience has been acquired a house officer may compete for a registrar post.  The basic salary for a registrar ranges from £15,083 at the minimum to £18,189 at the maximum.</P>
    <P>In addition to basic salary, any non-consultant hospital doctor rostered for duty in excess of 40 hours per week receives additional remuneration.  The rates of payment for these excess hours has been subject to repeated revision following examination by independent bodies, most recently in October 1986.</P>
    <P>The package of remuneration for non-consultant hospital doctors also includes <Col N="1676" /> additional payments in respect of higher qualifications.</P>
    <P>Fees from the Department of Social Welfare in respect of certificates issued to patients; fees in respect of providing lectures delivered to nurses; payment of a living out allowance where a hospital authority are not in a position to provide adequate accommodation and; payment of the cost of telephone installation and rental in situations where a non-consultant hospital doctor is living outside the hospital and is obliged to be on call.</P>
    <P>A non-consultant hospital doctor is entitled to 32 calendar days' annual leave. In addition he is entitled to a further 8 working days per annum in lieu of the liability of being rostered for duty on public holiday.</P>
    <P>A non-consultant hospital doctor is also entitled to any 14 calendar days with pay prior to an examination for higher degrees or diplomas including repeat examinations.  Provisions regarding maternity leave, sick leave, compassionate leave are similar to those granted to permanent health service personnel. All of these conditions are available to doctors who, after all, are still in a training position.</P>
    <P>The principal point being made by the media and medical representatives in the last few days concerns the excessive hours which doctors would be forced to work if the cutbacks proposed by local managements were to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I do of course accept that in certain situations in certain specialties, non-consultant hospital doctors can have very onerous workloads and can be under considerable pressure at times.  It should be pointed out however that many non-consultant hospital doctors do not encounter such pressure.</P>
    <P>Some specialties may not have a very heavy workload outside normal hours. There can be therefore a wide variation in the level of activity of doctors not only between hospitals but also within different departments within the same hospital.  When contacting the various agencies over the last number of days my officials have continually stressed that <Col N="1677" /> when considering their proposals, management should seek to ensure that as a matter of routine rostering, no doctor should be expected to work excessive hours.  I myself have made that statement here in the Dáil in the last few days and have made it publicly on a number of occasions outside the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As a result of a Labour Court hearing in 1986 to examine the rates of payment for hours worked in excess of a normal agreed working week, a steering group composed of representatives of all interested parties to conduct a review of the existing organisation of medical activity in hospitals was established.</P>
    <P>This steering group has been operating since October 1986 and its report is due in the very near future.  By their action at this stage, in advance of the issue of the report of this group, non-consultant hospital doctors are jeopardising an exercise which potentially is one of the most important initiatives taken for many years in the area of medical manpower.</P>
    <P>While making every effort in the short term to contain expenditure levels within the allocations made to the various health agencies, I am also acutely aware of the need to arrive at long term reductions in health care costs, in the context of a rationalised service.  Such a rationalised service will clearly require fewer beds than at present while maintaining the comprehensive nature of the service. This rationalisation progress provides a second avenue by which local arrangements can be arrived at to resolve this dispute.</P>
    <P>I feel duty bound as a proud member of the medical profession to remind my non-consultant hospital doctor colleagues of the long and honourable tradition they now represent.  It is a tradition that demands that no genuine emergency be ignored.  The caring orientation of our profession has recently been highlighted again by the Medical Council in their reminder to doctors of their ethical obligation to ensure that continuing care and emergency treatment remain available to patients.  I want to quote from a letter from the Medical Council which I <Col N="1678" /> received today and in which they stated:</P>
    <P>The Council wishes to draw attention to the statement under the heading &ldquo;Withdrawal of Services&rdquo; in the recently adopted, &ldquo;European Principles of Medical Ethics&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When a doctor decides to participate in an organised collective withdrawal of services he is not released from his ethical responsibilities <i>vis-á-vis</i> his patients to whom he must guarantee emergency services and such care as is required by those currently being treated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I trust that the non-consultant hospital doctors will find it possible not to deviate from these standards should the industrial action proceed.</P>
    <P>As I said in a statement yesterday the scale of the action proposed is out of all proportion to the matters remaining in contention.  Given the impending report of the steering group to which I have already referred; the rationalisation process to be completed shortly; the agreements already reached locally; and the likelihood that with the goodwill of the IMO centrally, a number of other agreements could readily be concluded.</P>
    <P>There is an overwhelming case for deferring the action decided upon.  I would ask the non-consultant hospital doctors now, bearing in mind the noble tradition of service they have inherited, to consider the appeal I am now making, not only in the interests of the wellbeing of patients and their relatives, but also in the interests of the health services as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disturbed by the somewhat fatalistic note in the Minister's contribution where he said that we are faced with a very serious industrial dispute in the health services.  There is one glimmer of hope where he indicates that informal contacts are continuing to see where a basis can be formed for negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute.  I urge that every possible effort be made between now and Saturday &mdash; and if necessary the strike should be suspended <Col N="1679" /> by the non-consultant hospital doctors &mdash; to enable these discussions to progress.</P>
      <P>There is a responsibility devolving on the Minister to end this dispute.  I hope he has indicated firmly through the LGSMB and the FUE that his officers will continue to be available to endeavour to ensure that there is no escalation of the dispute.  There are some 600 non-consultant hospital doctors in 33 hospitals involved in the dispute at present.  It would be disastrous if there was an escalation of the dispute which would lead to some 1,500 staff withdrawing their services. I say to the non-consultant hospital doctors and to the people who are leading their negotiating team that there is nothing sacrosanct about Saturday nor is there anything sacrosanct or meritorious about going on strike and that they should suspend their action to enable the Minister and the LGSMB and the FUE to review the situation to see how this year's budget can be kept in place during the remainder of 1987 so that essential, emergency and basic hospital services in the acute area, in particular, be delivered to those who are in need.</P>
      <P>No matter what role we play in society we will not forgive ourselves if a child, a mother, an elderly person, a person injured in an accident or a person requiring emergency treatment suffers unduly or terminally as a result of this dispute. Patients in need come first.  I know from experience that it can be quite difficult, even with the best of facilities, to ensure that emergency rotas and arrangements are kept intact during a hospital dispute which involves a large number of people. I urge that notice be suspended so that discussions can take place.  Even if the discussions are informal at present they can become formal and we would hope, lead to a resolution of the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental reason for this dispute is not that the 1986 agreement is being abrogated or messed around but because there is a basic lack of elementary resources in individual hospitals to enable the agreement to continue.  This applies whether it is a reduction from £120 per week to £50 per week in the <Col N="1680" /> salary of student nurses, whether there are one or two extra rotas being introduced for non-consultant hospital doctors in some hospitals or whether people are simply being fired.</P>
    <P>St. Vincent's Hospital which is in my constituency is a classic example of where this is happening.  That hospital has 500 beds, 90 of which are being closed.  St. Patrick's ward is being closed immediately. The budget for that hospital in 1986 was £22.5 million.  Taking into account the 25th round that sum would normally have grown to around £23.1 million this year.  However, the budget for this year is reduced to £20.51 million.  That represents a cut of £2 million in the budget for St. Vincent's Hospital.  In these circumstances it is easy to see why 90 beds have to be closed.  There are 105 non-consultant doctors in that hospital.  Two interns and SHOs will now have to be got rid of.  The workload on the remainder of the staff will increase if the hospital maintains its present degree of activity. Inevitably, eight more staff will have to go in addition to the 12 already mentioned. Thirty student nurses have already gone since last week-end.</P>
    <P>It is time this House began to appreciate that we cannot run a hospital like St. Vincent's or any other hospital if the budget is cut in that manner.  Inevitably the non-consultant doctors will be crucified in that exercise and we cannot maintain the February 1986 agreement. The issue is the collapse in many acute hospitals of their basic budgets because of reductions of between 12 and 20 per cent.  It is about time the people appreciated what that means in terms of the delivery of hospital care.  I predicted that that would happen.  Two days before Christmas I gave that memorandum to the last Government and I said that St. Vincent's Hospital would be cut by £2.4 million.  In the event it was cut by £2.1 million.  I resigned over it, because I knew what was going to happen.  Ths Secretary of the Department of Health and the Assistant Secretary responsible for Finance knew what would happen and there is no point in blaming them.</P>

      <P>The Minister should go back to the Cabinet and tell them that this dispute is an inevitable by-product of the reduction in the Health Vote and he should tell the Minister for Finance that he must get an extra £35 million for the remainder of this year in order to restore an ongoing delivery of acute hospital services. I do not care if the Minister for Finance next week in the Finance Bill raises health contributions from 1¼ per cent to 2 per cent.  I will vote for it as will my party.  We are prepared to pay for the continuation of the health services.  Let us stop blaming CEOs, the health boards, the FUE, the boards of voluntary hospitals and so on.  They can only do so much with the cloth that has been given to them.  If the Minister puts another 2p on the packet of fags or 4p on a pint, I do not care, I want my health services.  I do not want to have to bring my family down to Blackrock Private Clinic and pay £280 a day.  I do not have the money anyway.  I do not want to have to do that.  I want to pay my contributions on a taxation basis so that when I need the services they will be there for myself and my family, and the doctors should not suffer in trying to deliver the service with an agreement which I was proud to enter into in February 1986 and which will inevitably be torn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough for Doctor Collins or anybody else to say that they accept the health cuts but that they want them applied fairly.  They cannot be applied fairly to the NCHDs.  There is no such thing as fairness when one gets into surgery of that nature.  It cannot be done because the money is not there.  St. Vincent's Hospital alone has to cut £1 million in pay and pensions this year and they have to take out £260,000 for the NCHDs.  Inevitably they will be hammered, just as my niece, having done her training, got her walking papers from St. Vincent's Hospital and had to sign on in Victoria employment exchange last <Col N="1682" /> Friday.  She has now gone home to Waterford and cannot even do her six months. She knows, and I know, that that is what health cuts mean.  People will suffer and staff will suffer in the process.</P>
    <P>That would have arisen under the Health Vote of the former Government. The new Minister went into the Cabinet and they took another £6 million off the budget and that is the result.  Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have supported the health cuts.  They can have it.  It is a rotten vote and it is short by about £35 million to £40 million.  That money should be restored to the Health Vote.  These are the options.  I do not like them.  It is outrageous that four NCHDs in Holles Street should be told that if they do their six months they will be given meals and a white coat, and probably a broken down stethoscope.  When they said they would not accept it what did the hospital do? They said &ldquo;we will give you £50 a month&rdquo;. That is not the way to run a health service. In St. Michael's Hospital in my own constituency, for instance, we should not bring back a one in two rota into a surgical ward and have an NCHD work 136 hours. I had my problems with the NCHDs. Some of them could not go on strike fast enough when I was there but we kept them at bay, we got agreement and we got negotiations.</P>
    <P>I would make a point to the NCHDs. There is a report coming out on 24 June, a report which I commissioned in relation to the workload.  It is a very complex area as almost every hospital is different.  If the strike was deferred for a week or two that report would be available and the mayhem to be visited on the people by a total withdrawal of staff from all acute hospitals could be set aside.</P>

      <P>The fundamental question is the funding of our acute hospital system.  If we take out the best part of £70 million from the acute hospital system, this is the result.  It is not good enough for the NCHDs to say we accept <Col N="1683" /> the need for some cuts because inevitably they will suffer as nursing staff, as administrative staff and as every other staff in the hospital suffer.  I would ask the Minister to abandon the singular viciousness of what has happened this year in the budget and go back to the Cabinet on Friday morning and say that he must get some additional resources to keep the acute hospitals going.  The Minister for Finance, I am sure, will agree because in this case he misjudged the situation and his senior officials drastically misjudged the situation.  They would not accept the information given by the Department of Health and they are paying a rotten price for it now.  We cannot blame the Department of Health or the Minister for Health because he can only allocate the money he gets and he is being crucified in the process.  That is no solution.  I appeal to the NCHDs, in the national interest, to suspend their action.  That is the minimum we can ask and in return the Minister should enter into negotiations with them to ensure that if there are reductions in the acute services they will be applied in an orderly and rational way. The Minister should endeavour to get funding from the Government for the health services for the remainder of 1986. Not a lot of money is required.  He has saved a great deal in the past week alone and will save money even next week in terms of deferred admissions.  That money could be a solution in a minor part of the major problem.</P>

      <P>The former Minister felt it worth his while to remove Government memoranda from the Department and I am sure he took plenty of other information with him as well when he left the Department.  He was aware he was going to resign, but, of course, resignation was the easy way out for him, for former Minister Deputy Kavanagh, former Minister Deputy Spring and former Minister Deputy Quinn.  It was a stage-managed affair in an effort to secure as many votes as possible.  I wanted to reply to the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, about the point he made about the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, I should indicate the very determined efforts made to resolve <Col N="1685" /> this proposed dispute.  The Minister Deputy O'Hanlon met with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation recently and discussed the proposed action by non-consultant hospital doctors.  Following the meeting, the Minister asked his officials to contact the health boards and voluntary hospitals asking each of the agencies to hold discussions with medical staff, in particular local non-consultant hospital doctors' representatives explaining the implications of any decisions taken affecting non-consultant hospital doctors and asking them to participate in discussions which might ameliorate the effect of such decisions, for example, revised rostering arrangements and so on.  There has been widespread consultation at local level and in many cases that consultation has proved successful.  Where agreement has not been reached, both the Government and Minister have urged that such consultation should continue.  I make that appeal again here this evening.  In addition, officials of the Department of Health had detailed direct discussions with the IMO to try to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>As a result of these efforts, agreement has been reached in many hospitals and agreement is very close in many others. I am aware that directions to local non-consultant hospital doctors' representatives have prevented agreement being reached in many places, without any breach of the 1986 agreement on conditions of service.  Despite the considerable progress which has been made, the non-consultant hospital doctors have now taken the drastic step of escalating the dispute from Saturday next.</P>
    <P>I consider it unreasonable that a section of the medical profession with its long tradition of caring service should in the light of the progress being made respond in this way.  It is important in the case of all disputes, but particularly in the case of disputes in the health service, that staff should weigh in the balance the scale of the action proposed and the distress likely to be caused.  I think the action proposed is totally unjustified in the circumstances of the issues remaining <Col N="1686" /> unresolved.  It is my view, a reflection of a sense of grievance felt by some non-consultant hospital doctors rather than the reality of their circumstances and, unfortunately, they seem to have imposed their views on the majority.</P>
    <P>There are impending developments which reduce further the justification for the action now being taken.  First, there exists at present a specially formed steering group with equal representation from management and the IMO who are examining the existing organisation of medical activity in hospitals with particular reference to arrangements etc., for non-consultant hospital doctors.  The work of the steering group has progressed satisfactorily and the IMO have expressed to the Minister their satisfaction on progress made to date.  The report of the steering group will be available in a matter of weeks and it is potentially of major importance for non-consultant doctors and the hospital service generally.</P>
    <P>The main reason for undertaking the exercise was to provide information which would enable the payments made to the doctors to be reassessed to encourage the most effective use of skilled medical manpower.  While meeting non-consultant hospital doctors' objections to the present arrangements for out-of-hours work, it would also provide the basis for a possible restructuring of the out-of-hours remuneration package.</P>
    <P>For the record, the steering group set itself the task of: gaining a full understanding of and describing how all medical activity in hospitals employing non-consultant hospital doctors is organised; gaining a full understanding of and presenting an accurate, representative account of the extent and components of such activity in terms which will be relevant and helpful to the determination of an acceptable method of payment; analysing and describing the present methods through which medical activity in hospitals is determined, monitored and controlled and presenting a full analysis of their findings and drawing such conclusion as they consider appropriate.  As I have said, the report of the steering group is expected shortly.  There is no <Col N="1687" /> reason, given goodwill on the part of the IMO, why preliminary discussions on issues arising from the report cannot be got under way quickly.  I would be very concerned that the action now contemplated would jeopardise these discussions.</P>
    <P>It might be useful for the House if at this point I gave some details of the remuneration package currently available to the doctors.  The Minister has already outlined this situation.  A house officer's basic salary for a 40-hour week rises from £11,335 to £16,411; a registrar's from £15,083 to £18,189.  In addition, for hours in excess of 40 for which non-consultant hospital doctors are rostered hourly payments rising to £4.18 per hour are payable.  It must be emphasised that while non-consultant hospital doctors may be rostered for such additional hours and are available they are not necessarily working.  Let us compare that with the hours of employment of Deputies and Senators, but Deputies in particular.  We work very long hours per week in a very difficult profession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors have perks which cannot be regarded as ungenerous.  For example, they are entitled to 32 days leave per annum plus eight working days in lieu of the liability for being rostered for duty on public holidays.  Payment while on leave is on the basis of ten notional hours per each day's annual leave or 70 hours per week of annual leave, that is 40 hours basic pay plus 30 hours at the appropriate <Col N="1688" /> rate for excess hours.  In addition, they are entitled to study leave &mdash; 14 days with pay prior to certain examinations, accommodation or a substantial living-out allowance, allowances for higher qualifications and the cost of telephone installation and rental: in all a reasonable remuneration package by any standards.</P>
      <P>The Government in their statement on Tuesday last urged that, where agreement had not been reached by non-consultant hospital doctors in local discussions, such discussions should continue because the necessary detailed information required to reach agreement is available locally and the financial implications, which differ from hospital to hospital, can be properly assessed by local managements only.  The fact that agreement has already been reached in many areas by way of local discussions underlines this position.</P>
      <P>It would be a sad commentary on a learned profession, with its long tradition of caring, that the non-consultant hospital doctors should embark on this action when negotiation is far from being exhausted.  At the very least, their action should be deferred to await the outcome of further local discussions.</P>
      <P>The Minister is contacting health boards and voluntary hospitals regarding the provision of emergency cover.  I would expect that those doctors who have already carried the burden of emergency cover, despite difficulties, would continue to do so.  Officers of the Department will be in touch with the Irish Medical Organisation about the level of emergency cover to be provided by those taking industrial action.  I make this appeal to non-consultant hospital doctors &mdash; to call off their proposed action and not place the lives of innocent patients at risk.  This appeal should be re-echoed by every Member of this House to the doctors at this stage: would they, for God's sake, call off their action because they will place the lives of innocent patients at risk?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the leaving certificate honours English paper on which the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was omitted, leaving students obliged to answer two questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to a very serious and important debate. It is not my intention to delay the House unduly.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business this morning.  I was correctly ruled out of order by you, Sir, on the basis that it was not appropriate at that time.  I want to thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise it on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of urgent national importance, particularly to the tens of thousands of young people, and their parents, involved in the leaving certificate examination. The honours English leaving certificate examination undertaken yesterday created widespread confusion among students.  That confusion was occasioned by a serious misprint or what might more appropriately be called an omission from the afternoon honours English paper when the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was inadvertently omitted from the fiction questions.  As we now know this led students to believe that they had to answer both parts of each question rather than part (i) or part (ii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> today the representative of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, Mr. Tom Hunt, is reported as describing the mistake as &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo;. He was quoted as having said that it created chaos in examination centres. That newspaper claimed they had received telephone calls from schools around the country where students had emerged from examination halls in tears because of the confusion.  Sometimes newspapers are given to a little hyperbole on such occasions.  With the tension that abounds among students facing their <Col N="1690" /> most critical examination, I can well imagine how the first paper of the leaving certificate bearing an error would lead to confusion and indeed tears when they found that the time allowed for the completion of a particular paper was totally inadequate because of a misprint or mistake of which they were unaware, or of which they were not made aware by the relevant supervisors.  If students answered both parts of the question then undoubtedly they would not have had sufficient time to adequately answer the other questions on the paper.</P>
    <P>I understand that a spokesman for the Department apologised to the students and their families for the mistake made. As a lady of some ill repute some years ago used to say &ldquo;He would, wouldn't he&rdquo;; that so far as it goes is all right. He is also reported to have said that if students answered the two parts of each question he would ensure that they would get credit for so doing.  So far as it goes that is acceptable.  But the phrase which prompted me to raise the matter this morning and to request the Minister to come in here this evening and make a statement was when the spokesman &mdash; if he is accurately reported &mdash; said: &ldquo;We will do our utmost to ensure that no student suffers as a result&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;utmost&rdquo; put the fear of God in me.  I might add that I have not a child sitting the examination though I will have in a year or two.  But I and all Members will know people who have children sitting the examination.  For a Department spokesman to say that they would do their utmost, a glaring mistake having been made by the Department, is not sufficient.  Had he said that they would ensure that no student would suffer as a result that would have been acceptable and perhaps I might not have asked to raise the matter this evening.</P>
    <P>There are some worrying aspects of this occurrence.  I understood that papers are proof read.  Examination papers are not like newspapers which must be produced in a great hurry.  There may be a certain amount of pressure on examination setters to produce papers within <Col N="1691" /> a certain time but it would not be anything like the pressure on somebody who has to produce a newspaper and proof read it very quickly.  Even then I do not imagine that proof readers must read every subject, there being specialists in each subject.  Examination papers having been proof read, if at the last minute there is found to be a mistake, then I understand that an erratum sheet is attached to or delivered with the relevant paper to each of the 800 or so examination centres.  That would mean that the officer presiding over an examination centre would be able to inform students sitting the examination that there was an error or omission in the paper and which would make an enormous difference to the time available to students to complete the paper.</P>
    <P>At the very least one would have to claim that this mistake arose through carelessness.  I consider it gross neglect that a paper should have been issued to examination centres, given the time provided for proof reading, also given the fact that no erratum sheet was issued pointing out that the paper contained an error.</P>
    <P>Since it was in the afternoon that students actually sat the examination surely somebody at some stage yesterday morning would have been aware that a mistake had been made and that telephone communication could have been established with examination centres.  I am sure that in almost every examination centre now there is a telephone.  This was such a serious mistake I would have thought that the Minister might have sought some help from other Departments in establishing contact with every examination centre &mdash; or by way of telegrams &mdash; to so inform centres before the papers were opened. This would have meant that the error could have been pointed out to students. It should also be borne in mind that one point gained or lost in the leaving certificate could mean an enormous difference to a student's whole future.  I hope the Minister will make a statement tonight and will clear up any misunderstanding there is in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> I am aware that the consensus among teachers is that there should not be a resetting of this English paper.  I would be inclined to agree with that provided the Department can assure students the necessary change will be made or that extra marks will be given to take account of the mistake which was made in that paper.  If a student feels that because of some error he has done badly in his first paper, and an important one such as English, then perhaps that will affect his performance in future papers.  It is vital that the Minister should reassure students they will not suffer as a result of this mistake.  I will go so far as to say that if after the examination, students can prove that this caused a problem, those cases should be taken into account and perhaps something could be done for them in September or around that time.</P>
    <P>I agree there should not be a new paper.  Some students will have done well in the one they have already sat for and they would probably be reluctant to sit for a totally different paper.  I hope the assurance which I am sure the Minister will give to young people who are doing this exam, will allay their fears.  Again, I repeat that the mistake should not have been made.  What happened was not good enough.  I hope the Minister can assure us that the remainder of the exam papers will be read and re-read before they are sent out.  I imagine the remaining papers will be read more times than those in any previous exam to ensure there is no mistake.  Students must have confidence that the traditional accuracy of exam papers over the years will continue so that their ability will be fairly assessed in the rest of the exams.  A mistake has been made.  It is unfortunate and I am afraid some damage may have been done.  I hope the arrangements that will be made in the correction of those papers will give the results which would have accrued had the mistake not been made.  I hope the arrangements the Minister will make will ensure nobody suffers because of this error.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's normally placid humour which she demonstrates <Col N="1693" /> in the House was not so placid in the Department this morning and that certain people were given a piece of her mind when she heard about this problem. However, I ask for more than that.  On behalf of the students doing the exam and on behalf of the parents who have to put up with the worry of putting students through so many years of expensive education I am asking her to assure them that the results will reflect the ability of every student who is doing this exam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, as a former teacher, can very much appreciate the situation that arose throughout the country yesterday and the concern of the pupils sitting the exams, the teachers and the parents.  The exam which tens of thousands of pupils sat for yesterday will decide their future, what profession they will follow and what work they may get in the future.  The leaving certificate examination will definitely determine their lifestyle for the remainder of their lives.  To find that there was an error in the examination paper yesterday was very disconcerting.  It was the first exam and it was absolutely imperative that the pupils should start out with confidence, that they get the feel of the exam, that they would come out from that exam cool and confident and face the following papers feeling confident and capable.  The result of yesterday's fiasco was that the confidence of very many students was undermined.  They and their teachers were very unnerved and their parents were extremely concerned because they felt their children's future was seriously jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to underline to the Minister the seriousness of the overall situation.  If a number of students did the two parts of that question it meant they had less time for the other questions they tackled on that paper.  That, in turn, meant that those other questions were not answered as well as they would have been if they had not done the alternative part of that question.  The overall result is that the performance of every student in regard to that paper will be somewhat <Col N="1694" /> different from what it would have been if the paper had been properly printed.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to hear what the Minister proposes to do.  She is presented with a very difficult task and no matter what she decides the overall result will be distorted.  Perhaps she should consider giving some extra marks to the students who attempted that question.  Perhaps she should decide that that question should not be marked but that the marks should be divided between the other questions which were answered.  A number of options and permutations can be considered but I am afraid that no matter what is considered the psychological effect on a student will have seriously damaged his overall performance for the entire exam.  That is something the Department cannot quantify. It is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kavanagh asked, at whom does the finger point?  Where in the Department of Education was this serious mistake made?  It is the Minister's duty to find out exactly where it occurred. I hope the Minister is arranging to have all further examination papers examined well in advance.  If there was to be a repeat of this kind of mistake in any of the other exam papers the Minister would have to seriously consider resetting the English paper and also other papers.  I hope that situation does not arise but the seriousness of this matter and its effect on the students cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the manner in which this could affect the future of those students.  How the Minister can do something to rectify the matter is beyond me.  Perhaps she has some very inspiring answers for us this evening.  Normally she is very adept at answering questions in the House, as we have already seen this afternoon.  This is a particularly serious issue and I ask her to try to do everything she can to be as helpful, as compassionate and as understanding as possible and to give confidence to the students who are sitting the exams so that they will be able to continue the remainder of the examinations reassured that there will not be another mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Taylor-Quinn for the very sensitive and disciplined way they have dealt with this matter, but I would not expect otherwise from them. This has given me the opportunity to make a definitive statement on this issue.</P>
      <P>The error occurred in the fiction section of paper II of the leaving certificate high level examination in English. The error was that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was omitted between the alternatives (i) and (ii) which are offered in each of three questions A, B and C in this section.  As a result of this error candidates might have thought that they were required to answer both alternatives (i) and (ii) instead of one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of what has been said, it is unlikely &mdash; and I am convinced &mdash; that many candidates would have been confused or misled by the error, although I accept there would have been a degree of confusion.  In the preparation for the examination teachers during their classroom work have gone over with the student the format of an examination paper at all levels &mdash; intermediate and leaving certificates, and particularly with the higher papers because of the importance of this discipline &mdash; the method of answering and the choices of question offered. They would have been instructed in the use of those choices and they would have used them as part of their school tests &mdash; the mock intermediate certificate and the mock leaving certificate are based on the papers which will be set in the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations. They would have had no reason to expect that a change had been made but the teachers would have known if any such change had been contemplated because it would have been announced by the Department to the schools and a sample paper to illustrate the change would have been issued.  Therefore, because of their conditioning regarding the format of the paper, the majority of candidates would either have been unaware of the error on the paper or would have taken it for granted that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was in fact an error.  They <Col N="1696" /> would have been confirmed in this view by the fact that the general instructions at the beginning of the paper would have drawn attention to the existence of alternatives in the three questions, A, B, and C.</P>
    <P>All this is borne out by the results of preliminary inquiries made from schools and teachers of English throughout the country.  They have genuinely expressed the view that very few candidates would have thought that the two parts, (i) and (ii), in any of the three fiction questions were other than alternatives.  The teachers felt that most candidates would either not notice that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; had been omitted or would assume that it had been omitted in error.  They also thought that most candidates did not advert to the error until the examination was over and that their performance in the examination hall would have been unaffected by the error.</P>
    <P>That is why I regret so much what has blown up about this incident.  I regret that it happened.  As Minister for the Department, I must stand over the authority of the Department and the authenticity and validity of the examinations must always be beyond question.  This inspires the confidence of the parents, pupils and the public who place such emphasis on the results of the examinations.</P>
    <P>I come now to the point raised by the Deputies.  I want to assure Deputy Kavanagh that the spokesman for the Department did not say &ldquo;We will do our utmost&rdquo; which the Deputy obviously quoted from a newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot comment on how the newspapers interpreted his comment but his comment was that &ldquo;no candidate will suffer as a result of this confusion&rdquo;.  I ask the Deputies to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that no candidate has any cause to worry about this incident, I repeat that.  I want to assure the Deputies, the House and the country at large &mdash; students, parents and the <Col N="1697" /> public &mdash; that appropriate adjustments will be made to the marking scheme to guarantee equity to all candidates who sat for this paper.  Certain marking techniques will be employed to ensure that no candidate will suffer because he or she mistakenly thought that both alternatives had to be answered in relation to any of the fiction questions attempted.  Similar marking techniques have been successfully employed to cope with the effects of errors that have occurred on other examination papers in previous years.  However, I am not in a position to disclose what techniques will be employed because I do not wish to preempt the decisions which will be taken at the examiners' conferences shortly, the proceedings of which are absolutely confidential.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that some individuals or groups are urging that candidates be given a second opportunity to sit the leaving certificate higher level English paper. I was glad to note Deputy Kavanagh's firm assertion that this should not be done.  I think it would be counterproductive and would impose a quite unnecessary and intolerable burden on the candidates since it will be quite feasible to make appropriate adjustments to the marking scheme to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Again I regret very much that this happened. In the past number of years there <Col N="1698" /> were various incidents of one kind or another but my first duty this evening is to express regret.  My second duty is to assure the public, parents and young people in particular that the appropriate correcting measures will be taken to deal with any anomalies, that the supervisory examiners, and the examiners themselves, are skilled in this work, and that appropriate steps will be taken to enable them to pay particular attention to the various permutations which can occur in dealing with this error.  My third duty is to repeat that I am making this definitive statement as Minister for Education.  I take my duties so far as examinations are concerned very seriously and I intend to see that the steps I have outlined here tonight will be fully and comprehensively carried out so that no young person who sat the leaving certificate English honours paper need have any fear but that he or she will be judged accurately.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have allocated £400,000 to vocational education committees for adult literacy and community education, free of charge or at nominal cost, for the financial year 1987.  This is more than was allocated in any previous financial year by the outgoing Government for this service, being £50,000 greater than the sum allocated in 1986 and £250,000 in excess of what was provided in 1985.  An increase of this magnitude should be sufficient to enable VECs to at least maintain the service in 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 26 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that second-level schools in general do not offer relationships/sex education as a separate specific programme but integrate this provision with the overall educational programme of the individual school. Elements of sexuality and relationships education are included in various subjects and in other educational activities such as pastoral care.  I understand that all post-primary schools provide education in aspects of relationships and sexuality for their pupils.  This is primarily a matter between schools and parents and I am satisfied that all categories of post-primary schools are aware of the need to attend to this aspect of pupil development. I consider that my Department's circular on relationships/sex education provides appropriate guidelines for schools on the topic.  I will continue to keep the matter under review in the light of changing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures governing the appointment of assistant teachers and principals in national schools require that at least one member of the selection boards be a woman and one a man and that the boards have due regard to the <Col N="1550" /> provisions of the Employment Equality Act, (1977) and the Code of Practice of the Employment Equality Agency (1983).</P>
      <P>As secondary schools are private institutions, appointments of teachers in these schools are made by the authorities of the schools concerned and I, as Minister for Education, have no function in the matter.  However, post-primary school management authorities and principal techers had their attention drawn by Circular Letter 45/84, to the Code of Practice of the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
      <P>In regard to community and comprehensive schools, the position is that the arrangements for the appointment of staff are a matter in the first instance for the boards of management of the schools concerned.  My Department's function in relation to the appointment of teaching staff is one of sanction only, provided that the appointments are found to be in order in all respects.  The setting up of interview boards is a function of the boards of management and consequently the question of female representation on such boards is a matter for them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the representation of women on interview boards for teachers in second level vocational schools, the position is that while the general selection procedures are regulated by my Department, the kernel of the problem in relation to female representation on interview boards derives from the extent to which females are represented on the VECs themselves.</P>
      <P>The position regarding female teachers in vocational schools appointed to posts as principal, vice-principal and other posts of responsibility is that such posts are advertised by the individual VEC and the selection and appointment of the teachers is a matter for it.</P>
      <P>I shall continue, however, to encourage the representation of women in every field of educational activity.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the financial difficulties for students in third level education from lower income families. To assist them in pursuing courses of third level education, there are a number of schemes operated by my Department under which grants and scholarships are made available to eligible students.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme is the appropriate scheme in the case of eligible students who enter on university courses.</P>
      <P>Despite enormous pressures on Exchequer resources, the financial provisions of the higher education grants scheme, the VEC scholarship scheme and related student aid schemes will be improved in 1987 as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  The income eligibility limits for, and maintenance element of, grants and scholarships will be increased in line with inflation (3.4 per cent) and</P>
      <P>(ii)  The lecture fee element of grants will be increased for the academic year 1987-88 in line with the increases in fees (6%) for that academic year.</P>

    <P>The middle level technician training programme, supported by the European Social Fund, provides for 10,700 places in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.

      <P>Only textbooks included by my Department on an approved list may be used for secular instruction in national schools.  In 1984-85 agreement was reached with Irish publishers of textbooks on guidelines based on those of the International Reading Association for evaluating sex-stereotyping in reading materials.  Only textbooks which comply with these guidelines have been added to the approved list since for use in national schools.  However, I accept that a problem still remains in regard to certain textbooks which were approved before the guidelines with publishers were agreed, and I am at present examining the position to see how best sexist and sex-stereotyped material can be eliminated from use in primary schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the principles of flexibility and integration inherent in the structure of the new curriculum my <Col N="1557" /> Department does not lay down specific periods of time for various curriculum activities but advises that a certain minimum time be spent on each aspect of the curriculum each day.  Primary teachers are required to teach all aspects of the curriculum in schools, and the main components of the State's expenditure in education (teachers' pay costs, grants towards school running costs, school transport etc.) are costs which are borne by the State regardless of curricular content. For these reasons it is considered that it would not be appropriate or feasible to estimate the notional cost of teaching Irish or English in primary schools. In the case of post-primary schools, my Department's Estimates are not framed on the basis of subject areas nor is its expenditure accounted for on this basis. The information requested is, therefore, not readily available and its compilation would involve an inordinate amount of staff time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> Special provisions, dating back to the last century, apply to the granting of special liquor licences to three Dublin Theatres and two in Cork.  In addition, in view of the unique position which it occupies in the cultural life of the State. The National Concert Hall was enabled to obtain a special liquor licence under special legislation enacted in 1983.</P>
    <P>Any other theatres or arts centres in Dublin or elsewhere in the country can be granted liquor licences only on the same basis as any other premises, which involves, <i>inter alia,</i> the extinguishing of one or more existing liquor licences.</P>
    <P>Amending legislation would be required to enable The Belltable Arts Centre to be provided with a special liquor licence without meeting the criteria which normally apply to the grant of such licences.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of social welfare legislation, permanent and pensionable employment by a statutory transport undertaking is insurable at the Class D rate of PRSI contribution.  This was the rate paid in respect of the permanent and pensionable staff of Sealink up to their privatisation in July 1984.  Class D provides cover for contributory widow's pension and orphan's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Upon privatisation of the company, the staff became insurable at the Class A rate, which provides cover for the full range of social insurance benefits.  This is the rate at which contributions are now being paid in respect of these employees.</P>
      <P>The current Class A contribution rate is 20.08 per cent, i.e. 12.33 per cent by the employer and 7.75 per cent by the employee.  The Class D rate is 5.43 per cent, i.e. 2.28 per cent by the employer and 3.15 per cent by the employee.</P>
      <P>The change in contribution class means that employees who meet the statutory conditions can qualify for the full range of social insurance benefits and contributory pensions.  Entitlement in individual cases will, of course, depend on the person's earlier record of Class A contributions. The implications in all the individual cases have already been explained on request to Sealink.  If the Deputy has any further query on any case, the information can be made available.</P>
