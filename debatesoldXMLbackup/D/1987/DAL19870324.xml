    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he intends to continue the evolution of parliamentary reform; if he will set out his plans in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, responsibility for parliamentary reform is a matter for the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Government propose to avail of the usual channels to co-operate with all parties in the House in devising procedures for the improvement of our debates and the more effective and efficient dispatch of parliamentary business. We are prepared to enter into discussions at any time with the other parties on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government intend to suggest the reappointment of many of the committees which existed in the 24th Dáil and, in particular, do they intend to bring forward a motion at an early date for the reappointment of the Public Accounts Committee?  Has any <Col N="130" /> consideration been given to the appointment of a foreign affairs committee of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the intention to enter immediately into discussions with the parties to see how these committees should be reconstituted, in the light of our experience of the way they operated in the last Dáil.  The Public Accounts Committee are a statutory committee and must necessarily be reestablished. There is a question down to the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the appointment of a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government any intention of bringing forward proposals to improve procedures for raising urgent matters in the House, for example, a matter which I tried to raise before the general election, which was the possible danger to life and limb from gas leaks in Dublin city?  Would the Taoiseach consider proposals to review Standing Orders so that procedures would be introduced to allow urgent matters of that kind to be raised?  Secondly, has the Taoiseach any proposals to bring forward regarding the holding of Government State agencies and bodies more accountable to the House for their actions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would have a mutual interest in ensuring that matters of urgent public importance could be raised here in some appropriate and suitable fashion.  As the Deputy knows, it very often happens that not alone does a Deputy wish to raise a matter but that the Minister responsible is very anxious to have it raised so that he can make a statement on the matter.  On all sides we would have a common interest in ensuring that we devise some mechanism for doing this.  Of course, I am sure the Deputy will agree that the procedure would have to be hedged in with some protection; we cannot have a general free-for-all on every topic every day.  Subject to that, I would be quite disposed to discussing with the parties how matters of <Col N="131" /> urgent public concern could be ventilated here.</P>
      <P>On the question of the State and semi-State sector and its accountability here, that is a matter for another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, would the Taoiseach set some time scale for announcing the evolution of the parliamentary reform which the Government have in mind?  I recommend that it be done before the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Taoiseach to appoint a member of his Cabinet with special responsibility for parliamentary procedure &mdash; somebody like the Leader of the House, which was the case in the last Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would be our intention that this matter be dealt with, as previously, by the Chief Whip whose fundamental responsibility it is, after all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that indicate that the Taoiseach does not have the same commitment to parliamentary reform as was obvious from the previous Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have indicated in my reply that I am anxious to be constructive and co-operative on this whole question of enabling us to dispatch our parliamentary business more effectively and more efficiently.  It is my personal opinion, reinforced by a long number of years in the House, that responsibility for these matters should be vested in one single parliamentary person.  However, if it turns out that we cannot achieve the level of progress necessary through the mechanism of the Whips, then I am prepared to look again into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the plans, if any, he has for the reform of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="132" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that this year marked the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution. Would he agree that those who drafted this document in 1937 would hardly recognise the Ireland of 1987? Would he not think this is surely the time for a major review of the Constitution, to lead this country into the 21st Century?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply indicates that I have no particular proposals at present. However, I am inclined to agree that perhaps the time is ripe for some sort of look at the Constitution on an all-party basis.  If that is the general view of the House among the parties, then we could initiate something along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If such is being considered, would the Taoiseach be considering the recent interpretation of justices which seems to put the interests of private property ahead of the common good, which I am sure the Taoiseach will agree is not what de Valera intended in his Constitution?  Would he endeavour to redress the situation where no Government can end land speculation or ground rents or the controversial decision in regard to planning in Dún Laoghaire, or that with regard to the Derrynaflan Chalice?  Will the Taoiseach be taking those matters into consideration as well as social reforms in the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The wisest thing would be for these matters to be discussed, especially initially, among the parties to see if there is a broad basis of agreement that reform is necessary and how we might go about achieving that reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if the question of an all-party constitutional conference would still be an integral part of Government policy in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="133" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear on the import of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the suggestion made by the Taoiseach a couple of years back in regard to an all-party constitutional conference, would he think that would still be a relevant part of policy for resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify a point he made in reply to the question put to him?  Did I understand him to say &mdash; perhaps he might wish to reflect on this &mdash; that, in principle, he is open to approaches from the other parties represented in Leinster House to discuss changes in the Constitution that could be agreed on an all-party basis in line with the spirit of the questions just put to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider &mdash; if there is a general wish among the parties that some sort of mechanism be established to look at this whole question of constitutional reform &mdash; and I certainly am prepared to enter into discussions with the parties to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reply.  I put it to you, Sir, that in view of the experience of this House in the past three to four years &mdash; when we discussed constitutional reform on two specific items, and there are others as well &mdash; that such an exercise, as far as the parties on this side of the House would be concerned, would be considered constructive or fruitful only if it was the view of the Government Party that changes which might be agreed in committee on an all-party basis would be pursued to the extent of their being implemented by way of a referendum.  Without committing the Taoiseach to any specific change, do I understand that what he is now saying to the House is that, first and foremost, the Government are open to an all-party approach to constitutional change and that, if such change is found to have agreement among parties represented in <Col N="134" /> this House, the Government would then facilitate the necessary legislative and referenda changes that such a consensus would require?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going a little too far down the road and perhaps pre-empting the situation.  All I am saying is that if there is a general view among the parties that constitutional reform might be engaged in, then I would be prepared to discuss that informally among the parties to see whether some appropriate mechanism might be devised between us to pursue the matter.  For instance, I know that the outgoing Taoiseach had a proposal about electoral reform.  If there is a general view among the parties that there are grounds for a general review of the Constitution &mdash; let me put it this way, that is not something on which we would necessarily close the door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he proposes to meet the British Prime Minister and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for any meeting with the British Prime Minister would, in accordance with normal practice, be announced simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach anticipate that a meeting will take place at an early date, say within the next few weeks?  If so, are the arrangements for such a meeting being made by officials of his Department or officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the last part of the question first, the normal channels would be followed in regard to such a meeting.  But the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot say, and it is not the practice to say, in advance when meetings might take place.  Perhaps what the Deputy is really asking me could be answered in <Col N="135" /> this way; that meetings between the Head of the Irish Government and the British Prime Minister have become standard practice.  I would see no reason to depart from that practice whenever the occasion arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's wish to have such a meeting in the immediate future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard the holding of such meetings as desirable but, as to when any such meeting might or might not take place, I would not be at liberty to say at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the measures he proposes to take to consolidate and build on the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the coming year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he intends to renegotiate the terms of Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  It is the practice of Irish Governments to honour and operate international agreements concluded by their predecessors.  This Government will follow in that tradition and will fulfil and operate the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The House will notice that the Government have designated the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Permanent Irish Representative to the Intergovernmental Conference set up under the agreement.  We will seek, through this mechanism, to improve the position of all the people living in Northern Ireland and especially the members of the nationalist community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my party and I have indicated that we do not accept the constitutional implications of <Col N="136" /> Article 1 but as an integral part of a binding international agreement that Article could be amended only by mutual agreement and there is no likelihood that such agreement would be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that the Taoiseach is withdrawing his statement made at Bodenstown last October, that immediately on assuming power he would seek to renegotiate that aspect of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said in my reply is the position, that the Article could only be amended by mutual agreement and there is no likelihood that such agreement would be forthcoming.  That position has emerged since I spoke at Bodenstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of how the Taoiseach hopes to build on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, does he agree with the policy pursued by the previous administration, and turned down by Mrs. Thatcher, to have three judges sitting in the non-jury courts in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to enter into the merits or demerits of that proposal at present.  With regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, what is proposed and what has been the position of this party from the beginning is that if progress can be achieved through the Inter-governmental Conference, that progress will be followed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to leave the same officials serving the Anglo-Irish Agreement as have been there since its inception?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which I hope the Deputy will forgive me if I do not go into at this stage because there are security considerations involved.  Also, there is the question of the burden on particular individuals who carry particularly onerous responsibilities over a reasonably long period.  I would ask the Deputy not to pursue that for the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach if, since taking office, he has sought any further advice on his stated reservations in relation to the constitutionality of Article 1 and, if so, what has been the content of that advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying may I congratulate the Deputy on his elevation to the position of leadership of the Fine Gael Party.  May I wish him many long, happy and constructive years in that post. The position in regard to this matter is fairly well known, or rather the respective positions, are fairly well understood. It is our view &mdash; a view shared by quite a number of people, lawyers and others &mdash; that Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Accord cannot negative Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution in so far as they relate to the national territory.  I know that the Deputy's party and the outgoing administration were of the view that there was no conflict between Article 1 of the accord and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. These are the respective positions. They are both held with equal conviction, and there the matter must remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his good wishes.  I concur heartily with his wish that I may have many long, fruitful and constructive years as Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  Where exactly that might be situated is another matter, but to come back to the question: is it not the case that the Taoiseach, since taking office, is in a position to have access to perhaps rather more advice on constitutional questions than he might have had when he occupied this position and, that being so, has he not sought such advice, and if he has, what has been the import of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that the advice which was available to me when I occupied that position is still available to me.  Nothing further can be said about the respective interpretations of the constitutional position.  I am not aware of anything that the law officers <Col N="138" /> may have advised the previous Government in this connection.  I have had no access as yet to the particular advice the previous law officer gave to the Government about this matter.  In any event, it is something about which constitutional lawyers can have differing opinions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a body of legal opinion which agrees with me, that Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Accord does not accord with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, but I accept that there are other constitutional lawyers who do not see any conflict between Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  I accept that the previous administration have been advised to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said in my reply is that it is an integral part of a binding international agreement and as such can <Col N="139" /> only be amended by mutual agreement and the implications are quite clear that such mutual agreement would not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I paid a short visit on St. Patrick's Day to Washington where I had useful meetings with President Reagan, Speaker Wright, Senator Kennedy, Secretary of State Shultz, members of the Friends of Ireland group in Congress and other US political leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During these discussions, or in the US media and television, I encouraged US citizens to visit Ireland for their holidays <Col N="141" /> this year.  On investment, I emphasised that Ireland offers American industry the most profitable location in Europe and I extended to US business an invitation to participate in our programme of economic recovery, particularly in growth sectors such as financial services, computer software, information technology, biotechnology, chemicals and health care.</P>
    <P>I expressed special concern about the status of the many thousands of young Irish immigrants in the US as part of this Government's initiative to secure an improvement in their situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, I outlined my Government's policy and expressed my thanks to President Reagan and other US political leaders for their support and encouragement for the Anglo-Irish Agreement and for the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I regard my visit to the US as having been a success and I intend to complement this with the Friends of Ireland who intend to visit Ireland later this year and also by further and more extensive contacts both here and in America to cement the close relationship between this country and the United States.</P>

      <P>There was a very positive response to what I was saying. Among the politicians on Capitol Hill, where the authority for this rests, because it is a matter for Congress, all the political leaders to whom we spoke were anxious to hear what we had to say and were responsive to our concern about the position of immigrants and we were given every encouragement to follow up on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at the situation faced by Irish citizens, most of them young, who have travelled to the United States in recent years and remained there illegally.  Our concern to improve their position was set <Col N="146" /> out clearly in our election manifesto and was one of the main issues which the Taoiseach and myself discussed with Congressional leaders, Irish-American politicians, and the United States Administration during our recent visit.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that as a result of these discussions members of the United States Congress and the United States Administration have a greater appreciation of the scope of the problem; the difficulties faced by our illegal immigrants; and the need for measures to help regularise their position.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that certain immigration measures were adopted by the United States Congress last year which resulted in direct benefits to our citizens, notably the allocation of by far the largest portion of the new non-preference visas to Irish applicants.  This will give some assistance, but more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Taoiseach and myself discussed a number of proposals to facilitate the demand by Irish citizens who wish to enter the United States and to improve the conditions of those already there illegally.</P>
      <P>The Government intend as a matter of urgency to follow up these contacts and we are hopeful that the ideas we discussed will be developed and taken up by Congress to provide permanent benefit to those Irish who wish to live and work legally in the United States.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing Oireachtas committees and the terms of reference of such committees is primarily a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate his own attitude towards the establishment of such a foreign policy committee?  Should he agree with its establishment, would he be in favour of it having the terms of reference as outlined in the question?  Should he disagree, what are the grounds of his objections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, this again is pre-empting the situation.  The Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses of the Oireachtas are the committees who organise and order the committees to be established.  Discussions will take place through the Whips with these committees and that is the way to proceed.  I will certainly help to get that process of discussion going. The foreign affairs committee, if that is regarded as feasible, will be one of the matters on the agenda for such meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on what is happening.  The Minister, if he might elucidate for me, has said he will arrange for a meeting that in turn will possibly discuss a possible committee.  Can he, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, express his opinion as to whether he is in favour of such a committee being in existence or not in view of the widespread public interest in foreign affairs?  Would he not agree that our debates on foreign policy, on the Single European Act to take his own contribution, would have been <Col N="152" /> better informed had we had such a committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not a debating society here and I do not intend to take over any part of the very legitimate role of the Oireachtas in ordering our affairs. The committees I have referred to are a matter for the Oireachtas and I will certainly facilitate such meetings with the two appropriate Oireachtas Committees on Procedure and Privileges to see if we can get a committee on foreign affairs set up and working.  That will have to be looked at in the context of all the committees with a view to seeing how best the Oireachtas can handle and deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again that is not a matter that should be discussed at this stage.  The question addresses itself to the matter of setting up a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the lines of other committees that have been established. We can have discussions on that while recognising that this is primarily a matter almost entirely for the Oireachtas.

The matter is one for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The attitude of the Minister for Foreign <Col N="153" /> Affairs, or any other Minister, in regard to committees does not and should not impinge on the work of committees dealing with any sphere of parliamentary activity.

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="158" /> for Foreign Affairs the steps the Government propose to take to redress the image created abroad by sections of the British media of Ireland as a backward country; and if the views of the Irish Government on the sustained campaign of hostility being directed against Ireland by sections of the British media have been communicated to the British Ambassador in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the general election the British and international media reported extensively and seriously on Irish issues and, like our own media, concentrated on the debate about our economy.  Indeed, I would like to acknowledge the objective reporting of that debate by some representatives of the British media based permanently in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The distorted coverage of Irish issues and of the Irish economy, to which the Deputy refers, was largely confined to some articles in the British media.  For reasons best known to themselves the authors of these articles concentrated exclusively on our difficulties while ignoring our strengths and our successes. These articles did have an influence beyond Britain and I recognise that such unfavourable publicity could have a damaging effect if left unchecked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major responsibility of my Department is the proper presentation of the country's image abroad.  Every Embassy establishes close contacts with the local media and encourages them to look to our offices as reliable and authoritative sources of information on Ireland.  In addition we have press and information officers in most of the countries of major concern to us.  In the case of our Embassy in London we have two press officers. These are diplomatic officers of First Secretary rank who maintain close contact with key journalists in the British and foreign media based in London.  There is, of course, regular consultation both at home and abroad between my Department and those State-sponsored agencies which are involved in the promotion of our economic interests overseas.  I can assure the House that all of these <Col N="159" /> resources are being concentrated to promote a positive image of Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>During the Taoiseach's recent visit to the United States both he and I availed of major media opportunities to draw American attention to Ireland's economic potential and attractiveness as a location for investment.  The forthcoming budget will provide another important occasion when we will continue to build international confidence in our economy. It is, after all, our policies and actions at home which in the main will determine how others see us.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks about contacts with the British Ambassador on these issues. I am sure the British authorities will be fully aware of the impact which ill-informed or politically motivated articles can have on opinion in both our countries. However, in countries with a free press it is not the practice of Governments to complain to one another about media coverage.  This has also been the practice of successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to extend his last remark.  Would he agree that this coverage from certain sections of the British media was not random but was sustained?  In so far as this type of coverage has been sustained for a long period of time, is it not against the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which in its early clauses refers to friendship between the two islands and so forth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>I would go along with the Deputy in deploring the nature, content and format of a number of these very malicious articles that appeared in some sections of the British press and then found currency elsewhere.  One of the main reasons the Taoiseach and I went to the United States was to ensure that a general reassurance was given to the US Administration, Congress and public that Ireland has participated in a general election in a democratic manner, that there had been a democratic change of Government and that as far as this Government are concerned the emphasis is and will be <Col N="160" /> on investment, economic development, the promotion of tourism and raising specific issues such as the problems of our immigrants in the United States.  We had a very pragmatic visit in the United States designed to deal with the matters which could have been damaged by the sort of press referred to by Deputy Higgins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent third Ministerial Conference in Guatemala of the Central American and Contadora Group states and the Twelve, including Ireland, reiterated that the Contadora framework &mdash; the proposals of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela &mdash;&ldquo;continued to be at present the only means through <Col N="161" /> which a peaceful, negotiated solution to the Central American crisis could viably be reached&rdquo; and affirmed that peace could come about only as a result of a process which respected &ldquo;... the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the right of all nations to determine, freely and without outside interference of any kind, their own economic, political and social model...&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the Government believe that all states should refrain from interference of any kind in Nicaragua.  That country's problems and those of its neighbours in Central America can be resolved only in the context of a political agreement emanating from the region itself, such as has been proposed by the Contadora Group.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we agree with the decision of the last Government to vote for UN General Assembly Resolutions calling for compliance with the June 1986 judgement of the International Court of Justice and deploring continuation of the US trade embargo against Nicaragua. The resolutions reiterate the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and reaffirm Nicaragua's right to determine its own political, economic and social system &ldquo;free of outside interference, subversion, direct and indirect coercion or threats of any kind&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of diplomatic relations is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources. The Government have no plans at present to establish formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Should not the friendly and cordial relations established by this new Government and the American Administration on Saint Patrick's Day be used to impress on the United States our very grave concern about the now admitted involvement of the US at a very high level in attempting to destabilise the democratically elected Government of Nicaragua?  Would he not consider agreeing to the extension of the diplomatic relationship which exists between Nicaragua and the UK whereby <Col N="162" /> the Nicaraguan Ambassador to England might also act as an envoy to Ireland? This would avoid cost being used as an excuse in regard to diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach has already stated, details regarding Nicaragua and other matters did not arise during a very brief visit, but the United States Administration are very well aware of our attitude towards Central America and Nicaragua in that we have been consistent supporters of the various resolutions that seek to have a negotiated settlement on the basis of the states that exist there and to ensure that peace is restored throughout the whole region.  It is recognised by the Contadora countries and generally throughout Central and South America that this has been our stance.  It is the general stance in the European Community as well.  We feel that the greatest weight can be brought to bear on the United States in the interest of the Nicaraguan people through the Community and the United Nations.  These are the two important agencies whose view agrees with ours. We have put our own view to the United States bilaterally as well and there the matter rests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that the United Kingdom Government have lately extended the limits of their offshore territorial jurisdiction to 12 miles and that this extension purports to operate also in respect of the island of Rockhall; whether he proposes to protest at this attempt to attribute territorial status to an uninhabitable rock far distant from the mainland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The limit of the territorial sea now generally accepted by the international community is 12 miles measured from baselines.  Ireland was among the large majority of countries which supported the incorporation of this rule into the new UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
      <P>The Government are aware that the British Government are proposing that their territorial sea be extended from three to 12 miles and that a Bill entitled &ldquo;The Territorial Sea Bill&rdquo; has recently been introduced in the British Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to any claim that this proposed legislation would apply to Rockall, the position of the Irish Government remains that they have never recognised British sovereignty over the rock and, accordingly, they do not recognise any claims to maritime jurisdiction based <Col N="164" /> upon it.  This position was specifically recalled to the British Government in the most recent protest which was being made to them about the proposed legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not material but I would have expected it since the question was put down.  I also wish the Minister to consider two aspects of the British Bill which has passed through one of their Houses and is now with the other, first that it purports to attribute a very widely extended jurisdiction over the seabed around islands such as Rockall notwithstanding that those islands are uninhabited and unhabitable.  Secondly, it will have the effect in the North Channel, between Antrim and Scotland, of not leaving one yard of high sea; the entire North Channel passage will now be British territorial waters.  Will the Minister assure the House that both these aspects will be looked at in the light of the reported debates which have already taken place in the House of Lords from which both the points I made have become clear, and complain elaborately to the British &mdash; more fully perhaps than has been the case &mdash; if he sees any reason to think that the interests of this country are prejudiced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking into every aspect of this matter including territorial waters, fisheries waters and the economic zone.  The Deputy's question relates purely to territorial waters but the other aspects are also important and are the subject matter of pending arbitration and continuing negotiations at present.  I will keep the House informed in regard to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that I understood negotiations were in train to <Col N="165" /> have an arbitration between ourselves and the British about the delimitation of the seabed between the two countries &mdash; it is 12 years since I saw the file on this matter which was then nearly a foot thick &mdash; is the Minister not perturbed by a unilateral legislative act which purports to extend the jurisdiction over the seabed in the Rockall instance from about 28 square miles to over 450 square miles at one stroke?  Does he not regard this as a pre-emption of an arbitration on a disputed matter between the two countries in which the status of Rockall is central? Nobody wants the strip of water but it is the effect it creates in territorial waters which is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us keep this matter on a rational plane.  With respect to Deputy Kelly, there is a distinction between the 12 miles territorial limit around Rockall and the further wider economic zone which we have secured on the Continental Shelf which Britain has also secured.  The second matter is under arbitration and negotiation pending arbitration, and the first matter is the subject of legislation before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that they are separate matters but I am anxious that the Minister would understand or at least explore the possibility that our acquiescence in the arbitration of territorial status to this rock may weaken our case when it comes to drawing the dividing line along the seabed between the two countries.  The status of Rockall is central to this and may make a difference of many tens of thousands of square sea miles and the bed underneath.</P>

    <P>A documentary check on imports, including certificates of freedom from diseases and pests from the exporting country, is carried out by the customs authorities at the point of entry.  Physical inspections of produce are carried out by inspectors of my Department at the wholesale market and distribution points. <Col N="167" /> The inspectors have statutory power to impound and destroy produce or whatever other action is necessary to deal with an infestation of Colorado beetle or other parasite.</P>
    <P>Inspectors in my Department have already traced and destroyed nearly all the boxes of parsley in the consignment in which Colorado beetles were discovered. Checks have also been made with importers and traders in regard to any further expected import consignments so that detailed examination can be made. Contact is being made with the French authorities to ensure pre-export examination of produce coming to this country. Customs authorities have also been alerted and an appeal has been made to the public through the media to watch out for and report any suspected sighting of Colorado beetle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Just listen and hear.  Could the Minister tell us how many boxes of parsley were involved in the shipment and how much parsley approximately was in each box?  How many boxes have been traced?  Could the Minister also give rough particulars of the remainder of the cargo on the ship and tell us whether it is likely or possible that that cargo could also have been infested by these insects?  In what country or countries are these insects more commonly found?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 100 boxes of parsley involved in the container; 86 have already been traced and they and three beetles were destroyed.  It is because those three beetles were found that the action to which I referred was taken.  I should like to assure the House that vigorous attempts are being made to trace the other boxes associated with this consignment.  However, the beetles were found in one box only but that was <Col N="168" /> enough to alert us to take the action required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the inspection was not thorough at the point of import and it is necessary for the Minister to take stern action to ensure that all imports of food are held up for examination to guard against a situation arising which could have destroyed the potato crop of 140,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure, as I indicated to the Deputies in reply, is that you have a documentary check at point of import and then you have a detailed examination at point of distribution, as happened in this case.  Because of the alertness of the officials concerned at point of distribution these three beetles were discovered.  Where there is any reason at all for special action, then it is taken and if necessary it will be possible to ensure seals on all containers of this nature, but the Deputy and all Deputies will appreciate that if that were to be done in respect of all imported containers the whole basis of trade could be very much undermined.  For that reason, in view of what I have said and the action that has been taken, the notification to the French authorities to ensure detailed examination at export point as well, the House and the country can be assured that the matter is under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given us the approximate quantity of parsley in each box nor has he told us what the remainder of the cargo contained. I understand that it was a cargo mainly of vegetables.  If that is so quite a few of these insects could be involved. Will the Minister agree that these beetles fall into the category of foot and mouth disease and that in view of our history in regard to potatoes anything that would <Col N="169" /> destroy the entire potato crop should not be taken lightly and that what is regarded as a routine check is not sufficient?  Would the Minister not agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy, and through the Deputy the public, that there is no question of taking this lightly; quite the opposite.  I would not like to have anyone under any illusion.  No. 1, we are taking the most rigorous and effective action.  No. 2, only because of the procedures for examination this matter came to light, and I assure the House that that is the kind of procedure that will not only be maintained but strengthened.  Finally, I assure the House and the public that it does not give rise to any major apprehension. I do not want to understate the importance of it.  We have alerted everybody at every level, exporter, departmental, importer and otherwise as a consequence of finding these three beetles because of departmental inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage the full cargo has not been found.  Is it not true that the authorities involved should have known where all the cargo was going and that it should have been easy enough to find the total cargo within 24 hours?  On the information the Minister has given the House, to date this has not happened. Secondly, in so far as spot checks are concerned, the Minister has an opportunity now to ensure that the authorities involved can prohibit parsley and other items in the food industry from coming into this country by delaying them at point of import.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that and it should give our industry an important breathing space.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that any action required will be taken and if it means sealing containers at point of entry in respect of any food it will be done, but the Deputy and the House will appreciate that if that were to be the standard practice it would cut across all normal trade.  Secondly, in so far as we are aware of the source of export, we have been in contact with the export <Col N="170" /> authorities and the French authorities in this case.  Thirdly, I do not accept the implication of the Deputy's question, that we have not taken effective action. We have, and because of that what might have been serious I can now assure the House is a matter of the most minimal risk, if any risk at all is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that apart altogether from the need to protect our whole vegetable industry from such infestation, this Government in any event and my Department particularly are specially charged to ensure that we develop a horticultural industry here that will ensure we minimise the level of importation in every respect.  That is a major plank of the Government's responsibility.  Secondly, I assure Deputies that we are aware of the wholesaler to whom the consignment was addressed and through that we have checked and destroyed 86 of the boxes.  That is the most important thing.  The others, some of which have not yet been checked, will be finally made known to us.  They were all consigned to one wholesaler.  On that basis some of them may have been dealt with through restaurants and may have been destroyed by now.  The House can be quite sure that every effective action has been taken.</P>

      <P>No.  A Cheann Comhairle, I want to raise a couple of issues in relation to the Order of Business proposed.  It is right that you should know that there are two falsehoods in the Order of Business proposed to the House.  It says: &ldquo;By agreement, Nos. 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 6 shall be taken without debate&rdquo;. That should read: by agreement with all except the four Workers' Party Deputies Nos. 5, 8, 10, 11 and 6 shall be taken without debate, because the only agreement we made was with regard to Item No. 4 to which we agreed.  We have not heard about the others.  The Order of Business says: &ldquo;Also by agreement, No. 7 and the Second Stage of the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, shall be taken together for the purposes of debate&rdquo;.  That also was not by agreement of The Workers' Party.  I am not saying we disagree with all these items, a Cheann Comhairle.  What I am saying is that if any item is to be agreed on the Order of Business it is to be agreed by all parties in the House.  We are not taking any action on this today.  If we were to, we would call a vote on every single item &mdash; Nos. 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 6 agus 7 &mdash; and we would be here for an hour and a half.  On the next occasion on which this happens, that is the procedure we will adopt.  We will oppose everything down on the Order of Business as agreed if we have not been asked about it.  I am opposing the Order of Business on that basis.</P>

      <P>Before you put that question perhaps I might say to Deputy Mac Giolla that I was not aware in reading out these arrangements that there was any disagreement and to that extent I apologise to the Deputy and to the House.  Perhaps the Deputy would take into consideration the fact that this is the first routine working day of the new Dáil and because of the different composition of this Dáil from previous Dáils, perhaps he would bear with us today and we can iron out procedures in this regard from now on.</P>

      <P>First of all, I agree with Deputy De Rossa on the desirability of legislation for homeless persons and I will see what can be done to have it brought forward as quickly as possible.  I am sure Deputy Harney will find many other occasions within the order of the House to raise the matters she has adverted to. I am not quite sure of the exact point Deputy Spring has in mind but whatever additional information is required in connection with the budget will be circulated. The Deputy will understand the very difficult situation we are in.  So far we are working on an abridged version of the Book of Estimates.  For convenience it will be necessary to stay with that publication as far as the Estimates are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear what question the Deputy is asking.  Perhaps I shall tell the Deputy the situation as I see it.  The view and advice we are given is that it is much better and more convenient all round to stay with the published abridged Book of Estimates.  In the budget any alterations, additions or subtractions, as the case may be, from that will be fully detailed.  Later, then, a full Book of Estimates incorporating the final Estimates for the Departments will be published &mdash; a full and complete Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is the established practice of this House, including last year's budget, that subsequent to the publication of the abridged Book of Estimates, where policy changes are declined by the Government they are published <Col N="258" /> on budget day?  In the case of last year there was a variation of £51 million and the details were published contemporaneously with the budget.  Can the Taoiseach give an absolute assurance here that changes in the subheads, which I understand are being done at the moment, will be published next Tuesday simultaneously with the budget?  In due course, we will have the total Book of Estimates.  Otherwise, I am afraid the Taoiseach will be making some difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised figures for all the subheads will certainly be given to the House on budget day.  Subsequent to that, the complete and final Book of Estimates will be published.  When the Deputy is talking about normal practice and procedure, he must acknowledge that in this year normal practices and procedures cannot possibly be adhered to because of the rather dramatic circumstances in which his Government left office.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree, particularly in the light of abnormal practices in the past, that it will not be possible for this House to assess the Budget Statement unless the data which I have requested is contained in an appendix to it?</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned at the statement by the Taoiseach because it looks as though we are starting the same old merry-go-around of revised receipts and expenditure and here we go again.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad uair sa Dáil nua comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leatsa as tú bheith ceaptha mar Cheann Comhairle na Dála seo.  Tá sár taithí agat de bharr do sheirbhís fhada mar Theachta agus an tréimhse a chaith tú cheana féin <Col N="267" /> mar Cheann Comhairle.  Tá gach ion-taoibh agam go rachaidh do chríonnacht agus tuiscint chun tairbhe don Tí seo.  Tá mé cinnte freisin gur féidir leat brath ar chomhoibriú uainn uilig.</P>
    <P>Seo an chéad uair dom labhairt sa Dáil mar Aire Comhshaoil.  Bhí an-mheas agam i gcónaí ar an bpost tábhachtach seo agus tá sé i gceist agam mo dhícheall a dhéanamh chun gníomhú ann go diograiseach. Beidh a lán le déanamh de bharr réimse na n-ábhar a thagann faoin Roinn Comhshaoil &mdash; rialtais áitiúil, tithíocht, bóithre, uisce agus séarachas agus ar ndóigh caomhnú ar dtimpleacht.  Sílim go bhfuil sé an-oiriúnach ag tús Bliain Eorpach an Chomhshaoil gurb é an Bille um Thruailliú Aeir an chéad Bill os ár gcomhair sa Teach.  I rith na bliana seo tá sé mar aidhm an dearcadh a chothú go bhfuilimid go léir freagrach as ar dtimpleacht. Dearcadh tábhachtach é sin maidir le truailliú an aeir agus tá súil agam go gcabhróidh an díospóireacht ar an mBille seo leis an teachtaireacht a scaipeadh.</P>
    <P>This Bill has already been the subject of extensive debate, having been published over a year ago, and it has had a lengthy passage through the Seanad.  In broad terms, there has been consensus on the need for the Bill and on its general thrust and principles.  Naturally different Seanad speakers, as well as interested outside bodies and individuals, have expressed reservations on points of detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a comprehensive one which is designed to enable local authorities to ensure good air quality in their areas.  I myself have not yet had time to finalise my position on all its details.  I can undertake, therefore, to consider all amendments with a more open mind than usual on Committee Stage.  I would also like to say that between now and Committee Stage I hope to familiarise myself with the views of all interested parties who have made submissions on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Programme for National Recovery stressed the need for tighter legislative control of air and indeed marine <Col N="268" /> pollution.  Some people might see a conflict between this concern and the priority which the Government are now determined to give to economic growth.  In fact there is no contradiction.  Ireland without its traditional clean natural surroundings would be impoverished economically as well as environmentally.  For example, tourism and agriculture, two of our major industries which the Government are committed to maximising, would suffer immediately from any perceived deterioration of our natural environment. It is important, therefore, to keep fully before us this link between the protection of the environment and the improvement of economic and social conditions.</P>
    <P>The post-war period has brought an increasingly refined understanding of air pollutants and their effects, and of the relationship between energy and industrial production processes and air pollution. The United Kingdom Clean Air Acts, starting from 1956, were a forerunner of much legislation elsewhere and supported measures which proved highly effective in abating problems of smog and smoke.  The United States Clean Air Act of 1970, together with major amendments of 1977, gave a similar lead to the next generation of legislation, formulated in greater awareness of the polluting effects of sulphur and nitrogen oxides.</P>
    <P>Awareness of air pollution problems in Ireland is relatively recent.  Because of the nature of our economic growth, we have little heavy industry of the kind that, in the past, caused serious air pollution in other countries.  Our relatively low population density and our pattern of urbanisation have also served to delay the emergence of air pollution problems. Our geographical position and prevailing westerly winds have spared us the worst effects of transboundary air pollution. Indeed, it is only when air masses which have originated to the east of the country &mdash; over continental Europe and the United Kingdom &mdash; pass over Ireland, that air pollution arising from external factors is of any real significance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> Real problems of air pollution nonetheless have emerged in Ireland and we all have some familarity with these. Smoke levels in Dublin, particularly this winter, have elicited wide media and public concern.  Vehicle emissions cause obvious damage to air quality in urban areas.  Concerns are also expressed from time to time about the effects of lead in air and about the incipient evidence of acidification along the eastern seaboard of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The common air pollutants are smoke, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and lead.  The principal cause of all of these is the combustion of fuel in one form or another.  The main sources can be classified as power generation, industrial and commercial development, the domestic sector and the transport sector.  The proportion of total emissions contributed by each of these sectors varies with the pollutant in question.  In 1985, 77 per cent of Irish emissions of sulphur dioxide of 138,000 tonnes arose from the commercial-industrial and power generation sectors, with emissions from the domestic sector amounting only to 20 per cent.  For smoke, the reverse was the case, with domestic sources contributing 79 per cent of the 117,000 tonnes emitted in the State as a whole in 1985.  In the case of nitrogen oxides, 65 per cent comes from the commercial-industrial and power generation sectors, with 28 per cent from road transport. Transport accounts for 78 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions and 50 per cent of hydrocarbon emissions.</P>
    <P>It will be evident, therefore, that the preservation and improvement of air quality requires action on a number of fronts and that air pollution cannot conveniently be ascribed to a few large industries. In carrying on our normal daily activities relating to work or the home, we all contribute in one way or another to the volume of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere.  It follows, too, that all sections of the community must play some part in resolving the problems involved particularly as I noted earlier in this European Year of the Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> While many of the effects of air pollution can be local, in terms of damage to human health, buildings and the natural environment, transport and deposition of certain pollutants can also take place at much longer range.  This gives rise <i>inter alia</i> to the phenomenon of acidification, with its transboundary effects, proven or suspected, on lakes, forests and soils and is the basis for increasingly determined efforts to promote international agreement on measures for air pollution control at EEC level and at the United Nations sponsored Economic Commission for Europe &mdash; ECE.  At EEC level, eight directives have been adopted in relation to the prevention of air pollution within the framework of Community Action Programmes on the Environment.</P>
    <P>Apart from meeting our own national requirements, the Bill is intended to enable the State to meet in full the requirements of existing and likely future European Community requirements in the air pollution field.  To date, directives which set air quality standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide, and for lead, have been implemented by administrative means.  The European Commission is concerned about the lack of legal expression for these directives and, in the case of the directive on smoke and SO 2, has initiated action against Ireland in the European Court.  This Bill will enable us to implement these measures more fully and more effectively and, as well, to implement the more recent directive on air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide and a 1984 directive which requires us to introduce by 1 July 1987 a licensing system for certain categories of industrial plant which may cause air pollution.  The Bill also contains provisions which can be used to give full effect to directives on matters such as the sulphur content of fuels and the lead content of petrol.  I might mention here that regulations which reduce the maximum lead content of petrol from 0.40 to 0.15 grams per litre came into operation on 1 April 1986 last, almost a year ago, giving a reduction of some 60 per cent in lead emissions from motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> Ireland has, of course, obligations in relation to air pollution which extend beyond the responsibilities imposed by membership of the European Communities. The State is a party to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, commonly referred to as the Geneva Convention, which binds contracting States to limit and, as far as possible, gradually to reduce emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere. Increasing concern over the severe problems resulting from atmospheric pollution in Continental Europe and in North America led to the signing in 1985 of a protocol to the convention in Helsinki when 21 countries undertook to reduce their emissions of sulphur dioxide by 30 per cent as soon as possible, and at the latest by 1993, using 1980 levels as the base.</P>
    <P>Ireland was unable to accede to the protocol for a number of reasons, including the fact that our total emissions of SO 2 are small, the lack of evidence to suggest that these contribute to significant transboundary air pollution and the fact that the cost of such a reduction would be greatly disproportionate to any possible benefit to our own, or the wider European, environment.  We have, however, agreed to undertake all feasible measures to control air pollution and the present Bill is evidence of our commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>The question of future SO 2 and NO x emissions is also very much at the centre of a proposal now being developed within the EEC to limit pollution from large combustion plants.  In Ireland, the plant involved is virtually all ESB generating plant.  As originally proposed by the Commission, the draft directive had two elements: all new power plant after the date of the directive would have to use clean or &ldquo;acid-free&rdquo; technology as defined by the EEC; and overall emissions from power plant in each member state would have to be reduced with reference to 1980 by 60 per cent for SO 2 and by 40 per cent for NO x and dust.</P>
    <P>These proposals had no regard to the different environmental and economic <Col N="272" /> circumstances within member states and were opposed by a number of countries, including Ireland.  Although the principle of clean technology for new plant still stands, the large combustion plant proposal has otherwise been thoroughly revised so as to distribute emission reductions more equitably between member states according to their economic circumstances, their contribution to transboundary pollution and other factors.  Detailed negotiations are still continuing and I am hopeful that Ireland will be able to play its part in an eventual solution.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects the increasing specialisation now of environment legislation both in Ireland and worldwide.  The Planning Act, 1963, less than 25 years ago, was intended as a comprehensive framework for environment protection for many years ahead.  Partly because of increasing specialisation of pollution control research and techniques and partly because of detailed EEC directives, we have had to devise new legal systems to deal with water pollution control and, now, air.  We can look forward also to having to introduce special waste control legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>It may be useful to mention at this stage a number of things with which the Bill does not deal.  The financing and staffing of local authority operations are covered by general local government legislation and no special provision has been necessary in the present Bill.  The Bill's control powers, as such, deal with air pollution from stationary sources only.  Its main influence on mobile sources of pollution will lie not in direct regulation, which remains more appropriate to the Road Traffic Acts, but in environmental control of fuel inputs, section 53.  It is now acknowledged that the most effective way of reducing vehicle emissions is through the design of engines and exhaust systems.  There has been considerable agreement at EEC level which should result in significant reductions in vehicle emissions in the years ahead.  Finally, the Bill is expressly precluded by section 3 from dealing with radioactive emissions or with emissions connected with the <Col N="273" /> incineration of waste at sea.  This is because other legislation, namely, the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, and the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, already governs these matters and in any event they would not generally be within the fields of competence of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some key terms in the Bill.  Section 4 defines the term &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo;. Its meaning is not easily captured, because the concept of air pollution must be linked with a concentration of a substance in the atmosphere at a level harmful to public health, animal or plant life or the environment generally, rather than the mere existence of a substance in the atmosphere.  In some cases, too, it may be the interaction of substances in the atmosphere which may cause difficulties.  The definition in the Bill refers, therefore, to a condition of the atmosphere in which a pollutant is present in such quantity as to be liable to give rise to damage to public health, animal or plant life, property, amenities or the environment.  The definition of air pollution does include smells which, of course, can be a relatively common nuisance. There is an associated definition of term &ldquo;pollutant&rdquo; in section 7 (1) and, of course, the main pollutants with which the Bill is concerned are listed in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines the term &ldquo;best practicable means&rdquo; which is used throughout the Bill.  The best practicable means concept is well established in environmental legislation.  It is used in EEC legislation in both the air and water pollution areas, although different forms of words are sometimes employed, such as the best available technology which does not entail excessive costs, or the best technical means available taking account of economic availability.  In the Bill, the phrase is defined in such a way as to require, in the circumstances of each case, an appropriate balance between available technology, environmental demands and cost considerations.  This pragmatic approach properly considers both the needs of development and the <Col N="274" /> needs of the environment in seeking to improve the quality of Irish life.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a number of obligations and I will mention these in turn. The most general obligation is under section 24.  This requires every occupier of a premises, other than a private dwelling, to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. This obligation is similar in its incidence, namely on all non-domestic property, and in its very generally defined nature, to the general duty imposed by section 18 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, with regard to fire safety.  Both obligations are also for the occupier of the premises in the first instance to interpret and observe, with the local authority being entitled to follow up to determine if compliance is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A second kind of obligation will arise under the Bill from the licensing system provided by Part III.  This will apply initially to new industrial plant involving any of the processes listed in the Third Schedule.  Licensing under Part III will also apply to alterations of industrial plant which may materially increase or change emissions and it may be gradually extended to cover existing plant by ministerial regulation.  In addition, the Minister will have power, by regulations made with the prior approval of each House, to add to the categories of plant specified in the Third Schedule, thus extending the scope of the licensing system, if this should prove to be necessary in order to control air pollution.</P>
    <P>The third major source of obligation under the Bill is Part IV, which allows an intensive regime of air pollution control to be established by a special control area order.  Obligations under Part IV of the Bill, unlike those cited above, could be brought to bear on householders, and this may reasonably be anticipated as the primary purpose of Part IV.  But a special control regime can direct itself to any or all premises within the defined area, so that industry could also be affected. Grants may be made available by the Minister for the Environment to assist with the costs of adapting premises to <Col N="275" /> comply with a special control area order. I will return to this aspect of the Bill later on.</P>
    <P>The Bill permits of a number of different approaches to air quality control by the Minister and local authorities; some combination of these will emerge in practice. The Minister will have power under section 50 to prescribe air quality standards, with or without local variation, and local authorities would be bound to secure compliance with these.  The air quality standard approach, which has already been enjoined on us by the EEC, prescribes only the required end result and leaves open the means of compliance.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be empowered under section 51 to prescribe emission limit values.  These would relate to particular pollutants or combinations of pollutants and could vary by area, class of premises or other circumstance.  In contrast to air quality standards, emission limit values would represent a quantified control applying directly to the premises concerned.  They would have to be applied by local authorities, as a minimum, in enforcing the general obligation to limit or prevent air pollution under section 24 and in licensing industrial plant under Part III.  Emission limit values have only recently been prescribed by the EEC for the first time in relation to the burning of waste oils and the prevention of pollution by asbestos.  Additionally such values are envisaged in the draft directive on pollution from large combustion plant.</P>
    <P>Section 22 envisages the control of emissions by means of charges to be made by local authorities, subject to ministerial regulation.  These charges would be a quasi-tax, designed to secure the same environmental result by economic means as air quality standards and emission limit values seek by direct regulation.  There is limited precedent among EEC countries for this economic approach in relation to air pollution, although charges have been used in regard to discharges to water and therefore it would appear prudent to take the necessary powers in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I have already outlined briefly the main provisions of the Bill and I now propose to cover other aspects in a summary way. The House will, of course, have an opportunity to consider any or all of these in detail on Committee Stage.  Part I deals with matters of definitions, administration and organisation upon which the remainder of the Bill relies, as well as with matters common to virtually all legislation, such as commencement and repeals.  The Bill will repeal most existing legislation on air pollution, with special transitional arrangements under section 57 for the Alkali Act and the Control of Atmospheric Pollution (Licensing) Regulations, 1985, listed in section 58.</P>
    <P>The local authorities to whom responsibilities are being entrusted under the Bill are the 27 county councils, the five county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation listed in section 7.  Under section 21, provision is made whereby any function conferred on a local authority in relation to air pollution may, by regulations, be transferred to another person or body, including a corporate body specially established for the purpose.  This provision is included in recognition of the fact that some of the monitoring and other work which will arise under the Bill could require a high degree of expertise and access to specialised facilities which it might not be economic for the individual local authority to provide.  In such situations, it might be convenient for the functions in question to be carried out on behalf of local authorities by a body operating at national level such as, for example, An Foras Forbartha.  Local authorities are, of course, authorised under general local government legislation to undertake functions on behalf of each other on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>It may be opportune here to explain briefly why local authorities should carry the main responsibility for administering the Bill.  Environmental services and controls are the preserve of local authorities in most countries.  There are two main reasons for this.  First, because of their physical rather the personal nature, there is considerable local variation in the need <Col N="277" /> for and level of such services.  Secondly, environmental services in the broad sense are widely seen as suited to some degree of local democratic decision.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, these considerations have brought local authorities into the administration of physical planning, water pollution control and waste management in addition to their longer-standing involvement in sanitary services, housing and roads.  There is no reason why air pollution control should stand as an exception to these general principles and the Bill provides for a local authority involvement fully in line with that under other relevant codes.  The need for national standards and guidelines and for central policy direction and co-ordination in air pollution matters has not, however, been overlooked and the Bill provides the Minister for the Environment with powers to ensure adequate action by any reluctant local authority.</P>
    <P>Offences, penalties and prosecution are dealt with in sections 11 to 13.  A maximum fine of £1,000 will apply on summary conviction for an offence, and a fine of up to £10,000 where the conviction is on indictment.  The corresponding maximum custodial penalties will be six months and two years respectively. Local authorities are empowered to prosecute offences summarily and may do this even in relation to an emission from outside their area where this would cause air pollution affecting their area. Power of summary prosecution may also be extended by regulations to other persons, including the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 16 gives local authorities wide powers of acquiring information for the purpose of their functions under the Bill. A written notice from them can require relevant information &mdash; on burning appliances, fuels being used, etc. &mdash; from the occupier of any property.  Periodic returns of information can be required of occupiers of non domestic property, but not at intervals of less than three months. Finally, persons engaged in the fuel industry, in the widest sense, may be required to give particulars to the local authority of the type and quantity of fuel <Col N="278" /> supplied by them.  To preserve confidentiality local authorities are forbidden to disclose information obtained by them under section 16 to anyone other than a person prescribed in regulations by the Minister.  Private individuals would not, of course, be prescribed in regulations of this kind but bodies such as, for example, An Foras Forbartha which maintain the National Air Pollution Data Base.</P>
    <P>A further requirement as to information arises under section 29.  This obliges the occupier of a premises, other than a private dwelling, to notify the relevant local authority as soon as practicable after any incident which may cause air pollution.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the fundamental obligation imposed by Part II in relation to all non-domestic property to use the best practicable means to limit and if possible to prevent emissions.  Part II also spells out enforcement powers whereby local authorities can achieve compliance with this obligation.</P>
    <P>These involve first the service of a notice on the occupier of a premises requiring suitable measures to be taken &mdash; section 26; secondly, a power for the local authority, in urgent circumstances, to undertake these measures themselves; and finally, a right of application to the High Court, which will be shared by any other person, to prohibit or restrict an emission from a premises.  Part II also contains a provision &mdash; section 23 &mdash; enabling the Minister to forbid outright certain emissions on the production, import, sale, etc., of substances which may cause air pollution.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, Part III of the Bill will translate the 1983 directive on industrial plant into Irish law by providing a framework for the granting of licences broadly similar to that provided in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  The Bill provides for the making of regulations to govern the detailed procedure involved in the granting of licences. There is specific provision in section 34 for appeals to An Bord Pleanála against <Col N="279" /> the granting or refusing of a licence or against any conditions attached to a licence.  In practice, the board and the planning authorities are obliged under planning law to have regard to the potential air pollution from a development and they attach conditions for the control of air pollution, where appropriate.  It is desirable, and should be of assistance to applicants, that the one appeals tribunal should deal with appeals under the Planning, Water Pollution and Air Pollution Acts.  The new licensing arrangements where they apply will, of course, take the place of planning conditions relating to air pollution.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 33 for the review of licences at intervals of not less than three years, or at any time when the local authority have grounds for believing that an emission may constitute a serious risk of air pollution, or where there has been a material change in air quality which could not have been foreseen when the licence was granted.  The categories of plant to which the licensing requirements apply are listed in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  These include the plants which are most likely to cause air pollution.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill will enable a local authority, by order, to declare all or part of their area to be a special control area where the level of a pollutant, or combination of pollutants, requires special abatement measures.  In making the order, the local authority will spell out the measures to be taken and the requirements that will have effect in the area in order to prevent or limit the pollution in question.  It will be possible to consider using the provisions of Part IV in a situation, such as exists in parts of Dublin, where the air quality standards for smoke are exceeded on occasion.  But Part IV is designed to have wider application.  It could, for example, be used if, in the future, nitrogen oxides were shown to be a problem in part of a built-up area or if other pollutants, arising perhaps from industrial development, were to become an issue in a particular district.  In spite of this it is, I suppose, inevitable that Part IV will be seen primarily as a response to <Col N="280" /> the Dublin smoke situation and so before dealing with the sections concerned, it would be appropriate to comment on that situation.</P>
    <P>Smoke and sulphur dioxide levels have been measured on a regular basis in Dublin since 1962 and a more comprehensive monitoring network was established by the corporation in 1973. Sampling stations are located throughout the city in industrial, commercial and residential districts and there are further stations in the county area.  Results from these stations show that between 1973 and 1981 there was an overall decline in SO 2 levels and, to a lesser extent, in smoke levels.  However, since 1981 pollution levels &mdash; and particularly the level of smoke &mdash; have increased substantially. This reversal in the earlier downward trend coincided with the large-scale increase in use of coal and other solid fuels for space-heating purposes and problems have been emerging in so far as compliance with the smoke provisions of the relevant EEC directive is concerned.</P>
    <P>There were exceedances of the daily limit values at a number of stations in the city in 1985-86 and exceedances also on some groups of three days &mdash; and this despite the notably windy winter of last year.  However, the longer term values for the winter &mdash; with the exception of one station &mdash; and for the year as a whole were not exceeded.  The exceedances involved smoke only and the requirements of the directive were observed in relation to sulphur dioxide.</P>
    <P>The monitoring year runs from April to March and therefore the final figures for 1986-87 are not yet available.  However, a preliminary analysis of the results to date reveals serious breaches of the directive. At the very least, we will have had exceedances of daily limit values at six different stations and exceedances of the three day limit at four different stations. It appears that the figures for this winter will be worse than those for the severe winter of 1981-82.</P>
    <P>While we are on the subject of monitoring. I am aware of complaints which <Col N="281" /> have been raised about lack of quick access to air pollution data &mdash; particularly those relating to smoke levels in Dublin. It must be said at once that the reference method of smoke measurement, which is used by Ireland and several other EEC countries, does not lend itself to instant production of results.  This is also true of most of the parameters for the EEC air quality limit values themselves.  This inbuilt slowness of the reference method does not, however, prevent it from disclosing fully the reality of the Dublin smoke situation after the appropriate interval.  This in turn will suggest the extent of remedial action which may be required.  I accept, however, the concern of environmentalists and others about access to relevant air monitoring data.  I intend to contact the Dublin local authorities about the air monitoring situation generally and this is one of the aspects which I will raise.</P>
    <P>To turn from the monitoring practice in Dublin to the reality of smoke pollution which the results are now disclosing, I consider that action is now required to deal with the smoke problem in Dublin. It is important, however, that the extent of this problem is assessed objectively and that appropriate remedial measures are devised and carried through on a rational basis and in a cost-effective manner.  It is possible to identify a range of options which, either alone or in combination, could improve the situation. These include promoting the use of natural gas and other cleaner fuels, prohibiting the use of certain fuels, requiring that appliances which burn solid fuels smokelessly, or with reduced smoke emissions, should be used, and so on. Whatever measures are considered necessary by the local authority will have to be incorporated in a special control area order and submitted for confirmation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have suggested that special control area orders should be able to come into effect immediately where there are breaches of air quality standards without the need for an oral hearing.  It must be stressed that this <Col N="282" /> would not be in keeping with the safeguards traditional in Irish local government and environmental legislation.  It would be particularly insensitive to set aside such provisions in this case, given the likelihood that several low income areas in Dublin might be the first to be affected by the special control areas.  I believe it is essential that local authorities should defend their proposals to the public, show the need for any specific measures and satisfy the Minister and all those affected that the measures proposed are cost effective having regard to all the local circumstances.  The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Some comment is appropriate here on the relationship between housing standards, which are also, of course, the preserve of the Department of the Environment, and the possible requirements of clean air zoning.  In particular, people have referred to an apparent conflict between the chimney requirements of the various housing grants schemes and the smoke situation in Dublin.  While it must be remembered that domestic chimneys as required by the grant schemes are necessary for many heating systems which use smokeless fuels or which eliminate or reduce smoke, I intend nonetheless to review the conditions of the different schemes as they apply in relation to areas where smoke pollution is or may be a problem.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this question of special control area orders, there is one other matter I would like to deal with.  Section 14 deals with the powers of authorised persons to enter premises including private dwellings for purposes connected with the Bill.  Considerable concern was expressed by Senators and other interested people that authorised persons could enter private dwellings by giving 48 hours notice or without notice in case of urgency and that this provision could be abused.  We are all properly concerned to preserve domestic privacy.  On the other hand, the force of the requirements of a special control area order would be greatly weakened without substantative powers of inspection.  It will be essential to the success of any special control area <Col N="283" /> order that all householders are seen to comply with it.  Any system which through ineffectiveness encouraged periodic non-compliance with an order would be unfair to conscientious householders and would soon degenerate into widespread non-compliance.  That said, this is clearly an area which we should consider further between now and Committee Stage to see if there is any way of reconciling the needs of effective special control areas with the right to privacy in one's own dwelling.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill enables local authorities to make air quality management plans for the preservation or improvement of air quality in their areas.  The making of such plans will involve a local authority in assessing air quality in their areas and likely future trends and in identifying potential difficulties and planning for their avoidance.  Significant powers are also conferred on the Minister for the Environment under Part V, including the setting of air quality standards and of emission limit values which I discussed earlier.  National conditions may warrant the setting of emission limit values, either for the country at large or for specific areas or industries and, of course, limits set in this way at national level could bring about a necessary degree of consistency and uniformity in the administration of the Act throughout the country.  Part VI of the Bill provides for miscellaneous matters, including the powers of local authorities and the Minister to monitor air quality and emissions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should make it clear that the present Bill, being a comprehensive enabling one will naturally come into effect in a phased way.  Among other things, this should help to minimise staffing problems.  As I see it the obvious priorities will be to implement existing EEC Directives and to address the more serious instances of air pollution in the Dublin area.  The impact of the Bill on local authorities will obviously vary very widely because of the uneven distribution of population and industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Associated with the debate on the Bill <Col N="284" /> today is a motion on the long term financing of the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe &mdash; otherwise known as EMEP, the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme.  As the Protocol imposes a charge upon public funds, its terms must be approved by Dáil Éireann, in accordance with Article 29.5 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, before being ratified.  The Protocol was signed by Ireland on 4 April 1985.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I mentioned the Geneva Convention which binds contracting states to limit and, as far as possible, gradually to reduce emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere. The EEC and its member states are all parties to the Convention.  EMEP was set up under the Convention to provide Governments with information on the deposition and concentration of air pollutants, in particular the quantity and significance of the long-range transmission of air pollutants and fluxes across boundaries.  The Norwegian Institute for Air Research are responsible for technical co-ordination and there are two meteorological synthesising centres, a western centre at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and an eastern centre at the Institute of Applied Geophysics in Moscow.  Member states input relevant data into the system.</P>
    <P>Ireland has participated in EMEP since 1980 by providing data on acidity, sulphate and sodium in precipitation, sulphate in aerosols, and sulphur dioxide in gaseous form.  The Meteorological Service at Valentia have carried out the work on behalf of my Department.  Indeed, the Meteorological Service have made a significant contribution to the programme over the years and I would like to take this opportunity of putting on record my appreciation and thanks.  A further addition to the EMEP network is being considered by An Foras Forbartha, in co-operation with the ESB, in the form of a monitoring station on the east coast which would link up with the station established by the ESB at the Slieve <Col N="285" /> Bloom mountains to monitor the effects of the Moneypoint power station.</P>
    <P>The Protocol we are now discussing seeks to put EMEP activities on a sound financial basis for the future.  The system relies on mandatory contributions, supplemented by voluntary contributions.  The mandatory contributions to be made by member states and organisation are set as a fixed percentage of the overall cost of the programme.  Under the new arrangements, Ireland's contribution to the programme is 0.5 per cen per annum which, for example, on the basis of the 1986 budget would be approximately £3,000.  The Irish contribution rate is second lowest of the EEC countries and ninth lowest of the 32 states which, under the new arrangements, will contribute to the cost of financing EMEP.</P>
    <P>The Protocol has been signed by 22 countries to date.  It is intended that the EEC and its 12 member states will ratify the Protocol at the same time, hopefully within the next month or two.  The Protocol will enter into force when at least 19 signatories have ratified and the aggregate of their assessment rates exceeds 40 per cent of the budget.  Pending the entry into force of the Protocol, member states have been making an annual contribution on a voluntary basis.  Ireland paid £4,000 in 1985 and £3,000 in 1986 from the Environment Vote.  Provision for the 1987 payment has been made in the Environment Vote for this year.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that, while the Irish contribution to the financing of the programme is small in real terms, our overall contribution to and benefit from the programme is potentially quite significant. In the first place, because of the extreme westerly location in European terms of the Valentia measuring point, with the prevailing winds from the west or southwest, the data gathered at Valentia will reflect a European &ldquo;zero-effect&rdquo; baseline. Secondly, the data available from the programme will provide us with valuable information on the extent of acid deposition in the country.  The results to date show that Ireland is neither a significant contributor to, nor receiver of, <Col N="286" /> transboundary air pollution.  This scientific and independent corroboration has been helpful to us in convincing our Community partners that the uniform controls proposed in the draft Directive on limitation of emissions from large combustion plants were not appropriate in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have taken quite some time to go through the Bill in detail because I regard it as a very important matter and I see some significance in the fact that it is the first measure to be introduced by me as Minister for the Environment.  It deals with an environmental issue; it is something in which I have an interest and the matters raised will be of considerable benefit, particularly to our capital city.  I will be looking for the support of the House to ensure a speedy passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Tá óráid fhada déanta agam inniu ar an dá ábhar seo atá os ár gcomhair.  Ach is Bille fada tábhachtach an Bille um Thruailliú Aeir.  Cuimhnimís, chomh maith, go bhfuil an dlí bunúsach atá ann inniu maidir le truailliú an aeir i bhfeidhm ó 1906 i leith agus go bhfuil gach seans ann go mbeidh an Bille seo in úsáid i lár an chéid atá romhainn.  Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach tá sé ar intinn agam na tuairimí go léir a fhoilsigh grúpanna éagsúla, agus ar ndóigh tuairimí a nochtófar sa Teach seo, a scrúdú idir seo agus Céim an Choiste.  Molaim an Bille agus an Tairiscint don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister's remarks and I am particularly delighted that this most important legislation is the first business of the 25th Dáil.  The Bill had a very constructive and excellent passage through the Seanad some months ago, there were very solid contributions from all sides of the House and I look forward to a similar debate here and the co-operation which was evident in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good environmental conditions should now be more highly valued than ever before and, as legislators, we must see to it that environmental policy and programmes are developed and extended to meet current needs.  Recent events have <Col N="287" /> led to situations in which environmental matters of one kind or another are attracting a lot of media attention and are the subject of growing public interest and concern.  The accident at the Chernobyl power station and the series of incidents earlier this year at Sellafield bring home to all of us the need to give environmental protection a high priority even when financial, economic and social policy issues appear to demand so much attention.  We must develop not only the capacity to respond to serious incidents but also preventative policies and programmes designed to eliminate threats to our environment.</P>
    <P>We need also to do more to integrate the environmental dimension with economic and infrastructural policies and to educate and inform the community at large on environmental issues.  Let me in passing congratulate at this stage the various and varied environmental groups who have done so much to heighten public awareness and to educate us all in relation to environmental matters.  Perhaps without their bringing to our attention, or at any rate underlining, the importance and concern in relation to these varied environmental matters a great deal less would have been achieved in recent years.</P>
    <P>At EC level environmental policy has made great strides in recent years in spite of the absence of any express provision in the Treaties.  The Single European Act signed late last year now provides for three new Articles in the EC Treaty providing explicitly for action by the Community in relation to the environment. This is an indication of the higher priority accorded to environmental matters by the Community as a whole and, indeed, it is a pointer to us about the development of our own policies.  The new Articles provide that the action by the Community is to have several objectives: to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment; to contribute towards protecting human health; and to ensure a prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources.  It is also required that action in relation to the environment <Col N="288" /> is to be based on the principle that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage as a priority should be rectified at source, that the polluter should pay and that environmental protection requirements shall be a component of the Community's other policies.</P>
    <P>It is important also from an Irish point of view to note that the new Treaty provisions spell out requirements the Community action is to take account of &mdash; amongst them environmental conditions in the various regions of the Community, the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action, the economic and social development of the Community as a whole and the balanced development of its regions generally.  I have no doubt that the new provisions which are to be added to the Treaty and which will give a major boost to action at Community level will protect and improve the environment in the Community as a whole and in the individual member states.</P>
    <P>I was alerted to the fact yet again, and reminded by the very colourful stamp on the front page of the Minister's speech, that we are now into the European Year of the Environment as of a few days ago. The European Council decided in March 1985 to designate 1987 as the European Year of the Environment, or the EYE as we have come to call it.  The Commission subsequently put forward an action programme for the year and this was endorsed by a resolution adopted by the Environment Council in March of last year.  The action programme proposes that a general awareness campaign centred on a number of key topics will be carried out during the year, that model environmental protection projects will also be undertaken and that there will be projects aimed at improving monitoring of the quality of the environment.  As far as I am concerned this Bill is an ideal contribution from us as the country's legislators to the EYE.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Air Pollution Bill in February 1986 marked a major step forward in the development of our environmental protection law.  The Bill provides a comprehensive legislative <Col N="289" /> framework which will enable us to ensure good air quality throughout the country and to give effect to relevant EC Directives. All existing statutory provisions and regulations will be replaced by the Bill which should provide the State and local authorities with all the necessary powers for air pollution control both now and for the foreseeable future.  In general Ireland enjoys a very high standard of air quality.  Our geographical position on the perimeter of Europe and the prevailing westerly winds have spared us in the main from transboundary air pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that radioactive substances were specifically excluded from this Bill under section 3. The reason quite rationally given for this &mdash; the same reason as I gave in the Seanad in my Second Stage address on this Bill &mdash; was that other legislation, namely the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, and the Dumping at Sea Act already govern these matters.  In passing I should like to alert the Minister and to ask him to discuss it again with his officials before we get to Committee Stage.  My understanding of the position of the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, in that it established the Nuclear Energy Board is that the present Government intend to repeal it and to establish the radiological protection association &mdash; or board if I give them their correct title.</P>
    <P>I support that and I support what I understand to be their intentions in relation to the NEB, but if they are repealing the very legislation we are now saying makes it unnecessary to include radioactive substances in this Air Pollution Bill, I want to be sure that it will have a home, that this most important problem and topic will rest somewhere. Perhaps it would better rest here than in new legislation which will necessarily have to be enacted when we change the NEB or repeal the relevant legislation.  I throw that out to the Minister and perhaps he will come back to us on the Committee Stage of this Bill, or whenever is appropriate, and let us know what the intentions may be in relation to that.  I accept fully that the whole area of dealing with radioactive sustances would not fall <Col N="290" /> within the competence of local authorities too easily so I take on board the second part of the reason he gives, but we would want to look at this area again because of the stated intentions of the present Government.  Let me add that I agree with those intentions and I hope that when the Government repeal the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, they will remove that responsibility, which is really a safety or radiological protection responsibility, from the Department of Energy and give it to the Department of the Environment where I have always felt it more naturally belonged.  However, that is for discussion another day.</P>
    <P>Indeed, because of the nature of our economic growth we have little heavy industry of the kind that has caused serious air pollution in other countries. For over 20 years emissions from new industries have been controlled by conditions attached to permissions under the Planning Acts and this has contributed greatly to preserving air quality.  Nevertheless, local problems emerged from time to time and there is cause for concern about the trend in air quality in parts of Dublin, particularly the level of smoke at some periods during the winter.  Since 1981 smoke pollution has increased, reversing the downward trend of the previous decade.  The increased smoke levels coincide with the large scale increase in the use of coal and other solid fuels.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a 150 per cent increase in the burning of coal in our capital city in the past decade.  Coal and other solid fuels have been used for space heating purposes and create problems in complying with EC air quality standards for smoke.  In 1984-85 the EC daily limit value was exceeding at a number of stations in Dublin as was the value for the groups of three days. However, the longer term values for that winter and for the year as a whole were not exceeded.  Our attention was drawn to an article on the front page of today's <i>The Irish Times</i> where it appears that our excedents this winter are going to be serious indeed.  They seem as if they will be worse than the previous worst year 1981-82 and, let me say, a major cause for <Col N="291" /> concern in relation to the environmental health of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Air Pollution Bill provides a statutory framework for dealing with the smoke problems of Dublin.  However, before final solutions can be decided on the situation in each area must be assessed objectively and appropriate remedial measures devised on a rational and cost effective basis.  A number of options come to mind such as encouraging the use of natural gas &mdash; we hope it will overcome its apparent teething problems &mdash; and encouraging the use of other smokeless fuels, prohibiting the use of certain fuels and requiring the use of appliances which burn solid fuel smoke-lessly, I understand that various organisations in Dublin have fairly advanced research in relation to appliances which will burn coal as we all understand it without causing the smoke problems.  We await with anticipation the outcome of that research as I think there is a marvellous potential for such an appliance.</P>
    <P>Much of the Bill is designed to ensure that preventive action is given a high priority.  The licensing provisions relating to certain industries are a case in point. By taking appropriate action of this kind now, we can avoid the problems which are causing so much concern in other countries.  This Bill will be seen as a major step forward in environmental policy in this country.  Its success can of course be guaranteed only by the co-operation of the local authorities, the co-operation of industry and indeed the co-operation of the general public and this co-operation can be relied on.</P>
    <P>Like many forms of environmental pollution, air pollution is a problem which has been known to exist for centuries. We know that smoke control regulation in England dates back over 700 years. We also know that severe punishments were applied by the authorities for transgressions of air quality requirements.  For instance, there are records of a London manufacturer having been beheaded because he disobeyed a royal proclamation on coal burning.  In Ireland it does not seem to have been necessary to <Col N="292" /> introduce such harsh measures in days gone by.  It would however be interesting to know how air quality in our cities and towns in the past compares with that of today.  There must have been identifiable smoke problems in Dublin, Cork and perhaps other urban areas given the methods for heating and cooking which were employed at the time.</P>
    <P>How does air pollution affect us all? Initially it was perceived as a local problem affecting the immediate environs of cities and industrial sites and local control measures seemed the most appropriate remedy.  Very recently, however, air pollution has been recognised to have wider national and even international effects and its transboundary aspects have led to concerted international efforts to abate it.  The appalling spectre of the recent Chernobyl incident to which I have already referred brought this home to us tragically and dramatically.</P>
    <P>As regards effects on human health these in the main are respiratory and cardiovascular.  The very young and the elderly sectors of the population are considered to be most at risk from air pollution. In very severe pollution incidents such as occurred in London in 1952 there may be marked increases in mortality and morbidity.  There are also the less easily detected long term consequences of exposure to lower levels of pollutants and most importantly air pollution also affects the natural and built environments. Some of our historic and architecturally more important buildings, especially in our bigger cities, have suffered irreparable damage because of lack of control on certain aspects of air pollution.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate because of our geographic position and our prevailing winds in being largely unaffected by transboundary air pollution on the scale that is experienced in other countries, even in Europe.  Moreover, because of our economic growth we have little of the type of industry that has caused problems. Recent studies have shown however that particularly under the easterly air-flow conditions the acidity of rainfall along the eastern seaboard of Ireland appears to <Col N="293" /> suffer an artificial increase.  Air pollution has been assuming a higher public profile. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities has already devoted two reports to it, the most recent one being particularly concerned with acid rain.  An Foras Forbartha have launched a very useful report entitled Air Quality in Ireland &mdash; The Present Position.</P>
    <P>The common air pollutants are smoke, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and lead.  The principal cause of these is the combustion of fuel in one form or another.  The main sources can be classified as power generation, industrial and commercial development, the domestic sector and transport.  The proportion of total emissions contributed by each of these sectors varies.  For example, in 1985 77 per cent of our emissions of sulphur dioxide arose from the commercial, industrial and power generation sectors while in the case of smoke the reverse was the case with domestic sources contributing 79 per cent of the 117,000 tonnes emitted in the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>When we talk about smog here and what the public perceive to be air pollution, it is usually smoke.  On the Continent the reverse is true.  What the public there perceive as smog is usually high sulphur dioxide emissions.  In 1985 65 per cent of the nitrogen oxide emissions came from the commercial, industrial and power generation sectors with 28 per cent from road transport.  Again transport accounts for 78 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions and 50 per cent of hydrocarbon emissions.  These figures show quite dramatically that to protect air quality action is needed on a number of fronts and that air pollution cannot be attributed to one particular sector or to a few large industries.  In turn, this means that air pollution problems cannot be resolved simply or indeed overnight. They have developed over a space of years and our efforts to deal with them will also take some time and will have to involve all sections of the community.  It must be remembered that in carrying out our normal daily activities in relation to <Col N="294" /> the work or home, we all contribute in one way or another to the volume of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The most urgent problem of air pollution in Ireland is the trend of smoke levels in Dublin which have been giving cause for concern over a number of years. Certain winter smoke levels in Dublin continue to exceed the EC limits.  We are obliged to remedy this situation definitively by 1993.  To date, in addition to the standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide to which I have just referred, directives have been adopted which set air quality standards for lead and nitrogen dioxide in the air.  There is also a 1984 directive which requires the introduction of a licensing system for certain categories of industrial plant which may cause air pollution. EC directives also exist in relation to the lead content of petrol and the sulphur content of gas oil.  Ireland has further obligations on air pollution in the international forum.  The State is party to the 1979 Geneva Convention on long range transboundary air pollution which binds contracting States to limit and as far as possible gradually to reduce emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The motion we are taking today in conjunction with the Second Stage of the Air Pollution Bill was also set up under the Geneva Convention.  The Minister in his speech stated that the motion on the EMEP, that is the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme, really just puts in order our financial contribution to this programme.  He said we have in fact been contributing since 1980 and the monitoring work done has been done by the Meteorological Service from their Valentia Island station.  I would like to concur with the Minister in putting on record my appreciation of and my thanks to the Meteorological Service for this most important service not only to ourselves but to our neighbours.  I have no difficulty in supporting the motion on the EMEP protocol.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of justifiable concern over the severe problems resulting from atmospheric pollution in Central <Col N="295" /> Europe, Scandinavia and North America. The European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme is contributing to a data base of information so that we can control and eliminate as far as possible air pollutants particularly of a transboundary nature.  We are all responsible to one another in this area.  The concern led to the signing in 1985 of a protocol to the Geneva Convention in Helsinki when 21 countries undertook to reduce their emissions of sulphur dioxide by 30 per cent as soon as possible and at the latest by 1993 using the 1980 levels as the base.  Regrettably, Ireland is not in a position to sign this protocol.  Our total emissions of sulphur dioxide are small.  I do not like using that as a reason or as an excuse for not signing the protocol but it is a fact that our emissions are small.  However small though, they are still contributing to the total.  They amounted to 219,000 tonnes in 1980 and decreased in 1985 to 138,000 tonnes.  In other words they were below the reduction required by the Helsinki protocol.</P>
    <P>The second consideration for not signing the agreement is that with the developing economy seeking to industrialise even further Ireland's energy production is set to increase.  This means that reducing the sulphur dioxide emissions by reference to 1980 would represent proportionately a much greater economic burden for Ireland than for the more developed countries whose energy requirements have already peaked.  This, I think, is a reasonable point of view and a reasonable stance for us to take.</P>
    <P>This culmination of small emissions and the developing energy requirements is well understood at European level to require countries like Ireland to stand aside from uniform reductions in emissions like the Helsinki Protocol.  That said, we intend to co-operate to the best of our ability in the international effort to combat air pollution.  For example, the lead content of our petrol has now been reduced to the lowest permissible level three years before this was required of us.  Unleaded petrol has recently been introduced and I hope to see a worthwhile <Col N="296" /> network of filling stations developing rapidly. We already have a few in our major towns, but there is a cost factor.  I presume it will be some time before it is commercially viable to expect an unleaded petrol pump at every station, but that should be our objective.  We are required under the relevant EC directive to ensure the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol by October 1989.  We have been keeping within the limit values for sulphur dioxide imposed by an EC directive of 1980.  Our concentrations of lead and nitrous oxides in the atmosphere are within the limits imposed, as is the sulphur content of our gas oil.  All these measures will be given greater unity and coherence by the Air Pollution Bill of 1986 now before us in the Dáil, having successfully completed its passage through the Seanad.  This Bill is intended broadly to achieve two things. It will harmonise Irish legislation with a tendency in most industrialised countries towards a specific statutory code for control of air quality.  It is also a further important step towards completing the body of Irish law on environmental protection. With the increasing complexity of air pollution, both in its technical and international dimensions, there is a clear need for a separate and comprehensive statutory code.</P>
    <P>Now to the Bill itself.  Part II sets out general provisions relating to air pollution control and provides a range of powers which can be used by the Minister for the Environment and, indeed, local authorities, to deal with a variety of situations, for example emissions of dark smoke, wind blown dust from the land used for mining or industrial purposes, or any other emissions which give rise to air pollution, or nuisance.  It places an obligation on the occupiers of all premises other than private dwellings to use the best practicable means to prevent or limit air pollution.  It also prohibits emissions from any premises which may be a nuisance to anybody.</P>
    <P>During our discussions in the Seanad on this Bill there was quite a lot of concern about the definition of &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo;.  On the Continent, in <Col N="297" /> legislation of this type they use the expression &ldquo;best available technology not entailing excessive cost&rdquo;.  To me the one is the equivalent of the other.  An Taisce and, indeed, various other environmental groups made excellent submissions, some rather tardy, for example, An Taisce's not being received until November 1986. Although I have studied it in depth, I cannot go the whole road with them in relation to their point on best practicable means.  They want the best available technology to be included without the relative qualification of not entailing excessive cost.  Quite frankly, &ldquo;the best practical means&rdquo; is a relative term.  How one would treat a very old plant which has perhaps one or two years of useful life left under &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; is quite different from how you would treat a brand new plant which would be with us for decades. You cannot insist on best available technology for a small plant which is causing relatively no or little nuisance if that technology is available only in Japan or some other outpost in terms of geographic position to Ireland.  You must have good common sense in this area and it is a relative term.</P>
    <P>If we were debating whether the expression &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;best available technology not entailing excessive cost&rdquo; I would not argue the toss too long but that is not what is being requested of us.  I am quite satisfied by the use of &ldquo;best practical means.&rdquo;  This has been a legally established definition going away back, I understand, to the Alkali Acts of the first decade of this century and has caused no particular problems as technologies have developed over the years.  I am quite happy with its inclusion even though no doubt we will have further debate in relation to that expression.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the implementation of an EC directive on the control of emissions from industrial plant.  New industrial plant of the type specified in the Bill must obtain a licence before coming into operation.  There is a schedule attached to the Bill indicating to which plants these licensing requirements apply.  These include cement works, <Col N="298" /> chemical plants and certain electricity generation plants.  A most important point, as far as I am concerned, in relation to Part III, section 30 (2), is that there is a provision for retrospection on existing plants in relation to licensing.  I am sure we all could name plants about which we have concern.  Perhaps the concern is unjustified.  Sometimes as lay people we may over-react; I do not think so.  There have been many inquiries and investigations into a lot of what is perceived to be air pollution, or certainly nuisance coming from these plants.  One of these cases is still on its journey through our courts system and I await with interest the final outcome.</P>
    <P>We all have our own pet plant or area which causes us concern.  It is most important that the availability of retrospection is in this Bill in case the impression be given that existing plants can continue to ignore the standards we shall be demanding in the future of new plants, and Europe and all our neighbours in this area.  We must be reasonable about retrospection. The best practicable means would probably apply here.  If a plant has a limited life one is not going to insist that new technologies be superimposed at enormous cost, which would make no sense.  If plants perceived to be causing nuisance in terms of air pollution or environmental nuisance generally are going to be with us for some time and particularly if these plants are subsidiaries, for example, of multinationals, I think that we can look to the best practicable means and to a sensible attitude from these plants and require of them that over a reasonable length of time they step into line in relation to the standards now required.  I for one would hope that is how we would pursue this aspect and that the Minister of the Environment of the day would ensure that in a given length of time, where it is practicable to do so, all plants in Ireland will be licensed and to the standard required.</P>
    <P>Here more than in any other country where we do not as yet have what would be perceived as an air pollution problem nationally, we should protect what we have.  Not only does our agricultural <Col N="299" /> industry depend on it and the health of our nation and the health of our buildings and national environment, but our tourism industry depends on it.  Everything that we have to sell here and to capitalise depends on the quality of our environment, particularly our air quality.  This is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the statutory framework for dealing with localised air pollution problems.  Part IV enables local authorities by order to establish special control areas in which intensive measures may be implemented to combat air pollution. For instance, the local authority will have power in a special control area to issue notices requiring the owners or occupiers of premises to take the necessary measures to reduce air pollution. Ample opportunities, of course, are provided for public consultation prior to the confirmation of any special control area. It will be important that the extent of any problem, for example, the Dublin smoke position, should be assessed objectively, so that appropriate remedial measures can be devised and carried through on a rational and cost effective basis.</P>
    <P>A number of options come to mind, such as encouraging the use of natural gas and other smokeless fuels to which I have referred, requiring the use of appliances which burn solid fuels smokelessly and many others.  The main point is that there are likely to be a number of options available if we are dealing with a particular air pollution problem and that the optimum balance will have to be struck between all of these.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill confers significant powers on the Minister for the Environment including the setting of air quality standards and emission limit values. These powers are necessary to enable various EC directives to be given full effect and to protect public health and the environment.  These standards could be used also to bring about the necessary consistency and uniformity in the administration of the Act throughout the country.  The Bill is comprehensive.  I believe it to be a major step forward in environmental policy in Ireland. <Col N="300" /> However, it will need co-operation on the part of all concerned if it is to be a success.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the EC Commission has initiated proceedings against Ireland as of December last.  Indeed the proceedings were initiated against the last Government, seeking a declaration from the European Court that Ireland, in not adopting all the necessary measures to comply with Directive 80/779 of 1980, that is the Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide Directive, has failed to comply with its obligations under the Treaty.  The Department of the Environment were notified of this in early January and have since submitted their defence.  While I would hope that the case would not be pressed to a hearing in the European Court &mdash; given that we are enacting the Air Pollution Bill at present &mdash; there is no doubt that word of the Commission's action against Ireland has already reached environmentalists and other critical commentators.  What the Commission are essentially charging us with is failure to make adequate legislative, as distinct from administrative, provision to ensure that the prescribed air quality values for smoke and sulphur dioxide are observed in Ireland.  While the Commission's action relates entirely to procedure it may be interpreted by environmentalists as indicating a lack of commitment on the part of Irish authorities in tackling air pollution problems. As far as I am concerned the best answer to this is the prospect of early enactment of this Air Pollution Bill.  Incidentially, by the standards of other EC member states, the existence of just one problem area here, namely in Dublin, indicates a fairly limited incidence of smoke pollution in Ireland.  For instance, there are three problem areas &mdash; Belfast, Derry and Newry &mdash; in Northern Ireland and over 80 problem areas in Italy.  That puts in perspective the Irish situation.  The EC Third Action Programme on the Environment states that resources of the environment are the basis of, but also constitute the limits to, further economic and social development and the improvement of living conditions, which is what all of us in this House are about.  Thus, <Col N="301" /> the interaction between environmental protection and economic development must be a guiding principle in our approach both to environmental management and the promotion of economic and social development.  The environment cannot be sacrificed to development. Neither should development be seen as the enemy of the environment. Both are essential ingredients of our efforts toward economic growth and improving the quality of Irish life.  We must resist any temptation to look on environmental protection as a programme to be cast aside in the more difficult economic conditions in which the Irish economy now operates.</P>
    <P>It is against this general background &mdash; the protection of the environment linked with the improvement of economic and social conditions &mdash; that we have framed the provisions of the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, a Bill which, for the first time in the history of the State, will provide a comprehensive framework for dealing with existing and emerging air pollution problems.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in giving the Bill my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by congratulating you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in having attained for the third time the honour that this House conferred on you today and wish you every happiness. Likewise I extend a very sincere welcome to the Minister present in his role as Minister for the Environment.  I am sure he will bring to that Department the degree of enthusiasm and commitment for which he has become somewhat renowned in this House.  Indeed I might congratulate him on being the first member of the present Government to introduce legislation in this House.  I support Deputy Doyle in indicating my pleasure and that of my party at the measure the Minister chose to introduce to the House.  There was, in so doing, a degree of judgment exercised and in so far as that judgment was exercised, I support the priorities the Minister has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have a very active <Col N="302" /> time in his Department.  Much work has been done.  The introduction of this Bill is one indication only of the work that has been done in different areas.  The Minister is fortunate &mdash; I do not say this in any gratuitous sense &mdash; in having in his Department the technical and administrative resources with which to give effect to many of the things we shall be pressing him to do in coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his remarks, commented that he had received this Bill in its present form and that Committee Stage was the appropriate time to go into all of its details. There are quite a few matters that need to be examined.  However, I concur with what Deputy Doyle has said that there was a very extensive debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  Indeed all of us in this House would be paying the Seanad due honour and doing ourselves many favours were we to read that debate in its entirety.  I suspect that much unnecessary repetition in this House could be avoided were we to read the entire Seanad debate, in particular examining many of the technical replies given to questions posed by Members.</P>
    <P>I concur with the points that have been made to date.  There is an awareness of pollution in general.  There is now a growing awareness of air pollution.  Ultimately it is about resources because combating the negative effects of air pollution amounts to a question of resources. There are those people &mdash; no doubt we will hear from them on some occasion in this House &mdash; who would argue that economic development must not be impeded by any unnecessary constraints or any superfluous frills or fancy standards which our economy simply cannot afford at present.  The counter proposition I would put to those people is this: we cannot afford the damage that environmental or air pollution wreaks on our natural resources and, consequently, on our economy.</P>
    <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> saga off the west coast of Cork is a precise example of the damage that has been done to our natural resources because of lack of adequate environmental protection, exercised in <Col N="303" /> the first instance by the owners of the vessel in question.  If anybody needs to be persuaded of the damage done by the lack of proper pollution controls, they can look at that one instance among many others.  At present air pollution in our society and economy affects the human health condition, as was indicated by the chief medical officer of Dublin city some time ago.  However, we shall have more details of that on Committee Stage.  Air pollution also affects the physical fabric of many older buildings in the Dublin area and in other parts of the country where its levels can have a particular effect on the sheer physical fabric of buildings in a manner that many people might not fully appreciate or realise. Indeed within the precincts of these buildings most of the original sandstone that was part and parcel of the National Library had to be replaced because of a combination of air pollution and acid rain which effectively eroded and made unstable something that the ordinary lay person would regard as being a solid and durable commodity.  Therefore air pollution is a damaging and dangerous constituent of our environment against which we need to guard.  The position is being monitored, a fact to which the Minister referred at some length.  Any measures taken to support, rationalise and make more available data on foot of that monitoring is to be encouraged, particularly in the context of the European Communities and Helsinki Protocol, to which reference has already been made.  Ratification of that protocol which, in part, will bring us in line with the other 11 member states of the EC &mdash; the intention being that we would ratify this protocol together &mdash; is something that worries me. I shall return to that matter at considerable length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a two-tiered Community approach being applied to the requirement on peripheral countries and economies like Ireland, to adopt certain environmental standards in a manner that does not recognise fully the level of development which our society and economy have attained.  In the debate <Col N="304" /> in the Seanad there was reference on Committee Stage to section 28 of the Bill where appeals can be made to the High Court about compliance.  While the European Community may not invoke domestic legislation in that manner, there is nothing to stop non-governmental organisations and environmental groups in other parts of the Community from invoking such measures.  In this area we need to be sure that in undertaking Community obligations, recognition is given to Ireland's position.  If, having taken cognisance of Ireland's position, the Community insist on compliance within a period, the Community have a counterbalancing obligation to help a weaker and poorer nation state within the Community with additional resources in order to meet that compliance, for instance with regard to compliance relating to emissions from the ESB power stations. If the Community want a single standard of compliance in this area they must be prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>In relation to special control area orders, there have been a number of incidents of considerable and acute air pollution in this city.  The present legislative framework was incapable of dealing with the problem.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is probably aware of a debate which went on in Dublin Corporation for some time, relating to premises in Ranelagh where metal smelting and the burning off of high vinyl covering to lead and copper wiring provoked an intense local reaction in the area.  With the best will and with co-operation from officials in the Department of the Environment and from officials in the factory inspectorate in the Department of Labour, and other related bodies, we simply did not have the legislative framework to enforce minimal standards of compliance.  We were talking in this instance of lead from car batteries being burnt out and about lead pollution in a densely populated area and, in effect, there was no legal framework within which corrective action could be taken by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>This is not remote legislation which does not impinge on the condition of the daily lives of ordinary people.  It has a <Col N="305" /> very real impact for most people in the towns and cities of Ireland.  I agree entirely with the Minister's proposals to ensure that, if a local authority are to invoke the provisions in making a special control area order, there should be within the tradition of oral hearings and democracy a provision for the case to be stated and for the case to be appealed so that everybody can have a say in an open, democratic manner before a final decision is made.</P>
    <P>The rights of access and the sacred rights of private property were invoked in the Seanad.  These rights seem to cut across any attempt by this House to regulate activities in the area of our environment whether it relates to the control of the price of urban building land or to treasure finds belonging to the nation which happen to be located on a particular farm.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated today that without prejudice to what might finally be agreed, constitutional change is something that should be looked at and that perhaps in the tradition of the late Deputy Lemass, a previous Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, an all-party committee might be set up to get the balance right.  The rights of private property should not continue to be invoked as they have been invoked by successful lawyers under the interpretation of the Supreme Court.  The balance between those two things is now entirely in favour of the private owner to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps not enough attention is given to the environment.  It is only in recent years that the pressures on the natural <Col N="307" /> environment or pressures due to the complexity and difficulties in our urban and rural environment have brought a new attitude to our living environment which is so precious to us.  Our greatest gift is our environment.  The rapid changes in population in particular over the past 30 years have altered the character of our cities, towns and countryside in a way which would hardly have been contemplated 50 years ago.  Some 40 per cent of the population are living in the greater Dublin area and the country's demographic map shows the population shift in recent years.</P>
    <P>Dramatic changes are taking place even within the structures of our capital city and also in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  One of the difficulties in relation to the environment is that much of this has happened so fast that there has not been adequate time to plan the kind of infrastructure which is needed to protect city environments and to provide pleasant living areas within these cities.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to throw cold water on this legislation because I have had a particular interest in the natural environment for many years and called for the introduction of legislation of this kind for the past ten years.  However, I must issue a caution that this is just enabling legislation, not directive legislation, enabling local authorities to carry out particular tasks.  I would have wished that the legislation directed local authorities to carry out a particular task, such as enforcing proper air quality and air control, as should be the case in many areas where there is pollution of the natural environment &mdash; litter, water, noise control and so on.  This is a shortcoming in this legislation. We are living in the late eighties and the pressures have not built up to the point where legislation will become directive and will no longer be merely enabling legislation.</P>
    <P>At the outset I must congratulate those who drafted this Bill because a tremendous amount of work has gone into the preparation of this legislation which covers the pollution of the air and the environment.  My note of caution is that <Col N="308" /> this is purely enabling legislation, and that is where it falls short of what is urgently needed so far as the quality of air control is concerned.</P>
    <P>Air pollution, urbanisation, industrialisation and the utilisation of fuels are closely related and if cities and industries continue to spread, there will be an increasing threat to the quality of air in particular regions.  Common air pollutants which have already been referred to, sulphur dioxide, suspended particles, including smoke, nitrogen oxide, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, petrochemical oxates and lead, contribute to this immense problem.  There is a significant hazard to the future health of the environment when the concentration of these emissions into the atmosphere reaches a level which is harmful.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus firmly on the question of air quality and acceptability. I have never been content with what has come to be almost a parliamentary cliché &ldquo;it comes within acceptable EC levels&rdquo;&mdash; when it applies to air quality control, dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea and so on.  I am very wary of this because it is most misleading.  It is as if something falls just short of a particular limit and people are almost lulled into believing that it is acceptable, but it is not.  As far as air quality control is concerned, we cannot merely accept EC levels in a blasé manner.  Anybody familiar with the environment in heavily industrialised countries, such as France, Germany and to a lesser extent England, will realise that these countries have almost been forced into introducing quality air control and water control measures.  Germany was forced to take steps in this direction because her forests were devastated by acid rain due to sulphur dioxide emanating from many of her power stations. The same applied in France.  In Ireland we have been more fortunate because, compared with Europe, we have enjoyed good water, good air and a comparatively noise free environment.  I contend that that is the way it should be kept rather than drifting into accepting EC levels. That is something we should not do.</P>
    <P>Islands like Ireland and Iceland which <Col N="309" /> also has clear air, should offer no apology for maintaining high environmental standards. Let us stand on our own feet when adopting an attitude to the natural environment. It is opportune now, particularly in the Year of the Environment, that we should take a very forceful attitude towards our natural environment.  We should regard this legislation as a most serious contribution to the Statute Book. Future generations will not thank legislators if we pass laws which enable local authorities to take action but the local authorities are not compelled to take any action to protect the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>Our environment is a precious resource which is being abused through a lack of concern and, perhaps more insidiously in some cases, by vested interests who do not have a correct balance of progress with protection.  No one wishes to see jobs being lost or to see potential industry suffering because of environmental controls but there must be an added protection as well as advancement in these industries.  Air pollutants in sufficient concentration can have adverse effects on health resulting in an increase in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  It is important to realise that what is happening in our capital city is very injurious to the health of the nation.  I do not want to dramatise this but I believe people are actually dying as a result of the bad air in Dublin city and the situation is getting dramatically worse from year to year.</P>
    <P>In July 1980 I made a statement based on an environmental pollution report of 1979-80 issued by the health inspectors' department of Dublin Corporation, the monitoring service.  They said that the disquieting news that there had been a 35 per cent increase in smoke pollution in the Dublin city area highlighted a potentially harmful trend.  That statement was made seven years ago.  The reason for this increase was the oil crisis which made people burn solid fuel, particularly coal for domestic heating purposes.  One of the problems was that people just drifted into this situation and there was no control. The local authorities collected the statistics, looked at the figures and said we were still within EC regulations and <Col N="310" /> that there was nothing to worry about. What has happened is that year in and year out the problem has been worsening. Now we read in our morning papers &mdash; and these are alarming figures &mdash; that Dublin smog is going way beyond EC limits.  I would prefer if the authorities used the words &ldquo;beyond acceptable limits to people living in these areas&rdquo;.  There is no point reading into the record the figures we read in the papers, but areas like Crumlin, Ballyfermot and Rathmines are very heavily polluted.</P>
    <P>I notice the Ceann Comhairle has arrived in the Chamber and I would like at this juncture, late as it is, to offer my congratulations to him on his appointment as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>What about the areas bordering say, Rathmines, Ranelagh, Donnybrook, Terenure and so on?  What about the areas bordering Ballyfermot, Coolock and Crumlin?  The only effective way to tackle the problem in Dublin at one stroke &mdash; and we have got to square up to the problem &mdash; is to create a smokeless zone for the entire city.  There is no other way.  Piecemeal measures will be undertaken, efforts will be made to create a smokeless zone in Ballyfermot for example and we will read of a dramatic decrease in the smog level in that area. We have got to look &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of this &mdash; at what has happened in other countries. We will have to consider how they tackled the problem in London back in the late fifties when people were choking to death in heavy smog, this mixture of fog and particles of smoke.  As a result of the smog people were dying and so they set about creating a smokeless zone in the capital city of England.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples in Britain; for example, Belfast where the air quality is far more pure than it is in Dublin.  That is a shame.  The problem must be tackled and I can see no other way around it.  Unless in-depth legislation of this kind squares up to the problem we will not achieve anything.  Seeing is believing.  If people take a trip up the mountains and look down onto the city they will see before their eyes a heavy <Col N="311" /> pall of smoke, a dense fog, clinging to the city.  In a cold spell this smog gets trapped in the city.  It is a dreadful shame that this is permitted and that people have to live in that type of environment.</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of living people want to live in the inner city areas and yet the atmosphere in our capital city is bad.  It will drive people to live at a higher elevation.  I can see that happening unless something is done.  We cannot drag our heels and hope the problem will go away because all the facts and figures show that the problem is increasing month by month.  We have to depend on strong breezes blowing across the city to save us from the appalling, choking sulphur dioxide in the air.  It is great if there is a strong south westerly wind blowing as that is the one thing which saves us but if it is blowing in the other direction it is not as good.  In cold conditions if there is no wind it is very serious.  The House may not be aware that even in the less vulnerable months such as the spring or summer &mdash; November is the peak month &mdash; the level of polluted air in Dublin far exceeds that of London city which is heavily industrialised. Yet, in our city which is not heavily industrialised we have an immense problem.</P>
    <P>As I say, with a high concentration the effects are clearly manifested in terms of increased mortality and morbidity, especially among those with pre-existing respiratory illnesses.  The very young and the old members of our community are the two groupings who are most at risk with this problem.  If you tend to have a chest ailment, tend to be asthmatic or tend to have any type of respiratory or bronchial problem, you are very vulnerable. Less easily detected, and any cardiologist will tell you this, are the longterm consequences of exposure to low concentrations which may play an important part in the development of bronchitis, pneumonia, cancer and other related diseases.</P>
    <P>I realise this Bill confines itself to the stationary type emission of pollution. There is also mobile pollution from <Col N="312" /> stationary sources such as domestic, commercial or industrial buildings.  That is what the Bill concerns itself with.  There is pollution from cars, aeroplanes and other types of transport which is also worrisome.  More efficient fuel burning engines and more economical engines could ensure that there will be less pollution from these.  On the question of stationary pollution, we have got to square up to the problem of what we are going to do and substitute some of the fuels which are causing the problem.</P>
    <P>Coal combustion in Dublin contributes significantly to emissions and to the ground level concentration of smoke. There is no point in anyone saying otherwise. The coal distribution industry will argue they are not the culprits in regard to this problem.  If you look at the graphs you will see that there has been an increase in the tonnage of coal burnt in our capital city during the past seven years with a corresponding decrease in the amount of oil used and it is axiomatic that we have had an increase in the concentration of smoke-filled particles in the air.  Consequently, if there is any fog, both will combine together to form this awful smog effect.</P>
    <P>The recent increase in the use of domestic solid fuel and the high density of housing are combining to increase the problem.  I am aware that in Dublin there is the ESB coal burning station and that is a particular type of pollutant I will refer to in a few moments but I would like to dwell on the question of coal because it is the chief culprit at present.  I realise the comfort a coal fire and an open fire can have for people.  It is a focal point in family life.  It is not a luxury but a necessity in many cases.  Apart from anything else it has traditionally been a focal point in Irish life but there will have to be a change of attitude.</P>
    <P>We are the temporary custodians of our environment.  We have this environment of ours to protect but future generations will need to enjoy the environment in some measure.  It is sad to see, even on an international plane, the way the environment is being destroyed. Our children speak of the rain forests of <Col N="313" /> South Africa being destroyed and yet our own capital city, our environment, is being destroyed to the point that people are now aware of it on the streets.</P>
    <P>Our attitude in regard to coal fires must change.  In our cities we must discontinue the indiscriminate burning of bituminous coal that is causing severe pollution. Those involved in the distribution of coal should engage in promoting the use of smokeless fuels.  I burn smokeless fuel and I realise that it is difficult to get into the habit of burning it on a regular basis mainly because it is one-third more expensive than regular coal.  However, if more people used smokeless fuel Dublin's problems could be solved.  I do not think people will convert to it unless they are directed to do so by ministerial order and I do not think it is right to leave it to local authorities to carry out investigations.  We all know that a change to smokeless fuel will eliminate air pollution. Experiments carried out in other cities proved successful.  I would not like to see jobs lost in the coal industry but those people could be employed distributing alternative fuels.</P>
    <P>I accept that the coal industry carried out a lot of research on different types of grates for burning coal with a view to producing a more energy efficient grate and I am aware that some grates have a smoke recovery system incorporated in them.  We must continue our research along those lines because we will have to adopt a brave approach in regard to the quality of the air in the city.  We must remember that many people are living in fear of natural gas following the unfortunate tragedies in Dublin.  They feel that because the natural gas used does not have self-sealing effects in the pipes there is a danger of more damage being caused to the old piping system.  The Gas Company are concerned about this and are tearing up many of the streets in Dublin to repair damaged pipes.  It would be ideal if people turned to using natural gas because we would not have any air pollution but that is a long way down the road.  We must follow the example of other cities who have tackled the problem <Col N="314" /> of air pollution.  We should make a declaration creating a smokeless zone in Dublin city for a number of years as an experiment.  I realise that this is a Catch 22 situation because in the seventies people were encouraged to use coal when the price of oil was increased.  In fact the Government paid grants to people to change from oil burning systems.  I do not see anything wrong in encouraging people to switch away from coal.  A mistake was made and we must think in terms of smokeless zones to improve the quality of our air.</P>
    <P>We are giving bad example in the House because we have one of the most obsolete and inefficient pollutant causing heating systems in the city.  A turf burning system generates the heat for Government buildings in Merrion Street and Kildare Street.  If one looks out Kildare Street one will see a pall of yellow smoke hanging over the turf burning boiler-house located there.  The heating from it is very unbalanced and those who work in offices served by it are scorching one moment and cold within a short time. The National Gallery which is served by that system, is quite cold while offices near the system are very hot.  I understand that the system is 40 years old and uses 4,000 tons of turf annually.  It is the subject of regular complaints from those working in the area and officials at the National Gallery have complained about the pollution it can cause on some of the paintings there.  I suggest to the Minister that those four boilers be converted into a more efficient system as an example to the nation.  Two years ago when I raised this matter in the House I was given to understand that a conversion would be made within a few years but I suggest to the Minister that the plan be brought forward.  It may cost a lot of money to introduce a more efficient pollution free system but we must bear in mind the damage being caused by the plant.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are all types of nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide but the increase in sulphur dioxide has been caused by the huge increase in the use of coal.  Many buildings have been damaged <Col N="315" /> by pollution.  Deputy Doyle, when Minister of State with responsibility in this area, addressed herself to the problem and endeavoured to draw attention to the damage being caused to historical buildings and monuments by pollution. The faces of stone statues are wearing into amorphous anonymity and it will not be possible within a few years to recognise them.  We are witnessing a pollution of the living and the dead.  One must bear in mind the work done to protect the facades of many important buildings in Dublin such as the Bank of Ireland in College Green and City Hall.  A lot of money was spent using modern techniques to scrape away the ravages of air pollution on those buildings but the pollution trail has started on them again.</P>
    <P>More damage has been done to our architectural treasures and heritage by air pollution.  An in-depth study is being carried out in Trinity College on the effect of acid rain and sulphur dioxide in damaging buildings.  I believe this study will prove emphatically that more damage has been done in the past ten years or less than in the previous 500 years.  Hydrocarbons, nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide are steadily and visibly eroding the stonework on some of our renowned public edifices.</P>
    <P>You, a Cheann Comhairle, holding the illustrious position as Chairman, must feel that this building should be protected. If you go out into the courtyard and look across at the National Library or at the Museum or back towards Leinster House, the effect of erosion on the stonework is evident.  The cause is undoubtedly air pollution.  This would not happen in sterile air which was unpolluted.  We await the results of this survey to pinpoint how pollution is taking its toll on our national heritage.  The Bank of Ireland and the City Hall were cleaned at considerable expense only a few years ago but they are already showing further effects of pollution.</P>
    <P>If that type of pollution is affecting granite and stone to such an extent, we must consider the cumulative long term <Col N="316" /> effects on our health.  Anyone particularly interested in matters relating to the natural environment must consider the medical connotations and listen to what our chest specialists or skin specialists have to say about the effect of air pollution. Dermatologists will argue that many skin rashes are caused by air pollution. Certainly in ophthalmology only last year there was a huge increase in nonspecific conjunctivitis caused directly by polluting air of a kind that could be avoided.</P>
    <P>I consider that this nation is giving a very bad example at the Moneypoint power plant.  I raised the matter at the time and proposed a couple of solutions, saying that we should look to the EC for grants to support an installation which would be very much more flexible than one that burns unrelenting amounts of coal, irrespective of the quality of the coal.  When fully completed it will emit 90,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide which will come across our island.  This pollution will be felt as far away as Scandinavia. How can we look to countries in Europe when we are perpetrators of pollution ourselves from our single most important power station at Moneypoint?</P>
    <P>The problem of pollution could have been avoided easily if scrubbers and sulphur recovery equipment were fitted at the time.  Costs for such equipment were bandied about which were very misleading. At a seminar subsequent to the switching on of the plant it became quite clear that controls could have been fitted at a fraction of the cost that was spoken of by the ESB at the time.  It is not too late in the day to investigate the feasibility of fitting sulphur recovery equipment to the Moneypoint installation.  The problem should be faced up to.  It does not have to be Ireland's money which is used to do it, since grants of this kind are available from the EC and should be hotly pursued.</P>
    <P>In the Burren region we have one of the most delicate ecological treasures in Europe.  There is only one other and that is in Yugoslavia.  It has a fine balance of delicate botancial specimens and algae growing in a beautiful reserve.  Despite the assurances that monitoring stations <Col N="317" /> will be put in the Burren which will tell us if there is an amount of pollution, there is a grave danger that serious damage will be done to the Burren if the wind blows the wrong way or if the coal being used is of poor quality and the operation emits beyond the acceptable limits.  We have a unique opportunity as an island nation to give an example to the heavily industrialised parts of Europe.  We should refuse to stand for a coal burning station which does not have protective sulphur recovery equipment to stop unbridled pollution across the country.  This is the Year of the Environment and it is an opportunity to look towards protecting the Burren and to designating major areas of our cities as smokeless zones.</P>
    <P>The effects of acid rain must be referred to in the context of air pollution. The effects of sulphur dioxide come about through rain falling on grasslands. The dried deposition of acidic particles has the ability to produce an acidic solution in the grassland.  Studies have taken place on the Continent which show that much plant life has been damaged by acid rain.  The most alarming case is in Germany where 60 per cent of their forests, including many ancient forests, have been damaged or destroyed as a direct result of acid rain and air pollution.  We referred earlier to the wanton damage to the Coolattin forest, but that was damage of a different type.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a seminar in Geneva some eight years ago where Ireland and Iceland were referred to as countries which stood out because of their beauty and environment.  Things are happening now and air pollution is causing Dublin to assume the reputation of being a smog-ridden city as London was in the late fifties.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> That Dáil Éireann having approved and passed the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986, calls on the Government to implement the Act immediately.</P>
    <P>For many years various bodies, organisations and individuals have bemoaned the continuous rundown of the centre of our capital city.  There have been calls on various public bodies to take action to redress that seemingly relentless process whereby the centre of Dublin became tawdrier and more run-down.  However, it was not until last year that the Government addressed themselves to the problem in a particular way and that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill was introduced.  The purpose of the Bill was to establish a single function authority for a finite lifetime of three years which would assume all the powers and the responsibilities of the local authority, Dublin Corporation, and the responsibilities of the Dublin Transportation Authority as well as a number of responsibilities of the Garda Síochána. They were to address, in a co-ordinated way, the variety of problems of the central core of Dublin.  They were assigned responsibility for the area running from the top of Grafton Street, through Westmoreland Street to the Parnell Monument at the end of O'Connell Street, together with a number of smaller streets converging on that central spine.</P>
    <P>The Government announced their commitment to allocate a budget of £10 million over the three year lifetime of the commission as well as a subvention from Dublin Corporation representing the amount which the corporation would otherwise have spent on the maintenance of that area.  It was felt necessary to establish the commission because, as I already said, of the run-down nature of the centre of Dublin and the clutter of street furniture which was not in keeping with the demands of the area.  Regrettably, street furniture is often poorly maintained because flagstones in O'Connell Street are broken, removed and replaced by ugly and ill-fitting tarmacadam.  There is a <Col N="319" /> proliferation of litter and dirt and tawdry plastic signs adorn the frontage of many otherwise architecturally pleasing buildings. This has happened to such an extent that one can only reflect on the degree of architectural vandalism which was allowed to take place over a succession of years and which has blighted the centre of our capital city.</P>
    <P>Very high levels of traffic are funnelled through and, in many cases, virtually directed to flow through O'Connell Street, that single most important artery, with virtually no consideration given to the needs of pedestrians.  We felt that the way in which this might best be addressed was by the establishment of a single function authority which would be given all the responsibilities for the central spine of Dublin city so that they could identify and build on what was best in the area. We wanted to provide the area with matching, tasteful street furniture and to ensure that the architectural features of buildings would be highlighted.  We also wanted to ensure that advertising not in keeping with the general character of the street and which is very often in place without planning permission would be removed.  Indeed even in cases where such permission had been granted but where the commission felt the displays not to be in keeping with the area the commission should have power to seek their removal on foot of compensation.</P>
    <P>The commission were also charged with building new features in the streets, especially in O'Connell Street.  They were charged with the task of making the pedestrian predominant instead of traffic being king.  They were to carry out extensive planting of shrubs and flowers made up of different colours for every season in the year.  They were to consider the question of maximising the areas which could be pedestrianised in a permanent way.  This was to apply to Grafton Street on a 24 hour, seven day week basis, instead of the stop-start position which has existed for so many years.  They were to encourage the restortion and cleaning of facades of buildings, to identify and develop the importance of the central <Col N="320" /> mall in O'Connell Street which was the original intention of its architect.  They were to encourage the absolute concept of security for the pedestrian in that central area by having an increased Garda presence and a number of Garda kiosks. In short, they were to endeavour to restore to the centre of Dublin some of the grandeur which rightfully belonged to it in the past and which, unfortunately, it cannot claim today.  Yet, the essence of that grandeur, the scale of the buildings and the streets means that the essentials of that style and grandeur are still present.</P>
    <P>It was felt that establishing a single function authority whose sole purpose would be to identify all that was best, to concentrate on what was best and to remove which was worst, would add to the original design and lead to a centre of our capital city of which we could all be justifiably proud.  As I said, the commission were given a finite lifetime of three years so that they could address their collective mind to the task in hand and, having identified the need, would then get on with the job.</P>
    <P>There were a number of reasons for choosing a three year period.  It meant that the responsibility for continuing maintenance of the central area would revert to Dublin Corporation during the lifetime of the present elected corporation. It also meant that the second of the three years of the commission's existence would coincide with the celebration in Dublin of the city's millenium. Indeed, one could hardly speculate on a more appropriate time to commence this work than to have had a substantial amount carried out in time to have the centre of Dublin, as the proud capital celebrates its millenium, looking its best.  It should be designed in such a way as to maximise the usage and enjoyment for the individual pedestrian in the central area.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish the commission was, it is fair to say, widely and warmly welcomed not just, to my surprise, by Dublin but by people from every part of the country.  One thing it brought home to me very forcefully as we went <Col N="321" /> along discussing this proposal was that, while Dubliners feel that the centre of Dublin represents a very special place for them, so too do most people from virtually every other part of the country. For them the capital city represents a very special place and is identified with Ireland in a special way.  Consequently, the appearance, maintenance and upkeep of the central part of the capital city is a very important aspect for people from all parts of the country.  Therefore, the concept of trying to have central Dublin appear at its best appeals to all of those who have the interest of Dublin and of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>The proposals when published were welcomed by a variety of bodies, by An Taisce, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Bord Fáilte, the Dublin Eastern Tourism Organisation, the City Centre Business Association, individual business houses and traders in the area and especially by individuals, as I have said, individuals not just living in Dublin but individuals generally from whatever part of the country.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason which I have never been able to fathom, the then Opposition were the only organisation who expressed their opposition to the concept and they manifested that opposition in the most practical way available to a political party &mdash; by voting against it.  The single organisation, whether business, cultural, tourism or political who opposed the concept of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission in an outright fashion were the then Opposition, the party who are now in Government.  During the long debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas as the Bill passed with difficulty through those Houses I was never able to establish the reason for that opposition.  When the Bill was first published in June the Government at the time made every effort and endeavoured to be as accommodating as possible to encourage the Opposition to allow that Bill to become law before the summer recess so that the commission might commence work during last summer.  Despite every effort at that time <Col N="322" /> by the Government the Opposition refused outright to allow the Bill time for discussion in the House and intimated that were the Bill to be introduced and discussion to be insisted on by the Government they would withdraw all co-operation in relation to all other measures which needed to be passed before the summer recess.  Therefore, for that unidentified and as yet unidentifiable reason to oppose, the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was delayed by over six months. The Bill was eventually introduced into the Seanad in September and into this House in November of last year.  During its passage at that time I have to say that it was attacked by speaker after speaker from Fianna Fáil, very many of them Deputies representing the greater Dublin area but eventually Deputies ranging from as far afield as those whose affinity would be more with the Lee than the Liffey.  That culminated eventually here in the House in the Opposition party at the time voting against the final passage of the Bill, obviously unsuccessfully because the Bill became law and was put into effect.  I could never fathom why the degree and depth of the opposition was so great because in previous times and other circumstances Fianna Fáil had favoured the concept of single function authorities and I would have thought would have continued in their belief that if there is from time to time a problem to be addressed which can be addressed and resolved within a set period of time and where the spotlight needs to be on having the job carried out very carefully, it can often better be done by a single function authority than by asking a multi-discipline, multi-functional authority to carry out that special task in addition to all of their other functions and statutory requirements.  That was the attitude adopted by Fianna Fáil in previous years. It took a sharp U-turn last year when the metropolitan streets commission proposal was published.  Why I do not know.</P>
    <P>That continuing threat by Fianna Fáil over the future of the commission naturally caused a degree of apprehension for many people but I was interested to <Col N="323" /> note immediately post the election result that Deputy Bertie Ahern indicated as Lord Mayor of Dublin that he felt it unlikely that the Government would interfere with the metropolitan streets commission, although he intimated that they might very well decide to change or amend their terms of reference.  However about a week later Deputy Raphael Burke indicated, according to the newspapers, that the metropolitan streets commission had been established by the Oireachtas and derived their authority from the Oireachtas and he did not see that there would be any intention on the Government's part of interfering either with the functions of the commission or of the Custom House Dock Authority who had also been established by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that that was as it should be because the problem of urban renewal, urban regeneration, the attempt to breathe life back into city centres is now being addressed, and in many instances has been addressed for many years, right across Europe.  If there was anything to be said about what we were doing it could only be that the attempt to address this sensitive and important problem was far too belated in this country in comparison with many of our neighbours. The experience of many countries has shown that there is nothing clearer than that if Government do not give great attention and allocate resources to regenerating life in city centres those cities will die.  They will become faceless, nameless places, inhabited only from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. and will become virtually no-go areas outside normal office hours. Indeed, as time goes on they will become less and less attractive even as office centres as they will by then have already become dead commercial centres.  If we want living, viable city centres, of all the cities surely the one we would most want populated, vibrant, active and alive should be the centre of our capital city. Action to address that problem is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The metropolitan streets commission have been in existence for something less <Col N="324" /> than two months and their record in that short time means that they have shown by their work and by the imagination they have displayed since their inauguration the enormous potential they have.  The streets commission have already met with the traders and business people of the area they cover.  They have had discussions with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority and as lately as today we read in the newspapers of some of their proposals regarding the refurbishment and regeneration of O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission indicated that it is their intention that a considerable amount of the work which they plan will be carried out by the middle of next year in order that that work will coincide, as I mentioned earlier, with the Dublin Millennium.  For this worthwhile body as they commence their task, with their aim of having an important scheme prepared and of having much of the work put in place by June of next year, with the full support of the various bodies who have an interest in the area, from tourism to business and commercial interests, with the full support of the ordinary individual living in or visiting Dublin, there remains just one cloud, one shadow, one threat over their future and their success. That threat would appear to be the potential vindictiveness of the Government. There is a tradition in Irish politics, a tradition long honoured by a variety of Governments, that whatever is put in place by one Government, and especially whatever is put in place on foot of a statute enacted by the Oireachtas, is not interfered with or removed by that Government's successor.  It would be dangerous in the extreme if that tradition were to be broken.</P>
    <P>We have examples in neighbouring countries not too far away where in the recent past a variety of industries found themselves either within public ownership or outside of public ownership depending on the ideology of the Government of the day.  That is not good for any country or for any industry or grouping. The tradition which has been adhered to <Col N="325" /> for a very long time in this country is one which should be continued.</P>
    <P>For the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to succeed in their task, in their objectives and in what we set out for them in the legislation which was adopted by the Houses of the Oireachtas they require co-operation and support from many different sources.  They require co-operation support and goodwill from the traders in the area.  They require the same from Dublin Corporation, from the Dublin Transport Authority and from the various other public bodies such as the ESB, Bord Telecom and all the other people who use the streets to deliver their services.  The commission require co-operation from the Garda Síochána and from the general public.  Most of all for the commission to be successful they require the full co-operation and support of the elected Government.  I would have thought that was the least they might expect as they exist on foot of a decision taken by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A number of us believed that support might not be as readily forthcoming as the tradition of succession would demand.  It is for that reason that this motion was tabled.  It is the first motion in Private Members' Time and was tabled as a test. The test has been made.  The Government have been tried and have been found wanting by the nature of the amendment they introduced to the motion.  We find this amendment totally unacceptable.  When we made the decision to establish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and to make £10 million available to them over three years, as well as the allocation from Dublin Corporation towards maintenance and running costs, we did that in the full knowledge of the budgetary constraints which apply for this year and which are likely to apply for the ensuing two years.  It is fair to say that at the time we made that decision, during 1986, no group of people in the country were better in a position than the Government of the day to understand the budgetary constraints for this year and for 1988 and <Col N="326" /> 1989.  Despite those constraints we recognised the importance of the need for the establishment of this commission and for the allocation of a reasonable amount of funding to them.</P>
    <P>In that respect we allocated in the Book of Estimates which was published earlier this year a sum of £3.4 million to the commission to be spent in 1987.  The commission were established bearing in mind the budgetary constraints and yet we suspected that the support that might be given to them might not be as wholehearted from the incoming Government as it was from the outgoing Government. For that reason the motion was tabled to test the Government and the amendment is the result of the test.  The amendment is ominous for the future of the commission. It appears to reiterate the threat that was enunciated during the debates in the Oireachtas and to undermine the work of the commission by indicating the possible removal of that most vital artery from the success of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission &mdash; adequate funding.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission have made clear their objective of having as much as possible in place by the middle of next year to coincide with the Dublin Millennium. If there were to be any attempt now to interfere with their funding for this year or to starve them of funding for 1988, clearly that objective would be impossible to attain.  Without in any way seeking to rescind the legislation or to amend it, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission in the attainment of their objectives effectively can be thwarted if the Government are prepared to be vindictive enough to interfere with the moneys already allocated to them for 1987 or to starve them of cash for next year.  I would not have thought that would have been electorally popular.  The City Centre Business Association have already indicated that there would be a very violent reaction indeed from those organisations which have welcomed the establishment of the commission were that to be done.  Although the reason has not been spelt out in detail it is quite clear <Col N="327" /> from the reception given to this measure from the time it was published to the time of its delayed debate some four or five months later and to the attempt to vote it down in the Dáil, that Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to this measure.  One would have to ask again why?  One would have to fear again when reading the Government amendment that that opposition, that threat to the future of the commission is once again implicit in that Government amendment.  I want to say clearly that the Government had better realise that they will not have the support of this party for any diminution in the allocation of funding for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission as published in the Book of Estimates for this year.  Neither may they expect to have our support for that Estimate for 1988 if it provides less than adequate funding and less than the funding which would bring the commission on target to have delivered to it over the three years of its lifetime the full capital sum of £10 million as was promised.</P>
    <P>As I said, there was no group in the country better in a position than we in the springtime of last year, and more lately when we were preparing the Estimtes for this year, to understand the nature and depth of the budgetary constraints upon Government.  Yet we felt that the allocation of that £10 million was the minimum which was necessary to make the type of impact which I explained at the outset, an impact which would be not only necessary but long overdue &mdash; an impact which even in business or economic terms will have an enormous spin off in beneficial effect upon the commercial life and activity of the centre of Dublin and indeed upon the tourism potential of the city and especially the city centre.</P>

      <P>It is nice to see the unfortunate Dubliners doing well occasionally. Because of the outright opposition of the Government party when in opposition and because of the prevaricating tone of the remarks made by some of the Government party when in Opposition of the election, we decided to choose this motion as the first to be discussed in Private Members' Time because it was to be the test.  The Government might not have failed the test had they not entered an amendment but they tabled the amendment with all the capacity for effectively removing the potential of the streets commission to achieve its objective and once again reiterated the implicit opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party to the concept of the streets commission.  That means that the Government have been tried and found wanting.  I want to indicate again to the House on behalf of my party that any attempt to reduce the potential of the streets commission to achieve its stated objectives and the objectives laid down for it by statute will meet with the outright opposition of this party.  That opposition will be carried out on behalf not just of the people of Dublin but of the people of Ireland and of all those who have the best wishes and best interests of the centre of Dublin at heart.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;having full regard to the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> While Deputy Boland goes into considerable detail as to the way in which this commission legislation was framed and shows by the way in which he has addressed the matter this evening his personal commitment to that commission &mdash; I do not take from him in that &mdash; I should like him to try to understand that there are those of us who share in the regard that he has for the capital city.  It happens to be my capital city, too, and indeed it is looked upon by all citizens of the State as their city.  It is not simply the preserve of any one Deputy or group of Deputies of the House.  We all fully understand and appreciate the importance of the capital city to the lifestyle and international standing of the community at large.  Of course, it has a very great bearing on all the economic life in the country, both internally and externally, and the vast majority of the tourists who are attracted to our country come through the capital city.  It has a very great importance. I perceived in the Deputy's tone that perhaps he might not regard people like myself from another part of the country as having the same love and understanding of the importance of the capital city to this State as a whole.  He is perhaps too pessimistic about that matter, but he can rest assured that while I am Minister for the Environment I see and recognise the importance which the capital city has. It will be my intention to make sure that everything possible is done to enhance that capital city so that this House and the citizens of this State can be proud of it.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that there was a great need in so far as the total appearance of the city was concerned.  We do not drive to Leinster House in some blinkered way from other parts of the country and not take notice of the level of the difficulty of the run-down condition of the city and suddenly appear here and flit away at the weekend and be glad to be rid of it.  There are occasions when that might be the case, but the Deputy can rest assured that in so far as the appearance of this city is concerned it is a matter of ongoing and continual discussion amongst all Deputies of the House.  I can share with Deputy <Col N="330" /> Boland the fact that over the past number of years certainly the city has become run down to a very large degree.  The centre of the city is the place where one notices that most.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Boland should use some of the terminology that he used this evening in so far as this issue is concerned.  To refer to the potential vindictiveness of the Fianna Fáil Government in dealing with this matter is unfair and untrue.  He will find very little vindictiveness in this Minister.  It is not my style.  I would sincerely hope that the same could be said of all my colleagues in Government although I cannot speak for them.  Certainly I hope to ensure an open ministry in my term of office as I hope Deputy Boland will find.  I am sorry the Deputy thinks that somehow the Government are taking a vindictive stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>I found it difficult to understand why the Deputy moved the motion.  He gave as the reason that he wanted it to be some kind of test of the sincerity of the Government on a particular matter.  I did not see it like that.  I have to say I saw it as a blatant act of political expediency, seeking to embarrass the Government on their first day of public appearance in this Chamber.  That is not worthy of the Deputy.  The motion could be addressed only in the way in which it has been responded to here by the amendment. Deputy Boland knows that full well.  It would be wrong and irresponsible of me, and of the Government as well, to come in here in advance of a budget to be announced next week and divulge individual items or suggest how they might be addressed in the revamped Book of Estimates.  That was made quite clear by the Taoiseach here today when he spoke of the original Book of Estimates and the fact that there will be changes which will be outlined in great detail on Tuesday next, that is, pluses, minuses, additions, subtractions and so on.  It would have been preferable had Deputy Boland not introduced this motion at this time because, as I see it, it is provocative and inappropriate.  I cannot seek to pre-empt the decisions that will be announced in <Col N="331" /> the budget.  It is unfair of the Deputy to put me under that pressure.  Therefore, I do not see it as any kind of test of a political nature.  I see it purely in the way I have described.</P>
    <P>So much for the stated support we were to expect from the major Opposition party in dealing with the difficult decisions to be taken for the coming year. All those difficult decisions are being considered at present and were considered at a meeting of the Government today, on Sunday last and at meetings all last week.  Everything must be taken into account &mdash; all matters right down to the subhead with the least amount of money allocated to it.  Deputy Boland knows that.  I cannot &mdash; and it would be wrong of me to do so &mdash; divulge what will be the final outcome of those discussions.  I will not pre-empt the decisions to be taken by the Government in the final budget because some of those decisions have not yet been taken and discussions have not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>Most Members of the House are aware that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are a statutory body established under the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986, which became law on 27 November 1986.  The commission were established on 1 February 1987 under an order made by my predecessor, Deputy Boland, on 16 January 1987.  Under the provisions of the Act the commission must be dissolved within a period of three years from that date.  The commission consist of a chairman and six ordinary members, all of whom are appointed by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The area of responsibility of the commission is the Dublin metropolitan central area.  That consists of that part of Dublin city centre running from Parnell Street, through O'Connell Street, West-moreland Street, D'Olier Street, College Green to Grafton Street, including some of the adjoining streets.  In respect of that area it is the general duty of the commission to secure, by every practicable means, an improvement in the level of civic amenity and in the general <Col N="332" /> standard of civic design with special reference to the convenience and safety of pedestrians and the general appearance of streets and buildings, including standards of design, maintenance and cleanliness, the regulation of traffic, parking and the provision of further civic amenities.</P>
    <P>As a first step the commission are required to prepare an improvement scheme, or schemes, for the metropolitan central area in consultation with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority.  The commission must have regard to the development plan drawn up by Dublin Corporation under the planning Acts and also make arrangements for submissions by interested persons. Such improvement schemes will be required to detail measures regarding buildings, advertisements, roads, paths, street furniture, trees and many of the other things mentioned by Deputy Boland in his contribution which the commission consider will have to be implemented in fulfilment of their obligations. Improvement schemes, when drafted, must be submitted for approval to me as Minister for the Environment. At the same time a copy must be sent to Dublin Corporation.  The Minister is obliged to consider any objections to the scheme proposed by Dublin Corporation within one month of its submission.  Once an improvement scheme is approved the commission will have considerable powers of a planning nature designed to enable them to secure compliance with and implementation of the scheme.  The commission will have power to require property owners to remove or alter any structure and to provide suitable replacements, if appropriate.  Property owners could also be required to discontinue any use of and to remove, alter, repair or tidy any advertisement or advertisement structures.  Those are important powers with obvious implications in the area of compensation.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 10 of the Act the commission have general powers to carry out works of amenity development and environmental improvement in order to encourage <Col N="333" /> people at work, shopping or otherwise to use the facilities provided in the area. These powers would allow the commission, among other things, to provide street furniture, floral decoration and other amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the powers, duties and functions I have just mentioned the Act provides for the transfer from Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority of the following powers: the full range of powers of Dublin Corporation in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of public roads, the various traffic management functions of the Dublin Transport Authority in relation to taxis, bus stops, control of pedestrians, traffic and parking, traffic signs, the co-ordination of road openings, and the powers of Dublin Corporation in relation to the prevention and control of litter and the removal of house and trade refuse.  These additional powers, which are both extensive and onerous, have not yet become vested in the commission.  However, my predecessor, Deputy Boland, as one of his last acts in office, made an order on 9 March bringing the sections of the Act which transferred these powers to the commission into operation with effect from 1 June next.</P>
    <P>In summary that is the technical position regarding the Act.  I am aware that the commission have had a number of meetings and that a chief executive officer appointed by my predecessor has taken up office recently.  A process of consultation with various interest groups likely to be affected has already been begun by the commission.  However, as is only to be expected the commission have not yet submitted any improvement schemes to me for approval.  To help them in this task of preparing improvement schemes the commission have the assistance of a professional consultant, also nominated for that purpose by my predecessor in office.  It will be seen that my predecessor was very busy in this matter.</P>
    <P>At this stage there is little more to be said about the implementation of the <Col N="334" /> Act.  The commission have been established and are operational.  I am not aware that any proposals from the commission are before me and to my knowledge they are certainly not held up in the Department.  Neither am I aware that any specific decisions are required of me at this stage under the Act.  I am sure that the motion in the name of Deputy Fergus O'Brien was not put forward merely for the purpose of eliciting that information. Having left the Custom House within the last few weeks I have no doubt that Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Boland are fully informed about the operations of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and the stage reached in implementing the Act.  We are thankful to Deputy Boland for informing us that the motion was put down in this way as a political test of the Government's intentions. The only political test of any consequence is the one which took place some weeks ago, which was resolved by the people of Ireland and which established me here instead of Deputy Boland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to test the consistency of the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter.  I did not like the way in which Deputy Boland couched that test and the threatening manner he used in saying that if we did not comply with what he wanted in the way he wanted there would not be support and co-operation forthcoming from the Fine Gael benches.  I do not know if Deputy Boland has the full leave of his new party chief to make statements like that but if what he says is a fact there is a decided shift in what was the stated objective and aim of the former Leader of the Fine Gael Party, in that support was promised to the Fianna Fáil Government in carrying out their functions in the best interests <Col N="335" /> of the country and in the economic policies necessary to implement a proper fiscal policy.  Maybe that was political clap-trap to accommodate the political environment at the time and maybe now because there has been a change in the leadership, a new set of ground rules are to be applied.  We do not know that but we await further outpourings of Fine Gael wisdom as to how they will implement the stated position of the former Leader of their party.</P>
      <P>The popular image of the commission was aided by the substantial publicity campaign mounted by Deputy Boland especially in the run-up to the General Election.  The Deputy was active &mdash; he has been an active man all his life &mdash; and one must readily admit that he was particularly active in respect of this legislation despite the fact that he had difficulty in convincing a lot of his own people about the need for this legislation. Fair play to Deputy Boland, he got over the hurdles and into the finish; he got it on the book.</P>

      <P>Others cast a cold eye on the former Minister's approach to setting up the commission apart from the members of Dublin Corporation and some Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side. Some on the other side of the House had very clear misgivings about the measure and they stated their objections.  I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Boland was not familiar with some of the contributions made as to why there was some <Col N="336" /> opposition to the measure which was introduced.  I am sure he remembers the suggestion that this was just another layer of bureaucracy where an extra layer was not required and is aware that it was stated in the House during the debate on the matter that people had misgivings about the taking away of responsibilities and powers from the corporation.  The Deputy is also aware that there were many in Dublin Corporation, including some of his own supporters and elected friends, who thought that in some way it was a vote of no confidence in Dublin Corporation in having this commission placed on top of them suggesting that they were unable to do their job properly. These things were stated here and some people went as far as to say that what the Minister was suggesting was slightly antidemocratic. When reading the contributions to that debate one gets a clearer picture, in hindsight, of the thrust of the opposition to that commission.  I can well understand why some of the Deputy's colleagues in the corporation and other might have had misgivings about the legislation at the time, which was taking away some of their powers.  They probably felt that the commission were pinching the best ideas of the corporation and the corporation were seeking funding at the time to do many of the things that Deputy Boland rightly says are so urgently needed to improve Dublin city centre.  It is obvious from the contributions that Dublin Corporation already had plans.  This is obvious when one reads Deputy Ahern's contribution at column 691 of the Official Report for 29 October 1986.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation are engaged on a number of activities designed to improve the general environment of the city centre area.  One of the most important of these is the pedestrianisation of streets, the special treatment of the street/pavement surfaces, the critical examination of items of street furniture and their renewal or replacement as necessary.  The tasteful treatment of streets in this fashion will have a spinover effect into adjoining areas, <Col N="337" /> and, it is hoped, will likely encourage owners of premises fronting on to them to take a special interest in their immediate environment and to reflect this by way of improvement in the treatment of their own frontages, sympathetic material in shop fronts and sign writing, window displays, floral displays in window boxes etc.</P>
    <P>It is almost verbatim what Deputy Boland stated about the vital requirements necessary to enhance the centre of Dublin.  I agree with it but it would appear from reading this contribution of 29 October 1986 that Dublin Corporation had well advanced plans in this matter. Perhaps in that submission lie the answers to some of the questions posed earlier by Deputy Boland.</P>
    <P>Many people at that time said that the commission might be unworkable or might not work satisfactorily because of the great powers it would need to draw to itself from many other interested groups and that it might be unworkable in relation to traffic, refuse and planning. There was a lot of reference to that in the debate at the time and many said that perhaps Deputy Boland should have paid more attention to the corporation's needs and requirements to fund their stated objectives and for which their plan had been drawn up.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment here tonight is not to rake over old coals but to focus the attention of the House on the real issues which face us not just in implementing the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act but in implementing all other legislation and programmes. I would have hoped that such a reminder would not be necessary.  It certainly should not have been necessary to Deputy Boland, barely two weeks into the Government's term of office, and only a week before the budget.  I am sorry Deputy Boland found it necessary to put down this motion at this time because it made it necessary for me to put down my amendment in these terms.  I will not read out any provisions relating to the budget a week in advance of that budget.  It is <Col N="338" /> unfortunate that a reminder of this kind is necessary.  Since taking office two weeks ago the Government have been working against the clock in an attempt to review all aspects of public finances and all items of public expenditure to ensure that all the resources available to the country are used to the best advantage and that confidence and growth in the economy are restored.</P>
    <P>It is not news to Deputy Boland and everybody else that the economic situation has deteriorated since 1 January 1987.  There can hardly be a Member in the House who is not aware of the long hours that have been, and still are, spent formulating the budget to be presented next week.  Long Government meetings are nothing new to Deputy Boland.</P>

      <P>Dare I say it?  I presume he was present at most of those meetings and probably sat through some of the longest Government meetings ever held in this State.  Our Government meetings were an essential part of the work involved in the review of all existing spending programmes and a review of the various expenditure commitments undertaken by the former Government.</P>
      <P>When questioned by the Opposition today the Taoiseach stated the position as regards the abridged Book of Estimates and it was made quite clear that there would have to be movements in both directions, plus and minus, and that they will be put on the record next Tuesday. One would have thought Deputy Boland would have waited until that matter had been disposed of before going on one of his political quests to test the sincerity of the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial implications of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission cannot be excluded from a necessary review of the kind we are undertaking into the economic situation, it would be inappropriate if we did that; because every single item is on the board. As I said, it is the Government's objective to examine critically every item of <Col N="339" /> expenditure to see how each will fit into our overall approach of generating confidence and growth in the economy.  The Estimate figures published by the previous Government included a provision of £3.4 million from Exchequer funds for the operation of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission in 1987.  This is approximately one third of the £10 million budget envisaged for the commission in their three years of operation under the Act.  The provision for capital expenditure was £3 million and the balance of £400,000 was for current expenditure. The question to be asked is whether the country and the taxpayers can afford expenditure of this order in the current financial position.  This is not admitting that this sum is in or out.  I am putting it to Deputy Boland that all expenditure on all subheads, irrespective of size, must be looked at.  Whatever the reason for the slippage &mdash; and there are a number of them &mdash; the Government are faced with the unenviable task of finding the additional sums needed.  No item of expenditure can be excluded from a review in a situation of this kind.  As I said, the Government have decided to withdraw certain allocations of funds already notified to local authorities following decisions made by the previous Government.  I had to put a stop not just on this but on other matters as well until all economic matters are settled.</P>
    <P>Allocations for expenditure on roads and amenity grants had also to be withdrawn pending completion of the review in the budgetary context, no more and no less and that is what the amendment says.  I would have thought it reasonable to expect that a Government who would have to preside over expenditure for nine months of this year would not have had their hands tied by having all allocations suddenly disposed of under an Estimate which had not been agreed in this House and which did not have a budget or a Finance Bill to back them up.  Surely it is not too much to expect that a Government would have available to them the spending of the money they were providing in their Estimates?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The Dublin Streets Commission legislation was devised, presented and passed in this House but I have had a number of representations claiming that there had not been full consultation with the corporation. How can the commission work to everybody's satisfaction when they need the co-operation and support not just of the corporation but of a whole range of other agencies?</P>
    <P>All these matters are on the table and everything Deputy Boland said will be taken into account when considering the functioning and financing of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  At this stage, however, all these issues are subservient to the central consideration which is the state of the public finances and the preparation of the budget.  I regret greatly that Deputy Boland moved this motion at this time.  I regret also some of the excessive language he used. I ask that he be generous so far as the voting on this item is concerned and that he understand that the matter is not being disposed of and that the commission are not being disbanded, if that is the word to use.  The matter is before the Government and until the budgetary position is settled I can go no further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the words of congratulation addressed to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle by my party leader, Deputy O'Malley, earlier this evening.  I also wish to be associated with the good wishes he expressed to the Minister on his appointment to his very important portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject matter of this resolution is, in my view, one which has deficiencies of certain kinds.  The most important deficiency is that it failed to grapple with the real causes of urban decay in Dublin and was seen as a short-term interim measure to put right what had taken place through decay, disrepair and bad development in Dublin over 50 to 100 years.  My first objection to this Bill, although my party supported it when it was first brought before this House, is one which is not fundamental but which could, in the fullness of time, seek to be <Col N="341" /> properly amended, that is, it is temporary in nature.  I do not believe it is possible to accomplish within three years the programme of work the Bill intended the commission to carry out.  I do not believe for one minute that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commissioners could accomplish anything but a tiny fraction of the work which it was envisaged they would undertake.</P>
    <P>My second objection to this legislation is that if fails to address the problem which has arisen in the Dublin area in particular, but in all other urban areas too, from the inadequancies of the local government planning and development code.  The various Acts brought in since 1963 to control and codify the law relating to planning have made no real distinction between urban and rural planning and have, as their basic characteristic, adopted the approach of negative planning, that is, that one could do with one's land what one wanted as long as it conformed with certain minimum criteria.  I submit that that is a fundamental fault of our planning laws which has contributed to urban decay.</P>
    <P>Urban property, streets and buildings cannot be expected to come into existence on a harmonious basis if they are left to market forces, struggling against legal, geographical and social complexities. Anybody who examines the history of urban planning in Dublin will come to the immediate conclusion that what we treasure most in Dublin arose not out of the actions of any elected bodies, such as the corporation, but out of the actions of non-elected bodies.  The most attractive portions of this city were created either by the Wide Street Commissioners, 18th century and 19th century bodies, or alternatively by the great building estates and the grand landlords such as the Pembroke estate and Gardiner on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>The common feature to all the planning undertaken both by those estates and the Wide Street Commissioners is that they were done on the basis of a positive planning approach, where the person who took the ultimate decision as to how those areas might be laid out was <Col N="342" /> somebody who had a positive view of how the streetscape in every case should appear.  It is an important point to make that until such time as positive urban planning is applied to Dublin rather than the negative urban planning law we have now, there will be no improvement in the streetscapes of Dublin and there will be no general improvement in the wellbeing of the capital city.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made this evening by the Minister is that his predecessor rushed the enactment and implementation of this legislation for cynical purposes. Anybody who was in any way alert to the circumstances in which the Metropolitan Streets Commissioners came into being and came to be established as a set of persons given their appointments would have to take into account the undoubted tensions between Dublin Corporation on the one hand and those who proposed the Bill on the other.  It is not an unduly cynical view to express that if the political complexion of Dublin Corporation had been otherwise this Bill would not have come into being.  The extent of the opposition to this Bill from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party at whatever level reflects more the fact that they at a particular time had a particular strength in Dublin Corporation and they felt that this Bill was in some way calculated to take away from the effectiveness of the corporation.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the major blame for urban blight in Dublin lies at the doorstep of the corporation.  I do not say that with any disrespect for the members of the corporation because in the main they are unpaid people trying to do their best but the laws they are asked to operate and the structures which they have inherited from their predecessors leave them with no positive role in planning how Dublin should look and leave them also in control of traffic engineers and similar groups of expert servants whose view of what a city is and how a city can be conserved differs dramatically from the view of the ordinary person, not to mention the conservationists. If one looks not very far from this House at streets which have <Col N="343" /> effectively been rebuilt during the lifetime of the 1963 local government planning and development code one could not but draw the conclusion that streets such as Cuffe Street have no thematic unity, have no consistency of construction or style and are evidence of complete confusion, haphazardness and an ugliness which is soul destroying to the people who have to live on those streets and to those who have to pass through those streets each day.</P>
    <P>I ask the Members of this House to consider whether with very few exceptions the thrust and effect of the corporation's intervention in the affairs of this city and in its conservation have not been in the vast majority of cases negative and destructive.  That is a great pity but it is one which is understandable. Looking through any of the great cities in Europe I would also invite the Members of the House to draw the conclusion that they have never been planned, laid out or conserved solely by representative bodies.  There have always been bodies or individuals with extensive powers of a non-representative kind at the back of every worthwhile renewal project in Europe.  Haussmann in Paris is an example of the kind of powers which an individual needed to transform a city into a beautiful one and to make sure it had certain characteristics and standards of architecture which made it attractive to the eye.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the conclusion to which I am driven is that in order to plan a beautiful city you cannot entrust the function of conservation and the function of positive planning in terms of deciding how a streetscape should appear to a body who have a multiplicity of roles which include road widening, drainage, cleaning and all the various functions which Dublin Corporation are required to carry out and who have a multiplicity of demands upon their purpose.  A fund has to be made available for the purpose of positive urban planning and it has to be entrusted to a group of people whose sole function is to engage in urban planning and who are not distracted by the other functions of <Col N="344" /> representational politics which characterise Dublin Corporation today.</P>
    <P>I believe that process is a long term one, just as the Wide Street Commissioners of the 19th century were in power for many years.  It is also the case that in the latter years of the 20th century it is extremely naive to believe that a period of three years which involves, as the Minister told the House earlier, complex consultative processes could be expected to encompass the dramatic and far-reaching changes which are needed in order to make Dublin a beautiful city again.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there are many good reasons for believing that our planning laws are, first, misunderstood and, secondly, inadequate to deal with the realities of our inner city problems.  They are misunderstood in this sense.  One of the Deputies for the Labour Party today spoke about an apparent and mistaken view of the Constitution which, in the view of the Deputy, stands in the way of mediating property rights with the common good.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the Constitution does not prevent any worthwhile redrawing of our planning laws so that they can control in a far reaching way the manner in which urban land is used by its owners, the use to which it can be put and the way it can be developed.  The recent Supreme Court decision, referred to by the Deputy, did not have the effect he suggested.  On the contrary, it underlined the inadequacies of our planning laws and brought into focus the question of whether our planning laws with their very generous compensation procedures are not unconstitutional by reason of their generosity and arbitrary nature.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that Dublin Corporation have the power or the will to bring about urban renewal on a sufficiently wide scale.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961, was introduced to enable local authorities to prevent dereliction in the centre of their cities.  It is remarkable that the Act is virtually unused in Dublin. Instances of its use have yet to come to my attention and I dare say those involved in the administration of the law <Col N="345" /> at any level have rarely seen that Act used by local authorities to prevent dereliction in their area.  The question arises: what powers do the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission need to enable them to ensure there is a change in the way our city is planned?  I suggest that the commission should at least have been given the power to acquire property, to put together packages of land with clear title.  One of the advantages of the Wide Street Commissioners was that they could acquire land, simplify its title and dispose of it by way of building lease or outright sale to people who were obliged to build in conformity with a street plan. That is how streets like Talbot Street, Henry Street, Grafton Street, Pearse Street and Capel Street came into existence. In those cases an agency intervened to buy up land compulsorily and transform it into simplified building lots that were given to those who had the will and the means to develop in accordance with a positive plan.</P>
    <P>The only occasion when positive planning was attempted here was in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War in relation to O'Connell Street.  That street was rebuilt to a very high uniform standard and it had great appeal until much of it was destroyed and vandalised by developers and shopkeepers who had low standards of taste.  An architect was appointed to supervise the standards and streetscapes after the Civil War.  Positive planning in that case was successful.</P>
    <P>The powers given to the commissioners in the Act under discussion seem on the face of them to be concerned with small items such as the external appearance of buildings, street furniture, street surfaces and so on.  However important they may be they cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for what is genuinely needed, a programme of urban renewal.  Likewise, any person who believes that one can widen a road and tear down all the houses on it leaving it as an ugly scar in a city without any responsibility for rebuilding it and turning it into an artery of shops, houses and offices is gravely mistaken.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the area of Dublin with <Col N="346" /> which I am most familiar, the area between the canal and St. Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral, one will see the amount of damage the corporation's road widening plans have done to the streets, the communities in the area and the concept of the city.  It is self-evident that the corporation are one of the biggest agents of urban destruction. Therefore, it is proper that a specialised urban renewal agency should be established and that it should be given far reaching powers.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude my contribution tonight.  The Minister drew attention to the reservations expressed by some Members when the legislation was going through the House in regard to what was seen as the undemocratic nature of the powers given to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commissioners.  In my view those powers are necessary. They may appear undemocratic but they are the only practical powers which can be given to a positive urban renewal agency.  They are inadequate as to their extent and duration.  What is needed is a transformation of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commissioners into a positive planning agency of a permanent kind with powers not merely to deal with superficial matters but to acquire sites and promote building in the city to a standard and design which is consistent with urban renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the controversy that surrounded the conception of the Act and the pressures and tensions that now appear to characterise its birth this type of body is an essential part of urban renewal.  Unless the planning code is altered and an urban renewal commission with far reaching powers is established, <Col N="347" /> distinct from the local authority, all our best efforts at urban renewal will be a failure.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy McDowell on his maiden speech in the House.  I also congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State opposite.  This is also the first opportunity I have had to congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for coming back into the House after such a long day.  It is important to give him the opportunity to clarify his intentions in relation to community amenity grants, which were announced formally earlier this month but which had been notified informally to many groups last month.  Some of these were groups who had not been successful in their applications last year.  In particular, I wish to clarify whether the Minister is proposing a general review or whether we are talking about axing these grants entirely.  In the context of today's discussion at Question Time regarding a revised Book of Estimates, is this one of the negative provisions?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to take into account that my telephone has been ringing all day due to queries by my constituents about the reports in the national newspapers that these grants are being frozen.  Many of these people are involved in youth clubs, scouting associations and residents' associations and they have already begun planning in anticipation of receiving these grants.  I overheard on the monitor some of the Minister's remarks to the outgoing Minister in relation to the method of announcing these grants.  Perhaps some letters were not properly dotted and some ts not crossed, but that is standard practice. There is certainly a precedent on the other side of the House and it represents some of the corners that are cut in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> It is fundamentally important that we had made specific allocation for these grants in the context of a very severe budget which, perhaps, had certain electoral consequences.  There was a budgetary commitment and the Minister and the Taoiseach indicated today that essentially they would stick to our Book of Estimates.  The first priority of the Minister for the Environment is the provision of adequate services for the community. Many of the communities I represent are in great need and are under-served with community facilities.  I am asking the Minister to honour the commitment already given and ensure that this provision is protected and, if possible, expanded.  Last year, the first of its existence, it proved to be an immensely successful boost to all the local authorities in the provision of community facilities. It was also a most effective boost to employment.  The Minister's party in their pre-electoral document made certain commitments to the construction industry for expenditure of the order of £300 million.  I am asking that this comparatively minor figure of £3.7 million, which has the double advantage of giving a boost to construction and a major advantage to local communities in terms of facilities, should be honoured.  The Minister should fight hard to retain this figure and this commitment.</P>
    <P>Is his review intended to examine the nature of these proposals and ensure that they are bona fide?  I do not think there will be any problem in this respect because in the Dublin city area the vast bulk of them are sponsored by the local authority and are projects which the local authorities themselves were trying to fund out of smaller resources they take from the provision of other major services which it is their responsibility to provide.</P>
    <P>There are six major projects in my own area, two scout halls and a sport facility for a youth club being three of them.  I am sorry the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is not here because I know he and Deputy Michael Barrett would be able to back me up on the great need there is in a community such as Finglas south.  It has <Col N="349" /> been in existence for 15 or 17 years and the first community facility is being built there by a private businessman.  The local authority have yet to provide anything other than an open park in that area. These community grants were the first sign of hope.  These are communities which simply cannot raise funds for themselves.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Tunney was Minister of State at the Department of Education a £25,000 grant was made to a scout group. That was five years ago, but they were not able to go any further because they were unable to raise the funding.  In the interim they have raised a figure in the region of £20,000, but the building will cost £100,000.  The projected grant of £50,000 would have made it absolutely certain that they would be able to build this year, instead of running from school hall to school hall with hundreds of children providing one of the few facilities for young people in the area.  I know it is a large grant, but it is very much needed in this area.  The football club also need a grant, as do the residents' association who want to obtain £10,000 for the provision of water and sewerage.  There is also a need for a community hall in the Ballymun area, one of the most deprived areas in the whole country.  These are six projects in my constituency and I am sure every other TD could mention similar undertakings in his own area.</P>
    <P>I am asking that the commitment to these groups be honoured.  There is an element of social justice involved.  During the election campaign there was a justifiable question-mark over what many people saw as buying a pig in a poke in relation to the incoming Government's policies.  People were very much aware that they had not spelled out what they were going to do.  It is quite clear that their worries were justified.  In trying to make cuts, I suggest this is one area the Government should leave alone.  Some of the suggestions we put forward might be looked at, such as the axing of a couple of ministries of State, which would be a ongoing saving.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am unduly worried and the Minister will say this is a genuine review <Col N="350" /> to satisfy himself as to the nature of these projects.  Perhaps he anticipates being in a position to give the green light to most of the projects in the very near future.  I ask that the decision should be made speedily so that people will know where they stand.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty for her kind remarks.  A long day spent here is a great privilege.  It is because of the long days and long nights spent in other places that this long day is necessitated here.</P>
      <P>Amenity grants amounting to about £6 million were allocated to local authorities on 9 March 1987.  I took the decision to withdraw these grants because the Government are reviewing the financial provisions for the scheme in the context of the Department's overall estimates of expenditure for 1987 and having regard to the budgetary position generally.  That is the basic position.  My Department contacted the local authorities on 20 March notifying them that the scheme was under review and asked them not to take any action on foot of the Department's letter of 9 March.  The instruction was clear and explicit.  This was followed by an official letter from my Department on 23 March withdrawing the grants pending the review of the expenditure I mentioned.</P>
      <P>The grant allocations notified on 9 March included provisions totalling £2.143 million in respect of grants allocated the previous year but which could not be taken up because of the time factor.  There were, in addition, allocations amounting to nearly £4 million in respect of new projects.  The one specifically referred to by Deputy Flaherty was specifically provided for last year and I do not think she will be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projects involved in the allocations were of two kinds, those being undertaken by local authorities and those being undertaken by local groups under the general supervision of the local authorities. In notifying local authorities of the grant allocations on 9 March, they were asked to notify the local groups <Col N="351" /> involved of their relevant allocations. Accordingly, it should not have been possible for local groups to enter into any commitments based on the availability of grants prior to this date.  It appears, however, that the allocation decisions had, in fact, been made one month previously by the outgoing Minister and that letters issued to Fine Gael Deputies and councillors notifying them that grant approval for particular projects would be forthcoming.  This was blatant electioneering and any difficulties now being experienced by local groups is traceable solely to this improper conduct.</P>
    <P>In so far as some groups may have commenced work on their projects on the strength of the official letter of grant notification of 9 March, I am having inquiries made in my Department at present to ascertain the level of such occurences.  I have ascertained, however, that most local authorities had not notified the benefiting local groups of their allocations under the scheme at the time when they were asked to suspend such action.  In making any new allocations I will, of course, take all factors into account including the situation outlined by Deputy Flaherty and also that of any groups who can show that they entered into commitments following notification to them by the local authority of the allocation of a grant.  I can go no further than that at this stage.</P>
    <P>The action of the former administration in allocating these grants the day before going out of office was highly irresponsible and I do not like it.  Any responsible administration would have postponed the making of grant allocations until such time as the new Government had had a chance to examine the budgetary situation.  Accordingly, the blame for any difficulties rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the outgoing administration and, regrettably, on the outgoing Minister.</P>
    <P>The amenity grants scheme was introduced in 1986 to help meet the need for recreational facilities, particularly in urban areas experiencing social need and <Col N="352" /> rapidly expanding populations.  The original intention of the scheme was good. However, it degenerated into a political show in the light of the impending general election.  Over 130 projects were approved for grant assistance on 9 March but I regret that many of those projects fall far short of the original ideal and intent.  The public amenity value of some of the projects is questionable and I have them all here if anyone would like to read them.  Many of the allocations seem to reflect a desire to please certain sections of the electorate rather than revealing any commitment to meet genuine amenity needs.  I will go no further than to say that there are 88 schemes applied to the Dublin area alone and 13 counties could get no allocation whatsoever from the outgoing Minister.  That includes west Mayo which did not get a single application.</P>

I know that there was need for the grants and that it was a good idea originally but it strayed far from the original intent of the scheme. The outgoing Minister should be ashamed of himself.</P>
      <P>To summarise the points I have made, it is futile for Fine Gael Deputies to point to possible difficulties being experienced by local voluntary groups who may already have started work on projects or borrowed money on the strength of a commitment from their local Deputies or councillors.  The blame for any difficulties which may exist &mdash; I am not certain that they do &mdash; must rest with those who claimed political credit for allocations before they were officially made.</P>

    <P>It should not be assumed that the scheme has now ended.  Such a decision must await the outcome of the current budgetary deliberations.  However, it is my intention, as I have already stated, to carefully examine all applications for and <Col N="353" /> commitments to grant assistance under this scheme to ensure that the available funds will be channelled towards projects which are appropriate to the purpose of the scheme, namely to improve leisure and community facilities, especially in deprived areas.  They are the only areas which will get any grant allocations from me because that is what was intended when the scheme was formulated.</P>
    <P>Discussion of the amenity grants scheme does not arise here tonight, the real issue is that the Government are adopting a tough but responsible attitude to current economic difficulties.  In reviewing the expenditure allocations, they must suspend certain provisions until final budgetary decisions are made. This debate has arisen because certain politicians who exploited for their own purposes a scheme, which is of potentially <Col N="354" /> great benefit both in terms of providing recreational amenities and employment during the construction phase, are now trying to retrieve the situation for themselves at a time when they are faced with the justifiable dissatisfaction of those groups whose electoral favour they sought.  This was not well handled by the outgoing administration but I will try to retrieve it now.</P>

      <P>The plight of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union is a matter of continuing concern to the Irish Government. We believe that their treatment by the Soviet authorities is contrary to the human rights provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and other international commitments entered into by the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>In my view, the most effective framework to voice the Government's concern about the record of the Soviet Union in this area is provided by meetings held within the context of follow-up to the CSCE.  One such meeting opened in Vienna on 4 November 1986 and is still in session.  Its purpose is to review the extent to which the 35 signatory States have put into effect the provisions of the Final Act and to develop new measures to improve and strengthen implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish delegation at Vienna has already availed of the opportunity to express concern at breaches of these provisions by the participating States.  They have drawn particular attention to public and parliamentary concern in Ireland about the failure of the Soviet Union to permit Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue Jewish religious and cultural activities or to exercise their right to emigrate.  The delegation will continue to press for full implementation of all of the CSCE commitments by the participating States, <Col N="172" /> and, in particular, the provisions for human rights and fundamental freedoms and for human contacts.</P>

      <P>On 29 May 1986 separate warrants were issued against each of the brothers. The amount shown on each of the warrants was the full amount of the debt.

      <P>Late in the afternoon of 16 June 1986 the sum of £520.51 was paid to the Governor of Shelton Abbey and one of the brothers was released immediately. Given that there were separate warrants in existence against each brother for the sum of £520.51 it was not clear to the authorities at Shelton Abbey that the payment which had been made discharged both warrants.  They therefore attempted to contact the relevant District Court Office for clarification but this did not prove possible until the following morning.

    <P>For the person mentioned the financial reconstruction plan showed that viability <Col N="181" /> could be attained without the aid of the scheme; consequently he was deemed not to be in severe financial difficulty as defined by the scheme.  Accordingly the refund to the lending agency concerned of the portion of the cost of the interest rebate given to him was refused by my Department.  Additional information has now been submitted by the lending agency and, following consideration, a decision will be conveyed to the agency shortly.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who are permanently incapable of work, and who satisfy the contribution conditions.  One of the contribution conditions for invalidity pension is that the claimant has qualifying contributions in respect of not less than 156 contribution weeks of insurable employment since entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records there are only 125 such weeks of insurable employment registered in respect of the person concerned since his entry into insurance.  Therefore the person concerned is not entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>Similarly, disability benefit may only be paid for a period of 52 weeks where a person has less than 156 paid contributions.

The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 8 December 1986 and her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking employment.  She was notified accordingly on 26 February 1987.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance of her claim on 11 March 1987 and arrangements are being made to have her case submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit since 12 July 1985.  He is submitting medical certificates of incapacity each week from an approved medical certifier and is paid <Col N="192" /> benefit to the date of the last certificate received.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions of appointment of a medical certifier requires the certifier to complete and issue medical certificates of incapacity to claimants free-of-charge. The certifier is reimbursed separately from the Department in respect of medical certificates issued by him.  The conditions preclude the medical certifier from demanding or receiving a fee from the claimant for issuing a certificate but this does not preclude him from furnishing medical advice or treatment to the insured person at his request which may involve a fee.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 26 June 1985 to 18 March 1986 and from 2 July 1986 to date.</P>
      <P>He is not qualified for benefit as regulations provide that where a claimant has no contributions paid or credited for any two consecutive contribution years preceding his claim, he cannot qualify for payment of disability benefit, or the award of credited contributions in respect of periods of incapacity for work, until he has a further 26 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned has no contributions either paid or credited in the years from 1978-79 to date, and is not, therefore, entitled to payment of disability benefit, or the award of credited contributions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed and is in receipt of disability benefit since 22 December 1986.  Payment is currently issuing at the weekly rate of £45.80, the maximum rate payable to a married man with a dependent child, whose wife is working, earning more than £50 per week.  This rate consists of a personal rate of £41.10 plus half the increase in respect of a dependent child.  Pay-related benefit is also being issued at the weekly rate of £14.60</P>
      <P>The person concerned also made a claim for unemployment benefit which began on 20 November 1986.  However, as his claim began after 17 November 1986, he is not entitled to the special temporary payment in respect of his wife (either on that claim or the subsequent one for disability benefit).  This special payment was given as an alleviation measure to those who suffered a reduction in benefit under the implementation of equality legislation, i.e. a claimant who was in receipt of an adult dependant allowance prior to 17 November 1986.  Therefore as the person concerned was not receiving benefit before the introduction of equality he is not entitled to the temporary alleviation payment or to the special treatment payment.</P>
      <P>Payment is being issued at regular weekly intervals on receipt of medical evidence and all benefit payable has been issued to 9 March 1987.</P>

    <P>She appealed against the disallowance on 16 January 1986 and, arising from contentions raised by her in support of her appeal, her papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.

    <P>She is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £22.75 being the maximum rate payable in her case of £33 less means of £10.25, from 20 October 1986 increased to £25.75 from 10 December 1986.  Payment of arrears due will be made this week and further weekly payments of £25.75 will continue as they become due.</P>

Following investigation of his means by a social welfare officer his claim was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding, exceeded the maximum rate payable in his case.

      <P>He appealed against this decision and forwarded statements from her employer stating that she was in receipt of less than £50 per week.

    <P>The council's 1987 small water and sewerage schemes programme contains <Col N="223" /> proposals for 28 small schemes.  When their programme has been examined it will be a matter for the local authority to select the schemes from within the approved programme which they wish to carry out having regard to the available capital.</P>

      <P>The reply to a Private Notice Question on this matter on 25 November last gave details of action taken during the initial stage of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident.  Since then, Cork County Council has continued to deploy protective booms outside the marine reserve at Lough Hyne and to remove oil from affected beaches.  At this stage, there is no evidence of a continuing leakage of oil from the vessel's tanks and the small quantities of oil still coming ashore are believed to be attributable to oil remobilised from rocks, or the dislodgement of oil which had been trapped within the vessel.  Accordingly, Cork County Council has now begun a final clean-up operation of the affected shoreline in anticipation of the tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of oil and any other pollutant from the vessel is being actively <Col N="230" /> pursued by my colleague, the Minister for Communications.  The owners and insurers of the vessel failed to meet the deadline set for the submission of detailed proposals in this regard, notwithstanding a direction under the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977.  Accordingly, the Department of Communications are at present making arrangements for the removal of any oil and other pollutant material which may be on the vessel.</P>

      <P>The application in question was considered by the social employment scheme monitoring committee and approved by my Department in November 1986.</P>
      <P>However, in order to remain within the budget provided for the social employment scheme in 1987 regional participation quotas have been allocated. Consequently new projects and participants may commence only when sufficient numbers of current participants complete their term of employment under the scheme.  I am, however, confident that this project should be able to commence within the next three months.</P>

The person stated that she was interested in participating in the enterprise allowance scheme.  However, at that time, because of budgetary constraints, a quota system of recruitment onto the enterprise scheme was in operation. The person concerned was advised that the earliest date she could be accepted onto the scheme would probably be in January 1987 and that she should apply at that time.  If and when an application is received, it will be considered in the normal way.</P>

      <P>In order to eliminate any wasteful and unnecessary expenditure in this area of the long term illness scheme, the Eastern Health Board decided to quantify the maximum number of disposable syringes <Col N="236" /> and needles to be dispensed to diabetics. Accordingly, from 1 January 1987 the maximum numbers of disposable syringes and needles supplied free of charge in normal circumstances, under the long term illness scheme are:</P>
      <P>1.  Disposable syringe with integrated needle format &mdash; 30 per patient per month.</P>
      <P>2.  Disposable syringe with detachable needle format &mdash; 16 syringes plus 56 needles per patient per month.</P>
      <P>This decision was taken following full consultation by the board with diabetes specialists.</P>
      <P>The consensus of medical opinion is that a disposable syringe and/or needle can be safely reused on a number of occasions.  The reuse of disposable syringes is considered safe as long as usual basic precautions are taken, i.e. the needle is kept covered and the used syringe and needle are kept in a cool place, such as a refrigerator.  Some experts suggest that syringes and needles could in fact be safely reused dozens of times.  The Eastern Health Board policy means that, at most, one syringe and/or needle will be used four times in all.</P>

      <P>The preparation of tender documentation in respect of the proposed extension to the national school referred to is nearing completion.  When this documentation is available the question of invitation of tenders for the project will then arise for consideration subject to the usual review of enrolment trends.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to say when building works may commence. The delay in this case was due to the large number of projects at various stages of architectural planning which were in hands.</P>

      <P>The standard of service which is available to the pupils of the new Vocational School in Enniscorthy is considered adequate in the context of the general operation of the post-primary school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy is already aware, my Department would be prepared to consider relocating the central boarding and set-down point so that it would be generally equidistant between the post-primary schools.  This would be subject to the agreement of the schools concerned in consultation with the transport liaison officer and CIE.</P>

      <P>The school has currently a staff considerably in excess of normal quota.  Furthermore, there has been a significant decline in enrolments since the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other schools, the staffing of this school for 1987-88 will be reviewed shortly and my Department will <Col N="244" /> communicate with the school authorities in the matter.</P>
    <P>The school building referred to by the Deputy was, I understand, provided in 1979, having been designed by consultants in private practice engaged by the school authorities.  It has been explained to the chairperson of the board of management that it is a matter for the school authorities to approach the consultants in the first instance for their views and recommendations.  It would be open to the school authorities in certain circumstances to apply to my Department for grant assistance towards the cost of necessary works, but that aspect of the matter would not arise for consideration until the consultants' report has been fully considered.</P>
