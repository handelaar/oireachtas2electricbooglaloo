Arising out of the Minister's reply with regard to legislation promised and to an earlier undertaking by the Taoiseach in the carry-over of business agreed by all parties in the last Dáil, surely the Minister for the Environment is in a position to inform the House when the Building Control Bill, 1984 will be resumed in this House?  That is the framework of legislation within which the regulations governing, among other things, the problem to which Deputy G. Mitchell referred, can be given legal status.  Is the Minister for the Environment in a position to indicate when that Bill &mdash; which had been given a considerable degree of parliamentary time &mdash; will be reintroduced in this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the substance of the matter my main concern is that services should be available, and that we should so provide, for those who are unable to pay.  If we establish the principle that fees will be chargeable for the advisory services it will be improper to let this Bill go through the House without having full assurances that those who are unable to pay will still be able to have access to those services.  I am thinking in particular of the small farmers and those in serious financial difficulty.  It seems that those are the two categories which, more than anybody else need the services of the ACOT advisers.  It would be very detrimental to the future of agriculture if people did not have access to those services because they are unable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced by the last Government a commitment was given that there would be no question of the general body of farmers being charged for agricultural advice.  It was <Col N="2347" /> made clear by that Government that any scale of charges proposed by ACOT would not be approved unless the requirement in relation to those unable to pay was catered for.  When the Bill was reintroduced by the present Government that commitment was not included in the opening statement of the Minister and that is basically the reason I put down these amendments.</P>
    <P>From the techncial point of view &mdash; I am now focusing on amendment No. 1 &mdash; I notice that the Bill provides that ACOT may charge, vary, receive and recover fees for advisory services and that the Minister can vary any such scale of fees or the conditions relating to the charging or variation of any such proposed fees.  It strikes me that if ACOT are to be given power to charge, vary, receive and recover fees they should also be empowered specifically in the Bill to lay down terms and conditions relating to the charging or variation of any such proposed fees.  This is purely a technical point I am raising in the interest of ensuring that the Bill is in proper form.  This is not a substantive point and the Minister may have a reply that will satisfy my technical concerns.</P>
    <P>On the substantive point, the proposal I am making is that the Minister who, under the terms of the Bill as it stands, may vary the amount of any such proposed fees or variations or any such proposed terms and conditions, will not do so unless he is satisfied that such terms and conditions make adequate provision for those who are unable to pay.  I want a specific provision included in the Bill to cover those who are unable to pay.  I also want a provision that if ACOT in their scheme of fees do not provide for those who are unable to pay it will be incumbent on the Minister to specifically reject such a scheme of fees unless and until such provision is made for those who are unable to pay.  That is the focus of my argument.  I asked the Minister on Second Stage to give the kind of assurances I am seeking in relation to those who are unable to pay but I was not fully satisfied <Col N="2348" /> that the point was covered in the Minister's reply and on that basis I felt it necessary to put down an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me take the point of various Deputies' contributions, in particular Deputy O'Keeffe's, in regard to their anxiety in the matter of payment for advisory services provided by ACOT. Deputy O'Keeffe expressed the view that certain categories of farmers such as those on low incomes, in particular those with underdeveloped holdings and those in disadvantaged areas and also those in financial difficulties, should be exempted from any charges.  I have, as promised, considered these matters in the meantime. The Bill does not in any way rule out such exemptions.  It is purely an enabling Bill which leaves the nature and details of any proposed charges to be drawn up by ACOT and submitted for ministerial approval.  It is precisely the same Bill as that introduced by the previous Government to meet a situation where not all farmers would be charged. There is therefore no necessity for any amendment to provide specifically for exemptions to be allowed in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Administrative arrangements could of course be made to provide for the situation which Deputy O'Keeffe desires. However, the operation of a means test or other mechanism to identify those who are deemed unable to afford the payment of charges would obviously create exceptional administrative difficulty and lead to endless appeals.  This would clearly be counter productive to ACOT's main objective of assisting farm development.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the conclusion of Second Stage, it should be quite possible for ACOT to devise a scheme which would provide various options for obtaining advisory services and which would take account of the various categories of farmers and the particular needs of each category. I have no doubt that in this way provision can be made to cater for those farmers with low incomes and those in severe financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2349" /> ACOT's work brings them into close and trusted relationships with farmers at all income levels.  The service, with its special expertise, should, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, be in a position to formulate a scheme or a system which would take due account of the needs of such farmers.  I am opposed to laying down advanced prescriptions which would pre-empt ACOT's freedom to devise proposals which they consider are most appropriate. I can, however, give the House an assurance that when the question of approval of ACOT's proposals arises, due account will be taken of the position of low income farmers and farmers in financial difficulty, with the object of enabling them to continue to have access to the advisory services of ACOT.  The general thrust of this Bill, now as when it was originally introduced, is to raise income from those farmers who are able to pay and from those who are benefiting most from the services provided.  I made the point on Second Stage that a substantial number of farmers are earning very large sums of money and benefiting to a considerable extent from ACOT.  It is that category of farmer on which the Bill focuses.</P>
    <P>This is purely enabling legislation to allow ACOT to earn income from farmers deriving most benefit and from those who are in a position to pay for that service.  In times of financial stringency, additional income from farmers who can afford to pay will have the effect of providing a more comprehensive overall service and thereby be of considerable help to farmers in the category about which Deputy O'Keeffe and his colleagues are concerned.  The additional income will allow ACOT to focus on programmes of advice, on seminars, leaflets, radio programmes, telephone exchange of information with individual farmers and so on.  Without this additional income ACOT would be in a worse position and would be unable to provide the kind of service for the farmers we are particularly concerned about.  On 10 April 1986, the then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, when <Col N="2350" /> introducing the Bill said at column 481 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless there is no doubt that there are a number of farms, whether operated by individuals, firms, or other bodies, which are at a high level of development and generating good profits. It is eminently reasonable that those with such farms should be required to contribute an appropriate share to the cost of ACOT's professional services which are of financial benefit to their farm businesses.</P>
    <P>While this legislation will enable ACOT to charge for advisory services it also provides that any such charges and the criteria on which they are based will be subject to prior approval of the Minister for Agriculture.  Furthermore, should the Minister consider, in the light of changing circumstances, that any fees or charges should be varied or, indeed, terminated, the legislation will enable him to direct ACOT to vary or terminate them.</P>
    <P>Some may think that the introduction of charges will be a disincentive to some farmers to seek advice and I am, of course, conscious of this possibility. There will be full consultation between my Department and ACOT prior to the introduction of any charges regarding their level and the criteria to be used in their formulation.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies now.  It is only right, proper and appropriate that those able to pay and those benefiting most from the service should contribute.  Their contribution will be of immense benefit to farmers in the less well off category. I can assure the House that, following consultations with ACOT, when the question of the approval of the scheme of ACOT services comes up, due account will be taken of the position of low income farmers, those who are in severe financial difficulty and those who are on low incomes because of their location.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 16, after &ldquo;fees&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" />&ldquo;,and may set terms and conditions relating to the charging and variation of such proposed fees,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe there is not a real need for the inclusion of this amendment because subsection (3) (b) already provides &ldquo;... and any terms and conditions ... of any such proposed fees shall be subject to the prior approval of the Minister,&rdquo;.  It is clearly implied that ACOT may accept terms and conditions and there is no need to make expressed provision for it.  The simple object of the subsection is to give ACOT power to make charges.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 25, after &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;, and who will do so unless he is satisfied that such terms and conditions make adequate provision for those who are unable to pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this amendment on the grounds that it is unnecessary, inappropriate, and in practice unworkable.  It is unworkable chiefly because it would introduce the concept of persons &ldquo;unable to pay&rdquo; into the Act.  The determination of those who are unable to pay is a matter of subjective judgment.  The amendment would impose on the Minister an obligation to discriminate between different individuals without clearly specifying objective grounds on which such discrimination can be made.  The law officers advise me that this could lead to endless claims, and possibly litigation, by persons claiming they come within the description of &ldquo;unable to pay&rdquo;.  It could be open to objections on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>It is inappropriate because the setting and periodic revision of charges to take account of the economic situation in farming or among certain categories of farmers can more effectively be done by administrative means for which the Minister can provide in the context of his powers of approval, which are very flexible. I have said they can be terminated in the light of improving financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary because the Minister <Col N="2352" /> has ample powers in the approval of proposed changes to see that suitable provision is made to meet the position of farmers of limited means who should not, in the overall public interest, be excluded from availing of ACOT's advisory service. It is significant that the previous Government, who had indicated their intention that charges would not apply to all farmers, were quite satisfied with the provisions of the present Bill.  The provisions in that Bill were deemed to be adequate and not to need any amendment.</P>
    <P>I therefore propose that the amendment be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the substantial point the Minister is moving closer to my position.  I take the point that he does not want to insert this into the Bill but essentially what I have been seeking is a commitment from this Government about how they will deal with those who are unable to pay &mdash; small farmers, farmers in the disadvantaged areas, farmers on low incomes and those in financial difficulty.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is enabling legislation. As I said, the Minister appears to be moving closer to my position when he says the Bill does not rule out the kind of exemptions I have mentioned.  In a negative sense that is going part of the way to meet me.  He also said the Minister will take account of the position of those on low incomes and those in severe financial difficulties when the question of approval of the ACOT scheme of charges comes up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to come a little closer on this.  If he cannot accept my proposal that there should be a specific provision in the Bill to cater for those on low incomes, in financial difficulties and those who are unable to pay, let us go back to the reason I felt it necessary to put down this amendment.  When the Bill was introduced by the previous Government, a specific commitment was given that an ACOT scheme of charges would not be approved unless such scheme of charges was restricted to those who could afford them.  We can resolve this problem if I <Col N="2353" /> can wring a commitment from the Minister in similar terms because although the Minister quoted extensively from the speech of former Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, when he originally introduced the Bill in 1986, he did not touch on that portion of his speech.  I am worried the Minister seems to be avoiding this point.  Bluntly, if I can secure a commitment, even in political terms, from the Government that a scheme of charges will not be approved unless it restricts charges to an appropriate payment from those who can afford to pay, then I will be satisfied.  If the Minister can give me that assurance, I will have achieved my objective.</P>
    <P>I know discussions have already taken place as to how one would set objective criteria as to who could afford payments.  I understand the adjusted acreage system was suggested which would provide a very definite definition of a small farmer.  There was a suggestion that those with less than 40 adjusted acres should be exempt from charges but yet have full access to the services.  There was also a discussion as to how one would cater for those in severe financial difficulties and I accept the Minister's point that it would be hard to specify in statutory form the criteria which would designate someone as being in serious financial difficulty. However, the Minister can give a positive and specific political commitment and, knowing him as I do, if I can secure such a commitment I will be satisfied he will ensure it is carried out.  The Minister said he did not rule out such exemptions and that due account would be taken of them but I want him to make a positive commitment that any scheme of fees or charges produced by ACOT for approval will not be passed unless such charges are restricted to an appropriate payment from those who can afford them.</P>
    <P>I accept that an amendment to the Bill in the form I propose is not the ideal way of securing a commitment but it was the only course open to me as my requests on Second Stage were not fully met in the Minister's reply.  In regard to amendment No. 1, the Minister says that because <Col N="2354" /> there is a reference to terms and conditions in subsection (b) the implication is there that ACOT can, in drawing up such a scheme of fees, impose such terms and conditions.  Why leave it to implication? If there is a specific enabling power in the Bill to allow ACOT to draw up charges, to vary them and to receive and recover fees, it would be sensible in the legal sense to give them power to impose such terms and conditions as they consider appropriate before presenting a scheme to the Minister for approval.  It is purely a technical point and if the Minister and his advisers are satisfied that such power is not necessary I will accept it.  I put down the amendment more in the interests of good order than of making a substantive point.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to deal with the problem in the manner which I outlined as it would allay the fears of the small farmers and those in financial difficulties if they had the assurance about the charges. It would be disastrous if they were unable to have access to the advisory services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of my colleagues' amendment, I should like to inquire if the proposed scheme of charges will be applied on a nationwide basis or if they will be strictly the reserved function of ACOT in a particular county or area.  My concern obviously springs from the fact that those most in need of the advisory services, the small farmers or those in financial difficulties, will suffer unless the scheme is applied on a nationwide basis.  The fact that some farmers seeking advice from ACOT live in what is commonly regarded as the most affluent areas does not necessarily mean that they themselves are affluent.  I should like clarification as to how it is proposed to operate this scheme by way of qualification for hardship clauses and so on.</P>

      <P>Are the charges to be imposed at the discretion of ACOT instead of the Minister?  Will ACOT decide the category of farmer who will pay?  Will the Minister satisfy the House that the farmer who cannot afford to pay <Col N="2355" /> will not suffer as a result and that he will get equal attention from ACOT advisers as his counterpart who is paying a charge? Does the Minister intend giving <i>carteblanche</i> to ACOT to levy charges at whatever rate they think fit and, if so, what protection will there be for the small farmer and the person who will not be in the position to pay those charges?  Will he be put for ever more into a category in which he will not get any further instruction from the agricultural advisers?  I would like the Minister to answer those questions because he was critical along these lines when the Bill was first introduced in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the concern of Deputies in relation to the ability of farmers to pay these charges. Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Sheehan represent a constituency much of which is inhabited by farmers who are in disadvantaged areas and who obviously could not have this imposed upon them. As public representatives of that area we do our best.  Because of the extreme difficulties of the farming community in Deputy Sheehan's part of the constituency Deputy O'Keeffe and myself have occasionally helped him out.  We are in a better position than most to appreciate the difficulties of farmers in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of this legislation is to allow agriculture to develop in a rational way, to allow ACOT to maintain their level of services and to insist that farmers who are in a position to pay and who can afford to pay will contribute, thereby allowing ACOT to give a more comprehensive service.  Some farmers are making substantial profits.  Recent surveys undertaken by An Foras Talúntais reveal that several thousand farmers are making in excess of £25,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage debate of this Bill on 10 April 1986, Deputy Sheehan said:</P>
      <P>The Bill as a whole does not in any way curb agricultural output.  The charges are in keeping with charges made on other sections of the community. The wording of the Bill leaves ample room so that the Minister can ensure that charges are not imposed on farmers who are not in a position to pay and I was glad of the assurance given by the Minister in his opening remarks.  I accept the fundamental principles of the Bill, provided hard cases are sympathetically considered and aided by the Minister and future Ministers.</P>
      <P>I accept that, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the commitment I want to get from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Sheehan's concern that that category of farmers should be dealt with sympathetically. Of course, I can give that assurance to Deputy Sheehan and his colleagues.  I assure the House that allowance will be made in the scheme of charges for services where payment would cause any undue difficulty for any category of farmer in any part of the country.  To allay Deputy Durkan's fears this will not be confined to any geographical location. I accept that in areas designated as disadvantaged there are farmers with considerable incomes, whereas in nondesignated areas there are farmers who are put in the pin of their collar to eke out a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers in severe financial difficulties have gone through a pretty hard time <Col N="2357" /> over the past number of years.  I give an assurance that a national scheme will be drawn up by ACOT in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food subject to the approval of the Minister and that if the charges would impose any difficulty on any sector of the farming community, or if they were contrary to the best interests of agricultural development, they will not apply.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the whole thrust of this Bill is to get some income from a sector of the farming community who can well afford to pay.  They are already paying for visits by officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food in relation to grants and they are paying veterinary fees for visitations.  Therefore, I see no reason why people who are benefiting from particular services should have the general taxpayers paying entirely for them.</P>
    <P>To Deputies who expressed their genuine concern for farmers who would have difficulty in paying for these services, I categorically give an assurance that, when this scheme is being drawn up with ACOT, there will be no question of anybody having to pay where undue difficulty will be created for them.  I see no difficulty in the same spirit applying to this legislation as applied when it was introduced and when these sentiments were expressed by the then Minister, Deputy Hegarty.  I hope this assurance will be sufficient to allay the genuine concerns expressed by my colleagues in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much happier now that I have secured from the Minister the assurances which he has just given. We have almost resolved this problem.  I am working on the basis that we have an assurance from the Minister that there will be a provision in the scheme that those for whom difficulty would be created will continue to receive services without having to pay for them.  Essentially that is what I am looking for.  As I said on Second Stage I have to accept the principle that those who can afford to pay should pay some reasonable and appropriate payment.  I am satisfied with this provided the political commitment made <Col N="2358" /> by the Minister is fully implemented and the position of small farmers, those with no incomes and those in serious financial difficulties is fully catered for.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful, to finalise the matter, if the Minister could give us a preliminary indication of his thinking on what the charges would be and what terms and conditions would apply to them.  Has any thought been given to the specifics or have any discussions taken place with ACOT?  I know the Bill provides that ACOT will draw up the scheme of charges and then present it to the Minister for approval.  I presume in practical terms this probably means that there have been discussions between ACOT and the Department.  It would be helpful at this stage if the Minister could give an indication of how things are going: what level of charges is under discussion, what terms and conditions would apply and, in particular, what level of exemption has the Minister now in mind?  How does he now propose to implement the political commitment he has given in relation to the allowance which is to be made for those who are unable to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have taken place between the Department of Agriculture and Food and ACOT.  As the responsible agency, ACOT have been asked to draw up a set of proposals which the Minister will go through in detail and he can then either approve, amend or vary them as he sees fit.  To date ACOT have not been asked to come back to the Department with their proposals because it was felt it would be appropriate to have this legislation enacted before doing so.  Therefore, at this stage I am not in a position to go into detail but I can assure Members that as soon as this legislation goes through the House ACOT will have discussions with the Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food in relation to the package of advisory services they will provide to the farming community following which an appropriate package of advisory services will be made available to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> As I said, the general thrust of the package will be to allow agricultural development to continue and to be accelerated, and to ensure that the most comprehensive package of advisory services will be made available.  I think farmers will be sensible enough to make the most of the advisory services under the new arrangements.  I know for certain that ACOT will use their best advisers to the best possible extent.  As I said, farmers like other citizens are now paying for various services and they will pay at an appropriate level for the services which are of benefit to them.  Therefore, ACOT will have to ensure that their personnel are up-to-date with modern developments in farming and that they will be able to compete with the many consultancy services which are available and used extensively by the farming community.</P>
    <P>This legislation will ensure that the advisory officers around the country will be on top of their jobs and up-to-date with the most efficient techniques and technologies available to the farming community and will carry Irish farming into the next century keeping it on a par with developments in the European Communities.  It will also ensure that our farmers will have the back-up services which are essential in modern agriculture in order to allow them to compete successfully with the Danes, the Dutch and their other competitors in Europe.  I have no doubt that the scheme of advisory services which will be drawn up by ACOT in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food will be an appropriate package and will not cause hardship to any sector of the farming community, either those who will have to pay or those who will not be in a position to pay.  It will also provide an improved and enhanced service appropriate and contemporary to the developments which are taking place in agriculture at present.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  in the case of an urban district council, one which is operating in its administrative area as a controlling, <Col N="2364" /> licensing and monitoring authority, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason I put down this amendment was that certain problems have arisen recently in Listowel regarding the control of both water and air pollution.  Unfortunately the local urban district council seem to have been singled out by the local people because of the lack of control and proper monitoring of both water and air pollution.  Under the present legislation the urban council have no authority to act.  It seems a contradiction that while the urban council are the planning permission authority, nevertheless they are not the licensing authority.  This certainly has been the case in Listowel, where the urban district council are experiencing problems at present with an industrial plant which is burning material from Birmingham in England which would not be allowed to be burned there because of local controls.  The urban council are totally powerless to act.  I realise that if the urban district council were to be effective in monitoring air pollution they would need a great deal of expertise.  However, I feel the local resident engineer could provide the service and fulfil this function to some extent.  I feel that local urban councils should have a much greater say and should act in conjunction with the county council or local authority in monitoring local plants.  Could I point out that the urban council would be more aware and have greater local feedback on what is happening as most of the problems arise from plants located within their area.  I would like the Minister to consider this request as I am sure this matter is a source of much concern not only in Listowel but in the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for making his contribution on this section.  He spoke with conviction and I can understand his dilemma in the matter.  I appreciate the local concerns which have prompted him to put down this amendment.  We have already received in writing Deputy Deenihan's detailed case on Listowel Urban District <Col N="2365" /> Council, making the point which he has uttered for them here today.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not exclude the possibility of an urban district council exercising control or functions under this legislation.  Section 21 will allow the Minister by order to assign functions to a person or a body of persons other than the county councils and major urban authorities who will normally be the principal authorities operating under the Bill. If a convincing case can be made to the Minister of the day that a particular urban council would be better fitted than the county council to administer the Bill in its own area, then it will be possible for the Minister to accept that case and make the transfer order.  I would see no objection to that in particular circumstances where a good case can be made. However, the Bill establishes as normal practice, except for major urban areas, that the county council's functions will extend over the whole of the administrative county.  This is following the trend of all major environmental and local government legislation over the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act of 1977, the Waste Management Regulation of 1978 and the Fire Services Act of 1981 have worked reasonably well without any great difficulty.  The rationale behind the trend is that specialised environmental legislation often embodying EC related provisions will make more complex demands on local authorities in terms of staffing and equipment. It would be unrealistic in the majority of cases to expect urban district councils to be able to meet the demands that will be placed upon them in a satisfactory way or without excessively burdening their commercial ratepayers.  I am very conscious of that.  If they were to be designated without taking cognisance of their financial difficulties, we could end up with the Act not being utilised in the way intended.  Accordingly, reluctantly I cannot accept the amendment which is expressed generally by the Deputy.  It would immediately burden all urban district councils with complex regulatory duties under this Act.  I am not convinced <Col N="2366" /> that they are geared for it, either staffwise or from a financial point of view.  It is possible in certain circumstances, if the position so dictates, that the Minister can transfer the power under the Act to an urban district council.  While I understand the conviction with which the Deputy has made his case, I ask him to take it in good faith that this is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Certainly, I understand the problems that would be involved if this function were given to the urban councils. Indeed, it will be very difficult for the county councils to implement the regulations proposed.  That will involve much more staffing and procedure than previously experienced.  However, it is very important &mdash; and I am glad the Minister made the point &mdash; that the local urban council can play a very significant role in ensuring the success of this Air Pollution Bill.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it is very important to be on the spot to monitor what has happened. By the time the local authority officers get to the source of the pollution it may be cleared away, be it air or water pollution.  The reason then may not be too evident.  Local observation and evidence can be very important in bringing about prosecutions.  This has been the experience in Listowel where the urban council have had a very frustrating time in trying to deal with a local problem.  In withdrawing my proposed amendment, I fully appreciate the difficulties that would be involved if this function were granted to the urban councils.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for understanding the position as outlined to him.  He is quite right; it will even cause some difficulties for county councils but these are not insurmountable.  As far as I am concerned, it would be the responsibility of those local authorities to appoint special people to carry out the tasks that will be necessary under this legislation. This cannot be done unless they are prepared to co-operate in that way.  I expect they will appoint the necessary special people to carry out surveys so that those <Col N="2367" /> special control area orders can be put in place if demanded under the legislation. I expect full co-operation and it has already been indicated to me that that co-operation will be available from county councils and major authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), line 28, to delete &ldquo;or in a case of urgency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The background to amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 is the considerable disquiet expressed during the Bill's Seanad passage that the power of entry to private dwellings contained in section 14 is excessive.  In moving Second Stage of the Bill in the House, I undertook to examine whether there was any way to reconcile the need for inspection under the Bill with the right to privacy in one's own dwelling.  I regard that as being an important matter.  The spokesperson opposite will remember that during Second Stage contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments have been drawn up to offer some moderation in response to the commitment I gave on the provisions of section 14 in relation to private dwellings.  Amendment No. 3 will remove the immediate power of entry without agreement of the householder in a case of urgency.  That might be important. To balance this concession to domestic privacy, amendment No. 4 provides that entry may take effect following 24 hours' rather than 28 hours' notice.  Finally, in amendment No. 5 it is intended to make it clearer that the powers of an authorised person upon entry must be <Col N="2368" /> exercised with discretion.  I regard that as important.  Any time anybody gains entry into the private dwelling of an individual he or she must do it with discretion; that is the reason for amendment No. 5.  I should like to think Deputies agree with the benefit of these amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 14 now strikes the right balance between the requirements of meaningful supervision of the Bill and the rights of householders.  I have been very conscious, in considering this and in having consultations with individuals on this matter, of the need to try to get that right balance in so far as the privacy of one's domestic dwelling and the need for entry so as to establish what has to be done by way of remedy are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone some way towards allaying the fears of Members of this House who expressed concern in relation to the whole sensitive question of entry into private dwellings. I still have, at the back of my mind, a niggling doubt as to whether we have the correct balance between the right of the private dweller, with the sensitivity of this whole area, and the common good. Have we sufficient power to take immediate action if there is reason to believe a private dwelling is causing pollution or nuisance and where a local authority or an authorised person think action is required?  In my view 24 hours notice is a long time if serious pollution is being caused by a private dwelling.  I accept the Minister is trying to get the balance right between entry to a private house and reasonable notice but I should like to get an assurance from him that in the event of serious pollution the powers that be will not have to stand aside for 24 hours before they can deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  We have to get the balance right.  If there is a nuisance that must be attended to immediately and if there is no objection by the party involved entry will take place there and then.  It is only where a serious objection is raised that it is necessary to give some time.  In the case of a major nuisance such as that <Col N="2369" /> referred to by the Deputy, the right of entry can be immediate under Part II of the Bill.  That provision allows for immediate inspection.  It was while we were wrestling with that balance and trying to accommodate the views of Members that some of them felt that what we were doing was too excessive.  In the Seanad and in this House concern was expressed that we were taking powers over and above the norm, particularly when we were interfering with a traditional right that people have valued very highly.  The provision may not satisfy everyone but in my view it is a nice balance. The Deputy can rest easy because it is not the intention to diminish the power of the legislation.  However, we want to give that little bit of flexibility to accommodate the right of people to their own property.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed largely to satisfy concerns expressed by the Coal Information Services that the Bill did not clearly enough require local authorities to identify the source of air pollution in an area before proposing an order under section 39.  This amendment adds to the list of considerations to which local authorities must have regard before making the order.  It makes it quite explicit that the first factor for consideration is the incidence and cause of air pollution in the area.  I hope the amendment will satisfy those who advocated it and that proposed orders under this section will be subject to fair standards of justification.  I have spoken to the people involved in this matter and I hope they will accept this as a reasonable response to what they thought was a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very reasonable in trying to meet this body's difficulties with certain sections of the Bill to date.  It is quite reasonable to assume that if there is a major problem in a localised area, it need not necessarily be the type of fuel used which is causing it at any specific time.  Even without this amendment, I have no doubt that a local authority would be in a position to be able to consider the situation sufficiently to recognise if pollution was caused by an isolated incident with an industrial plant or by the type of fuel being used and would be able to proceed accordingly. The amendment proposed by the Minister clarifies the matter and if it <Col N="2373" /> serves to give peace of mind and some comfort to the professional body concerned, provided fair standards are used all round, it is very reasonable and I have no problem in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great difficulty in many cases in identifying a source of pollution in specific areas because pollution can cover over certain boundaries and can actually move from one area to the next.  For instance, in the case of certain areas in our capital city where pollution levels are very high, for example, in the Ballyfermot area, which is a densely populated region with a high rate of burning coal, or the Rathmines area where pollution levels are particularly high, adjoining areas can be affected by pollution.  From a practical point of view, it would be very difficult for a local authority to identify the particular source of the pollution because one cannot control air flows or air passages. Perhaps one can have some measure of control or monitoring in still air, but certainly when wind is blowing, which is quite common in our country, it is quite impractical to be obliged to identify actual sources of pollution.  This amendment is perhaps being written in to satisfy a demand.  I can understand and appreciate that fully but from a practical point of view I do not see how a local authority can pinpoint the source of pollution.  It could finish up being argued in court that a local authority are incapable of identifying a particular source of pollution because air disperses and pollution disperses and it is almost impossible to pinpoint a source of pollution particularly when other contaminents become intermingled with air flows in adjoining areas. A lot of this can fudge the issue so sooner or later we will have to grasp the nettle and face up to the fact that the local authority will have to be directed to control pollution rather than just having something as loosely defined as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of smokeless zones in other cities demanded that a directive was given to create these smokeless zones.  I feel quite strongly about this. <Col N="2374" /> We are really only tinkering with the problem rather than grasping the nettle and getting down to defining where locations of pollution exist.  Until our capital city and other cities are created smokeless zones, trying to define and identify where there are pollution levels in small areas, means that there will be a grave danger that this most important legislation will become inoperable.  This is not the Minister's intention, but we have examples of important environmental pollution legislation not being enforced primarily due to the fact that the legislation is not directive, that it is only enabling legislation.  The legislation should have teeth.  It should be directive. In the matter of obliging a local authority to define from where pollution actually came, this legislation will be difficult to enforce.  I would like if the Minister would give serious consideration to this part of the legislation.  Perhaps my judgment is coloured by the fact that I have doubts about the enforceability of this legislation but I would like the Minister to give an assurance that he is content that the legislation can fulfil the long term objective, even if this is just the first rung on the ladder, of creating clean air and a smokeless zone for our capital city rather than just tampering with small aspects of pollution which will be impossible to control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to elaborate on how this amendment might affect the concerns expressed by Deputy Brady.  We are assuming we are talking about Dublin and if we get to the point of establishing a special control area it will probably be in Dublin, but we must remember that the Bill could apply at some stage to any part of the country.  If there was a problem with air pollution in area A to such an extent that action was needed, it would be quite reasonable for the local authority in area A to look at an industrial plant in area B which could be unduly polluting area A.  That could be the cause of a serious health problem in area A, rather than the type of fuel in use in that area.  It is not likely to be the only cause of the problem but it is <Col N="2375" /> possible that an industrial plant could be causing problems of such an extent.  This legislation allows for retrospection but in practice existing plants will not be brought under the regulations for some years due to practical difficulties.  Where an existing plant is causing a problem in a neighbouring area it is reasonable that a local authority should control that specific problem before seeking to impose a special control area order.</P>
      <P>If there is any question that this amendment could be seen as a let-out or as weakening the ability of a local authority or of the Minister to impose such control area order in a case where such was needed because of the type of fuel being burnt, that should be explained by the Minister.  We need his assurance that this amendment will not weaken the Bill, particularly Part IV.  The discussion on special control areas has been emotive and there are major fears.  Householders have fears because alternative types of fuel are expensive and those representing coal interests worry about the future.  All we should be concerned about in debating this Bill is how we can best manage and control our air quality.  These other aspects are relevant for consideration but they must not be allowed to impinge on the outcome or effectiveness of the Bill. This amendment seems reasonable, provided it will not prevent the implementation of special control areas orders where they are deemed necessary by any local authority or Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The special control areas orders can apply to all types of business, not to domestic houses.  A whole range of operations will be covered.  Deputies Brady and Doyle have been talking about the problems caused by transboundary pollution.  That is what the thrust of this amendment is about.  We must try to trace in the first instance the causes of pollution.  It would not seem just and fair to confirm an order without having the necessary survey work undertaken. Emissions from a particular type of operation miles away might be the cause of a certain level of pollution in a housing <Col N="2376" /> area, due to wind velocity or direction. The use of domestic coal tops up the problem and the pollution level goes over the limit, thus causing an order to be placed.  One would have to commission a detailed survey to establish where the causes of the pollution arise.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Brady's view that the legislation should have teeth.  There is not much point in passing legislation if it does not contain the necessary powers or will not be implemented.  This Bill has been framed in such a way that certainly it is expected it will be implemented.  I will give it highest priority.  We are trying to achieve cleaner air not just in the capital city but in other areas which might have an air pollution problem, arising either from local sources or from transboundary sources.  It is important to recognise that the Bill is not centred on Dublin, although instances of pollution in the city have been brought to our attention and areas have been scientifically identified as having air which is not in accordance with the baseline directive we would like to apply.  It would be a matter for the local authorities to carry out the necessary surveys to prove these conditions exist and to seek to have a special order put in place.</P>
      <P>Section 39 enables a local authority in the interests of preventing or limiting air pollution to make an order declaring all or part of their area to be a special control area.  In considering the making of the order the local authority must have regard to any relevant air quality management plan or air quality standard, as well as the availability of the means necessary to comply with the order and the cost of compliance.  Making an order will be a function reserved to the elected members of a local authority.  Local representatives have been seeking this power to address difficulties in certain areas in their locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will also have a reserve power to direct that a special control order be made.  That is important in an area where there might be reluctance on the part of an authority or of certain members of it to make such an order. The Minister will have the overriding <Col N="2377" /> power to step in and direct that the order be made.  Of course, he will have to take cognisance of the surveys and management plans that might be in place and the evidence brought forward in support of making the order.  There is a cost element involved in any such measure. That reserve power is an essential ingredient in the legislation.  It indicates to local authorities and to elected members that if they are reluctant to take the necessary steps to have a special control order supplied, the Minister will simply step in and do it on their behalf, and I assure the House that this Minister will not be reluctant to take the power available to him.</P>
    <P>Section 39 (1) is important because it provides the basic power for a local authority to make a special control area order and this power is stated permissibly as &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, something which has attracted criticism from certain commentators on the Bill.  By implication these critics would like to see a mandatory provision requiring the establishment of special control orders in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>It can be said in reply to some of these criticisms that the Bill embodies a mandatory provision under section 39 (4) for special control area orders in the power of the Minister, to direct a local authority to make such an order.  That would go a long way to setting at rest the minds of those who say that the Minister might not have the power or might not be available to use it.  Secondly, it would be unreasonable and inappropriate for the Bill itself to define where or in what exact circumstances an order should be made. Making an order will involve a pretty complex assessment for which the Bill must be the framework rather than the detailed blueprint.  That is important. There are steps to be taken so as to protect rights of individuals, people and areas so that those steps can be clearly set down.  The local authority will be in full knowledge of the expertise, the surveys, the plans and all that goes to make a decision one could stand over.  I am particularly conscious of that.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, making a mandatory provision <Col N="2378" /> the norm would deprive local authorities of any real input into the question of special control areas.  It is embodied in a particular way in this legislation that local authorities should be conscious of their own environment and should take the initiative for it.  In the first instance I want them to do that.  I do not want to mandate them and say that it must be done this way or that way; I want them to set in place a sequence of events that will take place before the special area order of control is made.  They will have their input, they will have an opportunity of articulating the reasons.  In this way their own electors will understand the reason certain steps are being taken, including the efforts made to trace the causes of the pollution affecting their own area.  It is very important that that amendment be seen in that light.  I do not see it as a long term benefit to say that we are having a special control order in this area and leave it at that.  It would be preferable that before an order is made the cause of the pollution is traced back so that one can remove or take steps to remove the cause and thereby the control order would not be in place for all time.  There is not much point in making an order unless we do something about seeking the source.  By attacking it in that way we might eliminate the need for having that many orders put in place. People would recognise that those making out the orders were seeking the sources.  This would be a good indicator to all and sundry that they must do something about their own business in advance of having the order put in place on them and it would be instead of doing it in a mandatory way in the legislation and against the practice of most countries, in particular against the tradition of Irish local government who have entrusted elected local authorities with all kinds of responsibilities for the environment, taking in such things as planning, water pollution control, waste management, sanitary services, roads and housing.</P>
    <P>We could all agree that there is a pretty wide range in the powers the authorities have and it has always been good practice to allow them to have the power to deal <Col N="2379" /> with all these matters which concern their own areas.  This legislation goes down that road in allowing the elected representatives the maximum autonomy in dealing with their own areas.  I would like to see that enshrined in this legislation. If they are not prepared to do it or are reluctant in any way when the Minister has the power, but I would like to think that it would not come to that and that they would seek to have these control orders put in place themselves and to take an interest in seeing to it that their areas are free from the type of pollution we are referring to in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to that subsection, entrusting discretion to local authorities in this matter is consistent with the reality that different approaches to environmental protection are appropriate for different areas.  We could see that in a broad way also.  What one might do in one area might not necessarily be the right thing to do in another, whereas if it were included in the legislation by way of mandate, it would be a blanket kind of thing, taking away from local authorities the making of orders and having particular surveys done in a particular way to satisfy their own requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 39 (2) lists the matters to which the local authority must have regard in deciding whether to make a special control area order.  It is important that that be understood by those considering putting in place this type of order.  The matters they would have to take cognisance of would be as follows: any air quality management plan adopted by the local authority under section 46 of the Bill; any relevant air quality standard described by the Minister under section 50 of the Bill &mdash; this could be based on EC directives or prescribed independently &mdash; the availability of the means necessary to comply with the order, for example, smokeless or other non-polluting fuels, low emission burners and so on, and the expense involved in complying with the order.  Of course, these things are added to by the amendment in that they have to seek into the cause of the pollution as well.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that the availability of <Col N="2380" /> means necessary to comply with the order and the expense involved in complying with the order deprive these provisions of any real teeth.  I do not see it that way. They are just the overriding considerations but their inclusion is necessary to ensure a balanced assessment of the merits of a special control area.</P>
    <P>These subsections in outlining the details of how it is to be done give some indications as to how serious the question of imposing such a control area order is. It must be done carefully following all due surveys and recognition of the difficulties involved, but once decided on it must be done in a proper fashion.  In this way the legislation is given teeth.  Deputy Brady need have no fear; the legislation is comprehensive enough and allows for implementation without getting completely stuck in so far as investigation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 39 (3) requires a special control area order to specify the area to which it relates, the pollutant or pollutants with which it is concerned and the measures required under it.  Section 40, without prejudice to the generality of this subsection, lists in much detail the possible matters for which an order may provide. Section 39 (4) empowers the Minister, where he considers it necessary to prevent or limit air pollution to direct a local authority to make a special control area order.  This is to be seen as a reserve power complementing that given to local authorities under subsection (1).  It has parallels in other areas of local government law, notably in section 42 (1) (a) of the Planning Acts, 1963, which allows the Minister to direct a planning authority to make a special amenity area order.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that amenity area orders can be made in different ways and one of the ways in which it can be done is by direction of the Minister.  I always like to think that these orders should have their source in the local authority members themselves but on occasion, for whatever reason, when the Minister deems it necessary to come in and do it then he should have power to do so.  That provision is incorporated in this Bill as well, that the Minister does <Col N="2381" /> have that power to take the necessary steps to prevent air pollution, to direct a particular local authority to put a special control area order in place.  Hopefully, it will not be necessary for a Minister to take this step too often.  I like to view it as purely a reserve power to show the Minister is determined and wishes it to be effective in so far as the control of pollution is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 39 (5) allows a local authority, with the consent of any other local authority concerned, to make a special control area order which relates to an area within the jurisdiction or functional area of the other local authority.  This subsection effectively allows an order to extend beyond the functional area of the local authority making it.  Similar provisions exist for special amenity area orders under section 42 (3) of the Planning Acts, 1963.  This was touched on by Deputy Doyle when she spoke about transboundary pollution, the fact that a difficulty might arise because it might be outside the jurisdiction or control of a given local authority.  It is important &mdash; if it can be established that the difficulty arises in some other place &mdash; that that can be covered by this section of the Bill, that the area of control can go beyond the boundary of the particular local authority. That is a good provision and it is necessary.  Otherwise one could end up in a nonsensical situation in which one could go up the road to a certain limit but one could not go beyond that limit. It is for that reason that subsection (5) allows a local authority to deal with an area beyond its territory.  Of course, the consent of the other local authority is needed in these matters.  However, the reserve function of the Minister &mdash; in being able to direct the control area order to be made, over and above that &mdash; means that if one local authority are not prepared to play ball with another local authority wishing to have a control area order put in place then the Minister may have to settle the matter for them.</P>

I wanted to ask &mdash; as we had gone on slightly beyond the amendments &mdash; whether under subsection (3) (b) which reads that a special control order area shall specify the pollutant with which it is concerned that renders the amendment in question somewhat unnecessary?  Before an order could specify the pollutant one would have to know the source and so on.  Perhaps unnecessary is somewhat strong. Does it render the amendment somewhat superfluous?  I might take up the Minister on a couple of other points he made. Perhaps you will bear with us, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have been rambling a little.  It may not be 100 per cent in order but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The Minister drew our attention to the fact that the wording of section 39 (4) is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2384" /> The Minister may, if he considers it necessary so to do....</P>
    <P>I have long been concerned with the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in legislation apart from this Bill altogether.  It appears in our Planning Acts all too frequently, in our county development plans and so on. Really what is meant is that where the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used, nothing is done if at all possible.  The initial part of subsection (4) concerns me.  Surely any Minister who considered it necessary to do so would definitely proceed according to the terms of the subsection?  There should be no question of his not proceeding.  I would prefer if that could read either: The Minister may, in order to prevent or limit air pollution, having regard to and so on, or: The Minister shall, if he considers it necessary to do so.  If any Minister considered it necessary to do something there should be no &ldquo;may&rdquo; about it: it should be a matter of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Can the Minister give us an example of circumstances in which any Minister might consider it necessary to do something and perhaps not do it?  I hope I am making myself clear.  The semantics here bother me somewhat.  Perhaps I might repeat for the Minister's benefit: could the initial part of that sentence read: The Minister may, in order to prevent or limit air pollution, having regard to and so on?  Or, if the Minister could not agree to that could we have: The Minister shall, if he considers it necessary so to do in order to prevent or limit air pollution and so on?  Could we have one or other but surely not the juxtaposition of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and then the words &ldquo;if he considers it necessary so to do&rdquo;?  I cannot think of any circumstance in which it would be necessary for the Minister to act that he would or should not act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, it is a semantic point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be important if there was a get-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that section 39 (5) says that a local authority <Col N="2385" /> may with the consent of any other local authority concerned and so on.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is also included in subsection (1) in particular.  I am trying to make the point that the making of any such order is a reserve function.  The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; allows it to be taken by a majority decision, that they may or may not but, if one inserts the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in circumstances like that it leaves no discretion whatsoever, they just have to do so.  Whereas the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; provides the majority with the right to make or to refuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in subsection (5) but I am referring specifically to subsection (4) where it is left to a local authority and they, for some reason, have not made an order.  We are saying: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he considers it necesary to do so...&rdquo;  Surely if it is necessary to do so, &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; would be the correct wording or else we should leave out &ldquo;it necessary to do so&rdquo; and leave in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise tha the Minister would have to have good justification for doing something and he should be entitled to decide one way or the other.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives him that flexibility, whereas if it was &ldquo;shall&rdquo; he would be mandated in a particular way and it would take away the Minister's power to decide whether or not he should take the powers available to him as a reserved function to put the order in place.  The only reason the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is included in so far as the local authorities are concerned is that it is a reserved function and the Deputy can accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give the same flexibility to the Minister?  Following on the case being made and having checked the evidence and the reason the council did not decide in their wisdom as a reserved function to put the order in place, he may then decide that it is necessary to put it in place having cognisance of the justification, because of the level <Col N="2386" /> of pollution or whatever.  For that reason it gives the Minister the entitlement to decide one way or the other.  If it was stated in such a way that he had to do it, by the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, it would defeat the purpose of the powers the Minister would like to have in so far as flexibility of decision is concerned. Maybe it is a semantic point but it is worth making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with subsection (5) which states: &ldquo;A local authority may, with the consent of any other local authority...&rdquo; or the other reference ot the local authority having the option, it being a reserved function of the members.  It does not say that a local authority may, if they consider it necessary to do so, etc.  It is the juxtaposition of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;if he considers it necessary to do so&rdquo; that concerns me.  Could we have a position where a Minister would consider it necessary to proceed and then would not proceed for some reason?  I do not think we could have that position.  I am happy with the words &ldquo;the Minister may ... in order to prevent or limit air pollution, having regard to the provisions. ...make a special control area order in relation...&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; allows the Minister to step in if the local authorities for some reason or another have not proceeded with the special control area order and if the Minister thinks it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to consider the position under the subsection to which she refers where it states: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he considers it necessary ...&rdquo;  They are the overriding words of that subsection.  It is important that the Minister should have that discretion available to him.  He cannot act in an arbitrary fashion.  He would have to take cognisance of the evidence before him. In all the circumstances the inclusion of the words &ldquo;if he considers it necessary&rdquo; puts the Minister in a very strong position. We should take into consideration all the time that before it happened the local authorities had their say and they may for whatever reason have decided <Col N="2387" /> one way or the other.  It would only come to the Minister when they had decided against the order being put in place.  That is not to say that the Minister could not initiate and direct an order in his own right irrespective of whether a local authority intended to put an order in place.  I expect that in the normal course of events that matter would be brought before the local authority and they would be put on notice that this evidence was there and that they should utilise the powers available to them.</P>
      <P>In other legislative areas local authorities are sometimes reluctant to move in the first instance and they may very well require a push from the Minister.  I would like to think that the push would be given by the Minister initially and that he would ask them to consider these matters. If they fail in their duty and if it is seen that they are failing in their duty then the Minister may, if he thinks it is necessary, go ahead and put the order in place.  That is what is intended here.  It is in no way intended to limit the powers of the Minister.  The Minister has considerable power under this legislation and I am not in favour of limiting that power because we might find that local authorities are reluctant to comply with this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment, specifically.  I beg the Minister's indulgence; I do not recall him answering my specific question as to whether section 39 (3) (b) makes amendment No. 13 superfluous.  Perhaps I lost the answer in our overall discussion.  I wonder why it is necessary to include a subsection in relation to the incidence and cause of air pollution when, before any special <Col N="2389" /> control area order is made or when it is made, it shall specify the pollutant to which it is concerned.  Before a pollutant can be specified surely its incidence and source will have to be identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Deputy's point of view.  There may be a whole range of pollutants which affect this matter; some may be of major consequence and others may not be.  The order would zone in on one pollutant or maybe two, but it is more than likely that it would be only one, smoke being the biggest one.  It would not necessarily mean that there were not a lot of other pollutants also involved and for that reason I do not think the Deputy's point is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably be smoke or SO 2 in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case at present but in the general legislation we would have to consider what might by the situation years from now.  For that reason it has to be framed in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the pollutant could be considered to be the cause of air pollution which we are concerned with in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to establish the cause of the air pollution before proposing the order.  I take it that when the order is made it will nominate a particular pollutant and that will be the principal one.  In our circumstances the Deputy is right when she says it is smoke at present but that is not to say that there are not many other pollutants in the air as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take what the Minister is saying but I find it a little superfluous that both are there, but I do not think they do any harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the survey is done properly it will identify all the pollutants and, hopefully, will seek to address the problem of finding the source of the pollutions. If the major cause is smoke, obviously they will lean in that direction. <Col N="2390" /> I am including this as another element in the survey which would have to be done before it goes before the council to make the reserved order.  I suspect that because the pollutant is smoke they will be seeking the source before making the order.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier &mdash; I presume it was out of order but I hope it is on the record &mdash; the list of matters the special area order survey would have to take into consideration before the order would be made, and I am including this one now which was sought by interested parties so that they would not be discriminated against in any way.  This does not minimise the effectiveness of the legislation in having the order put in place, but it is important that at least cognisance be taken by those carrying out the survey and that they make every effort to identify the source of the major pollutant, which would be smoke, before the survey goes before the local authority with a view to having a control order put in place.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  I would not like to be seen as pandering to certain interests but one must accept that smoke is the major pollutant we are talking about and domestic coal contributes to this problem.  It is only right and proper that fair play be seen to be done.  That was why the amendment is down in that fashion and I would like the Deputy to see it in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I see it in that light and that is why I am pressing the Minister about this problem.  He said the Coal Information Services have specifically requested clarification in this area.  It is important to realise that none of us has any reason to criticise the operation of the coal industry nor would we wish to see a diminution in the carrying out of their business in an effective manner.  We want to see them making a good living and supporting a large number of jobs.  I want to put that on the record as a preface to what I have to say about this amendment. I support their efforts.  Be that as it may, the harsh reality is that in this city the smoke levels have doubled over the past year.  These are factual figures from <Col N="2391" /> the control section of Dublin Corporation, a section which does its best, with very inadequate equipment, to monitor areas in Dublin city.  I cannot see how it will be possible to determine the source of pollution.</P>
      <P>The Coal Information Services sent me a leaflet dated 19 May which arrived on my desk this morning.  In this leaflet they say that deaths are caused by cold and not by air pollution.  That is a very, perhaps unintentionally, misleading statement and it is a serious statement.  Anybody interested in research into bronchial conditions and asthmatic or respiratory problems of elderly people who have to suffer the appalling air pollution levels in our capital city could not agree with a remark like that from a responsible organisation representing the coal industry.</P>
      <P>In this leaflet they say that the much quoted Kelly-Clancy report omitted the fact that in January 1982 proportionately a greater increase in deaths occurred in Munster, Connacht and the rest of Ireland than occurred in Dublin.  They went on to say that only Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal recorded a lower increase than Dublin and that that was just one example where all the facts had not been highlighted in that debate.  I see as misleading the calling into question of a medical report that highlighted the fact that five years ago we had a very cold spell and sulphur dioxide was trapped in our atmosphere.  This meant there was an increase in the number of deaths in our capital city due to air pollution.</P>
      <P>They are trying to influence this legislation by making it mandatory on the local authority to establish the source and not just the presence of air pollution. They say that if the Bill is not amended there is a very real danger that local authority decisions will be based on ill-formed popular opinion and not on fact.  That is tantamount to endeavouring to negative all the information and reports which have come out from Dublin Corporation pinpointing the fact that in Dublin city air pollution exceeds the limit set in EC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say that section 39 (3) (b) should <Col N="2392" /> be amended to require a local authority to specify the source of the pollutant by including after the word &ldquo;pollutant&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;and its source&rdquo;.  The effect of this change would be to put an onus on the local authority &mdash; and this is the important point we have to consider &mdash; to scientifically establish the source of the pollutant before proposing the introduction of a special control area, that is, a smokeless zone.  This is a very important point.  In my view it is well nigh impossible to establish the actual source of a pollutant.  There are so many other components in air pollution that this legislation, regrettably weak-kneed as it is and unfortunately non-directive, will become inoperable.</P>
    <P>The legal people will have a field day as years go by trying to establish where a particular air pollutant is coming from and how air pollutants chemically can change as they interact with other sources. There is one poignant example in the Ranelagh area where for years a man has been smelting lead and polluting the atmosphere and, to my mind, causing deaths as a result of air pollution.  I believe there is some kind of cop-out there because it is impossibe to pinpoint the source of pollution.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are asked to include the words &ldquo;the incidence and cause of air pollution in the area&rdquo; before a smokeless zone can be created.  I think it is unnecessary but I am so anxious that this Bill be passed that I will not oppose the inclusion of the words, although I feel it necessary to mention them.  The Minister will probably have to involve himself a lot more than he realises and it will not be a question of his hoping he will not have to implement the powers he has and depending on the local authority to use the power.  For a number of reasons I would have less confidence in the local authority enforcing the legislation.  They have not the equipment to pinpoint the source of pollution.  The delay involved is another factor because air pollution levels vary dramatically from season to season, from a high point in November-December right down to a low point in June-July.  In fact in June and July our <Col N="2393" /> pollution levels are even higher than are winter levels in the capital city of England. It will not be possible to pinpoint the source of pollution.</P>
    <P>The temptation here is to point the finger at the coal industry but I will not do that.  I realise that the coal industry are engaged in a vigorous manner in endeavouring to produce scientific smoke recovery grades.  Only today, I suppose by coincidence, we have been invited to the Shelbourne Hotel to examine new means of smoke recovery apparatus which the coal industry are engaged in developing.  That is a very welcome development but all of this is being forced on the people who are perhaps inadvertently the main cause of air pollution in our city.</P>
    <P>I do not like to see this amendment.  A Bill like this, with so many sections, is a bit like Parkinson's law, we can fill so many sections in it that it goes on and on without having teeth.  This amendment would weaken the legislation by making it impossible for the local authority to do their job.  People are dying from air pollution in the capital city.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents a densely populated area with a lot of local authority housing estates in which the air is just appalling.  Even if the local authorities saw fit to introduce what we call under this section a special control area, how is it to be enforced?  We must have a brave attitude to this legislation.  We must take a directive on it for health reasons and we cannot pander to particular aspects of industry.  The health of our people must come before consideration for polluters.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Minister should give consideration to the creation of a smokeless zone for the capital city and he might find that the industry who for one reason or another are a party to the high level of air pollution would with their scientific endeavour go a long way towards correcting the problem by reducing the burning of this high bitumous coal which is causing the problem.  Other fuels can be used which will greatly minimise or eliminate pollution.  The coal industry could <Col N="2394" /> be engaged in the distribution of these fuels and still make their profits to create employment.</P>
    <P>I put up the red flag of caution to the Minister here.  Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, there is a grave danger in this amendment.  It would be very difficult for lawyers to try to set about establishing source.  It is very difficult to establish source even in relation to international pollution, be it in its most ugly form by way of nuclear radiation pollution from as far away as Chernobyl or from Sellafield, let alone within our own regions.  Perhaps the Minister will find that local authorities will have to equip themselves with very expensive apparatus to try to establish the source of pollution.  I am most unhappy about that but perhaps we will get an opportunity to amplify the points when the section is discussed in more detail.  It is most regrettable that the amendment is open to loose misinterpretation.</P>
    <P>This morning reading through a document that arrived from the Coal Information Services I noted that it quoted a medical report which specifically highlighted a problem in our capital city and pinpointed the cause and the source.  The cause was the burning of domestic coal and the source was Dublin.  Yet this information leaflet came to me requesting that I should use my station in this House to try to amend the legislation.  It is self contradictory.  If we do not have a directive in the legislation needed to create smokeless zones there is a danger that nothing will happen.  We have an example of this in the Litter Act which appealed to the local authorities to enforce certain rules and so on, and yet they are not doing it.  The same type of thing could happen here again.  During this debate the Minister should spell it out loudly and clearly that he will take no misdirected reports from people who have a vested interest in this legislation, that he will act very bravely about this and will do what is necessary in calling for a smokeless zone for our capital.  We are going down hill year in, year out and we all know it. If one stands in the foothills of the Dublin mountains and looks down, one can see <Col N="2395" /> an appalling yellow smog across our city. This pollution will have a deleterious effect on our tourism and on the health of the citizens living in the capital.  The Minister should spell out loudly and clearly that he will not take any hedging from local aouthorities on the basis that the source of the pollution cannot be proved.  Weak though the legislation is, we must use this opportunity to do something about dealing with the problem before, people start to die on the streets as happened in England, as a result of pollution in the late fifties and before something was done about the problem there.  We should not start in any way kicking for touch on this important legislation.</P>

      <P>We are back again to the semantics, but it might take on board the fears expressed by Deputy Brady and myself in relation to any weakening of the power of the local authorities.  If section 39 (2) read &ldquo;In deciding whether it is necessary or expedient to make a special control area order in relation to any area, the local authority may have regard to&rdquo; so that the legal eagles will not have a field day and if it is not possible to nail down the incidence and the specific causes of air pollution there will not be an out.  Could the Minister look at this to see if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; could be inserted instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In that way we can have all the amendments we like but we will not get hung up on any one of them which would preclude the procedure which is deemed necessary in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is there because we are mandating local authorities to have due regard.  I am not anxious to give them any flexibility in what they may or may not consider important if they should choose so themselves. If I put standards in place I do not want the local authorities to have the flexibility to say they may or may not consider them important.  I will be mandating them that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have to take cognisance of that.  If an EC directive on standards was in place, which would probably be the important one, I would not like them to feel they had flexibility of action not to consider it.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would weaken that section and I am particularly anxious to have the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; included so that there would be no way out.  Deputy Brady probably agrees that that might weaken the thrust of the legislation and bring about discussion and argument which would inevitably lead to actions we would not wish to see taken being taken and eventually after a long process coming back to me again.  I am anxious that it would be mandatory on the local authorities to consider the standards and controls that are available before and in consideration of the special period of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Brady's point of view and I would like to say, if it is of any comfort to him, that it is not the Minister's intention to take any nonsense from local authorities who would be tardy or reluctant to consider having control orders put in place.  There is a serious condition to be addressed and this legislation is the first piece of environmental legislation put before the House by the Minister.  Deputy Brady made the point very well about the incidence of pollution he is aware of.  He is well known nationally for his concern in this matter and I share his point of view.  This legislation <Col N="2397" /> will give local authorities power to create smokeless zones as they are loosely called.  Deputy Brady will have my support in seeing to it that local authorities do not seek by any means to frustrate the intent of the legislation.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not being inserted to weaken the legislation in any way.  I hope that in the overall control of pollution it will be a strengthening factor.  It is only being added on to those items which the local authorities must have regard to.  It is an important amendment from the point of view of equity and tracking down the sources of pollution generally.  It is only in addition to what the local authorities &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have regard to.  It is important that they have no alternative but to do this.  For that reason I recommend this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady quite rightly said &mdash; and it has been reiterated by many people &mdash; that the coal industry and the distribution of coal are very important to Dublin and to the country as a whole.  This amendment should in no way be seen as trying to accommodate the industry.  It is being inserted so that the problem of smoke which is a major pollutant can be dealt with.  It has been established that the burning of domestic coal in fire places is a contributing factor to pollution but we have to be fair and say it is not the only contributing factor so far as the levels of smoke in this city are concerned.  There are many pollutants.  It has to be recognised that smoke which comes from open fires is a major pollutant but local authorities, when they are considering these matters, will have to have due regard for the other sources of pollution as well.</P>
    <P>Industry and commercial concerns other than domestic houses contribute to the pollution levels in the city.  We are inclined to think this is capital orientated legislation, but it is not.  I want everybody to understand that this legislation applies nationally.  Many people might think there is no difficulty attached to air pollution in other parts of the country but this is not so.  This legislation will put in place the methods whereby local authorities can address the problem.</P>
    <P>Smoke levels have been a source of <Col N="2398" /> concern for some time.  Deputy Brady referred to the fact that smoke levels have increased considerably in recent times. That is fair comment.  As he and the House will be aware there was a considerable reduction in the level of smoke in the seventies but unfortunately the level of smoke pollution in Dublin increased considerably during the eighties. About 16,000 tonnes of smoke are emitted annually in Dublin.  That is in advance of the emissions for the London area.  It is in this context that the need for this legislation is absolutely apparent.</P>
    <P>This problem has to be controlled and the reason we are pressing this legislation is so that we can start the process whereby we can have cleaner air in Dublin.  I would not like anybody to run away with the idea that Dublin would have to be made a smokeless zone area overnight.  That is not fair, nor is it required.  Certain areas have been identified which will have to be addressed first.  It is important that, when the surveys are completed, the local authorities whose reserved function it is to make the control area order will have all the necessary evidence available to them.  This is why I am anxious to include this provision along with the other provisions under section 39 (2).</P>
    <P>Local authorities will have to have regard to all other possible sources of pollution affecting their own areas.  Local representatives will consider this as being important.  When they see that there are high levels of smoke in particular areas of Dublin city they will know that domestic smoke contributes much to these high levels but they will also be aware, as Deputy Doyle rightly said, that there are other trans-boundary polluters emitting smoke into areas quite a distance from them.  If that dimension is not provided for we are not being fair to all concerned. It will give the authorities a better way of pinpointing the sources of emissions of pollution.  In that way we will be able to get a good idea of where the pollution is coming from and go about our business in a determined way.</P>

One would have to have cognisance and regard to the standards which were set down by the EC or by the Minister in carrying out the survey.  Finally, the elected members can make and put an order in place but if they are reluctant to put one in place the Minister, once the evidence has become available to him, can direct them to do so.  I sincerely hope that that situation will not arise.  Sufficient evidence is available and sufficient concern has been expressed particularly in certain parts of the city, to ensure that local representatives will pursue the implementation of control orders at the first available opportunity.  I am anxious that that should happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There are two aspects of this section on which I seek clarification from the Minister. First, who is going to bear the cost of the implementation of any such order <Col N="2400" /> made?  Ballyfermot, in my constituency, has a very acute air pollution problem which has arisen from some local climatological factors.  Ballyfermot does not appear to be in a hollow, yet the winds appear to clear only what is on either side of it and not what is in the place itself. The vast majority of householders in the area use coal fires.  The air pollution problem is a very acute one and cause problems not alone for those who suffer from bronchial ailments, although it is clearly of greatest difficulty for them, but also for ordinary people.  The pollution in Ballyfermot is so bad that while travelling around the area, I sometimes have difficulty in breathing.  Therefore, there is an urgent need for an order as provided for in this section.  Are the people of the area to bear the cost?  Let us suppose that the order bans the use of coal fires or insists on smokeless fuels being used, which are more expensive, is any provision to be made to pay for the implementation of the order or will the cost fall on the residents of the area?</P>
      <P>My second question relates to a local authority making an order in respect of another local authority area.  I can understand such an order being made if such an area is on the boundary between two local authority areas but the phrase in the section is far from specific and does not say anything about contiguity.  It seems a little anomalous that one local authority might have the power to make an order in respect of an area in another local authority area without specifying that it should be a contiguous area or that it is intended to be a contiguous area or does the Minister have something else in mind?  For instance, does he have in mind that Dublin Corporation might make orders in respect of areas covered by Dublin County Council which are populated by Dublin Corporation tenants? Would it not be better to be more specific and specify contiguity?  For instance, the Dublin Transportation Authority Act might possibly be a good precedent.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to apologise for not being here earlier.  I <Col N="2401" /> was on referendum business and unfortunately could not be here to move my amendments.  I take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister for bringing forward the Bill so swiftly.  Regarding this section, the need for special control orders has become increasingly obvious during the past number of years and I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there are certain areas that are more prone to pollution.  South Dublin is one of those areas and I do not mean just my constituency. A good portion of south Dublin is more prone to pollution.  This must have something to do with the mountains in the background.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in section 54 for monitoring by local authorities and I would be afraid that we would not make full use of that provision by using the information which is constantly supplied. What I have in mind is some kind of air pollution alert such as the warning which is broadcast on radio when there is a reduction in the water levels in reservoirs and such as the broadcasting of the pollen count during the summer.  Something on those lines would not cost a lot of money to implement and it would have three effects.  First, it would allow those who suffer from bronchial ailments to avoid going out of doors, if necessary; secondly, it would encourage people to use forms of heating other than coal fired heating and, thirdly, and more importantly, it would raise the level of public awareness about air pollution.  We do not have a sufficiently high level of public awareness at present.</P>
      <P>The burning of coal in grates causes more smoke pollution in some areas than in others.  There is no doubt that if we could use smokeless fuels, there would be a reduction in pollution.  I suggest to the Minister that one method of reducing the cost of smokeless fuels and of encouraging people to use them is a reduction in the rate of VAT which is applied to those fuels.  That would be an incentive in that regard.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any of his Ministers or Ministers of State have, since their appointment, attended any meeting of any local authority, local authority committee, health board or health advisory committee, in respect of which they have claimed or been paid travelling subsistence or other expenses; whether he will make inquiries as to whether any such expenses have been claimed or paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>Under revised arrangements for official transport introduced in November 1983, Ministers of State, other than the Government Chief Whip, must provide their own transport and are paid a mileage allowance for mileage related to official business.  Four Ministers of State have made claims to local authorities or other bodies for normal expenses for <Col N="2406" /> attendance at meetings of these organisations. I am assured that there has been no duplication between these claims and any payments for expenses incurred in the performance of ministerial duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Taoiseach confirm that one of his junior Ministers on the date notice of this question was published in newspapers tendered his resignation to Dublin County Council? Secondly, will he agree that part of the whole purpose of travel expenses paid to county councillors is to reimburse them for the capital cost of their car, if they use such, and that part of the money given to junior Ministers is to do the same thing?  Is it not a long-standing tradition and a desirable one to be maintained that junior Ministers should resign their positions on these bodies from which large sums of money are recoverable as expenses for attendance?  Is it not incumbent on the Taoiseach now to request his junior Ministers as quickly as possible to follow Deputy Brennan's example?</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 4, 27 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The temporary measures introduced in November 1986 to assist persons who suffered reductions in payment as a consequence of the new dependency arrangements brought into force at that time are due to expire in mid-November 1987 and no provision was made in the 1987 Estimates for their continuation beyond that.  I am reviewing the operation of the present arrangements and will be advising the Government on the results of this review.  The question of extending these arrangements beyond November 1987 would be a matter for consideration in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend, of course, on the number of recipients.  The estimated cost of the alleviating measures for the year 1987 to mid-November is £14 million.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason widowers do not come within the scope of EC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment as between men and women in matters of social security; his views on whether if a widow is entitled to death payment, a widower should also be entitled, as in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 3 of EEC Directive 79/7/EEC specifically provides that the directive does not apply to survivors' benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment referred to by the Deputy is the payment of benefit in certain circumstances to a dependant of a social <Col N="2410" /> welfare beneficiary for a period of six weeks after the death of the beneficiary. The general arrangements for after death payments are that such payments are made to widows whose husbands had been in receipt of a social welfare payment with an increase for the wife as a dependant.  These payments come under the heading of survivors' benefits and are not, therefore, covered by the EEC Directive.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the widower in the case was himself the beneficiary, being in receipt of a retirement pension with an increase for his wife.  A widow in similar circumstances would not have qualified for the after death payment which only arises where the beneficiary dies, not the dependant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the problems which arise for widowers whose spouses die?  Is he prepared to consider some special arrangement, at least for hardship cases, among widowers? I do not think that anyone would ask the Minister to consider a pension for widowers because of the clear cost implications but there are very special cases.  Will the Minister consider some scheme to make provision for cases where, for instance, a working widower loses the tax-free allowance for his spouse and only gets a single person's tax bands? If he is not working he does not get any pension; he is in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in general there is a question to be considered further although there are cost implications involved.  However, this question refers to a particular set of circumstances in which after-death payments are made. The circumstances in which such payments were made were revised to take account of the new arrangements and such payments are made to the widow. However, when the wife dies, payment is made to the husband provided that the benefit which was being paid to the wife included an increase in respect of the husband as an adult dependant.  I know <Col N="2411" /> it is complicated but the husband benefited if he was a dependant of his wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's remark but does he not agree that there is no equality in the law in practice in regard to single parent families where the parent is a man, regardless of the fact that he is a widower or a deserted husband?  This small section of the community is one of the most needy and there should be special arrangements to deal with so many tragic cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the question refers to a specific case and set of circumstances. Notwithstanding that, I recognise that there is a need to introduce benefits for spouses whenever this can be achieved.  That is the direction in which the changes are going but the principal problem is the cost involved.  With each successive budget in future, that question will have to be examined further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister rightly wants to avoid innovation which would cost a lot of money.  However, we should make arrangements to deal with very special cases.  For instance, a widower or a deserted husband with four children could receive £30 a week less than a woman in similar circumstances. Many of these people are living in abject poverty.  Perhaps provision could be made through the supplementary welfare system whereby community welfare officers could pay the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone into a totally different question now.  I accept that this area needs further attention.  If there is a clear need under the current criteria, it can be dealt with under supplementary welfare allowances.  As the Deputy knows, however, that would not meet some of the circumstances which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These cases are not provided for under the supplementary welfare system and frequently community welfare officers deny assistance <Col N="2412" /> to men in these circumstances.  I have had several of these cases in my own constitutency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was detained in connection with the Single European Act and I regret I was not in the Chamber for the Minister's reply.  I appreciate there is a problem in regard to finance but I should like to ask the Minister if, bearing in mind that there would not be an enormous expenditure involved out of a total budget of the Department of £2,000 million, he will arrange for widowers to be treated in the same way that widows are treated in regard to death grants. Will the Minister agree it is a matter the Ombudsman should look into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for further and future consideration.  There has been some improvement in that where a wife dies payment is made to the husband provided the benefit which was being paid to the wife included an increase in respect of the husband as an adult dependant. The introduction of that principle represents a development.  I appreciate it does not mean there will be equal benefit to that which applies where the husband dies because in such cases the benefit carries on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in a whole range of areas &mdash; in the case of a lady who reaches 66 years <Col N="2413" /> of age before her husband, for example &mdash; there is wholesale discrimination involved.  I welcome the efforts of the Minister, and the Government, in recent times to eliminate inequality but I should like to ask the Minister if he will consider setting up a section in his Department to work towards abolishing inequality as between the sexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to have his Department look at all social welfare schemes to ensure entitlement is given to the person irrespective of their sex?  In the past one rarely came across deserted husbands but it is common to meet them today and it is time that the Minister looked at all the schemes, statutory and discretionary, to ensure there is equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in favour of equality but, as Members realise, the main question to be considered is the amount of cash available to extend benefits. In that context I will be considering the suggestions raised in connection with the preparation of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At intermittent intervals between October 1986 and April 1987 limited industrial action was taken at the employment exchange in Limerick by members of the union representing the majority of staff in protest against the delay in commencing the construction of a new employment exchange.  This action took the form of refusal to deal with <Col N="2414" /> telephone inquiries, non-handling of incoming post and the non-completion of statistical returns and this led to delays in making unemployment payments in the Limerick city and county areas.</P>
      <P>Following discussions, the union concerned substantially reduced the scale of the industrial action subject to the condition that the Office of Public Works who are responsible for my Department's building programme would invite tenders for the construction of the new building by the end of July 1987.  This industrial action is not, at present, causing delays in the payments of benefit.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to issue the invitations to tender at the earliest possible date and I am confident that work on the erection of the new building will commence before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a building for a temporary employment exchange for women at Mungret Street, Limerick, has been acquired and it is expected that these premises will be ready for occupation in early autumn.  The addition of a second employment exchange in Limerick will be beneficial to claimants and staff alike and will eliminate overcrowding until the new employment exchange is ready for occupation.</P>

      <P>Provision has not been included in the 1987 Estimates of Social Welfare expenditure for the payment of a Christmas bonus this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the payment of a Christmas bonus the Minister should try to be selective and make the payments to the needy groups rather than making them across the board.  He should consider paying the needy a higher bonus than heretofore and avoid paying a bonus to those who have incomes other than their social welfare pensions.  He should try to avoid paying a bonus to those who have three or four pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for selectivity in regard to this bonus.  The payment of the Christmas bonus in recent years has been an emotional issue in the House because it was felt that those who received it were in need.  However, I am aware of people who are on pensions amounting to about £30,000 annually from the banks getting a Christmas bonus <Col N="2416" /> because they qualify for an old age pension from the State.  Will the Minister agree, given the position of the Exchequer and the fact that there are needy groups in our society, that we should not be giving the bonus across the board?  Will he agree we should be more selective and give more to those in real need?</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting we should not give the Christmas bonus? The Deputy will have to be on one side or the other.  I would like to see the bonus paid, and in that regard I will take into account the points raised by Deputy Mitchell but there may be a difficulty in regard to administration.  I take it the House will agree to pay a Christmas bonus to the long-term unemployed, pensioners, widows and other categories of beneficiaries if that is possible.  That is the line I will be adopting.</P>

I should like to remind the Minister of the motion promoted by Fianna Fáil on 25 November 1986, when they were in Opposition, which called on Dáil Éireann to request the Government to arrange to have the Christmas bonus payment to social welfare recipients <Col N="2417" /> made this year on the same basis and at the same rate as it was in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report of the National Pensions Board which was published recently contains wide ranging proposals for the future regulation of occupational pension schemes under a number of headings. These include such areas as the funding and financial security of pension schemes; the transferability of members' pension entitlements; the disclosure of information to scheme members, the standards of administration of schemes and the general monitoring of pension scheme performance.  The board also recommend the establishment of a national pensions board to monitor the <Col N="2418" /> implementation of the proposed new requirements and to advise on developments in pension schemes generally.</P>
    <P>The process of consulting with the interests involved, i.e., the employers, trade unions and pension industry, in regard to the board's various recommendations, commenced immediately after the publication of the report.  I expect that this process of consultation will be completed within a short period and I will then be in a position to bring forward definitive proposals on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a need, as a matter of urgency, to bring in amending legislation regarding the disclosure of information to pension scheme members?  This is causing great concern.  If the establishment of a pensions board will have to await further consultation, perhaps the Minister would bring in legislation in advance of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be treating this as a matter of urgency.  I set the middle of June for the completion of submissions and consultations.  I did so purposely so that the information could be worked on during the summer and we would be in a position to go ahead in the autumn.  I would not regard the setting up of a board as something which would delay that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The legislation will be brought in quite urgently.  The board is not essential to the legislation.  There could be other ways of monitoring even without a board.  It is a matter which is receiving priority attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2419" /> for Social Welfare his estimate for the total number of people in the State now living below the poverty line; the criteria applied in assessing poverty; the percentage of the population this figure represents; the way in which this compares with other EC countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no official poverty line in Ireland.  Studies of poverty here have used different arbitrary lines usually based on a social welfare payment, e.g., the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, which is the basic income due to any person who is in need.  In a study of poverty in this country over the 1973-1980 period, it was estimated that the level of poverty was considerably reduced over this period by reason of improvements in income maintenance policies.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in making worthwhile comparisons with the situation in other EC countries in this area and comparable data are not available.  However, Ireland's gross domestic product per head stands at 70.7 per cent of the EC average, so inevitably the general standard of living of all sections of the population in Ireland is bound to be significantly below the standard of living in most of the other EC countries.</P>
      <P>A more important basis for comparison is the degree of redistribution in the form of social protection services to the weaker sections of the community. In this regard Ireland compares well.  In 1983 the percentage of GDP devoted to social protection in Ireland was 23.9 per cent, just 4 per cent below the average for the nine EC countries, excluding Greece, Spain and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty agency, whose brief includes research into poverty, is at present part financing a major study of poverty being conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  One of the objectives of this study is to establish the extent of poverty and it forms part of a study of a number of EC Countries being co-ordinated under the Statistical Office of the European Communities.  The final European report <Col N="2420" /> will enable valuable comparisons to be made at international level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's lengthy and detailed reply.  Would he not accept that, while we are waiting for analyses and reports, there are people in dire need and that there are readily identifiable needy sectors such as those living alone on unemployment assistance of £34, £35 or £36 per week?  Would the Minister not accept that it should be an urgent priority of social welfare policy to identify and target these groups now for special consideration and help?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the reply, the Deputy asked a whole series of questions within one question and I was asked for comparisons with EC countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Hence the length of the reply.  In relation to the basic levels, unemployment assistance is one of the lower levels.  The long duration unemployment level will be £37.80 from July, whereas personal rates for old age pensioners will be £55 and the widow's pension will be £49.50.  Some areas are lower than others and these will have to receive special attention in any future developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister's Government stop the special increase of £3.50 per week which the previous Government had provided for in relation to those in the catogory I mentioned? Why in the name of God was it stopped when those people are living in dire need?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises specifically from the supplementary reply given by the Minister.  I feel very passionately about that sector of our community.  Did the Minister see &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on 8 May during which Gay Byrne described this country as a Third World <Col N="2421" /> country and would he agree with that description?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the show in question.  The figures I have quoted will go some way towards indicating what our position is in that regard.  It is very far away from what is suggested in the Deputy's statement about &ldquo;The Late Late Show.&rdquo; Nevertheless it is something that will have to be considered on an ongoing basis as money becomes available. The Deputy raised the question of the special allowance for people aged over 45 who are living alone.  That was a measure which was introduced because of a particular political situation in which the previous Government found themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  That political situation has passed.  That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it passed and the Government passed with it.  Unemployment assistance is totally funded by the taxpayer.  It is not part of the insurance fund.  That is where the real problem arises.  Unemployment assistance is currently costing £396 million per annum.  In addition to the basic levels in our schemes, we must also bear in mind that there are certain cash benefits which apply.  Only when you consider the real value of any of our schemes and of the dependant's allowances which go with the basic allowances in conjunction with the cash benefits do you get the full picture. Certainly I will be concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question sought information not on the extent of benefits but on the number of people below the poverty line.  In the first instance, would the Minister give the source of the report he mentioned and which, after all, if it is to answer the question, should give the <Col N="2422" /> number of people concerned?  Would he not agree also that the question asked for the criteria in assessing poverty to be indicated to the House and that the criteria he has announced are not those used for calculating the poverty line in any other country in Europe where the criteria centre around basic needs such as questions of food, nutrition, housing, access to services and so forth?  When does he propose to bring that information to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Deputy was here for the full reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency are currently undertaking that task.  Most of the criteria that have been used to date have been arbitrary criteria in the various studies.  One of them was the study I mentioned and which was carried out by John Roche and based on the analysis of household budget surveys. He used alternative poverty lines.  He used the supplementary welfare allowance level as what he called level A.  He then took a level 20 per cent above that and then a level 40 per cent above that. He found in 1973 at level A, the lowest of those three levels, that the percentage was 9.8.  In 1980 the percentage was down to 4.3.  At poverty line B the level was 15.3 per cent in 1973 and that had reduced to 7.5 per cent in 1980.  At poverty Line C it was 22.7 per cent in 1973 and 12.3 per cent in 1980.  I give that as the latest information available that is directly relevant. The ESRI are conducting a major study in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency, and that I expect will provide the kind of information the Deputy and the rest of the House would like to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his second last reply the Minister referred to the scarcity of resources and the amount of money being spent on social welfare.  I understand that resources are not limitless and I am not even asking that more money would necessarily be spent on the overall Social <Col N="2423" /> Welfare Vote, but would the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need for selectivity, that, for instance, we should not be paying children's allowances to everybody no matter how well off and at the same time ask a certain category of our people to live on £36 or £37 a week?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is raising a matter which is worthy of a specific question on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to suggest in his reply that we were asking for more resources for social welfare.  I am asking for special attention for those below the poverty line and if that means greater selectivity, let us get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to the poverty line, how you determine it and who is living below it, and there are different criteria for assessing that.  It is difficult enough to define that line very clearly.  Nevertheless, as I said to Deputy Higgins, I will be pursuing this in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency.  The Commission on Social Welfare established another line, and the cost of bringing everyone up to that line would be £460 million at 1986 levels.  I wish to make clear to the Deputy the size of the problem.  The commission concluded that the basis they were using was not a particularly good one for the criteria for establishing where poverty lay.  That is the difficulty, and that is the relevance of the study being done by the Combat Poverty Agency.  That study will provide the information on which greater selectivity can be introduced.</P>

      <P>Question No. 10.  I have dwelt on this question for a considerable time.  I appreciate that it is a very important question but all questions on the Order Paper are important to the Chair.  I hope that Deputy Bell will be very brief so that we can pass on to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister to say that social welfare payments here <Col N="2424" /> were 70 per cent of the EC levels.  Most of the parties are selling to the people the question of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the Single European Act referendum campaign and telling people that everything effectively will be equalised in European terms, but I have not heard if the Government have plans to equalise social welfare payments in accordance with the ratification of the Single European Act.  Will the Minister state if that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question and if the Deputy puts one down we can have it considered.  We had a question earlier on the equality which arose from the EC.  It is significant that our joining the EC in 1973 made resources available here which were paid for previously by the taxpayer here to support agriculture. It was the freeing up of those which made it possible to increase social welfare benefits during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did it come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a redistribution of, for instance, the milk support moneys in 1973 which were than available to the Government to put elsewhere.  That is what happened in practice.  Fair enough, taxpayers' money had to go to support agriculture but subsequently it did not have to go for that purpose and went in this direction instead.  During the years 1980 to 1982 &mdash; I was Minister at the time &mdash; there were still substantial increases in social welfare, 25 per cent each year.  I accept that since that time the general situation has become much more difficult. I accept also what Deputy Mitchell and others have said, that there is a need now for more information and greater selectivity in future decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to simplify the social welfare appeals machinery, emphasising impartiality and ensuring that it operates on uniform criteria for eligibility.  Recommendations in this respect were also made by the Commission on Social Welfare.  A detailed review of the appeals system is at present being completed by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for reforming the system.  The need to establish more clearly the independence of appeals officers is one of the matters which is being addressed in the context of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a constitutional action ever been launched against this system where the deciding officer makes a decision and an appeals officer within the same office decides the appeal, subject, of course, to any appeal to the High Court on a point of law?  Would the Minister agree that the system smacks of partiality in the public mind?  By the way, this is not criticism of the officers concerned. It is the system which is defective. Would the Minister agree that when the Commission on Social Welfare reported on 14 May 1986 one of their recommendations was that an appeals office should be established as a separate executive office with an independent chairman? Surely that would solve the problem.  Another recommendation was that information on the rejection of the appeal should be given to the appellant. This is an area where there is another serious defect, where we as Dáil Deputies can never respond to the many appeals. Something like 17,000 appeals were launched in 1985.  The weakness arises in that we can never give information to those persons who have been refused <Col N="2426" /> applications by a deciding or appeals officer.  I also urge that the appeals office should publish an annual report which would include, where appropriate, policy recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider that proposal because the system, as it operates at present, is unjust and unfair and we have an obligation to bring about justice in the system.  Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, rectify that system which operates unjustly against many thousands of people annually? It is the system I am criticising, not the people who operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should point out that the number of appeals lodged in 1985 represented 1.4 per cent of the total number of claims made under all schemes.  The Deputy is correct when he says there is a perception that the appeals officers are working within the Department and consequently can be seen to be within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a perception that they would be accountable to the Minister and would not be independent in their view.  That is not the way the system operates.  As Deputies probably know very well from their experience, they operate independently.  Indeed that is what the Commission on Social Welfare found.  They made four recommendations. They recommended that an appeals office should be established, as a separate executive office, with an independent chairman.  That was their first proposal.  Second, they recommended that information on the reason for the rejection of an appeal should be given to an appellant.  Third, they recommended that such appeals office should publish an annual report and include, where appropriate, policy recommendations.  Lastly they recommended that supplementary welfare appeals should be included in the <Col N="2427" /> general appeals system.  These matters are being considered as part of the review.  I should stress that we are satisfied that the office acted independently but nonetheless felt there were improvements needed, also that it was important that it be seen to be independent by the public at large and, for that reason, suggested a separate executive office.  I would regard this as a priority matter. That is why I am having it urgently reviewed with a view to implementing revisions.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's impartiality and integrity.  But I would not be too happy about the last part of his reply when he said that civil servants are reviewing themselves and the system under which they and their colleagues operate.  I consider that strange, to say the very least.  Will the Minister give the House an undertaking that he will keep a close eye on that position?  I stress that <Col N="2428" /> it is not the civil servants I am criticising but rather the system under which they operate.  We, the politicians &mdash; who come in for so much criticism &mdash; are responsible for that system which is a false, bad and unjust one.</P>

      <P>Of course the system has been reviewed by the Commission on Social Welfare as an outside body.  It is something in which I am engaging but I do not physically run around collecting pieces of paper and so on; sometimes I have to but not all the time.  The Deputy can be assured that, as Minister, I am reviewing it but the people who are undertaking that work for me at present are civil servants.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the present appeals system is totally unsatisfactory for another reason also which arises, first of all, from the incredible complexity of the social welfare code which rivals that of the income tax code? Would he agree that this means, in effect, that an unfortunate appellant, to whom such an appeal can be very important, who may be inarticulate and not in a position to understand the conditions applicable to a situation, has to appear before an appeals officer and is incapable of presenting his appeal without some assistance.  It is very important, in the interest of justice, that technical assistance should be provided to an appellant to brief him or her on what are the issues, what evidence they would need to call or produce to an appeals officer.  Is the Minister prepared to organise such assistance on the part of officers in his Department to unfortunate people who must appear as appellants before an appeals officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider the Deputy's suggestion in the light of the review.  One problem may well be that people do not always realise their right to an appeal at the appropriate time. The hearing of appeals, judging from results, would certainly appear to be very fair.  Indeed, that is what the Commission <Col N="2429" /> on Social Welfare found.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the most troublesome part of this appeals system is when the doctor of an appellant on disability benefit disagree with a medical referee, when a person is disallowed disability benefit by a medical referee but will not be given a final certificate to return to work by his doctor and is left without any income whatsoever?  Is the Minister aware that there is an acute problem here and is he examining it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of most Deputies I find myself confronted by such cases as a Deputy as well.  As the Deputy will know, what happens is that if one decision is taken by a medical referee, if the person concerned is not happy with that decision, a second medical referee is brought in to examine the case separately. Indeed, if the Deputy looks at the Written Replies which will be available at 4 o'clock he will find there is a case today in which a second medical referee found a person to be unfit whereas the first medical referee had not so found.  These people act independently and, if we want the system to operate properly, we must let them act independently. That is the first safeguard. After that the question of appeals arises if one is not satisfied.  The main problem encountered in regard to appeals is the provision of information.  Quite often &mdash; say, in the case of a back problem &mdash; people do not produce information from a specialist when appearing before a medical referee.  In those circumstances one often finds that such an appeal is upheld by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Most areas of my Department have computerised facilities but the local officers dealing with unemployment payments operate mainly on a clerical and manual basis.  A start has been made on the process of computerising unemployment payments and so far some 30,000 unemployment assistance cases in the Dublin area have been computerised. The computerisation of all local offices will take a number of years to complete because of the size of the task and the decentralised manner in which payments are administered.  Unemployment payments are administered through a network of over 120 local offices around the country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other short term payments which have been computerised work is presently underway to modernise and update the computer systems so that they will be more flexible and capable of responding to changes in the schemes that might arise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics dealing specifically with the number of complaints received regarding the failure of <Col N="2431" /> employers to pay social insurance contributions are not held in my Department.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions for failure to pay contributions are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who are the collection agency.  Any cases of defaulting employers discovered by my Department are passed on to the Revenue Commissioners for appropriate action.  In 1984 my Department reported 3,161 employers.  The figures for 1985 and 1986 were 2,667 and 2,797 respectively.  In 1987 to date, 812 employers have been reported to the Revenue Commissioners for failure to pay contributions.</P>
      <P>My Department institute court proceedings against employers who fail to co-operate with or who obstruct social welfare officers in carrying out their investigatory duties.  In 1985, seven employers were prosecuted for this type of offence and there were six cases in 1986.  With regard to other forms of abuse of social welfare schemes by employers, such as collusion with employees in regard to the fraudulent receipt of sickness and unemployment payments, it is the policy of my Department to institute court proceedings against employers where there is sufficient evidence to do so.  There were no such prosecutions in 1985 and 1986.</P>
      <P>The practice of some employers of avoiding or delaying payment of PRSI contributions is not acceptable and I am concerned to see that effective action is taken in this area.  While the primary responsibility for the collection of PRSI contributions rests with the Revenue Commissioners I will be ensuring that the inspectorate of my own Department will continue to have an important role in detecting cases of non-payment of contributions. I am particularly concerned to see effective combined action by Revenue and Social Welfare in this area so that this particular form of abuse, the burden of which in the final analysis falls on other contributors and on taxpayers generally, is eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I refer the Deputy to his question.  He asked for certain numbers which I have provided and he also asked for the numbers of prosecutions and the measures I intend to take to eliminate this abuse.  As I pointed out in the reply, prosecutions for failure to pay contributions are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who are the collecting agency, and we report to them immediately. I gave the figures of the people whom we reported to the Revenue Commissioners. We will also try, in the development of our computer systems, to link up with the Revenue Commissioners as quickly and as urgently as possible to ensure that that information is dealt with immediately.  The ensuing action is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. On the other hand, the Deputy now mentions a different aspect, that of people waiting months for payments. If the Deputy has any cases in mind I will do anything I can to hurry up such payments because I agree entirely that the employee, where he or she has paid contributions and the employer has not submitted them, should not be left without benefit.  If the Deputy is aware <Col N="2433" /> of any cases I will certainly pursue them very urgently.</P>

      <P>The total estimated cost of unemployment payments by my Department in 1987 (including payments to smallholders) is £694.33 million.  This provision is based on projections supplied to my Department of the average rate of unemployment during the year.  The figure underlying the 1987 provision is 241,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2434" /> The thrust of Government policy is towards reducing unemployment and a number of measures in the social welfare and other areas have been designed with this objective in view, such as for example the national Jobsearch programme being spearheaded by my Department.  It is too early as yet to assess the impact of such policies and I do not propose, therefore, to speculate at this stage on what the likely outturn by my Department will be on unemployment payments this year.</P>

The full impact of the measures of economic development in the budget will not be seen until later in the year.  The impact of these will have to be seen before one will know the average for the year.  The 241,000 is on average an increase of 5,000 above last year's figure of 236,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that, taking seasonal factors into account, unemployment figures always fall in the month of April but this year they went up and that <i>prima facie</i> this would indicate at least a strong possibility that the average numbers of registered unemployed will be greater than those which were taken into account in the budget Estimates?  Will he not also accept that the overall effect of the budget is deflationary and will cause not less but <Col N="2435" /> more unemployment as is evidenced in the impact of the health cuts?</P>

This figure is on average 5,000 per month above last year's figure.  That has already been taken into account in the estimation of the figures for the current year.  The impact of the Government's measures in relation to tourism, agricultural development and other areas will not be felt until somewhat later in the year and obviously that was taken into consideration in arriving at the Estimates.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the overall impact of the budget is deflationary?  There will be some benefits, I hope great benefits, from the further improvements in the regime for tourism and agriculture, as the Minister said I hope they will have a great impact.  As against that, the estimate by the Central Bank is that there will be a 0.5 per cent increase in economic growth this year and some people think that is optimistic.  Even if that is the case, does the Minister not know that in order to maintain unemployment at a static level there would need to be about a 4 per cent increase in economic growth.  Is he not therefore avoiding the question by not admitting that unemployment rates will be much greater than is provided for in the Estimates, even allowing for emigration?</P>

      <P>As announced in the budget, the Government have decided to extend the existing social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons from October 1987.</P>
      <P>I recently met with representatives of the Irish Dental Association to discuss the implementation of the extension in so far as it relates to dental benefit.  In the course of the meeting I agreed that, in the context of the arrangements for the extension, a review could take place in order to consider if improvements could be made in the social welfare dental benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The representatives of the Irish Dental Association undertook to consider this with their executive in the context of the Government's decision to extend the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who will benefit under the extension will include dependent spouses of PAYE workers and dependent spouses of insured unemployed, of disability benefit <Col N="2437" /> recipients and of retirement and old age contributory pensioners.  The extension is primarily targeted at providing the benefits of the scheme to wives working in the home.  In relation to those matters which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health, I understand that that Minister proposes to have discussions with the Irish Dental Association shortly.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to define &ldquo;community dental health&rdquo; before October 1987, when dependent spouses of insured workers will qualify for dental benefit under the social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The possibility of one Department taking over all responsibility for the provision of dental services has been raised before and will be considered in conjunction with the Minister for Health.  In the meantime, I will be proceeding in October this year with the extension of cover under the social insurance scheme.</P>

      <P>The operations research section of the Department of the Public Service carried out a survey of the medical referee system and reported their findings in January 1986.  One of the results of that survey was a recommendation that the referral system should focus its efforts on claims by reference to factors such as age, incapacity and length of time on benefit.  It was shown that it was neither cost effective nor efficient to target groups on the basis of sex or marital status.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that the rates of claim among unskilled and manual workers was high.  It further highlighted the preponderance of married women in this category.  One of the reasons for that would be that married women would have left work and come back into employment having to take jobs which were not well paid.  Married women accounted for 46.7 per cent of those in the unskilled manual group and single women 40.8 per cent, as against 13.6 per cent of married women and 18.3 per cent of single women in the skilled white collar worker category.  The Deputy will see that the biggest difference between the two categories covers married women &mdash; 46.8 per cent in the unskilled manual category and 13.6 per cent in the skilled white collar category.  One has to bear these variations in mind when looking at the overall picture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to equalise the rights under the law of all children, whether born within or outside marriage. The Government fully support that purpose. That is why we are proceeding with the Bill, initiated by the previous administration. The Bill follows on consideration of the Law Reform Commission's Report on Illegitimacy of 1982.  It has received support from all shades of political interest represented in this House, from the churches and from a wide range of interest groups.  I am sure I can rely on Deputies to assist in securing its expeditious passage through the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill is wide-ranging and comprehensive. In its opening provisions it enunciates a general principle of equality whereby, for the purposes of this Bill and of all future Acts, the family relationship between any two people is to be determined without regard to whether any person's parents have married each other.  It goes on to apply this principle to guardianship, maintenance and property law, including succession rights.  The Bill also introduces important new provisions regarding declarations of parentage, blood testing as an aid to establishing paternity, presumptions of parentage and other evidential matters.  Finally, it amends the law dealing with the registration of births of children whose parents are not married to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area of the law not dealt with in the Bill in which there is inequality of treatment as between persons having regard to the marital status of their parents is capital taxation.  The necessary changes in taxation law to remedy that <Col N="2500" /> will be incorporated in a suitable Finance Bill which will be introduced at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to eliminate all legal discrimination against children born outside marriage and, I would suggest, succeeds in that aim for all practical purposes.  However, as I will explain later when I come to deal with guardianship, the Bill retains, unavoidably, a distinction in the matter of guardianship rights of the father depending on whether he has married the child's mother, and in that sense at least children born outside marriage will still be recognisably in a different legal category.  I would emphasise that for all practical purposes this is the only area in which the law will treat children differently depending on whether their parents have married each other, and I think most people will agree that there are very good reasons why a distinction should remain in this area.</P>
    <P>The general principle of the Bill is set out in section 3, which provides that in this and future Acts, except where the contrary intention appears, family relationships will be calculated without regard to the marital status of any person's parents.  The special position of adopted children and their adoptive parents is catered for.  Section 3, as a result of the commencement provision at section 1, will come into effect one month after the passing of the Bill.  The remaining parts of the Bill will come into effect six months at the latest, after its passing: this is to allow time for the making of rules of court and ministerial regulations necessary for the smooth operation of the various procedures provided for in the Bill.  Section 1 enables parts of the Bill to be brought into effect earlier than six months after its passing, and I intend to avail myself of that power if the necessary rules and regulations are ready before that date.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives statutory recognition to the existing principle that the fact that one's parents have not married each other is not a bar to Irish citizenship. Thus, a child born abroad to an Irish man and a foreign woman, who are not married to each other, is an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2501" /> Part II of the Bill consists of one substantive section, namely, section 7. Under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, the subsequent marriage of the parents of a child born outside marriage has the effect of making that child legitimate.  However, there is an exception to this rule where the parents could not have been married to each other at the time of the birth or at any time during the previous ten months.  Section 7 removes that exception.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part III of the Bill, which is concerned with the important question of guardianship.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which codified our law in this area, provides that the court, in any proceedings relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, must treat the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. We, as legislators, must also, in amending guardianship law, pay due regard to that principle.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in their Report on Illegitimacy, recommended that all parents should be guardians of their children, irrespective of whether they had married each other.  The reasoning behind this recommendation appears to have been a desire for consistency between it and the basic recommendation of the commission's report that the concept of illegitimacy be removed from the law altogether.</P>
    <P>The recommendation was unacceptable because of the practical effects which would ensue from it.  By and large, in our society, the mother of a child born outside marriage ends up having to look after the child herself.  While there are, of course, many exceptions, the father generally simply does not want to know, and if pursued for maintenance, will generally try to avoid his responsibilities. The notion that fathers, in circumstances such as these, should by law automatically be guardians of their children, and have the same rights in regard to these children as married fathers have, could not be justified because it would not take sufficient account of the actual situation nor could it take sufficient <Col N="2502" /> account of the interests of the individual child.</P>
    <P>The solution suggested by the Law Reform Commission to deal with any problems caused by their recommendation was that the mother should have the right to go to court in order to relieve the father of his position as guardian, even before the birth of the child.  This would clearly put an intolerable burden on the child's mother; she would have to take the initiative of going to court in order to secure the position in relation to the child which, under existing law, is hers by right, and all this at a time when she would already be under the physical and emotional strain arising from the pregnancy or birth.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the father of a child born outside marriage should in no circumstances be allowed to become guardian of his child.  Indeed, many of us will have come across circumstances where parents who are not married to each other are bringing up their children in a stable atmosphere; where the father, although he cannot under present law be the legal guardian, acts with the mother's co-operation and consent as guardian of the children jointly with her.</P>
    <P>All this brings me to the approach to guardianship taken at Part III of the Bill. This amends the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, so as to enable the father of a child who has not married the child's mother to apply to court to become the child's guardian.  The court will, in deciding any application, treat the child's welfare as the first and paramount consideration.  If the court appoints the father as guardian, he will be guardian jointly with the mother.  His appointment as guardian can be terminated by the court on the application of the mother where the court thinks that is in the interest of the child.  There is provision for a special, informal procedure which can be used by the father to apply for guardianship if the mother agrees, and if he has been registered as the child's father in the births register.</P>
    <P>Under this approach the <i>status quo</i> is preserved, whereby the mother remains sole guardian of her child born outside <Col N="2503" /> marriage unless the father takes the initiative of applying to become joint guardian.  Most important, it protects the interests of the child in each case.  At the same time, it gives the father of the child the opportunity, if he is sufficiently interested and concerned to grasp it, to take a full and active part in the upbringing of his child, which will be recognised by the law.  This policy has the support of many voluntary groups and organisations who deal with the problems faced by single parents and their children.</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with at Part III is the position of the father of a child of a void marriage or of a voidable marriage which has been annulled.  Under existing law, the child in such a case is illegitimate, and thus the father is not guardian.  It seems unjust that, in a case where a father may have acted as guardian in the belief that the marriage ceremony was valid or, in the case of a voidable marriage, where he has been treated in law as guardian, the decree of nullity should operate to remove him from office as guardian. Accordingly, provision is being made to ensure that in every case where a voidable marriage has been annulled, and in any case where the father entered into a void marriage in good faith, he should be guardian of any children of the union jointly with the mother.  I will be proposing some amendments to these provisions on Committee Stage, arising out of points made on the Report Stage of the Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with maintenance. This part replaces the present procedures under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, as amended by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, with new provisions to cater for children whose parents are not married to each other, in more or less the same way as that Act provides for the maintenance of dependent children of married parents.  Among the more important effects of the changes are that either parent of a child born outside marriage will now be able to obtain a court order requiring the other parent to contribute <Col N="2504" /> to the child's maintenance; the time-limits after the child's birth for applying for maintenance are being abolished; and it will no longer be an absolute requirement that the mother's evidence be heard and corroborated.</P>
    <P>Of course, if an alleged father denies paternity, it will be necessary to prove the matter on the balance of probabilities, and it is generally easier to prove paternity if the events in question are in the recent past and if the mother's evidence is available and supported by other evidence.  Moreover, modern methods of blood testing have brought a very high degree of certainty into the establishment of paternity.</P>
    <P>One area of the law where inequality between persons born within and outside marriage is most glaring is that dealing with property rights.  Deputies will be aware that the child of parents who have not married each other has no rights in his father's estate.  What is, perhaps, not so well known, but is just as discriminatory, is that if the mother of a child born outside marriage dies intestate, that child can share in her estate only if the mother left no children born to her within marriage.  Furthermore, any reference in a will or deed to a person's children or any other family relation excludes persons related through an extra-marital link.  Part V of the Bill brings about changes in the law in this area so that there will no longer be discrimination against persons based on the marital status of their parents.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill ensures that, in all wills and other dispositions made after the commencement of Part V, the new principle set out in section 3 of the Bill will apply.  That principle is, as I have said, that family relationships should be calculated without regard to the marital status of any person's parents, except where the contrary intention appears. The new rule will not affect wills made before the commencement of Part V, even though the person who made the will dies after that date: for the law to change retrospectively the meaning of a person's will would be wrong in principle, <Col N="2505" /> as not all testators might have the opportunity to restore the original intended meaning of their wills.</P>
    <P>Section 28 offers protection to trustees and personal representatives against the consequences of distributing property, without having ascertained that there is anyone entitled to a share whose claim is calculated through a person whose parents have not married each other.  This provision was criticised in the Seanad as being too sweeping in its protection.  I agree that there is some justification for the criticism, and I hope to bring forward a suitable amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Most of the remaining provisions of this part are concerned with applying the general principle of equality to the Succession Act, 1965.  Thus, the rules of intestate succession will now be interpreted as applying irrespective of whether any person's parents had married each other.  A person born outside marriage will have the same entitlement to a share in the estate of a parent who dies without having made a will as his brothers and sisters, or half-brothers and half-sisters, born within marriage.  In addition, section 117 of the 1965 Act will give the same right to a child born outside marriage as it does at present to children born within marriage to apply to court for just provision out of the estate of a deceased parent who made a will and who failed in his moral duty to make proper provision for the claimant.  This will apply to all cases where the parent dies after the commencement of Part V, irrespective of when the will was made.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the area of succession I should like to refer to the provision at section 34 which allows for an exception to the general principle that entitlement to succeed should be independent of whether any person's parents have married each other.  Normal application of the rules for distribution on intestacy means that if a person dies intestate leaving neither spouse nor issue, his parents will share his estate equally.  Where the parents have not married each other, however, section 34 will enable a court to exclude the father if it is satisfied that <Col N="2506" /> he did not contribute substantially to his child's upbringing.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission considered this matter in their report, and recommended against such an exclusion. There are arguments both for and against having a provision of this kind, and I remain open to persuasion as to whether section 34 should be retained or dropped from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill sets up a new statutory procedure to enable anyone to obtain a declaration of his or her parentage. This new procedure is in addition to, and will not supersede or replace, the existing procedure under which a person's parentage can, if it is raised as a preliminary issue in, say, maintenance or succession proceedings, be determined for the purposes of those proceedings. The new procedure provided for in the Bill is designed to cater for the situation where no other relief is sought than a declaration as to one's parentage.  There are safeguards to ensure that a person's parentage cannot frivolously or vexatiously be put in question by another, and to give the Attorney General a role in, for instance, cases where there is no other party to put the case against that of the applicant.</P>
    <P>An increasingly important source of evidence in proceedings involving questions of parentage is the blood test.  One of the difficulties with this evidence at present is that its value is set at nought if samples of blood are not made available for testing by everyone concerned.  If, say, an alleged father refuses to give a blood sample, the court is helpless: it can draw no satisfactory conclusions from other blood tests carried out in the absence of that sample, nor can it compel the alleged father to provide a sample nor impose any sanction if he refuses. Part VII of the Bill, as well as setting out a statutory procedure providing for the taking of blood samples and the giving of blood test evidence, will enable the court to draw whatever inferences it thinks appropriate from a refusal to give a sample.  The provisions of this part are all the more timely because of the technological advances which have been <Col N="2507" /> made recently in the area of DNA profiling, which is likely to be used more and more frequently because of its capability, unlike existing tests on blood, to give a positive indication of parentage.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill makes a number of significant changes in the law of evidence. The most notable of these changes is the abolition of the presumption of legitimacy at section 47, and its replacement, at section 49, with a presumption of paternity arising out of marriage.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in this part will enable findings of parentage in certain types of cases to be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence in subsequent proceedings, and will give statutory effect to the abolition of the old rule whereby spouses could not give evidence which would tend to show that a child of one of them was illegitimate; in 1983, the High Court held that this rule was unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill makes changes in the births registration code so as to facilitate the entry of the father's name on the births register in the case of a child of unmarried parents.  At present, the father's name can be entered only at the joint request of the parents, who must both attend at the registration office to sign the register.  This contrasts with the position where the parents are married, when full details are usually supplied to the registrar by a person who attended the birth or by a member of the staff of a maternity hospital.  This part also puts on a statutory basis the procedure, laid down by the High Court in 1983, for entry of the father's name on the register in any case where a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband, and all three are agreed on the facts.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind Deputies that this Bill is a major piece of reforming legislation, which will bring an important area of our family law fully into line with present day standards of social justice.  It also has important implications on the international plane.  Deputies will be aware that the European Court on Human Rights, in its recent judgment in the case of <i>Johnston v. Ireland,</i> found that this country was in breach of its <Col N="2508" /> obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The court held that the absence in this country of an appropriate legal regime reflecting the natural family ties between parents who have not married each other and their child amounted to a failure to respect the family life of the parents and child.  In coming to its decision, the court was mainly concerned with the discrimination in our succession laws against children born outside marriage and the absence of any provision in our law recognising the link between these children and their fathers.  The enactment of this Bill and the consequential changes in revenue law to which I referred earlier will remedy that breach.  Enactment will also enable this country to ratify the European Convention on the Status of Children Born out of Wedlock.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I think I am correct in saying that this is the first occasion on which the Minister, since his appointment in this Government's term, has been in the House introducing legislation. I would like to congratulate him on his appointment and to say how pleased I am that this Bill is before the House.  This Bill was introduced by the previous Government and it is a measure to which my party have been committed for many years.  It is a measure which a former constituency colleague of mine introduced in the Seanad.  During the course of the debate in the Seanad on this Bill we saw the legislative process working in a way we frequently do not see it working in this House in that the measure now before the Dáil is a measure improved in a number of respects from the original Bill as published.  Clearly, the then Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, the former Deputy Nuala Fennell who is now a Senator, was open to amendments and proposals in this legislation when it was before the Seanad.  Indeed, the Bill has been substantially improved in the context of the one now before this House.</P>

      <Col N="2509" /> I suppose in congratulating the Minister on his appointment I might congratulate him also on what I think is a first since I was elected to this House in 1981.

      <P>I welcome the fact that this measure is before the House and that there is now a more constructive approach being adopted by the Government on matters relating to children's rights and to the status of children.  I hope that the Minister in dealing with this measure in this House will deal with it in as constructive a way as the former Minister for Women's Affairs dealt with it in the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is considering amendments although it is regrettable that he does not give us in some instances an indication of what amendments he may have in mind.  I welcome the Minister's open approach in that he is seeking comments from Members of this House in relation to particular sections of this Bill. I intend during the course of my contribution to indicate a number of measures in this Bill which I think require further change so as to ensure that the Bill works in the way intended and does not leave lacunas and anomalies with regard to children and their rights after its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a measure of some considerable importance.  Since the foundation of the State we have discriminated against a group of children.  We have labelled children born out of wedlock as illegitimate and have effectively made them second class citizens.  We have denied them their statutory rights and entitlements which extend to all other children and in so doing we have found ourselves condemned in the European Court of Human Rights as being in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and rightly condemned. We have been seen not merely to deny a position of equality to children who should be entitled to be treated equally regardless of their status but also to deprive them of basic legal rights and entitlements by not using our court procedures to establish very basic things such as their identity and who is their father and to ensure that adequate financial protections are available to them and that <Col N="2511" /> if they are part and parcel of a family, though, through no fault of theirs, they were born outside wedlock, that they will be treated in an equal way with all other children.  It is a matter of particular disappointment that the discriminations embodied in our statutory law with regard to children should be regarded and should have been regarded as discriminations which were justifiable within the constitutional framework within which we operate.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that whereas in a decision relating to the rights of children on intestacy when a parent dies without making a will our Supreme Court held it was justifiable under our Constitution to discriminate against children, the European Court on Human Rights took an entirely different view.  In this context the European Court in dealing with the proceedings the Minister mentioned took a more considered view of the position of children and their rights in the Johnson case which came before it.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House was introduced as a result of a great deal of public pressure and agitation for reform of our law in this area over the years.  It is only right that tribute be paid to organisations such as Cherish, the Federation for Single Parents and other single parent groups and organisations who have sought and pressurised for change.  We should also mention organisations such as CARE, the Campaign for Deprived Children, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Dr. Barnardo's Homes and organisations such as the free legal advice centres.  All of these over the past 15 years have been in the forefront of the campaign to bring about legal equality as between children.</P>
    <P>Mention should also be made of the very comprehensive report produced in this area by the Law Reform Commission who dealt in 1982 in their report with this whole area of the law and with many of the discriminations that should be addressed and highlighted the need for reform. They effectively recommended that in regard to children there should be no discrimination and that all children <Col N="2512" /> should be put in a position of legal equality. In this context it is also worth noting that the Episcopal Council for Social Welfare, which is a committee of the Roman Catholic bishops, in a report on Irish family law in 1975 recommended that the law in this area be changed.  It is possibly a criticism of this House and of successive Governments over the years that only now are we at this stage.  We move very slowly in the implementation of major social reform, even when it appears there is a political consensus that such reform is necessary.  I suspect if it were not for the Johnson case in the European Court we might still not have measures such as this before the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is largely devoted to placing children in a general position of equality regardless of the circumstances relating to their birth.  It is effectively devoted to ensuring that a child can establish, where there is any doubt about it, who his mother and father are and to ensuring that children will have equal rights with regard to guardianship, property and financial matters, <i>vis-á-vis</i> their parents, irrespective of the circumstances relating to their birth.</P>
    <P>The measure is also designed to improve the position of the father of the child born outside marriage and to extend to such a father the possibility and opportunity of participating as a guardian of his child in the important decision-making processes relating to that child.  The measure is also designed to try to bring Irish law into line with some other modern scientific developments which seek to assist in the establishment of paternity where there is a dispute with regard to the paternity of the child.  For many years there would seem to have been a necessity for a measure in our statutory provisions to provide for the carrying out of blood tests in the area of seeking to establish paternity.  Legislation relating to blood testing was enacted in most other countries in Europe very many years ago.</P>
    <P>What is regrettable about this Bill is that we have been so slow in producing it.  In the general order of dealing with the issues of paternity, and even with the <Col N="2513" /> issues of children and their birth, this Bill seems to be locked still in a time frame circa the sixties.  The Bill seems to ignore, to a degree which I find surprising, the great developments in the scientific area that have taken place in the past four to five years in the establishment of paternity and in the use of scientific testing in this area.  This is an issue going through certain provisions of the Bill to which I wish to revert.</P>
    <P>The Bill also appears to ignore a matter I would accept and understand as being regarded as of some considerable sensitivity, a matter which the Law Reform Commission in their report in 1982 chose not to deal with in any great detail but one which has become more urgent in 1987 and of more public importance than it appeared it might be in 1982 when the Law Reform Commission reported.  The matter to which I am referring is not addressed at all in the Bill, although it is addressed in similar legislation currently going through the Westminister Parliament. This means if this Bill is passed without this issue being properly addressed, considering it is the first time since 1930 that we have had a Bill largely dealing with the position of children born outside marriage it is unlikely it will be addressed before the year 2000.  There is an issue to which I have not yet reverted in any detail which is excluded from this Bill which I want to mention and I would ask the Minister to examine it in a constructive, non-controversial and sensitive way with a view to dealing with it in the context of this Bill.  That issue I shall deal with shortly.  In doing so it is in the context of the general and the important provisions which seek to ensure the manner in which relationships between parents and children can be deduced.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is an important section.  It is the section which seeks to ensure that the marital status of parents is to be of no effect in real terms in determining relationships.  In that section it is stated that &ldquo;the relationship between every person and his father and mother (or either of them) shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be determined irrespective of whether his father and <Col N="2514" /> mother are or have been married to each other and all other relationship shall be determined accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill in section 9 seeks to provide for certain amendments to the Guardianship of Infants Act which legislation is concerned with determining when someone is and is not the guardian of the child. In that section, in amending the 1964 Act, the Bill defines a father as including a male adopter under an adoption order but as not including the father of an infant who has not married that infant's mother and in respect of whom no order under section 6A is in force.  In other words, an order under section 6A is of importance in determining whether a father is to have guardianship rights.  Such an order can effectively be made in regard to a child born outside marriage in circumstances in which, to put it simply, the mother consents and acknowledges someone to be the father or where there is a contest where the court believes that in the interest of the child's welfare an alleged father be determined to be the father and be given such guardianship rights.  I am referring to these sections and I am only doing so in a general way because on Committee Stage we shall have to come back to them.  I am leading up to an issue to which we should make reference.</P>
    <P>The other matter of relevance relates to section 49 in which there are certain presumptions regarding the paternity of a child.  It provides, very sensibly, that where a mother gives birth to a child during a subsisting marriage the husband of the marriage is presumed to be the father of her child.  The position nowadays is that if somebody gives birth to a child in marriage it is presumed that her husband is the father of the child.  The section also provides that if within a period of 10 months after the termination by death or otherwise of a marriage to which the mother is a party a child is born the husband is also presumed to be the father.  No difficulties of any nature can arise in such cases.  The Bill also provides that it can be presumed someone is the father of a child if that person's name is on the birth certificate as the father. Basically, there is the question of consent <Col N="2515" /> there.  One assumption made throughout the Bill is that the giving of birth and the conception of children is a relatively straightforward exercise and, fortunately, for the majority of people it is. For the majority of people children are conceived by sexual intercourse taking place within marriage, or outside marriage, and as a result a child is conceived and a child is born.  There are unfortunate couples who find themselves in a very distressing position within marriage. They find that for physiological or other reasons they lack the capacity to have children with each other in the usual way in which children are conceived.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of couples who cannot have their own children the adoption mechanism up to now provided a means whereby they can bring a child into their family, act as parents to that child and have a full family life with children. Of course, the number of children now available for adoption, despite the increase in the number of illegitimate children born in recent years, is decreasing and people are looking to other methods and ways of conceiving children. It is possible for a wife who cannot conceive in the normal way, due to some difficulty on the part of her husband, to have a child by use of artificial insemination, by what is known as AID, by use of the services of the sperm bank.  This is something people in Ireland tend to ignore due to the controversial nature of such processes.  I understand that that service has been available for some time and I have no doubt that a number of children have been born as a result of AID.  It is possible that a number of children have been born to Irish couples by the use of AID in other countries and there is no doubt that in future years children will be born to couples in Ireland by the use of AID.  I am not expressing any views of a moral or religious nature about that but pointing out that in 1987 it is a fact of life here.</P>
    <P>What is not generally understood is that a child born to a wife in those circumstances is under our current law illegitimate.  Within the terms of the Bill <Col N="2516" /> the husband of the wife would not be the father of that child.  I urge the Minister to look at that issue which has a lot of difficulties surrounding it.  In other countries they have managed in their legislation to deal with that issue.  I do not think it is a matter of great difficulty to say that where a couple make use of a system of AID to conceive a child and where such a child is conceived by the consent of the couple that the husband of the mother is in law the father of that child.  This is an issue that we are ignoring.  Like all other issues of this nature we tend to pretend they do not exist until they reach up and hit us.  This legislation is uniquely placed to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>If we do not address the issue in this legislation children born in those circumstances will be the new second class children, the new discriminated against children within the context of Irish legislation. It is not simply a theoretical issue. It is one that is affecting so many countries in the world that in recent years a gigantic amount of legislation has been enacted &mdash; we can deal with that legislation on Committee Stage &mdash; to deal with the issue.  There are other circumstances in which a child can be conceived. Various procedures are used in our hospitals whereby as a result of test tube fertilisation a child of a husband and wife may be conceived by an embryo being implanted in a wife.  In those circumstances there is no difficulty with regard to the relationship of husband and wife as father and mother to their child. It is also possible for that procedure to be used in circumstances where not merely is there a donor's sperm but there is a donor ova and for an embryo to be implanted within a wife.  Again, this is a theoretical issue, something that is happening in other countries, and we have the medical techniques available here to use those techniques.  Where a child is born to a wife in those circumstances a serious question could arise as to her relationship to that child.  Is she the mother of the child?</P>
    <P>I am raising these issues because to date we have sought to ignore them.  They <Col N="2517" /> are of vital importance to a number of couples who find themselves in the unfortunate position that they cannot conceive children in the way the vast majority of couples are able to conceive children. They see medical science offering to them other methods and techniques by which they could have a family in circumstances in which in years gone by couples may have resorted to adoption.  Those people see these medical and scientific techniques available to them at a time when the number of children available for adoption is considerably reduced from what it was some years ago.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look at this area in the context of the Bill.  It is not all that complicated.  It can be fully and promptly dealt with in the context of this legislation. In that regard I should like to refer the Minister to section 27 of the Family Law Reform Bill introduced in the Westminster Parliament and which seeks to determine the legal status in England and Wales of children born as a result of AID.  The effect of it will be that a child born in England and Wales as a result of the insemination of a married woman with sperm other than that from her husband will, unless it is proved that the husband did not consent to such a procedure, be treated in law as the child of the parties to the marriage and not as the child of any other person.  Currently those procedures are being used in Ireland. Children can be born here by use of those procedures and there is grave legal doubt as to the status of such children.  Those doubts will not be resolved in any way by the Bill as drafted.  I urge the Minister to look at section 27 of the Family Law Reform Bill as drafted &mdash; that Bill was before the Westminster Parliament but had not completed its passage when the Parliament was dissolved and a general election called.</P>
    <P>The Bill in dealing with children and their status does not, unfortunately, totally abolish distinctions with regard to appending names to children.  The Bill still preserves in a modified form the legitimacy Act of 1931.  In a sense we still have in our law, though this Bill seeks to <Col N="2518" /> minimise the differences between children born inside of marriage and those born outside of marriage, a legal distinction and a labelling in certain circumstances. For example, in the context of adoption, our Acts refer to children as being illegitimate as opposed to being legitimate.  I would urge the Minister in the context of reforms that may be introduced in the area of adoption to seek to ensure that the terminology that is used in future legislation does not bring us backwards into preserving that is a labelling discriminatory terminology that is more part of the 19th century than the 20th or the 21st centuries.</P>
    <P>This Bill still preserves the ironic position whereby there are distinctions and discriminations between children.  It does nothing in the area of adoption.  It was not designed to do anything in this area but it is worth mentioning in the context of legislation which seeks to place children in a position of legal equality, that in relation to children born within marriage <i>vis-á-vis</i> children born outside of marriage, those born outside of marriage have until now been severely discriminated against.  The one area, where children were not discriminated against was where they did not have someone who wished to care for them and provide them with adequate and proper parenting. At least, children born outside of marriage have the opportunity to be adopted.  We are preserving the discrimination my party sought to have removed from the law last week whereby children, for adoption purposes, are labelled legitimate in the context of the Adoption Acts.  Even after the enactment of this Bill they cannot be adopted in cases where their parents have totally and completely abandoned them.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill which should be welcomed in the context of the effects of decrees of nullity bringing to an end what appeared to be valid marriages but which the courts have determined are invalid marriages.  There have been a number of court cases in recent years in which as a result of the court declaring a voidable marriage to be a nullity, children born to parties to such <Col N="2519" /> proceedings who up until then were assumed to be legitimate had been retrospectively rendered illegitimate, or as the law so graphically described it in some instances, retrospectively bastardised.  In that context I welcome the fact that section 9 in amending the guardianship provisions seeks to maintain, even after the granting of a decree of nullity, the guardianship position of a father in relation to children born to a couple whose marriage has been annulled.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill in this area could have been more simply dealt with. This was my belief when this measure went into the Seanad and it remains my belief.  I am not sure whether it is necessary for us to deal with voidable marriages and void marriages in the context of the guardianship provisions in as tortuous a way as it is dealt with under section 9 in the various amendments made.  I accept the Minister's view that in certain circumstances it may not be appropriate that an automatic guardianship right be conferred on fathers.  In certain instances one could argue that very strongly, for example, in a situation where a woman was raped and became pregnant.  No one in this House would argue that the child born to such a woman should have as her enforced legal guardian the man who behaved in that way.  Of course, that is an exceptional case.  The vast majority of children are not conceived in such circumstances either inside or outside of marriage.</P>
    <P>The guardianship issue could have been dealt with far more simply.  The New Zealand Status of Children Act, 1969, provides an adequate and better precedent for dealing with that issue than the manner in which we are dealing with it in this legislation.  Under the relevant legislation in New Zealand there is an automatic acquisition of parental rights of guardianship in certain circumstances. Section 6 of the New Zealand Guardianship of Infants Act 1968, provides that generally the father and mother of the child shall each be a guardian of the child, but that the mother is a sole guardian if she has been never married to her child's <Col N="2520" /> father or if their marriage was validly dissolved &mdash; presumably that would not arise in Ireland due to the prohibition on divorce &mdash; prior to the child's conception and she and the father of the child were not living together as husband and wife at the time the child was born.  Thus, in New Zealand if the parents of a child born outside marriage are living together when their child is born, both are automatically joint guardians.  If they are not living together the legislation provides a mechanism whereby the father can seek guardianship rights.</P>
    <P>It would be a lot simpler in this legislation to effectively provide that where a child is conceived and born in circumstances where a couple are not married but are living together, the father is a joint guardian.  That would mean that if a decree of annulment was declared, be it a voidable or a void marriage, the father or the former husband would retain guardianship rights.  I raise that because section 9 of the Bill in what is referred to as providing a new section 2 provides that where there is a void marriage which the father reasonably believed, whether due to a mistake of law or fact, was a valid marriage, upon the marriage being declared void within the context of the provisions here, even though the marriage was declared void, the father would retain guardianship rights.  That mirrors the sort of provision that existed in a number of jurisdictions in years gone by, and still does in some other countries.</P>
    <P>In the context of a Bill that seeks to remove the differences between children, it is an unnecessary provision.  I do not know how it can be established after a decree of nullity is granted determining a marriage as void, whether a father reasonably believed or did not reasonably believe that the marriage was valid.  I do not know what that phrase will mean in practical terms.  When will that issue be decided?  If an issue arises directly out of nullity proceedings as to a father's guardianship rights, this Bill should confer a jurisdiction on the High Court when granting a nullity decree in the context of a couple to whom children have <Col N="2521" /> been born, to there and then make a determination as to whether at the time the children were conceived and born the father reasonably believed he had a valid marriage.  This is certainly not a theoretical issue but it is an issue that probably affects many hundreds of couples and probably currently affects the legal relationship that many hundreds, if not thousands, of fathers have to their children.</P>
    <P>The reason this matter is of importance and is not just a technical issue is that currently marriages the law regards as valid are being annulled and held to be void by the marriage tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church.  The Church is currently granting in the region of 200 decrees of nullity a year.  There is also the problem that a large number of people who have obtained Church decrees of annulment are marrying in Church a second time and all of these second marriages are invalid, bigamous and void.  All these marriages can be declared void by our courts currently. The only circumstance in which they are not void is where civil decrees of annulment are granted.  While a figure in the region of 200 Church decrees are being granted each year, only about 25 civil decrees are being granted per annum. There is a wide discrepancy.</P>
    <P>A large number of couples to whom children have been born are parties to what is in law an invalid marriage.  Under this Bill I do not know in what circumstances the fathers of such children will be regarded as guardians.  Have they in all circumstances to fill out a document with a consent?  If this second marriage is declared invalid it seems they could have considerable difficulty.  The fact that they filled out a document and had their names down as fathers of these children may give them certain rights under this legislation, but could they be deprived of guardianship rights because they did not reasonably believe the marriage was valid and were unreasonable in believing it?  I do not know whether an ordinary member of the general public regards a marriage as valid after getting a Church annulment and marrying a second time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2522" /> I do not know whether that is a reasonable or unreasonable belief.</P>
    <P>In a matter of such importance when we are addressing the realities of some of the social problems we have, it is unnecessary for this to be as ambiguous as it is.  If we have to retain it and if we cannot adopt the simpler and more sensible legal formula adopted in New Zealand, at the very least this provision should have a section inserted, which is also in the Guardianship of Infants Act, to the effect that where the court makes a decision that a marriage is null and void, a decision should also be made by the judge there and then as to whether the father of the children reasonably believed that the marriage at some stage was valid.  This would mean that a further court case would not be necessary to determine whether the father should remain as guardian of his children or whether he should lose his guardianship rights.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises in regard to the changes being made to the 1964 Act is the new section 6A which is sought to be inserted.  This section is of considerable importance because it is the section under which if a child is born outside marriage &mdash; and 10 per cent of the total number of births in this State last year were of children born outside marriage &mdash; a procedure is laid down whereby it is decided whether the father of the child can obtain guardianship rights.  Rights of guardianship are not just rights that accrue to a father; one could also argue that a child has a right to have a father acting as his guardian in circumstances where paternity is established. It can be very much in the interests of the child that the father should play a role in the decision-making process with regard to the child's upbringing.  This section effectively lays down that there should be a simple procedure to allow for guardianship orders to be made where the mother consents and where the father is registered.  I would ask the Minister to explain what simple procedures will be required.  I suggest that in circumstances where a mother and a father agree as to the paternity of the child and the woman <Col N="2523" /> agrees to the father's name being on the birth certificate, the father should automatically become a guardian and should not be put to the expense of going to the courts in order to obtain a court order, even to an informal court hearing.</P>
    <P>I have heard a lot about informal court hearings in the context of family law and presumably such an informal court hearing would take place either in the District Court or the Circuit Court.  Informal can mean helpful and easy or it can mean difficult and chaotic, depending on the building within which the court is operating and the personality of the district justice or the Circuit Court judge who is asked to make the decision on the matter. It may or may not require lawyers.  Where a couple agree and consent, I suggest they should not need to incur the expense of lawyers.  It might be appropriate in circumstances where, by consent, the names of a mother and father appear jointly on the birth certificate that the father should automatically become a guardian, possibly with a residual right on the part of the mother to make a court application to have the father's name removed as guardian if it is in the interest of the child's welfare.  In those circumstances the necessity for a court procedure, even a special procedure, should not necessarily arise, both because of the expense that might be incurred and because it seems an unnecessary procedure.</P>
    <P>An area of some concern relates to subsection (1) in section 6A.  Where a mother does not consent, it is open to the father of a child born outside marriage to go to the court and ask to be named as guardian.  Where there is an absence of consent, presumably the mother will object.  That objection could arise in a simple situation where a child is born to a couple who cohabitated for some months and then separated or following a brief liaison of two or three days or one evening or where a couple have a child at a late stage in their relationship after cohabiting for some 20 years.  After the collapse of the relationship the father might feel the need to have his position <Col N="2524" /> protected by being named as legal guardian. It could also arise in the situation I have already mentioned where couples are living together after obtaining a Church decree of annulment when their second relationship breaks down and some difficulty arises.  Presumably they might go to the court by consent where there has been a Church annulment and a remarriage.</P>
    <P>A variety of situations can arise whereby a child is born outside wedlock. A father may come to court and say he wants to act as guardian of his child and to be involved in the joint decision-making process about the child's education or whether the child should be given permission to marry under the age of 18. The mother may say that she does not want this man to be named as guardian because she does not like him.  The court has to make a decision about the matter and the only basis on which the court can make that decision is by having regard to the welfare of the child.  I do not know in what circumstances individual district justices or Circuit Court judges around the country will regard it as in the interests of a child's welfare, where the child has been born outside wedlock, that a person be named as guardian.  I do not know in what circumstances they will regard it as contrary to a child's welfare that a person should not be named as guardian, and particularly where that person is the father of a child born outside marriage.  The courts may need more detailed guidance as to the circumstances of naming a father as guardian.  For example, where the father has an established relationship with the child whether the mother objects to a guardianship order or not, the legislation should provide that where such application is made as a general rule the father should be named as guardian.  Where the parents have lived together for some years and the relationship has built up it is only when the relationship gets into difficulties that the father realises the necessity for making this type of application.  In such circumstances the legislation should spell <Col N="2525" /> out in somewhat greater detail the circumstances in which the Circuit Court or the District Court can make an order.</P>
    <P>Every lawyer who practises and who works in the area of family law knows there are a number of judges and district justices who deal with family law matters in a very sensitive, considerate and rational way and there are a number of others who deal with family law matters in a very inconsiderate, insensitive and irrational way.  I believe there would be a regular outcry about the outcome of some of the family law matters that arise in our courts if hearings of such matters were not held in camera.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of looking at that section and laying down somewhat more detailed guidelines for the courts as to the circumstances in which it is appropriate for a father to be named as guardian of the child where the mother objects to the father being so named.</P>
    <P>For example, if the father is contributing towards the support of the child even though he does not have a relationship with the child, should that in itself entitle him to rights of guardianship? That raises another problem from the point of view of mothers who may feel they should not seek support payments because they may have someone foisted on them as a joint guardian whom they do not wish to have.  All these matters require consideration but I suggest to the Minister that the manner in which the general principle is dealt with is too broad and insufficient guidance is given to the courts in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like other Acts which we have in this general area at various stages, confers powers on the District Court, on the Circuit Court and on the High Court. In the light of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and the unanimous recommendation of that committee that we provide for family courts, I hope the Minister will look at the need to provide for such courts.  The legislation before this House indicates that need.  We are conferring different powers in relation to <Col N="2526" /> different aspects of one family law problem across a broad spectrum of courts who have no great specialist knowledge to deal with the areas referred to.  I urge the Minister during his term of office to look at the need in this area and to consider implementing the recommendations in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown report to provide family courts.  They could provide a far more efficient and effective system not merely for dealing with the various matters referred to in this Bill but for dealing with all the general matters that arise in the area of family law.</P>
    <P>I want to come to a general reference in this legislation which is to be found in a number of sections.  In section 3 and mirrored in later sections the relationship between a child and parents is laid down. Section 3 provides that &ldquo;the relationship between every person and his father and mother ... shall ... be determined irrespective of whether his father and mother are or have been married to each other ...&rdquo; The Bill also seeks to ensure that an adopted person is not affected detrimentally and reiterates what is already part of our law under the Adoption Acts, that effectively an adopted person is deemed from the date of the adoption to be the child of the adopters and not the child of any other person, so as to ensure and reconfirm that the relationship of mother and father and guardian as between parents of children born to them and as between parents and children adopted by them remains the same.</P>
    <P>One very curious provision in this Bill relates to a growing problem but does not tease out what the law is supposed to be. Section 3 (2) (b) provides that:</P>
    <P>In this subsection &ldquo;adopted person&rdquo; means a person who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, or, where the person has been adopted outside the State, whose adoption is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State.</P>
    <P>In effect that is saying that if a couple living in Ireland have adopted a child outside Ireland in circumstances in which <Col N="2527" /> Irish law recognises the adoption order, under this legislation that couple shall have the same relationship to their child as if the child had been born to them.  I welcome the fact that that is in this Bill, but its being in the Bill raises another difficulty.</P>
    <P>A growing number of Irish couples have been and are resorting to adopting outside Ireland.  An increasing number of adoption orders are being made by South American countries such as Chile, Peru and Brazil and countries outside South America such as India and the Philippines, and a growing number of Irish couples living in Ireland are going to these countries for brief periods, perhaps a few weeks or two or three months, adopting there and bringing their adopted child back to Ireland.  They are doing that because of the problem I mentioned, that at present fewer children are available for adoption by couples in this country than has been the case in preceding years.  In the past two or three years the number of children becoming available for adoption by couples unable to have their own children has greatly reduced in real terms and the number of adoption orders the Adoption Board are making in respect of couples unrelated to the child being adopted is greatly reducing. Therefore, Irish couples are resorting to adopting outside Ireland and in a number of different countries.  It is right when a couple go through the correct legal format in another country that they should under Irish law be recognised as having a proper adoption.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the provision in this Bill is that it talks about adoption recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in this State.  No law currently in force in this State sets out the circumstances in which we regard foreign adoption orders as validly vesting parental rights in Irish couples.  There is not a single statutory mechanism for that. None of the Adoption Acts contains any provision setting out the circumstances under Irish law in which we recognise a foreign adoption order as valid.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of legal opinions as <Col N="2528" /> to what might be the circumstances in which we might recognise a foreign adoption order.  As a consequence there is an increasing number of Irish couples adopting outside Ireland, bringing their children back to Ireland, not knowing what is their legal relationship with the children they have adopted in a foreign country.  Some of them are adopting a second time in circumstances in which they can establish that a child adopted abroad is illegitimate, in circumstances in which they can get the mother to sign a consent to adopt under our Adoption Acts.  In some circumstances these children are being adopted a second time pursuant to order made by our Adoption Board but, in many instances, that is not a possibility and that option is not available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the problem is recognised as existing in this Bill.  This is an area of overlapping responsibility between the Minister's Department and that of the Minister for Health.  I would ask the Minister to examine whether it is possible in the context of this Bill &mdash; if it is not it certainly should be in the context of the Adoption Bill that has been promised &mdash; that there be a provision setting out clearly and concisely the circumstances under Irish law in which we recognise as valid in this country adoption orders made in other States.  I might draw to the Minister's attention the fact that the Adoption Review Committee in their report published in 1984 drew the attention of Government to the need for legislation to deal with that area.  But it is unfortunate that this provision &mdash; which recognises that this is a problem area &mdash; does not set out the circumstances in which we do recognise such adoptions.  If the Minister feels it appropriate that that matter be delat with in the context of this Bill I would suggest that he might consider introducing appropriate amendments on that issue.  Certainly it is an issue that we on this side of the House will be seeking to consider in the context of amending this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer in the context of this Bill relates to blood tests and to which the Minister has <Col N="2529" /> already referred.  Until some years ago blood tests had a very simple role to play in the area of determining paternity.  Due to the existence of different blood groupings, by conducting what were the then relatively simple blood tests, it was possible to establish whether someone might be the father of a child.  By looking at what blood grouping a child had and taking a sample of that of the mother and the alleged father it was possible to determine whether the child's blood group could have derived from the birth of a child through sexual relations having taken place between the mother and the person alleged to be the father.  If it was not possible, someone alleged to be the father was excluded from the possibility of being regarded as father.  That did not, of necessity, confirm that that person was the father.  In theory at least he and many thousands of other people with similar blood groupings could have been the father of any particular child.  The section in the Bill as published &mdash; it is phased somewhat differently in different places &mdash; but to a great extent reflects provisions in British legislation that has been in force during the sixties.</P>
    <P>When I said at the outset that I was concerned that the provisions of this Bill have not kept pace with medical science it is because the whole concept of blood testing has advanced considerably in the area of establishing paternity.  What used to be known as simple blood testing became tissue testing, which involved in certain instances the scraping of a skin sample in the context of determining paternity.  We have now advanced to a stage at which what is known as genetic fingerprinting cannot just as a matter of probability but as a matter of absolute certainty &mdash; establish whether someone is or is not the father of a child.  What is known as DNA fingerprinting is a new scientific method available in England and, I understand, likely to be fully available in Ireland in the very near future if not already available.  DNA fingerprinting can establish to an exactitude beyond the competence of the courts whether someone is or is not the father <Col N="2530" /> of a child.  DNA fingerprinting is known as genetic fingerprinting.  The genetic fingerprinting test was discovered and described by Doctor A.J. Jeffreys, an expert in this area in the United Kingdom, as being far more powerful than the series of conventional blood tests generally used to establish family relationships.  It proves beyond doubt whether an alleged father is or is not the true father.  In that sense it differs from the conventional tests.  The genetic information that everyone carries in their cells is inherited from parents.  Effectively, when a DNA fingerprint is produced it resembles in a sense, what is known as the bar code on supermarket goods. Approximately half of the bands are inherited from each of our parents.  Thus this type of test can be used to establish family relationships.  Genetic fingerprinting can now resolve disputes over paternity in a positive way that ordinary blood testing and blood sampling cannot. In effect it can resolve complicated cases which previously could not be solved at all by ordinary blood tests.</P>
    <P>I might draw to the Minister's attention the scientific basis for the type of tests about which I am speaking.  They have been described in full in a number of international scientific journals, for example, in a journal called <i>Nature</i> published in Britain, volume 316, page 76 on 4 July 1985 and in the same publication on 31 October 1985, volume 317, at page 818, this type of scientific testing is described.  More recently on 12 December 1985, in volume 318, page 506, the work done in this area is very extensively commented on and has been generally accepted by the international scientific community.  The technique used in genetic fingerprinting in this context has already been accepted by the courts in the United Kingdom.  The type of DNA fingerprinting I am talking about has been referred to also in legal journals.  It was referred to most recently in the <i>New Law Journal</i> published on 11 April 1986, page 326, which described generally in paternity cases the use that can be made of DNA fingerprinting.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions in this <Col N="2531" /> Bill relating to blood tests in determining paternity are adequate in some respects. But, in so far as blood samples are referred to and the language used in this Bill, I can foresee it being argued that the type of sophisticated genetic fingerprinting mechanism now available and which can be used to determine paternity is not provided for in this Bill, that the references in this Bill to blood samples could be taken as meaning a less sophisticated and simpler type of testing.</P>
    <P>In this context I might draw the Minister's attention to the Family Law Reform Bill which came before the Westminster Parliament, in particular to section 23 which deals with replacing the blood test provisions which were contained in the Family Law Reform Act of 1969, the relevant English legislation which provided by statute for the carrying out of blood tests to determine paternity. Due to the availability of tissue testing and genetic fingerprinting it was felt necessary to deal with this issue in a different way.  In that section there is reference to the use of scientific tests to ascertain whether a party to proceedings is or is not the father or indeed the mother of a child.  In that legislation, the terminology &ldquo;scientific testing&rdquo;, is very carefully used.  Scientific tests are defined as meaning scientific tests carried out and made with the object of ascertaining the inheritable characteristics of body fluids or body tissue.</P>
    <P>I can see that one might engage in a legalistic argument as to whether the provisions in Part VII of this Bill could be regarded as incorporating that.  I suggest to the Minister that it should not be a matter of doubt.  It seems that the definition used in the section in the Family Law Reform Bill that came before the Westminster Parliament is a better provision in that it removes all doubt as to the carrying out of general scientific testing in this area.  If we are to do this, if we are to provide a mechanism, as this Bill seeks to provide, for making paternity orders and if we are to provide for legislation which enables a child to <Col N="2532" /> establish his own identity and to determine who his father is in circumstances where someone might be denying fatherhood, we should, within the context of this Bill, take into account the modern scientific developments in this area.  We should ensure that these are incorporated in Irish law and even more so we should do so in the context of this Bill because of how tardy and slow we are in seeking to reform these areas of law.  If we do not get it right this time, I am not sure when we will get it right.</P>
    <P>The other matter that arises under this section is in regard to paternity issues.  It provides that on the application of any party to proceedings a direction is given with regard to the carrying out of tests, be they blood tests or other tests, the party who seeks the direction shall pay the cost of taking and testing blood samples. The reason I raise this issue is that many mothers of children born outside marriage have to rely on the legal aid system, for example, to seek orders as to the paternity of their children or to seek orders with regard to maintenance support from the father of a child born to them.  From my own knowledge, the carrying out of tissue testing, which is a further step removed from blood testing but which is not as sophisticated as the DNA finger printing, could cost in the region of £200 to £250.</P>
    <P>If the mother of a child born outside wedlock seeks to require maintenance support for that child from a person she alleges is the father but who denies he is the father, who will meet the expense of carrying out the necessary tissue testing, paternity testing, blood testing of fingerprinting? If the mother patently requires legal aid through a law centre to bring such a case before the District Court, she will not have the means available to her to pay for the carrying out of such tests and such tests will be crucial in determining the outcome of any court case she might bring.  I urge the Minister to consider this in the context of implementing this provision in the Bill.  I also ask him to consider the scheme for legal aid, a non-statutory scheme provided for <Col N="2533" /> through his Department.  I ask the Minister to clarify who he anticipates will meet the expense that will be incurred by mothers who seek to establish paternity in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to raise in regard to this Bill relates to the maintenance provisions in the Bill which effectively seek to extend the provisions of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, in so far as those provisions apply to the making of support payment orders for children born outside marriage and who fall within the ambit of this legislation.  I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the support payments for children that the District Court can order under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, have been confined to a payment of a maximum sum of £30 a week since the Courts Act, 1981, came into force.  That sum has applied during a period of spiralling inflation in the first part of the eighties.  The £30 is now worth considerably less in real terms than it was worth in 1981 when the Courts Act was passed in this House.  Since 1981, the court has been allowed to order the making of a support payment of £100 a week for a wife.  That amount has also gone unchanged.  I suggest to the Minister that this Bill provides a very useful mechanism within which the financial limit on maintenance orders could be amended and increased to take into account the impact of inflation.</P>
    <P>In the context of family law, many wives are now forced to go to the Circuit Court to get support payments.  They could adequately bring their cases to the District Court if the financial limits of that court had even kept pace with inflation.  It is in the interest of the functioning of the court system that we ensure legal costs are kept as low as possible until such time as we have a family court and while the District Court still has jurisdiction in this area.  We are extremely slow in increasing the financial limits.  The financial limits under the 1976 Act were increased under the Courts Act, 1981 but more than five years have elapsed since that Act was passed in this House.  I urge <Col N="2534" /> the Minister to provide, in this Bill, for an increase in the financial limits.</P>
    <P>Another matter should be drawn to the attention of the Minister in the context of this Bill.  One of the procedures that was and still is available to a certain extent under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, allowed for what are known as lump sum payments. In circumstances where someone gave birth to a child outside marriage it was open to the person alleged to be the father of the child to reach an agreement with the mother of the child so that, instead of making weekly or monthly payments for the support of the child until the child reached 18 years, he would pay an overall lump sum to the mother.  Such moneys might be given to the mother in trust for the child or by way of a lump sum payment or by way of some property being made available to the mother.  In many cases, the possibility of that happening would not arise but in practice, there are still instances where children are born outside marriage and where the mother requires some degree of support or security from the father for her child but does not wish to be tied to having to get payments from the father and to pursue him for payments throughout the child's minority.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances where the father of a child born outside marriage may be fully willing to meet his obligations with regard to the child but would wish to resolve the matter and to close what might be an unhappy chapter both in his life and in the mother's life and not maintain any contact which both may find distressing.  In those circumstances, the father may be anxious to make a once-off settlement or once-off payment, what is know as a lump sum payment.  This Bill, in effect, removes the possibility of lump sum settlements between fathers and mothers in the context of children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission expressed the view that such payments were necessarily appropriate or useful. As someone who has worked in this area for many years, I can say as a matter of practicality, that in the real world and <Col N="2535" /> aside from looking at these problems from an academic point of view, there are couples who wish to deal with events in their lives, such as the birth of a child outside marriage, in a way whereby the child can be provided with security but whereby the couple do not have to maintain links.  It is in the interests both of a child born outside marriage and its parents that we retain a statutory mechanism so that if the mother and father want to enter into an agreement whereby a large sum of money, a property or other financial protection is made available to the mother for the child it should be possible for them to conclude what is know as a once-off or lump sum settlement. This should be binding on them in circumstances where the settlement is submitted properly to a court and the court adjudicates it is in the interests of the child's welfare that it be entered into. I am not suggesting we should allow a situation to arise where a mother who might be under stress is forced to accept a payment which is inadequate.  I am saying there should be a mechanism in this legislation to allow a mother who wishes to do so, who has had advice and has considered the options open to her, to enter into a settlement with the father who has had similar advice and considered the options, and where the financial settlement is such that a judge approves it as being proper protection for and in the interests, of the child.</P>
    <P>In many instances that might provide greater protection than any court maintenance order because if a court maintenance order is made and the father disappears out of the jurisdiction and nobody knows where he is, then the order is not worth the paper it is written on.  If it is a once-off settlement it can often provide the mother with a degree of security for her child which would not otherwise be open to her.  This Bill removes the possibility of that.  I believe that is removing a very helpful and protective mechansim which is available under our law.  I ask the Minister to provide for that in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention <Col N="2536" /> to an issue of a similar nature.  The Family Law Act, 1976, currently makes it impossible for a husband and wife whose marriage has broken down to conclude a once-off settlement.  There can be instances where marriages have broken down, there may be no children or the children may have attained their majority, but the husband and wife may be totally incompatible and wish to permanently separate and do not want to have further contact with each other.  The wife may wish to enter into an arrangement which guarantees her security for the rest of her life and the husband may be in a financial position to provide that security.  However, as the law stands, it is not open to a husband and wife to enter into a legally approved arrangement which a court adjudges is protecting the wife's welfare, which can enable them to break the link and reorganise their lives after the marriage has broken down without the wife having to permanently pursue the husband for maintenance support payments.  As I said, the law prevents a husband and wife from doing this; they are tied to each other financially and the wife may not have financial independence for many years.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that wives who are financially vulnerable should be put in a position where they can be forced by their husbands to accept inadequate sums of money for their support after their marriage has broken down.  I am suggesting there should be a statutory mechanism so that if a couple who are properly advised want to enter into such an arrangement they can do so in circumstances where a court approves it as properly protecting a dependant spouse.  The problem is that under existing law a form of lump sum arrangement can take place with regard to a child born outside marriage but it cannot happen where a marriage has broken down.</P>
    <P>The Bill will remove the possibility of a once-off settlement payment with regard to a child.  There are practical reasons for wanting this mechanism retained.  If a child is born outside marriage, if the mother and father cease to have a relationship and the mother wants <Col N="2537" /> to ensure the child is properly provided for, the mother, two or three years after the birth of her child, having formed a relationship with someone else, may marry.  In her marriage it may be a matter of pain and concern to receive regular payments from the father of the child born to her before marriage, particularly where the father has no contact with the child, and it could be in the interests of the mother and child to conclude a once-off financial arrangement.  I urge the Minister to consider providing for such an arrangement in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to raise relates to a matter the Minister mentioned he might be amending.  In the area of succession law this Bill seeks to place a child in a position of equality, subject to one or two exceptions, with regards to inheritance rights.  There is one provision in the Bill to which the Minister drew attention.  This was discussed in the Seanad and he may consider amending it.  It arises under section 34 of this Bill and the new section 120A which it is proposed will be inserted in the Succession Act, 1965.  Under this section in the context of a child dying intestate and on the assumption that the parental relationship has been established, if the father survives the child and is unworthy to share in the estate the court may make a declaration that he should not get anything out of his deceased child's estate. The court may consider that just having regard to the circumstances, and if it is satisfied the father did not make a contribution of a substantial nature towards the upbringing of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to draw the Minister's attention to is that in legislation abolishing discrimination against children we seem to be enacting legislation which is discriminatory against fathers.  I accept there are circumstances in which there can be an unworthy father where he shows no interest in the child, or where the child was born outside marriage and the father did not properly provide for its support.  It would be appalling if the child died owning the property and the mother, having struggled to bring up her child without the assistance of the father, was <Col N="2538" /> deprived of portion of that property because it went to the father.  There is a very good case to be made to ensure that an unworthy father does not inherit in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have come across some cases of children being born outside marriage who were abandoned by their mothers and left in the care of the father or the father's family and lost all contact with their mother throughout their childhood.  Just as you can have an unworthy father within the definition of this section, you can have a mother who is equally unworthy.  If this section makes any sense &mdash;and the intent is right in a general way &mdash;then surely it should make provision that the unworthy mother can be excluded from an inheritance?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the general area of succession on intestacy that this particular provision is an exceptional measure in the sense it will provide and retain a difference in the legal relationships as between children born inside and children born outside marriage.  It could be argued that this sort of provision which is envisaged should apply to unworthy fathers and mothers in the context of children born outside marriage, could equally be included in the Succession Act, 1965, with regard to unworthy fathers and mothers where children have been born to them within marriage.</P>
    <P>Take the issue we were debating here last week.  I made the point that at present there are in excess of 1,000 legitimate children permanently abandoned by parents in permanent foster or residential care.  Surely it is equally wrong that if such a child grows up, having been in foster care throughout its childhood and upon attaining adulthood goes its way in the world and dies at a young age leaving property, the married father and mother &mdash;who abandoned that child&mdash;would currently inherit?  Surely they are just as unworthy as the unworthy father envisaged in this section?  There is room in the Succession Act for a provision relating to unworthy parents but it need not necessarily be a discriminatory provision which only applies to the relationship between children and parents where a child is born <Col N="2539" /> outside marriage.  It certainly should not be one which solely applies to fathers and not to mothers, which is illogical.  The Minister should amend this section to remove what I see as illogical sex discrimination.</P>
    <P>The provision which says the court may make the declaration sought if it considers it just having regard to any circumstances it considers appropriate and if it is satisfied that the father did not make a contribution of a substantial nature, seems to mean it does not matter how unworthy a father is, that provided he made a financial contribution of a substantial nature he would still be entitled to inherit.  The financial contribution should not be the determining factor.  In the context of children generally, be it a child born inside or outside marriage, a father may substantially contribute towards the upkeep and upbringing of that child but if that father is convicted of a serious offence relating to child abuse or to sexual abuse of a daughter or son, to a child born inside or outside marriage, the courts could very well take the view that that father is unworthy to inherit anything. Under this section, a father or indeed a mother who sexually abuses a child and who is deprived of the custody of that child could still, on intestacy, inherit from that child provided he or she could establish that they had made a decent financial contribution towards the child's upbringing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition of the need in our succession laws for a provision relating to what I describe as the unworthy parent.  However, I ask the Minister to ensure that it applies generally and not just in one specific set of circumstances where a child is born outside marriage.  The essential link in determining whether someone is unworthy should not relate to the level of financial contribution which has been made towards the child's support by the particular parent.  I hope the Minister will regard my remarks relating to the specifics of the Bill as being of a constructive nature.  It was brought before this House to seek to place all children in a position of general legal equality.  It <Col N="2540" /> seeks to remove anachronistic and barbaric discrimination.  It also seeks to bring our law into line with the requirements imposed upon us by our adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and it is long overdue. We are far slower in addressing these issues than many other countries.  It is important to get the Bill right and to ensure that it works in the way it is intended to work.  It is also important that it provides a logical, legal framework within which all children are treated equally and which removes any vestiges of discrimination which remain in our laws with regard to children born outside marriage. For far too long we have discriminated against children for reasons unrelated to any fault on their part.  The Bill, if we get it right in its passage through the House, will finally pull some of our legislation with regard to children up by its coat tails and into the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to an issue to which I referred very briefly.  As someone who has worked in many voluntary organisations concerned with children for many years&mdash;for a decade before I came into the House &mdash; and as someone still involved in that area who sees the way our courts operate in dealing with family matters, I urge the Minister not just in the context of this Bill but in the context of the whole area of family legislation, in so far as it requires people to have their rights determined by the courts, to look at the question of providing legislation to establish a system of family courts.  In doing this, he should not be distracted by someone saying that if he provides for such a system it will be terribly expensive especially when we are in such a difficult financial position and that it will cost too much.  The Minister could explain to such a person that our current system is financially the most wasteful and degrading court system to which people could posibly be subjected.  A study has not been done of the current cost to the State&mdash; leaving aside all the human arguments for having a family court &mdash; of having district justices, Circuit Court and High Court judges throughout the country <Col N="2541" /> daily determining family law matters, each doing it in his different and subjective way and many of them lacking the skills, insight and training with the cases which come before them.  Some of them often create more problems for the families than they resolve.  Those problems are then thrown back on the health and social welfare services.</P>
    <P>The hidden costs of our current court structure as it implements legislation in the area of family law are far greater than the possible cost of establishing a coherent family court system with specialised judges trained to deal with family matters operating them.  I urge the Minister to establish such courts as soon as possible.  I am firmly of the belief that even if this Bill is passed the intent of the House will, on occasions, not be properly implemented in the courts because there would be a lack of the necessary insight and expertise in the manner in which these matters are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am also firmly of the belief &mdash; the Minister could check the statistics in this regard&mdash;that because of the manner in which, for example, affiliation proceedings are dealt with by many justices and Circuit Court judges at present and despite the extraordinary increase in the numbers of children born outside marriage, an extraordinarily small number of maintenance or affiliation cases are currently brought before our courts by, for example, unmarried mothers seeking support payments.  They are inhibited and frightened of the court system.  The mothers who find themselves caught up in the system often come out more demoralised and distressed than they were when they first decided they needed support and sought it from the father of the child born to them.</P>
    <P>There is a great problem relating to the structure of our courts system and the manner in which family problems are dealt with and administered.  I will go so far as to say that there are some members of the Judiciary who will not even entertain properly affiliated proceedings brought by a mother in circumstances where she is seeking to obtain support from the father of her child.  There are <Col N="2542" /> some judges who take a moral view and will not deal with such issues in their courts.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look at that.  It is not generally known except to a small group of people, both lawyers and social workers who work in the area of family law problems, that the problem is as bad as that.  The reason why it is not known is that when judges make comments such as those in family law matters they do so in private and it is not reported in the newspaper.  Therefore, if this legislation is to truly work we have to get it right and make the necessary amendments which both the Minister and we on this side of the House see as necessary to ensure the legislation is workable.  I am firmly of the belief that unless this legislation is ultimately administered through a family courts system we will be back in this House in years to come saying that despite the fact that the legislation has been passed in real terms the people whom it had sought to help have not in practical terms been helped as it lacked the administrative structure within our courts to implement it properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I would like to begin by welcoming the introduction of this Bill to the House and I would like to congratulate the Minister on its speedy introduction.  Indeed, in the early days of the present Dáil I had on a number of occasions on the Order of Business asked whether we would see this Bill which had effectively been processed in some detail by the Seanad and when it would come before the Dáil. I am glad to see that it has now been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Shatter for his thoughtful speech and I wholeheartedly subscribe to the sentiment with which he both began and ended his contribution and that was that the legislation, as passed, should be as comprehensive and as careful as possible and should be given the institutional support that is necessary to implement its provisions adequately.  I am very interested in this legislation for a number of other reasons.  It is exactly 13 years <Col N="2543" /> ago that Senator Mary Robinson, Senator Horgan and I attempted in the Seanad to introduce a Bill called the Removal of the Status of Illegitimacy Bill.  It occasioned an interesting debate which centred entirely around the juxtaposition of the rights of property and the rights of children.</P>
    <P>In that debate a Senator now no longer with us, who was a very brilliant Senator, made a suggestion that the proposal we were advancing at that time was a kind of socialism between the sheets and that we were going to redistribute the property of the country in a way which was going to be totally unacceptable.  Indeed, I recall the spirit of that debate very well. The proposal received less than a dozen supporters in the Seanad.  In the course of the debate a number of phrases were used which were reflective of the atmosphere of the time.  However, they were reflective of something deeper which was more than of the atmosphere of the time. They were reflective of a culture which had asserted property rights to be clearly more important than the rights of children. One of the phrases used in that debate was &ldquo;adulterine child&rdquo; and an image was constructed which supposed an individual had gone on to full respectability by owning property and, being in a valid domestic relationship, to be asked to account for his behaviour many years before would be most inappropriate procedure. The idea was that you could not possibly have these human skeletons coming from cupboards to frighten what was an intact and disposable set of property relationships.</P>
    <P>Since 1974, I have been fascinated by the phrase &ldquo;adulterine child&rdquo; which was used in the debate in the Seanad.  When we came back a kind of evolution took place some of which we can take credit for.  There was a change in attitude. There was also an evolution in Europe. Let me say before I go any further that when the Minister of State for Women's Affairs, the then Deputy Nuala Fennell, introduced the Bill I was very glad to see her bringing it back because over a decade had passed in which a number of <Col N="2544" /> debates had taken place.  It is to the credit of the Minister of State, the former Deputy Nula Fennell, that she took the advice Deputy Shatter is now offering the present Minister for Justice and accepted amendments to the Bill which was initially introduced in May 1986.  When the Bill came back the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; was removed but it still retained a number of problems which Deputy Shatter has addressed and which quite frankly I do not intend addressing in detail on Second Stage but they are ones which we should tease out on Committee Stage in terms of their implications.</P>
    <P>What had taken place in Europe was interesting in a number of ways.  In 1975, the Council of Europe building on what had been achieved in a number of States adopted a convention on the legal status of children born out of wedlock.  The purpose of that convention was to bring about a situation throughout Europe where the legal position of children born outside of marriage would in all essentials be assimilated to that of children within marriage.  In 1979 the Court of Human Rights under the Convention of Human Rights argued in the Marckx case that laws which discriminated against persons born outside of marriage were inconsistent with the convention unless they could be justified on some reasonable and objective ground.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other developments also.  There was the report on illegitimacy, which has been referred to by many speakers, which was published by the Law Reform Commission in 1982. Therefore, we had an evolution in the debate on this problem.  When the Bill was introduced initially in the Seanad I recall convincing arguments being put forward that the concept of illegitimacy could not be abolished legally, but by one of those fine pieces of thorough research in a short period of time and by comparison with the legal changes which had taken place in Scotland it was found when the Bill came back that the concept and stigma of illegitimacy could be removed and that was very welcome.</P>
    <P>A number of points were provoked.  I spoke on both Second and Committee <Col N="2545" /> Stages in the Seanad and suggested at that time that I would have preferred a stronger title than the Status of Children Bill.  Perhaps this is not necessary now because of the changes which have been made in the Bill, but the Bill as introduced in the Seanad contained the extraordinary term &ldquo;non marital child&rdquo;.  At that stage there was a necessity to change the title to one which would be so strong as to remove the discrimination against children who had been born out of wedlock. Nevertheless, things change very slowly.</P>
    <P>I note in the explanatory memorandum the phrases &ldquo;void&rdquo; and &ldquo;voidable marriage&rdquo;. I have been fascinated by this language of voidable marriages.  We in this country use language like that because we do not allow for civil divorce. That is because the people decided in a constitutional referendum that they do not want to make changes in the law to allow people to end what are for them irretrievably broken down marriages.  I strongly urge the Minister for Justice to set up such institutional arrangements as are necessary to draw distinctions between church and civil marriages.  The confusion we had in the referendum would not have arisen if that clear distinction had been drawn.  We must as a Parliament have the right to offer to the people proposals for changes in the civil law, without the shadow of other forms of law being cast over the civil law.  That is only a reasonable point of view.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is the question of children of void marriages; that is the concept used.  This question will, of course, be fudged in a number of ways as it is by people who talk to me about their family difficulties.  In a recent court decision a judge ordered that the male spouse is entitled to a standard of living equal to that which he enjoyed previously, even though the nullity decree in that case is a church one rather than a civil one.  The question there is fudged; it is an undesirable intersection.  We have heard a great deal and had a long hot summer about matters like that but what we are discussing now is very specific legislation. <Col N="2546" /> However, it does carry with it a particular history.</P>
    <P>In 1974, the debate was overwhelmingly in favour of the rights of property.  It was rather like what surfaced again in that long hot summer spent in deciding matters of civil law reforms.  It came back in the end to what is now part of this Bill, the question of property rights.  The argument was a very interesting and simple one.  It reflected something sometimes referred to as a traditional view of Irish life&mdash;the idea that a male could, with impunity, become involved in sexual relations and be regarded merely as sowing his wild oats. He was sowing more than that.  The attitude was that he then could forget this wild period of his life but the appalling result was that the babies born as a result of such behaviour were placed on turn-tables from which they were taken into institutions and denied not only maintenance, guardianship, education and sustenance but even knowledge of their identity.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to put some of these matters right.  It replies to those who have such an uncritical view of the past, believing that it was some kind of Arcadia where these things did not occur.  Literature has been published about the children who filled these institutions, sometimes later hired out to different people.  Some were children who never participated fully in life again.  In my own work as a sociologist I was interested in the background of young offenders.  One found that institutionalisation so impaired many of the social skills that those involved were not prepared for any ordinary integration into life.  That is there as a dark part of our past &mdash; the way we treated the children whose equivalents in the future will be saved by some of the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators stood up in 1974 and did the usual and correct thing in Ireland.  They paid tribute to all the charitable institutions that had absolved people from their responsibilities.  Running with that strain of avoidable obligation in the community was the other strain that all these children were produced really by loose <Col N="2547" /> women who were not able to control adequately those buttons in the male anatomy which could have protected them from pregnancy.  Very often, in relation to the child born out of wedlock it was not only the child who was sent off into a legal, social and civil wilderness; the mother was asked to disappear as well and the women did disappear, having committed this act of giving birth to a child.  They had been impregnated by some man who was now, no doubt, safely somewhere launched in the respectable echelons of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I do not recall anything as vigorous as the opposition we encountered when in 1974 we tried to change this.  The idea was; how could somebody now be asked to answer questions in relation to paternity so long after the event.  It was as if one could wipe the slate clean, wipe these irresponsible actions from one's personal history.  That is the first point I want to make on this legislation.  There is need for an emphasis on social responsibility in relationships to accompany legislation like this.  I am thinking in terms of an education programme so that we can, indeed, regard all children as equal.  There are many other implications that require a great deal of explanation and amplification in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Another interesting concept arose at this time.  All the main parties joined together to defeat that effort in 1974. Some spoke, as I have said, with extraordinary eloquence.  Interesting also was the idea that somehow or other these children were different from children born within the real family.  The family was the family defined in the 1937 Constitution. There is no point in Members of this House in 1986 or to the end of this century imagining that they can go on with the fiction that children of couples who are co-habiting together and behaving responsibly towards each other are not children who are equal to other children, who have rights and must enjoy rights under the Constitution and in law. You are talking about the equality of children and you must realise that the <Col N="2548" /> form of the family has changed, the form of unions has changed and you are dealing with an entirely new set of circumstances. I have every sympathy for a reforming Minister who wants to do something like that in relation to the restriction in the family, but the constitutional amendment and its defeat clearly show where we stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>I shall discuss on Committee Stage this question about void and voidable.  I would be fascinated to be told where it exists in other legislation, its history in any kind of jurisprudence.  The notion is a cultural one.  The idea is that in a country that precludes civil divorce one can imagine that one's marriage never took place.  One can, because of our law and well-tested international reputation for contemporary as well as ancient mythology, imagine that the existence of children of that imaginary marriage does not contradict the myth.  Thus we have to go on with the concept of voidable marriage and so forth in law.  That is the history of this legislation.  There is a fictional element running through it with people struggling to try to construct a piece of legislation in almost impossible circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question of the balance of rights and property is one I will not be deflected from in this debate.  We are all aware from recent cases in relation to planning and other matters that the constitutional provisions need to be changed.  However, looking at the balance of rights that exist in the Constitution in relation to children it is my view it is seriously defective. There is a need in terms of women and children for a stronger constitutional affirmation of equality.  From such a desirable constitutional amendment could come equality in relation to the sexes and there would follow a whole series of Bills to conform to such a constitutional change.  If the position of children was more explicitly stated in a reformed constitution it would be easier to bring in reforming legislation because young people would be able to argue their <Col N="2549" /> case.  It would be an easier legislative process than the one we have.</P>
    <P>I do not want my remarks to be construed in any way other than being a welcome for the legislation.  It is important to recognise the historical background to the legislation and to recognise the source of the arguments that were directed against it.  I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister of State for Women's Affairs, Senator Nuala Fennell, for her work in this regard.  Unfortunately, that post no longer exists.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad debate the two informing elements concerned property and the role of the woman in society.  I like to think there has been a change in the political culture of Ireland and that we have been moved to introduce legislation that we would not have brought in in the seventies. The cynic in me suggests we are assisted by the decisions of the European Court and European reform.  It may be we need a good tailwind from Europe to move us to bring in reforming legislation although the domestic tailwind our Supreme Court brings occasionally is usually welcome.  I note that in recent weeks that wind could not be regarded as being benign.  Nevertheless, we are dealing with an important piece of legislation. The Bill is better than the legislation introduced in May 1986.  It has been considerably improved and I should like to thank the people involved in the Department of Justice, and elsewhere, who responded to the suggestions put forward, particularly with regard to the nonsense about marital and non-marital children.</P>
    <P>The remaining reservations I have hang around the question of property rights.  The notion is that for the future we will have removed the basis of a stigma that existed which was an appalling disability not only in terms of law but in practical terms.  In my view we are talking about one of the most important pieces of legislation in the socially reforming area in 20 years and when the Bill passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas it will be welcomed as such.  I am glad the Bill is abolitionist in nature, that it will abolish the stigma, rather than <Col N="2550" /> introduce new words which would become the basis of a new stigma.</P>
    <P>While we, as legislators, can change the status of children legally in terms of the number of children born within wedlock and others we cannot but urge people towards some kind of socially based morality and responsibility in this regard.  This may be a contentious point to make in the House but not only could one forget about the child one had deposited in some charitable or State-aided institution but there was also the theological suggestion that one could wipe the mark from one's soul and go on being a good person in many ways.  We need legislation like this because we have not got a kind of morality and responsibility that is based on the social and sexual relationships between people as living sexed human beings.  It is our responsibility to bring in laws that will create an environment for that.  It is important that we recognise what went on under the old system and under the old version of exculpation of responsibility in regard to the children who filled the institutions.</P>
    <P>In regard to legislation of this kind we have been operating under the dead weight of a traditional view, as it was called, but I do not believe it was traditional. In my view it was conservative. Over the years in the House some Members liked to confuse the words conservative and traditional.  There are many traditional aspects of Irish life that were generous in their nature, were not condemnatory and did not place stigmas but, unfortunately, conservative people have been allowed to use the word traditional for their own purposes to rationalise their construction of history.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad on 9 July 1986 I spoke about these matters.  I referred to the phrase that was being used, the first family.  That raised an interesting question. The idea was that if one had what was called by Senators in 1974 an adulterine child and then went on to produce normal children those children were considered under the Constitution to be the first or the real family.  That left in a kind of penumbra those other bodies with responsibilities.  We moved very slowly <Col N="2551" /> since then.  It took 20 years for a Bill to be introduced in the Dáil.  There was a long debate in the Seanad on this matter. In its first introduction and when it was returned to the Seanad it had more amendments.</P>
    <P>I wish the people who want to abolish the Seanad were here listening to me now.  If I were to give an example of legislation which in the Seanad received the most careful and thorough debate I would cite the Status of Children Bill.  It was improved in a number of ways in the Seanad.  Many amendments were suggested some of which were rejected but many of which were made generously and the Bill was reformed.  If there was ever a case for the solid work of people involved in family law, professionally, such as Senators Robinson and McGuinness and other Senators from all parties who contributed to the improvement of the Bill it was made during the debate on this Bill.  This is the Bill I would single out as the great negation of the argument for the abolition of the Seanad. The fact that Senators of that party did not contribute to that debate hardly justifies the abolition of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will have a smooth passage here.  I have had time to contribute elsewhere on this issue but I would just like to make a few small points here. One of the points that bothers me most relates to the implementation of the Bill in relation to property.  The effect of the Bill will be that such wills and arrangements as are made after the date of the Act will then take effect.  This almost suggests that one could have intensive legal activity between now and the signing of this Bill as people put their moral, economic and property houses in order. I doubt if this will take place but at the same time there is not a convincing case for saying that we can start anew in relation to property entitlements of the child born outside of wedlock.  There are children who have accrued natural justice rights to property that should be reflected in this Bill.  On Committee Stage I will have some observations as to how the Bill might be improved in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2552" /> The sections dealing with leaving intact a number of trust and deed arrangements by which property can be transferred are quite defective in so far as we are not excluding the child born out of wedlock from any access to property but we are not creating any concept of equality in relation to access in terms of appealing to either the estate or to such property as might be transferred or disposed of by way of a trust or deed.  I would urge the Minister to look at that section again. Many of these points were made by Deputy Shatter and they should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>There should be an accompanying explanation with this Bill.  The explanatory memorandum is as good as I have seen in relation to Bills but I am really talking about an explanation and publication of the implications of the Bill in the public realm.  Another matter arises under the property sections of the Bill. Let us assume that an individual is given the responsibility to dispose of an estate. Should the person have an obligation to see if there is a natural child who is excluded from benefit from the estate? Rather than putting the onus on the person who has been excluded, that provision should be changed so as to make it necessary for whoever is in charge of disposing of the property to assert that person's rights.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know what happens in relation to women and children in Ireland at present.  We must remember that the woman usually elects to support her child separately from support from the natural father and she is at a unique disadvantage.  For example in 1975 a woman's earnings, the kind of woman who has tried to rear her child unsupported in law for so long, were less than they were in other comparable countries in Europe.  In 1975 an average woman being paid hourly earned 60 per cent of male earnings and 52 per cent of male earnings on a weekly basis.  In 1978 she had 63 per cent of male earnings on an hourly basis and 55 per cent on a weekly basis.  Women were working part time, on an hourly basis unable to take on the obligations of a full weekly job, in order <Col N="2553" /> to be able to carry the burden of rearing their children, who were different in status from every other child.  There is no need for me to go into the whole history of the experience of the children who were involved.  It is nice to think that we live in a generous society that all of the children of the nation are treated equally. That is an aspiration which I would not condemn.  Would that it were true, but it is not true.  It is not true now, it was never true and there is nothing I see in tendencies in this country that will ever make it true.  At present, even for ordinary children, the child of a manual worker will have a sixteenth of the chance of entering a third level institution as the child of a professional parent and about seven times the likelihood of needing some medical care later in their lives.  We have produced children for poverty and we have produced children for wealth. Society reproduces itself and it has a subterranean stream of children which this legislation will affect.  Thousands of women reared their children unaided by the father of the child without access to his wealth.  What was the woman to do? People wrote novels about all of this. They would find in a strange place the initials of the natural father and the mother scraped on some wall and around it one could construct the novel, the famous nineteenth century novel.  The idea was that perhaps all of these children were children of a person of property. When the madness had been removed from it, all that it really meant was that women earning less than anyone else in Europe, earning less than men, unable to take weekly jobs and being badly paid by the hour, tried to rear their children unaided by the earnings of the natural father, and with no access to his wealth or property during his lifetime, which was no doubt one of respectability, or even after his death when he had gone to his reward, as people say who concentrate on such things.</P>
    <P>The legislation of 1986 and 1987 attempted to stamp out a number of things.  We had sense, as some speakers have said.  This legislation is another way of dragging us by the hair of the head <Col N="2554" /> screaming and kicking into the twentieth century and making us realise that we have obligations to regard all children equally.  Inevitably in Ireland, in its undecolonised institutional status, we have had to have an endless array of attempts. I pay tribute to people like Senator Robinson, Deputy Fennell and others. There were also the reports of the Law Reform Commission and reports on illegitimacy.  Then there was the discussion memorandum on the status of children.  I regard all such documents as useful discussion documents.  We did not rush into this position and we should welcome this reforming legislation while noting its slow history.  May no other reform in the area of child welfare and of family law have such slow progress.  If we are to reform family law and the law relating to children, there is a package of law which must go together.  I have made the point that it could have been assisted by a different kind of constitutional assertion.  This legislation needs to be brought forward now.</P>
    <P>This Bill does a number of important things.  The things it abolishes and removes are also important.  It assists in relation to the right to establish one's parents and the question of guardianship. These are important reforming provisions. It will assist in relation to clarification of maintenance and to some extent in the clarification of property rights, although there are serious defects in that section.  It will assist in relation to the declaration of parentage.  It sets up some useful procedures regarding the establishment of paternity and it makes some useful suggestions in relation to the registration and re-registration of births.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at the entire procedure for the registration and processing of births.  The present mechanism is not a useful one.  I repeat that it stems from the intersection of the question of birth registration and baptismal registration. An immense amount of confusion exists which reflects something which was old in Ireland, a State which had not the confidence to claim a civil authority.  We must have the confidence to demand a civil authority.  We are the <Col N="2555" /> State.  The office we hold is elective and we can be rejected by the electorate &mdash; I know more about that than most people. We are elected to enact civil law and to set up civil procedures in relation to marriage, birth registration, property and so on.  Unless we want to follow the example of Iran, which claims that it has some kind of chosen role within Islam, or claim some special relationship in the Milky Way galaxy, we must clarify these procedures and establish a distance between the different legal systems that are involved.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill avoids the area of taxation and revenue.  I once calculated the way the State views the needs of a child in relation to maintenance.  There are no less than 24 different ways in which a child is calculated for expenditure purposes in our social welfare and taxation law.  At no stage is there a specific commitment to what is needed to maintain a child.</P>
    <P>I beg the indulgence of the House for giving the history of this legislation.  I was one of the people involved about 13 years ago in the struggle to have such legislation enacted.  I echo the views of Deputy Shatter that we should look at each of the sections as carefully as possible.  There is also the question of property, which is often considered as if it were a stable entity.  There is much merit in considering a system whereby a person could discharge his obligations by the payment of a lump sum agreed between the parties concerned.  It would also have considerable flexibility.  I do have sympathy for the family who find that someone they never knew will have access to an estate. One must have sympathy in such an event.  The problem up to now has been that we pretended reality did not exist.  If we are to recognise these problems we must have sufficient flexibility to leave intact as many of the feelings and relationships as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>It would be very inappropriate if I did not at this stage acknowledge our indebtendness to a number of voluntary organisations who have addressed the question of the isolation of people living in a world <Col N="2556" /> where children were not regarded as equal.  It was a world of stigma.  There are women who struggled to rear their children against extraordinary difficulties and who continue to write to us as legislators telling us what changes should be made.  I have in mind such organisations as Cherish.  The Minister would do well to consider again the submissions they have made in relation to this Bill, particularly in regard to the property clauses. I very much welcome the Bill and I look forward to the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out a number of amendments.</P>
    <P>We must pay particular attention to the sections dealing with wills and intestacy and the whole question of the disposal of property and the court procedures involved.  There is merit in the family court concept.  I do not agree that the Circuit Court as referred to throughout the Bill is necessarily the appropriate mechanism for the invocation of possible new measures in relation to the law.  If one does not want to become involved in major reform of the courts it might be possible to maintain a ministerial initiative to direct such institutional changes and resources as are necessary to implement the Bill.  I am not talking only about court procedures but about other forms of procedures that could be called in until we see the Bill in action and then perhaps it could be amended in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very welcome.  It is important social legislation, one of the most important pieces of such legislation to come before the House for some decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I realise my colleague, Deputy Barnes, is anxious to make a contribution before this discussion on the Bill concludes at 7 p.m.  It is a privilege to stand here in Dáil Éireann and speak about a Bill of this nature.  During the years before it became fashionable and popular &mdash; in the best sense &mdash; I made many speeches both inside and outside the House and tabled questions seeking abandonment of the term &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo;<Col N="2557" /> to give meaning to one of my concepts of what republicanism means.  I see my socialist colleague, Deputy M. Higgins, about to depart after making a first-class contribution to this debate.  He had the unusual distinction of making a first-class speech about this Bill in the Seanad and than had the privilege and opportunity of making a similar speech in the Dáil.  He is a former Senator and is a Dáil Deputy today.  Such privilege is not given to many people.  I listened to his speech with great attention but I would not agree with all he said.  I do not share his pessimism in relation to the future of the nation and the future of the children of the nation. We make an effort to support the Proclamation that we should cherish all the children of the nation equally.  While that at present is an ideal, as Deputy Higgins said, it is something we can realise in time.  This legislation is part of that realisation, part of the achievement of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</P>
      <P>I have referred to my concept of republicanism, and this Status of Children Bill is part of my package of republican reform.  The Shatter Bill on adoption was rejected for a number of reasons which we will not go into now.  I would like to see it reintroduced urgently before the end of this Dáil session, and the Minister for Health has referred to that.  Such legislation is part of the thrust of what the Minister for Justice has now before the House.  I would like to see the whole area of family law reformed urgently.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is to be congratulated on introducing this Bill.  It is an historic breakthrough in social legislation and I am very privileged to be able to stand up and be part of that historic breakthrough.  Without going overboard and being sycophantic, which is not in my nature anyway, I want to thank the Minister for bringing the Bill in and to say we appreciate it very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to equalise the rights under law of all children, whether born inside or outside marriage. The Bill achieves that by putting children born outside marriage on the same footing as those born in wedlock or as nearly <Col N="2558" /> as possible.  Deputy Higgins made the point that certain strands still have to be brought together to give fulfilment to total abandonment of discrimination against children born outside wedlock. We must be careful about that.  The Bill allows a person to obtain a court declaration as to his or her parentage and facilitates the use of blood tests in civil proceedings.  It amends the law relating to legal presumption and other matters evidential to the registration of birth of children born outside the marriage structure, as so well articulated by the previous speaker.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker seemed to be dining off his speech.  We are inclined to do that in this House, although I try not to fall into that trap.  However, he made a very valid point in relation to the number of amendments that were made to this Bill when it passed through the Seanad.  He used that point as support for the continuance in existence of the Seanad, in other words the bicameral system.  He said that if for no other reason than the achievement of the Seanad in relation to the perfection of this Bill, the Seanad should continue in existence. That is not a bad point.  I am not certain whether we should have two Houses.  I have not given the matter great thought or come down one way or the other on that.  As Deputy Higgins said, the Bill was amended substantially in its passage through the Seanad and extremely worthy contributions were made at that time.  I studied them with great concern and reflection.  I am glad that the nonsense in the &ldquo;old&rdquo; Bill - the term &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; to describe children whose parents had not married each other &mdash; has been abandoned.  The use of the term was criticised both inside and outside the Seanad.  That term would have perpetuated the very stigma we are seeking to abandon in this Bill and for that <i>Deo gratias.</i></P>
    <P>Another point made was in regard to the enactment of the Bill.  Some consequential changes in Revenue laws to be included in the next appropriate Finance Bill will ensure compliance in this country with the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to persons born <Col N="2559" /> outside marriage.  The breach of the convention in this regard as found by the European Court of Human Rights in its recent judgment in the Johnson case will, we hope, be remedied once and for all.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Law Reform Commission published a report on illegitimacy.  That may have been the first time this social problem was addressed by an organisation of this nature.  The basic recommendation of the commission was that legislation should remove the concept of illegitimacy from the law and equalise the rights of children born outside of marriage with those of children born within marriage.  The report included recommendations covering the area of succession, parental rights, maintenance of children, actions to prove parentage, blood testing as an aid to proof of parentage and registration of births, as has been stated already.  Among the principal recommendations in regard to succession was one that persons born outside of marriage should have the same succession rights as other persons on the intestacy of their fathers and mothers and relatives of their fathers and mothers &mdash; that relatives of a person born outside marriage should be entitled to succeed on the intestacy of that person as if the person were born within marriage.  The present rule of interpretation under which such words as &ldquo;children&rdquo; or &ldquo;issue&rdquo;, when used in wills, deeds or other instruments are presumed to refer only to persons born within marriage should also be set aside.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the reasons that group of persons gave for the suggested abandonment of the stigma attaching to the expression &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; in relation to children.  Before going into that I should like to pursue the sense of injustice and unfairness that those people born outside of wedlock must feel that this problem was not resolved sooner than 1987.  It seems to me disgraceful that we are dealing with it only now.  I am not making that criticism in any negative way.  I am glad that we are now dealing with it rather than, say, 20 years hence. <Col N="2560" /> In the meantime it should be remembered that we are dealing with people who had no say good, bad or indifferent in relation to their existence.  That should be a sufficient reason for ensuring that they are given equal status with those born within wedlock.  In other words, those children born outside of wedlock had no responsibility whatsoever for the circumstances of their birth.  Deputy Michael Higgins in a graphic, colourful way described it so well.  I should like to support what he said in that regard: the old concept of man and woman being one, that is basically what he is speaking about, but thankfully that concept is gone.  I was brought up in the Republican tradition in which men and women were equal, in which we felt no strong sense of separateness in relation to achievement or otherwise.  That is what I was brought up to believe.  I did not have to have the latter day women's liberated organisations to explain the difference and their entitlements under the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain women made a mess of what they were trying to achieve in their hysterical proclamation of their case.  I say that with the greatest respect to Deputy Monica Barnes, who has done much for the women's movement and who would not fit into the category I have just described.  I do not want to be drawn down that avenue.  It is possibly worth quoting the Law Reform Commission's reason for change, a very worthy reason, contained in their Fourth Report, paragraph 5:</P>
      <P>The thinking underlying the then Government decision is that the continuation of the legal disadvantages suffered by persons born outside of marriage is not in keeping with the Christian and democratic nature of the State...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2561" /> I presume that would include the Jewish citizens who do not happen to be Christian. We do have a Jewish community here.  We do have people who do not proclaim to be Christian at all.  Again, that sentiment would stem from my Republican background.  To quote the relevant recommendation again:</P>
    <P>The thinking underlying the then Government decision is that the continuation of the legal disadvantages suffered by persons born outside of marriage is not in keeping with the Christian and democratic nature of the State and that, as far as possible, the law should not operate to the disadvantage of people merely because of the circumstances of their birth.</P>
    <P>Point made.  The Government had regard to the fact that in many common law and civil law jurisdictions substantial reforms in this area of law have taken place within the last 20 years.  As has already been stated Ireland is not a party to the European Convention on the Status of Children Born Out of Wedlock, 1975, the aim of which is to assimilate the legal status of persons born outside of marriage with that of persons born within marriage.  It should be possible to ratify that convention when the proposed legislation has come into force.  I should be glad if the Minister would address himself to that point: will we be ratifying that Convention when this legislation is passed?</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that this Bill does not have to go back to the Seanad &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; if it is not amended here but that, if there are amendments passed in the Dáil, then it does have to return to the Seanad.  It is my information that, during the General Election period this Bill was discussed in the Seanad and in those circumstances it does not have to revert to the Seanad.  If the Minister cares to answer it I shall be glad and, if not, I will take no offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us must be considered to constitute major legal and social reform.  We are following an international trend, dating back some 20 <Col N="2562" /> years, toward the elimination of discrimination in the law against people born outside of marriage.  That is as it should be.  Deputy Higgins mentioned the Markx case, contending that we have obligations in this area arising out of our adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In 1979 in the Markx case the Court of Human Rights held that laws which discriminate against persons born outside of marriage are inconsistent with the Convention unless they can be justified on some reasonable and objective ground.  I believe that, in the course of that judgment, the court expressly recognised that, while supporting the encouragement of the traditional family was in itself legitimate and praiseworthy measures aimed at achieving that end should not be such as to result in prejudice to the family not based on marriage.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, until recent times, children born outside of marriage were ignored by Statute, the famous old legal phrase &mdash;<i>filius nullius</i>&mdash; meaning the child of no-one that child born outside of wedlock being thrown to the four winds. Nobody wanted to know.  That is the social discrimination to which such children were subjected up to ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Then there was an awareness that we in this nation had an obligation to those children born outside of wedlock. Natural parents were not the guardians of their child or children nor had they any rights with regard to their custody. Indeed when either parent died without making a will the children had no right to share in the estate.  Some of the rigour of the common law has been lessened by Statute over the past 50 years or so.  Those of us who learned a smattering of law to achieve our professional qualifications will recall the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, which enabled the mother of a child to claim maintenance for the child from the putative father but a finding of paternity in such cases was effective only for maintenance purposes.  The Legitimacy Act of 1931 provided that the marriage of parents subsequent to the birth of a child could render the child legitimate.  That <Col N="2563" /> Act also gave a child born outside marriage some rights of succession on the death intestate of the mother.  The Adoption Act, 1952, provided for the legal adoption of children born outside marriage and this involved the permanent transfer of parental rights and duties from the natural father to the adopting parents.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, removed uncertainty in relation to guardianship by declaring that the mother of a child born outside marriage is the child's guardian.  The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, improved, in the area of maintenance, the position of children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The social reform of the law on illegitimacy was called for.  It would not be fair to fail to pay tribute to the Minister of State with special responsibility for womens' affairs at the time the Bill was introduced, Deputy Nuala Fennell.  She was very genuine and sincere in her efforts to bring forward a Bill which finally found a home in the Seanad.  Unfortunately, she lost her seat in the recent Dáil election but was elected subsequently to the Seanad so will continue to have her social awareness input into debates and issues of this nature in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We should be glad for that.  Tribute is due to her for her efforts to highlight discrimination in this and in other areas of the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister said, covers a wide spectrum of the law.  It deals with guardianship, maintenance, succession and property rights, a new procedure for the declaration of parentage, blood tests as an aid in determining questions of parentage, legal presumptions, in evidential matters and registration of births. The only major area of relevance which it leaves untouched is, as I have already stated, that of revenue law.  I understand that will be dealt with in the Finance Bill which is to be brought before the House in the not too distant future.  As I have undertaken not to speak at any great length, I will make one or two suggestions to the Minister on Committee Stage.  One of the difficulties of being a backbench <Col N="2564" /> Government Deputy is that you can be hoisted on one of your own amendments in the sense that some smart alec Opposition Deputy will see an opportunity of making the Deputy walk into the division lobbies on an amendment which he proposed and which the Minister did not accept.  I will not fall into that trap but at the same time I will not hesitate, and have not hesitated since Fianna Fáil came back into Government, to express a point of view in the House and I will continue that attitude.  I have a number of amendments that the Minister might consider and I have no doubt that the Opposition parties will also pursue the additional perfection of the Bill by way of a number of amendments.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Seanad for the work it did in bringing about a Bill which was to the satisfaction of the majority in the House.  It will be interesting to see how the standard of debate in the Dáil will compare with that achieved by our sisters and brothers in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other Deputies who have spoken, and before I get down to some of the particulars of the Bill, I also would like to pay tribute to several people.  I wish to pay tribute to the then Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, who brought this Bill through the Seanad and who, even before then had received the many submissions made after a discussion document had been published.  That is always a very good exercise, particularly with complicated legislation.  Having either listened to the debates in the Seanad or read them afterwards, we can all be struck by the high level of debate and by the commitment and social conscience of many Senators as expressed during the debate.  The strength of their arguments was such that on Committee Stage many amendments were made.  Probably the most contentious, important and fundamental one of all was the removal of the terms, &ldquo;marital&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who was then a Senator, that there are many instances and examples on the <Col N="2565" /> Seanad records of the input and contribution of Senators to legislation but there is no better example than the debate on this Bill.  I am delighted that the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats is present to hear me say that because while I agree that reform may be needed with regard to the structure of the Seanad I certainly would not agree with its abolition.  We in this House have had many occasions to be grateful for the input, the contribution and the almost finalised legislation we received from that House.  I know the Government are going to initiate legislation through that House and will use it to its full ability.  I welcome that very much.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute also &mdash; and all of us should pay attention to them &mdash; to the voluntary organisations such as Cherish, the Federation of Single Parents and Unmarried Mothers and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children who work with mothers and children and who made very important and significant contributions to this legislation based on their experience. Like other social legislation this Bill comes to the House after a long history.  I welcome it and thank the Minister for bringing it so quickly to the Dáil.  Because I have not spoken on legislation since Fianna Fáil took office I wish the Minister a very successful and productive career and I hope there will be many occasions when we will talk across the House on social legislation.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that as a result of many countries removing years ago this intolerable discrimination against what we still term illigitimate children, the Council of Europe moved to adopt the convention on the legal status of children born out of wedlock.  I agree with the Minister that when we pass this Bill we will be able to ratify that convention. It is always a matter of pride and pleasure to ratify conventions we have entered into, particularly in the area of human rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins referred to the importance of our membership of the EC and to the significance of the many <Col N="2566" /> times it has dragged us either willingly or unwillingly into mainstream European legislation.  I question why our continued existence and full participation in the Communities should be opposed by him. This is one of the most important and productive ways in which we can participate in Europe from which we gain very much.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Services Expenditure: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Molloy on Tuesday, 19 May 1987:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann wishing to remain within the 1987 Revised Estimates for Health.</P>
    <P>(i)  notes that there is widespread public concern about the provision of health services throughout the country, notwithstanding an increase this year of £13.082 million;</P>
    <P>(ii)  condemns the failure of the Government and the Minister for Health to set guidelines for expenditure on health this year that would ensure an acceptable level of service, which failure has resulted in threats of closure of numerous hospitals, and curtailment of services in others causing inevitable deep public concern;</P>
    <P>(iii)  calls for a reduction in the size and cost of the bureaucratic machine administering the health services, including the health boards; the abolition of local Health Advisory Committees; greater accountability by consultants, and a retention of such numbers of persons supplying health care direct to the public as are necessary to provide a reasonable level of service, given the country's financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2567" /> 2.  To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;wishing to remain within the 1987 Revised Estimates for Health</P>
    <P>(i)  notes that there is widespread public concern about the provision of Health Services throughout the country;</P>
    <P>(ii)  condemns the failure of the Government to plan the impact of the extra cut of £22.8 million imposed in the Estimates to Health Boards and Health Services of March, 1987 compared to January, 1987 as well as the accelerated phasing out of the Health Board deficits and propose that the Government in consultations with the partners in the Health Services devise a strategy for staying within the overall budget allocations embracing a review of</P>
    <P>(1)  Health Boards structures and administrative overheads in the Health Services,</P>
    <P>(2)  the charges for prescriptions in order to make more funds available for the delivery of services to the public,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said I would point out certain areas where appreciable savings could be made in our health services and I dealt with the health boards and the need to rationalise their position. I put forward a suggestion in this House some time ago that the number of health boards should be looked at and I expressed disappointment that the Minister had closed his mind against reducing the number of health boards.  The administrative costs within the service have to be looked at.  Last night I mentioned the <Col N="2568" /> common contract and expressed disappointment that the IMO have failed to date to come to the negotiating table with the Minister.  It is ironic that the IMO are criticising the cuts that have been made. Junior hospital doctors have been seriously affected by the cutbacks but the IMO, who represent the consultants in our hospitals, are refusing to renegotiate a contract which is allowing serious abuses to occur within our health services.</P>
      <P>In a previous debate in this House I said we must deal with the computerisation programme, look at the fee per item and the purchase and use of drugs.  The purchase of drugs by the health services was dealt with comprehensively in a recent newspaper article which raised many serious questions. The Minister has a responsibility to look at this area.  Much of the contribution made by the PD spokesman was based on the very excellent report of the Committee on Public Expenditure published last January.  That committee highlighted and pinpointed many defects in our health service, and I urge the Minister to study that report in detail.  We took a lot of time to study the health services and the report does justice to the time given by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last night a serious matter has come to my attention in relation to vocational training for general practitioners. As the Minister knows, the proper training for general practitioners is a key factor in reducing hospital costs. Everybody agrees that the development of our vocational training for medical students before they enter general practice is vital.  At present there is a scheme in Dublin and Cork with Dublin training ten prospective GPs per year.  I have been informed from authoritative sources that because of the embargo on the appointment of temporary general practitioners, this training scheme will be abolished. This is a serious matter because under EC legislation by 1992 every general practitioner must be vocationally trained before he enters general practice.  I ask the Minister to tell the House how he proposes to deal with a threat facing the <Col N="2569" /> vocational training scheme for general practitioners in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>I know this debate is limited, but we could pinpoint many areas where huge savings could be made in the health services if the Minister had the political will and the courage to take on these issues instead of picking easy targets.  Allowing for the urgent necessity to bring our expenditure on health into line with the current availability of taxpayers' money, it is difficult nonetheless to visualise a more hamfisted exercise than that on which the Government have now embarked. The cuts are being implemented, at the behest of the Government with the insensitive crudeness of a battering ram. To put the health budget into balance, it was necessary either to make cuts or to increase revenue.  A careful and considerate merging of both elements, as we in Fine Gael have constantly asserted, would never have resulted in so many hospitals being closed, staff disillusioned and patients victimised in a way that has caused chaos, strife and resentment. These hammer and anvil strokes are not the way forward.  Bludgeoned by Government policy, health boards are now being forced into making decisions which are demoralising in their impact on the community at large.</P>
    <P>Coming from a Government whose &ldquo;caring concern&rdquo; was the cornerstone of their election policy, the dictatorial policy we now see being implemented, on health cuts in particular, is insulting, not only to those directly affected but to those of us who have consistently pointed to a better way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Imposing a prescription charge, which would greatly ease the burden, would be part of that better way and would not have resulted in the morale-shattering experiences being witnessed through the cries of anguish of people from all parts of the country.  Last night I outlined the broad based protests which are taking place.</P>
    <P>These cuts are insensitive and are aimed for the most part at the soft options which effectively affect the poorer, and consequently, the most vulnerable section of our community.  It is not too <Col N="2570" /> difficult to comprehend why this line of action is being taken, why hospitals are being forced to close down, why workers have been forced out of their jobs in droves, why entire communities have been left to suffer and why lives have been put at serious risk.</P>
    <P>It results more than in part from a reluctance bordering on a fear to take on the powerful and influential groups who appear to be immune from any dictation. I ask the Minister to take on these groups which are resisting change.</P>
    <P>The people, as taxpayers, who are now suffering are left again to pay a piper who is all the time playing the expensive tune that only a select few can afford to hear. There have been a number of totally unnecessary decisions at Government and at health board level that carry the conviction of a scared rabbit.  In a number of communities these decisions have had a destabilising influence that should have been predicted.</P>
    <P>As I said last night there is a need for a cooling off period before further irreparable damage is done to the health service and before any decision is copperfastened. Other options must be carefully looked at and examined.  By doing so, the Government would be given an opportunity of looking at the fundamental issues and problems that originally brought about these draconian decisions.  I am sure this cooling off period would have the effect of forcing the Government to look at other viable options which Fine Gael, over the last few months, have pressed them to examine, but the Government have failed.</P>
    <P>That, as we see it, is the way forward which would bring about a consensus to a problem which, because of the way it is being handled, is bringing discord, divisiveness and hardship to all communities. I ask the Minister to look at the issues which have been cropping up in all areas and expecially the problems which have arisen in the most deprived areas.</P>
    <P>The time has come to call a halt to the devastation which is being caused in our health services.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that he has lost his way.  I am pleased he is bringing in the <Col N="2571" /> experts for consultation.  This should have been done a long time ago and the Minister failed in his duties by not bringing them in to advise him.</P>

      <P>In the debate which has been going on over the past two evenings, many vital points have been raised. Unfortunately, there have also been a considerable number of negative and unhelpful comments.</P>
      <P>It was very reassuring to find that the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael agree we cannot afford to put any more resources into the health services at present.  That represents a good base from which to proceed.  The task now is to plan well and manage constructively the considerable resources that remain available and to do that we must be positive, we must apply imagination and deal with reality.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has already outlined a comprehensive and positive approach to this task.  It is a great pity the same cannot be said for all those who have spoken, particularly the main proposers of the motion.  I will deal later with some of the points which have been made.  It was interesting to watch Deputy Allen's attempts to substantiate his claim that the provision made by the Government was £28 million less than provided by the previous Government.  This is not in accordance with the facts.</P>

      <P>The Government's gross provision is £1,295 million compared with a proposed gross provision of £1,294 million by the previous Government.  In addition, the new income measures introduced will reduce the need for service reductions.  The previous Government sat on the issue of allocations for two months for narrow political reasons.  It is scarcely believable that their spokesman should now bemoan the problems which arise from this delay and from the failure of a Government who were in office for well over four years to come to grips with the job of putting in place an effective and efficient service which could be afforded.  It was very cynical not to announce the allocations before polling day in February.  They were not prepared to inform the health boards of their allocations which will be very similar to those made by the Government.  That is why the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, Deputy Spring, Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Quinn all resigned from Government.  They could not stand the heat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputy Molloy made accusations about the lack of co-ordination and direction in relation to computer systems.  His contribution is a distortion of the factual position.  The charges made by the Deputy, who seems to be relying for much of his material on a flimsy consultants' report submitted to the Committee on Public Expenditure, were comprehensively refuted by officers of my Department who appeared before that committee.  The Deputy has deliberately chosen to ignore the facts which were made available to the members of the committee.  I can understand why commercial interests would choose to deliberately misrepresent the factual position on the systems front and put forward interpretations which most favoured their own interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>However, those who have no vested interest &mdash; clearly Deputy Molloy and his PD colleagues fall into this category &mdash; could reasonably be expected to establish the accuracy of their facts before arriving at public conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health have a coherent, comprehensive and well-documented policy on systems development. There have been significant developments in this area in recent years and, contrary to what Deputy Molloy alleges, these developments, spearheaded by the Department, have taken place in a planned and co-ordinated manner.  Progress to date, however, has been hampered by inadequate funding and the Department are also affected in this regard.  Since going into the Department, I found out that there are only roughly 300 people working there and that they administer over £1,300 million per annum. This is a considerable success for a Department of its size.</P>
      <P>The former Government, despite the rhetoric, made very little provision for systems development.  This Government, however, are committed to more rapid progress in the development of cost effective computerisation within the health service.  We see progress in this area as a prerequisite to the development of more effective and efficient management, greater cost control and better patient management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also chose to make statements about the lack of accountability in voluntary hospitals.  Statements of this kind had also been made by the Committee on Public Expenditure but were found to be totally invalid.  Voluntary hospitals are funded on a budget basis directly by my Department on behalf of the health boards.  Their accounts are not only audited by private commercial auditors but are examined in detail by my Department's auditors to ensure compliance with specific guidelines. Such matters as the numbers and type of staff, pay rates, arrangements for the replacement of equipment and for <Col N="2575" /> competitive purchasing of materials are all examined.  Control is also exercised on the range and extent of specific specialities.  Of course some improvements can be made in the working relationships between voluntary hospitals and between those hospitals and the health boards.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has already outlined the initiatives which he proposes to take in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill launched a direct attack on the hospital planning office in the Department and on the engineers, architects and quantity surveyors who staff it. She seems to have overlooked the fact that the operations of this office, and in particular the control measures they exercised in relation to major capital works in the health services, have been subjected to quite minute study by the Committee on Public Expenditure and have been commended.  This study was carried out before Deputy Quill became a Member of this House and in the circumstances she may not be aware of that fact.  It is a specialist office providing a fine service in a most efficient and effective way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of activity has been going on for a number of years on rather dramatic changes in a wide range of services.  Major studies have been carried out in the psychiatric area, the general medical services area as well as in the general hospital area.  The fact <Col N="2576" /> that we are faced with the current financial problems should not be used as an excuse to slow down or stop those initiatives. Rather there should be an increased motivation to speed up these necessary changes which are designed to achieve a more effective and efficient service.  For example, one of the essential features in the development of our psychiatric service is that acute psychiatric in-patient treatment should be provided as a normal function of a general hospital.  This means that the acute psychiatric unit should be located in the general hospital in the same way as other specialised hospital services. Such units are already in operation in a number of general hospitals.  This is an enlightened view of psychiatric care and services.  Mental illness is the same as any other illness and it should be treated in the environment of a general hospital instead of being isolated in a separate hospital.  It is planned to provide them in a number of other hospitals, such as Ennis, Roscommon, Portlaoise and Kilkenny.  This will be done by transferring the acute psychiatric service from the mental hospital to the general hospital.</P>
      <P>The current reduction in activity in general hospitals provides an opportunity to transfer the acute psychiatric service to the general hospital much earlier than had originally been anticipated.  Health boards should seek to avail of this opportunity. Roscommon hospital, for example, could be provided with a unit which would meet the acute psychiatric needs of County Roscommon and which would have the support of their consultant-staffed services in the hospital which should be retained.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is understandable <Col N="2577" /> that those directly affected should make their feelings clearly known.</P>
      <P>I know that for the individuals involved the need for reductions is going to cause hardship but in looking at the reductions in an overall context, it must be borne in mind that the last decade saw a huge upsurge in the numbers employed in the health services of about 20 per cent.  It would be very difficult to justify that level of increase simply in terms of development of services.  A curtailment of expenditure on health services must involve a curtailment of staff bearing in mind that approximately 70 per cent of the total costs of the health services are pay costs.</P>
      <P>I would also like to comment on statements made by Members of this House and others about the application of the restrictions to various categories of staff. It has been naively suggested that all that is necessary is to do away with virtually all clerical and administrative staff and this would solve the problem.  It is implied that such staff are inessential to the operation of the services.  It is not as if the clerical and administrative staff were being left untouched.</P>
      <P>In the instructions to the health agencies it was asked that the restrictions be applied evenly across the grades.  The information supplied to the Department of Health since the issue of those instructions confirms that the boards and hospitals have endeavoured to carry through those instructions.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence that the clerical and administrative grades are being specially protected.  We must realise again that total expenditure is £1.3 billion.  That is a considerable amount of public expenditure.  We are now paying for an overrun of £55 million by the previous administration.  We should also bear in mind that Deputy O'Hanlon is the third Minister for Health in 1987.  The first was Deputy Barry Desmond who resigned his ministry when he could not face the difficulties ahead.  He was followed by Deputy John Boland.  I recall he was the Minister who proposed to do <Col N="2578" /> away with the dispensing of drugs in rural areas in an announcement made during the general election campaign.  Deputy Desmond resigned because he could not contemplate staying in office with his Fine Geal partners due to the measures proposed by that party.  In particular, he could not tolerate the proposed charge of £1 per item prescribed for those people who were deemed eligible to hold a medical card and who by definition are the very poorest in our community.  The prescription charges proposed by Fine Gael would have imposed undue hardship on the least well off in our society.  We decided to dispense with those charges because we felt they were not in order or suitable for the most deprived people in our society who are eligible for a general medical service card.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the £10 out-patient charge is being collected and has been accepted by the general public.  We must bear in mind that a visit to a general practitioner would cost at least between £8 and £10 and one would not have the benefit of the back-up services which are available in an out-patients department in a general hospital. The VHI have introduced an extremely attractive scheme, very moderately priced.  I recommend that those who are not eligible for free out-patient and in-patient services should avail of the extremely attractive offer which has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in issuing the 1987 letters of allocation to the health boards and <Col N="2580" /> voluntary hospitals laid down clear and specific guidelines on how they should frame their budgets.  His concern was to ensure that the basic fabric of our health services should remain intact while, at the same time, ensuring that the best possible service was delivered within the amounts available.  The specific instructions to the agencies required that they should seek to make the necessary reductions in the institutional area and in particular in the acute hospital sector. The overall bed provision in our acute general hospitals is widely accepted as more than adequate to meet all needs and this is by reference to international standards.  The administrator directed agencies to protect community care services as far as possible including, for the old and the housebound, such key services as community nursing services, services for the mentally handicapped, home help services, meals on wheels, child care services and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly day care and pre-school services for the deprived and disadvantaged communities and after care programmes for children leaving long term residential care.  Adequate provision should be made also for boarding out payments to reflect the trend towards increased numbers in foster care. The Minister asked the health boards to maintain their expenditure on these services, at least at the 1986 approved levels in real terms.</P>

      <P>This approach is an expressed departmental policy to protect primary care within the community as opposed to hospital based treatment.  The guidelines I have referred to have regard to the over-riding need to maintain a full time staff to provide a service at an <Col N="2581" /> acceptable level directly to the sick in our community.  Indeed, the Minister did not think it unreasonable that the letter of allocation should require the health boards and the voluntary general hospitals directly funded from the Department to face up to the harsh reality of the need to bring their expenditure into line with what their allocations should realistically support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They met them in the past fortnight to discuss their proposals and the Department now are analysing the agencies' proposals with a view to ensuring that overall the service plans are co-ordinated and rational.  This will require new arrangements for co-ordinated action between health agencies locally and my Department.  Those arrangements are being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the public service generally by the Government led immediately to the conclusion that to a very significant extent the problems of the numbers employed in the public service have not been tackled in recent years.  For instance, when I took office there were 62,000 people employed in the health boards and other agencies to provide health services.  Ten years ago there were 51,000.  I find it difficult to <Col N="2585" /> accept that this increase in numbers has produced a corresponding improvement in that time in the quality of the service delivered to the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the financial difficulties facing the economy at present, this clearly is a situation which could not be allowed to continue.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance announced that no public service vacancy could be filled without the express approval of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  Following discussions with the Department of Finance a package was agreed.  Because of the late stage in the financial year and the random effect on services by closing down all vacancies as they occurred, this package was, first, the non-filling of some vacancies; secondly, a reduction in the number of current temporary employees and, thirdly, a reduced scale of local cover to achieve an overall reduction of 2,000 posts by 31 December 1987.</P>
      <P>The setting up of a specific target for each agency gave the management of health agencies flexibility to allow for the effects of the hardships of a total embargo on the filling of vacancies and on the provision of local cover.  At the same time it involved agencies taking a much stricter approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood ten minutes before the debate began that there was agreement on the division of my time.  I understood that the Government were conceding five minutes to The Workers' Party but I have heard since that that has been withdrawn and that that party will be given the five minutes I am conceding. The Chair expressed the view that Private Members' Business was degenerating into comic relief but the Labour Party do not regard the position of the health services as a matter for comic relief.  The population do not regard it as comic relief.  At last we are having a debate on an issue that is causing great public disquiet, concern and controversy.  The debate has come about not by the Government conceding time to allow the issue to be debated in a proper manner but by a party tabling a motion to be debated in Private Members' Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for the debate is a motion from the Progressive Democrats the first line of which indicates the schizophrenia that exists in that party on this and other issues.  They wish the Dáil to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for Health and note the widespread public concern notwithstanding an increase this year of £13.082 million for the health services.  What increase are the PDs talking about?  The increase alluded to is the money it is expected to collect from charges, £6 million from charges to outpatients and £6.5 million from charges to in-patients.  Those charges were levied by the Government with the collusion of Opposition parties.  The Labour Party have resisted those charges and tabled a motion to rescind them because we consider them to be fundamentally unjust.  Those charges were supported by the Progressive Democrats.  It is time all parties in the House behaved in a responsible manner rather than trying to have it both ways; supporting a general strategy <Col N="2589" /> while making political capital when the details are unveiled at ground level. Other parties created a rumpus in the House and in the constituencies, and that provides a neat smokescreen to avoid the public glare of their support for the budget.  It should be remembered that these provisions were included in the budget.</P>
    <P>The real issue for those who are not afraid to address it is the net provision by the Department of Health, and the House, to run our health services.  The Labour Party have tabled their own Private Members' motion to deal with this issue and we will press it to the limit.  The real issue is the reduction by the Fianna Fáil administration of the net Exchequer provision for Health from £1,115 million in 1986 to £1,111 million in 1987.  It is worth noting that 70 per cent of that provision will go on salaries and pensions which will rise this year by a minimum of 3 per cent.  An increase of that magnitude is required if the boards are to stand still, at a minimum.  The <i>de facto</i> cuts of £50 million-plus are causing the havoc we are witnessing throughout the country.  They are causing fear and anguish among the population, particularly the elderly, and uncertainty and anger among those who are working in our health services.</P>
    <P>What is causing this pandemonium?  Is it being caused by a modest cutback?  I should like to spell out in detail what the cutbacks mean in the South Eastern Health Board area which covers my constituency. I listened with amusement to the Minister's statement that he is seeking to protect key services.  Perhaps he does not regard the propositions of the South Eastern Health board as affecting key services.  How does he regard the closure of five support hospitals?  In the auxiliary hospital in Kilkenny 36 beds and 19 jobs are to go resulting in savings of £280,000.  At Bagenalstown, County Carlow, 35 beds and 17 jobs are to go with an expected saving of £260,000.  At Brownswood in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, 112 beds and 64 jobs are to go saving £780,000 despite the fact that £14 million has been spent on improvements in that hospital in recent years.  In fact, <Col N="2590" /> last week £25,000 was spent on a new lift. At Lismore in County Waterford 21 beds and 12 jobs are to go resulting in a saving of £140,000.  In Tipperary town 42 beds and 24 jobs are to go resulting in a saving of £90,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hospitals with acute units, Waterford Regional Hospital is to lose 45 beds, ranging from maternity to ENT, and 26 jobs.  At Wexford General Hospital 30 beds in the surgical and gynaecology wards and 16 jobs are to go. At Saint Lukes in Kilkenny 35 beds &mdash; the children's ward is being halved &mdash; and ten jobs are to go.  At Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel 20 beds and six jobs are to go while at Saint Joseph's in Clonmel ten beds and three jobs are to go. The orthopaedic hospital for the region, Kilcreene in County Kilkenny, will lose 30 beds and ten jobs despite the fact that elderly people in the region have been waiting months for vital hip operations. Clearly many of them will not live to have the operation.</P>
    <P>That is in the hospital area.  What are the effects in the other areas of the Southern Health Board?  The psychiatric service will lose 312 beds in the region and 100 jobs.  The dental and opthalmic service will lose £500,000.  This will effectively end proper dental and ophthalmic services for the region.  In the area of chiropody there has been a loss of £65,000. The child care service area has lost £100,000.  Transport services have been reduced.  The ambulance service has been reduced to cater for emergencies only to transfer people between hospitals or to bring people in for dialysis.  I spoke to ambulance drivers this week who had to break the news to patients who have regular treatment that there was not the money to bring them into hospital, that they must hitch or find a neighbour to bring them in.  This affects elderly people in remote areas who will now have no prospect of continuing with treatment because the ambulance service is gone. The appointment of locums has been virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>The litany of disasters is pages long. That is the real effect of protecting essential service as per the present Fianna Fáil <Col N="2591" /> administration.  We cannot lop £6.3 million off one health board area painlessly. Delicate surgery was required and measures were being implemented by the previous administration who received the anger and bile of the Opposition at the time.  Instead of using a scalpel to prune any excess fat the Minister, nudged by the Department of Finance, has chosen to use a chainsaw.  Very little will be left after this administration.  The Minister is so concerned about the health services that on 19 November last he said in this House:</P>
    <P>The members of our party are sensitive to the needs of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped.  We know that health care is expensive and we are concerned with the high level of taxation in the State but the people who are paying taxes are not complaining about providing essential services for the less well-off.</P>
    <P>In Government we will discharge what is the responsibility of any civilised Government, to ensure that the necessary level of health service is provided. I call on the Minister to take the necessary action now to ensure the survival of our health services.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Minister to take the action he urged a few short months ago to protect the basic fabric of our health services.</P>
    <P>The issues we address are of prime importance.  Politics has been played with the health services and a cruel deception was perpetrated on the electorate by the Fianna Fáil Party in February.  The charade continues now, with Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats making capital by mouthing against the inevitable consequences of a strategy which they support.  Local TDs say one thing at home but another thing in the House.  I stood on a platform last Saturday with a local Fianna Fáil Deputy who did not mind being rapped on the knuckles by the Taoiseach when he said he would support the local hospital.  That is all right in Enniscorthy but in Dublin we are so isolated from reality one can do the <Col N="2592" /> opposite.  One can say one thing for the local paper and another thing for this House.  Enough is enough.  The people can see through that form of hypocrisy. The reality is that there is a grand coalition now in operation, a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, who fundamentally agree with the strategy of these cuts.  They have said so.  Both in the PD motion and in the Fine Gael amendment they say: &ldquo;wishing to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for health&rdquo;.  They accept the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will resist that view and if we have the opportunity we will put into force the alternative strategy which we spelled out last week which showed where we can get the funding we need for our services.  We refuse to allow in a few short months the creation of a health service where the thickness of one's wallet dictates the quality of service, where private medicine thrives as never before, while people who cannot afford the basic essentials are expected to pay £10 on turning up in an outpatients department.  We indicated where we can get the money.  The Revenue Commissioners could be directed to collect a modest £14 million extra VAT this year out of the £700 million due.  The Government could look into their heart again and rescind their decision to abolish the land tax which would raise £6 million this year.  They could collect money due in health levies from the self-employed, including farmers.  We put forward in detail the amount of money we could raise from these sources to do away with this savagery but that will not happen because 90 per cent of the people voted for parties that wanted those cuts.  We, in the Labour Party will resist it, and we will put forward the alternative every step <Col N="2593" /> of the way so that when it comes to the next election there will be no cruel deceptions and no misapprehensions.  The people will know where they stand on issues of public expenditure and on issues of prime importance such as the Health and welfare of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time since 1927 the national collection of the Fianna Fáil party was not taken up in Ennistymon. We know the reason.  Fifty years later, in 1977, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, moved a supplementary Estimate of £25 million, £9 million of which was for additional staff. Deputy Haughey told Deputy John O'Connell, in a proud voice that in 1977 he took on 4,200 extra health staff.  In 1978, Deputy Haughey moved a supplementary Estimate of £36 million.  In 1979 Deputy Haughey moved a supplementary Estimate of £72 million.  In 1980 Deputy Woods moved a supplemenary Estimate of £36 million and in 1981 Deputy Eileen Desmond, stating that the Estimates did not provide for the original allocation, had to move a supplementary Estimate of £91 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the legacy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Yet that party have the nerve to suggest that because in the years 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 I refused point-blank to bring in any supplementary Estimate as I obliged the health agencies to live within their allocations in those years there was an overrun in the health boards during that period.  Deputy Haughey could not even get the figures correct on budget night when he said the figure was £80 million.  Then it became £55 million. Last night for 1985 it became £19 million and for 1986 it became £36 million.  They do not know how to add up overdrafts incurred by the Fianna Fáil health boards at local level.  They were told in no uncertain terms by me that a supplementary Estimate would not be brought into this House under any circumstances and that if they had an overrun it would be their responsibility.  With due respect to the Minister, he should not try to hang things around the neck of an outgoing Minister based on a threadbare apologia which is <Col N="2594" /> being trotted around by the Fianna Fáil health boards.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the major development which this crisis in the health services has brought about.  In effect we are forcing our national health system, which is overwhelmingly a system based on income taxation and health contributions, into a two-tier public and private system where a person who has a VHI code number will get priority in an operating theatre.  A person who has a VHI number will be given a bed in a hospital but anyone who has not will have to wait and wait whether he or she is in pain or in need or one of their family is in need of medical care.</P>
    <P>Blackrock Private Clinic have submitted a planning application to Dún Laoghaire Corporation looking for two additional floors, 58 more beds costing £3 million.  For what?  More private hospital beds with public consultants creaming it off inside getting £38,000 from us and another £70,000 out of the private hospital, collecting it on the basis of a transfer payment, supported by the PDs in relation to VHI taxation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They and other Deputies will defend giving £30 million in income tax relief to private medicine while public beds in other public hospitals are to be closed down and starved of funds because the people who go into them have not a shilling in their pocket. On top of that, these people have the ignominy and humiliation of having to pay £10 every night for a child of only seven weeks old until they reach £100 in a year.  That is the double standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork the Bon Secours Hospital are pouring £4 million into a private hospital and using the VHI to amortise their capital investment, with the support of the Government.  We are heading for a two-tier system of public and private health care.  We are privatising a national health system which successive Ministers, including the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, endeavoured to build <Col N="2595" /> up on a national basis.  We must stop and examine our health system.  I have no objection to legislation being brought in to give the Minister control over the building of facilities for hospital beds, public and private, health board and voluntary, and control over the specialities. We must do it or the system will slip out of control.  I will support the Taoiseach if he brings in the legislation.  I proposed such a measure in the Health (Amendment) Bill, No. 2 which I am sorry to say the previous Government decided not to go ahead with.  There was opposition from particular interests in that regard.</P>
    <P>We can ensure we have a public system but we have to point out that the mad rush started in August 1986 when the CII, with spurious analyses, stated that this country was grossly over-endowed with hospital beds and acute hospital beds. They do not even know the difference between a consultant covered bed and an acute hospital bed.  This country is not over-endowed with consultant covered beds, which are the beds that matter, or with geriatric beds.  There is a fond belief fostered by the CII and adopted holusbolus by the PDs that we have 12,000 beds too many.  There is another fond belief that because we have a young population we do not need the health services we have, but if one examines basic dependency statistics we have 41 persons per 1,000 under the age of 14 and over the age of 65 and these are the people who predominantly occupy these beds.  We must compare like with like.</P>
    <P>I am infuriated by so-called health economists who are examining data which relates to 1976 and 1979 which has no application to the health system.  I urge the Minister to bring some rationality into this area.  Certain health economists and other so-called economists decided we were spending far too much on health and that it should be cut down to 6.5 per cent of GNP rather than 7.5 per cent of GNP, which we should rationally have.  They decided to take out the shotgun and virtually abolish the health service. Certain other people decided we should go for the privatisation of the <Col N="2596" /> health service and finish up with a completely private service which would in due course destroy the public system.  The private system is based by and large on how much the investors can get out of it, with no concern for real health care and a real assessment of people's actual needs on an objective basis.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the spurious proposals to abolish health advisory committees. That suggestion would yield a lousy £300,000.  They say we should control the consultants &mdash; if we shot the lot of them we would not save £4 million a year in actual public service payments and we would have no system.  These are the kinds of alternative policies which are put forward.  It is also suggested we should raise money by imposing prescription charges but it could not be done. The reality is that the Health Vote was savagely reduced to 6.7 per cent of GNP.</P>

We must deal with policy issues rather than individual personalisation. I urge the staff who will march through Dublin tomorrow to take down their posters about the Minister for Health.  Let them put up posters about Fianna Fáil if they want to &mdash; that is their privilege in a democracy.  We will deal with the policy issues and not the excessive personalisation of Irish politics.  We must deal with this issue in a mature, political, democratic and parliamentary way.

      <P>I would like to avail of the very short time left to me to reply to what has been an unusual debate, unusual not because of what happened in regard to Deputy Sherlock but unusual in that for the first time for many years that I can remember there was no Government amendment to this motion in Private Members' time.  Secondly, this debate is taking place because it is in <Col N="2600" /> Private Members' time as the Government in the past several weeks have daily refused resolutely to allow any form of debate on the health services and are now reluctantly in the aftermath of this debate, allowing some kind of debate tomorrow in such a way that there can be no vote and there can be no decision made or any expression of opinion by this House.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in expressing an opinion tonight in relation to the motion which we put down and to which the Government have put down no amendment. There is an amendment put down by the Fine Gael Party which is one of the most unusual amendments I have ever seen because it proposes to delete all the words in our amendment and then to substitute nearly all of them again with the addition of a few words of no great consequence one way or another.  What precisely that is supposed to achieve I do not know, but a great deal of manoeuvring goes on in relation to amendments. Apparently the amendment, strangely enough because of the unusual rules that are here, seems to take precedence over the motion.  What will happen when it comes to voting I do not know but it seems a strange thing to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point that we sought to make to the Minister for Health last night was the apparent absence of guidelines in relation to the way in which the health services were being administered this year.  The Minister referred to the fact that the Secretary of his Department wrote a letter, a copy of which I have to various health boards and voluntary hospitals telling them that they would have to do different things.  I have read the letter and it certainly does not contain anything but the vaguest of guidelines which would be on no assistance to a health board or to the management of a voluntary hospital.  That seems to be borne out by the fact that the Minister, in his reply last evening announced that next week officials of his Department will start touring the health boards and voluntary hospitals, consulting with the <Col N="2601" /> people concerned, advising and suggesting what they might do.  Then, when all that is over, there is to be further consultation at national level with various experts and so on and then a review group &mdash; the great panacea when things are not really being done &mdash; is to be set up.</P>
    <P>All of these things would be hardly necessary if there were meaningful guidelines. Looking at the figures involved, where in this year we have an increase in the gross Estimate for Health of £13.082 million &mdash; that is there is black and white in the Estimates volume for anybody caring to read it &mdash; we have an extraordinary position with regard to voluntary hospitals.  I have here the list of 40, 50 or whatever is their number in the country.  The way in which they are treated cannot be the subject of any guidelines of any coherence or meaning at all.  For example, one receives an increase of 19.1 per cent, that is at one extremity and quite a number of others receive increases on last year's allocation while most have their allocations decreased.  The highest level of decrease &mdash; where the average is approximately 15 per cent &mdash; is no less than 47.4 per cent. What coherence is there in that?  Or is it saying to those who get more money, &ldquo;we want you to stay in business&rdquo; and to those who get less, especially those who get a lot less, &ldquo;we really want to put you out of business because we cannot close you down unless we have a public sworn inquiry and we do not want to go through the hassle of all of that&rdquo;.  If that is what is being done the Minister would be better off to come and tell that to the House, change the law and avoid this kind of charade because its effect is to terrify large numbers of people, patients, potential patients and staff.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the manner in which staff are now being let go.  Staff are being let go on the basis that those who have no come-back will be the first to go, that is those engaged on a short-term basis who have no permanent contract or who have acquired no statutory or redundancy rights.  They are all being let go.  Tragically, for patients and for the country, they are the people who are in <Col N="2602" /> the front line, mainly nurses and junior doctors.  The Minister gave what might appear to be a very plausible explanation last evening in regard to what is called administrative staff, that was that 10 per cent only of the staff of health boards and so on were administrative.  That may be true in the sense of administrative staff as people sitting behind desks but I believe that the percentage of non-medical staff of hospitals and health boards is really more in the region of 50 per cent. But it is all people on the therapeutic or medical side and particularly those who have not acquired rights in terms of their employment who are being let go.  The result is that there is a totally distorted and disproportionate effect on the sick, on the patients.  It is only right that this House should protest at that situation because it is quite indefensible.  A plausible explanation was given but it is far from the reality.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister of State this evening, or at least in the part of it given to him to read out first, went to great lengths, about two and a half pages, strangely enough in a debate of this kind, to justify what the Department of Health had done over a number of years, and long before he ever came on the scene, in relation to computerisation.  Deputy Molloy made the point here last evening that there was an appalling waste of money in relation to that.  I happen to know something about it because I addressed a question on that topic about two years ago to the then Minister for Health who gave me a very inadequate and rather evasive answer.  I can see that the Department are no less concerned today than then.  As an example of waste in the health services we have the incredible scenario of all that money, over £10 million, having been spent.  Yet we have not even the beginnings of a computerisation service when that, in itself, would be invaluable in reducing the cost of our health services. A lot of explanation is called for in relation to that.  I noticed that the Committee on Public Expenditure failed to get any explanation from the Department as to why this extraordinary system from America was used, a system that simply <Col N="2603" /> did not work in Irish hospitals and had no application whatever to them.</P>
    <P>There is the spectacle of incredible waste in that the Government have decided, since the budget, to expend £7 million in dental benefit on the spouses of insured workers, many of whom are in very comfortable circumstances.  At the same time they cut back on dental expenditure on school children and other people who already have a statutory right to dental benefit.  This has outraged anyone who knows anything about the position, not least the dental profession itself.  It seems to me to be an extraordinary waste of money when we are already in the position that we cannot provide the services we are supposed to provide.</P>
    <P>On the question of equipment it is as well to remember that we already produce more dentists than we need. Apparently it is now the intention of the Minister for Health &mdash; perhaps he will change his mind on it and I would hope he would &mdash; to build a second dental hospital in this country at a cost to the taxpayers of more than £20 million to produce even more dentists when they are already in surplus.</P>

      <P>Apparently this is being done for reasons that have to do with some kind of academic politics going way back for the last ten or 15 years when some sort of promise was made to a particular university.  Equipment is very important in modern medicine, it is much more important than beds alone.  Beds are necessary for the limited number of uses to which they are put at present. Obviously they are necessary for people who are seriously ill.  They are not necessary for people who go to hospital for tests of various kinds, who do not need to remain in hospital as in-patients over a period.  On that question of equipment, which should be directed by the Department in the national interest with an overall view being taken in regard to it, we <Col N="2604" /> have the extraordinary position in Dublin city at present where two machines for the purpose of crushing kidney stones without the necessity for any surgery are being purchased.  These machines take something like 15 minutes only to perform this very necessary task which in the past required major surgery.  Although the demand, not just in the Republic of Ireland but on the island as a whole is for one of these machines only, two are being purchased.</P>

      <P>We were given all kinds of assurances last evening by the Minister for Health that there would be great emphasis placed on community care, community medicine and so on.  Something that happened in the last few days under directions from the Minister apparently under these guidelines, such as they are, is that a training scheme for young doctors &mdash; to train them as general practitioners, 30 of them in the country as a whole &mdash; has been terminated.  Their view on the matter is that this makes a total nonsense of the Minister's suggestion in the House last evening that he is trying to orientate the service towards the community.</P>

      <P>I do not deny that there is need for control.  I fully support the need for control particularly where there has been so much waste, duplication and unnecessary spending in the past, but I seriously question that it should be done in the way it is.  I blame the Minister to this extent, not so much for his intent but for the careless way in which he is going about it without specifying exactly what should be done in a way that would prevent people worrying, becoming distressed both <Col N="2605" /> about their health and their jobs, to the extent that is now the case all over the country.  It is a matter for which the Minister and the Government must accept full responsibility and it is a matter which they should rectify at once.  It is pathetic that in a debate of this kind we have, as some other Deputies have already mentioned, the extraordinary performance from the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="2606" /> of Health who came in here tonight and read out word for word, page after page, the script that was delivered by the Minister for Health in this debate last night.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 16 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a steady improvement in the level of service from my Department despite the enormous increase in workload in recent years.  The average <Col N="2440" /> time taken to process practically all types of claims has fallen as indeed has the time taken to reply to representations from public representatives.  This progress can be attributed to a number of important steps which have been taken to provide a more efficient and co-ordinated service to people who are dependent on social welfare or health board payments.</P>
    <P>The Department have been reorganised and the Social Welfare Services Office, which is an executive office, is now in a position to concentrate on the efficiency of the delivery of services.  The administrative procedures are kept under continual review and I am glad to say that the management and staff in the Department are totally committed to providing the best possible level of service to the public.  There is an ongoing programme of computerisation and there are plans to complete the computerisation of the unemployment payments schemes over the next few years as resources permit.</P>
    <P>A computerised inquiry service has been provided in a number of local offices throughout the country and this is being extended.  Computer links are being used to provide closer working arrangements with community welfare officers of the health boards who are often the first point of contact with claimants.  This means that payments are being made more quickly.</P>
    <P>My Department are making good progress towards providing a more co-ordinated and integrated local service on the lines recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  In a number of centres the local employment exchange manager, the social welfare inspector and the health board official now work closely together and they have reduced the time taken to process unemployment assistance claims from several weeks to a few days.  This has dramatically reduced the &ldquo;interim payment&rdquo; role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme operated by the health boards in these areas.  I propose to extend this arrangement to other offices around the country as soon as the necessary accommodation and computer facilities become available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> I am very anxious to further develop the integrated approach to the delivery of social welfare services generally through the introduction of &ldquo;one-stop-shops&rdquo;. What I have in mind is that, in addition to the normal employment exchange services, clients would have access to current information on social welfare claims, general information on the full range of schemes and services provided by my Department, on-the-spot means assessments for unemployment assistance together with current information on job opportunities, placements and on the courses which are available through the National Manpower Service.  The objective is that, operating as a co-ordinated team, the various personnel involved would meet the needs of the client quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner at the one location.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to unemployment benefit of the person concerned for the period in question is subject to the condition that she must have had at least 26 contributions paid at a class which provides cover against unemployment since her date of entry into insurance and at least 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the contribution year governing her claim.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records the person concerned has only 27 Class J contributions paid on her behalf since she entered insurance.  These contributions provide cover for occupational injuries benefits only.  She has no contributions paid or credited during the contribution year April 1984 to April 1985, which governs her benefit claim from 30 May 1986.  Consequently, it was not possible to authorise her claim.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the plans, if any, he <Col N="2443" /> has to eliminate the anomalies within the existing system regarding the payment of old age pensions; and if he is prepared to pay old age contributory pensions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to old age contributory pension is that a person must have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions since 5 January 1953 or his entry into insurance, if later.  Non-manual workers were, prior to 1974, not compulsorily insurable whenever their income went over a certain limit.  This meant that such workers could have gaps in their insurance record unless they become voluntary contributors.</P>
      <P>In some cases the gaps were such that persons did not have sufficient contributions to qualify for old age contributory pension and I presume that this is the situation which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>This issue was specifically examined in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare which suggested the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for persons in this situation. I am reviewing this matter in the context of my overall consideration of the Commission's recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current signing arrangements for unemployed persons are governed by statutory regulations which provide that claimants for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance must sign the unemployed register to indicate that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.  Persons who <Col N="2444" /> reside within six miles of a local office of my Department are required to present themselves there to sign the register at least once weekly to prove unemployment. Claimants who reside over six miles from the local office are required to attend at their local Garda station or other approved signing centre once a week to have their unemployment declarations certified by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The signing form incorporates a declaration by the claimant that he continues to satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.  In the event of fraudulent claiming, the declaration of unemployment made each week is an essential element in the evidence produced in court.  In addition, the signing form enables claimants to indicate the days on which they were employed each week; in the absence of this declaration, the local office would not know how many days unemployment benefit or assistance were due.</P>
      <P>Attendance at signing centres was introduced to facilitate persons who would have too far to travel to the nearest local office each week.  These claimants generally have no direct contact with the local office and my Department rely on the gardaí to certify that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.  I am satisfied that certification by the gardaí is a necessary control measure against abuses of the unemployment schemes.  Any alternative system such as, for instance, one which allowed claimants generally to submit unsubstantiated declarations to their unemployment by post without the need to present themselves periodically at the local office or signing centre could be open to abuse and loss of public funds.</P>

      <P>The office in question is one of the Department's 81 branch employment offices all of which are supplied and managed on a contract basis.  The contracts with branch employment managers require them to provide suitably furnished premises with adequate counter and other facilities necessary for the efficient provision of services to the public.  In determining the suitability of applicants for the post of manager my Department gives consideration; to a range of factors including the location and suitability of premises.  The branch employment office has been located for some ten years in rented accommodation on the upper floor of a two storey building. A portion of the ground floor is occupied by a person who operates a small scale amusement arcade.  This business, which it is understood has been in operation for several years is entirely separate from the branch employment office and there is no business connection between the branch manager and the operation of the amusement arcade.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's concern, I am satisfied that the accommodation arrangements in Monaghan branch employment office are generally satisfactory and that they are not giving rise to problems in relation to the operation of the social welfare services.  Needless to say matters of this nature in relation to all branch employment offices are the subject of regular review by my Department and steps are taken to remedy any problems as they arise.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation unemployment assistance is payable only from age 18.  In this connection it is of interest to note that the Commission on Social Welfare did not consider that this scheme should be extended to those under 18 but recommended that the needs of 16 to 18 year-olds be met by a reformed supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Supplementary welfare allowance may be paid at present directly to persons under the age of 18 provided, however, that the applicant is not living at home and is not supported by a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>It is also relevant to mention that the various benefit and assistance payments made by my Department and the health boards include increases in respect of dependent children until they reach the age of 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition for receipt of an unemployment payment that the unemployed person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  In general, full time attendance by day at a course of education involves a degree of commitment from the person concerned which would not be consistent with the condition of being available for work.</P>
      <P>Within the limits of the present legislation, however, it is possible for persons to engage in education courses, without affecting their entitlements.  Persons engaged in part time courses who are trying to improve their prospects of employment would generally be able to fulfil the availability for work condition. Similarly, unemployed people who attend evening classes or those who do not attend education institutions but who present themselves for examinations would also be eligible for unemployment payments, provided always that they can show that they are making continuing efforts to secure employment and that the course does not unduly restrict them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of introducing a degree of flexibility into the unemployment payments system is at present under examination in my Department <Col N="2449" /> following the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission drew a distinction between short term or part time education courses and long term courses and recommended that unemployed people should be enabled to participate in short term or part time education courses, perhaps up to six months duration and that unemployed people pursuing long term courses should be taken off the live register and paid under separate arrangements.  These recommendations are being examined in the context of the overall examination of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I should also mention the educational opportunities scheme which is being piloted in Limerick and Tallaght and which is due to finish at the end of the current academic year.  This scheme gives unemployed persons the opportunity to participate in a leaving certificate type course run by their local VEC.  Participants receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payment while attending the course.  The scheme will be professionally evaluated at its conclusion and I am hopeful that useful suggestions may emerge as to how best unemployed persons who wish to do so may improve their education.</P>

Bus drivers and <Col N="2450" /> conductors on the other hand are insured at the full rate and are covered for all benefits and pensions of the system.</P>
      <P>The reason for the exclusion of certain public sector employees from full social insurance was that because of the permanent nature of their employment and the standard of their occupational pension and sick pay arrangements it was considered unnecessary for them to have full social insurance coverage in addition.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare was that full social insurance cover should be provided for all public servants in return for payment of full social insurance contributions. This recommendation is being considered in the context of the examination of the commission's report which is being carried out by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Department have no main frame computers as such.  Its system comprises an extensive computer network based on the VAX range of the Digital Equipment Company.  Practically all the Department's schemes and services are now computerised with the major exception of the unemployment payment schemes which are operated through its local offices.  The Department's network is being built up on the basis of major studies done over the years, involving the assistance of consultants, and is specifically designed to meet the business needs <Col N="2451" /> of the Department which includes its dealings with other agencies such as Health Boards, the NMS and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of pay-related social insurance in 1980, there has been a large and increasing flow of data between the Revenue Commissioners computer system and those of the Department relating to the social insurance contribution records of the insured population. This transfer is done by means of magnetic tape which is considered the most appropriate arrangement for these purposes.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for any further degrees of interface between the computer system of the two organisations. However, an in-depth study of the Department's computerised central records system is underway at present with the help of consultants.  The relationship with the Revenue system will, of course, be an important element in this study but it cannot be said at this stage what recommendations if any may emerge which would point to the need for further computer links.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, continual working relationships of an administrative nature, backed-up where appropriate by computer facilities, between Revenue and the Department.  These operational links are subject to continuous review and adapted where necessary to meet ongoing requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 35 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The pilot Jobsearch programme operated in three locations around the country namely, Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght. It commenced in September 1986 and continued up to March 1987.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme was designed to give selected groups of people intensive coaching in job seeking techniques and it made available to them extensive facilities to put the training into practice in placing themselves in employment.  I should emphasise here that the purpose of the Jobsearch pilot programme was not one of job creation, as is implied by the questions, but to help the long term unemployed by giving them skills and facilities which would assist them in looking for jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that this objective was achieved.  A survey of a substantial number of participants showed that over 80 per cent believed that the course was worthwhile and 76 per cent felt more confident about looking for a job.  A number of people identified self-employment opportunities while others got jobs; <Col N="2453" /> 516 people were interviewed in connection with the pilot programme; 340 of these were listed for the programme with 219 being admitted to the course and 207 completed the course.  Eleven got long term jobs and five short term jobs.  Of the 11 persons who found long term employment eight were in Tallaght, one in Limerick and two in Letterkenny.  In addition 236 people were placed on other schemes or courses.  Of those interviewed 69 ceased claiming and there is no indication as to how many of these got jobs or were already in employment.</P>
    <P>Like the pilot programme the Jobsearch programme announced in the budget is not designed to directly create jobs.  It is concentrated on the long term unemployed.  Its main purpose is to be of personal assistance to those who are six months or more on the live register in their search for work.  As the Deputies may already be aware from public statements I have made to date, the programme provides that by the end of December next 150,000 of those on the live register will have been referred by my Department to the National Manpower Service for interview.  The purpose of this interview is to help them to assess their strengths and weaknesses as potential employees and to assist in the search for work.  Those for whom it is not possible to find employment immediately are considerd for 40,000 manpower scheme opportunities and 12,000 places on Jobsearch courses.  These are four week courses operated by AnCO and are designed to help the participant to improve his or her ability to search for employment.</P>
    <P>Figures available to date show that up to week ended 8 May 1987 a total of 9,827 people were interviewed under the programme.  Of these a total of 1,547 were referred to employment-training schemes and programmes (995) and to job vacancies (552).  To date 310 have been placed in schemes and programmes and 88 have been placed in jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition 484 have been placed in Jobsearch courses.</P>

      <P>It is provided under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, that a person shall be entitled to disability benefit only in respect of a day of incapacity for work.  The legislation does not relate this incapacity to any particular occupation or employment.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, a person who is temporarily ill, will be regarded as incapable if he is unable to follow his normal occupation.  However, in the case of a prolonged claim to disability benefit the incapacity may be assessed in relation to his ability to perform alternative work in a more general sense.  In doing this, however, the person's background, including age, experience and training would be relevant.</P>
      <P>Medical referees provide a second opinion to that of the person's own doctor for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers.  In carrying out examinations, the referee reviews the history of the case, considers any fresh reports received, usually from the general practitioner concerned, and expresses an opinion based on the results of the clinical examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, following an examination, the claimant is deemed capable of work and <Col N="2456" /> appeals against the decision, he is normally referred for a second examination by a different medical referee.</P>
    <P>Where this referee also considers the person capable of work, the case is considered by an appeals officer who examines each case afresh and any relevant submissions received from the appellant. In this connection, the appellant's circumstances, including experience and age, are considered in relation to his returning to his normal occupation or alternative work.</P>
    <P>Where a claimant is deemed to be capable of work, it is open to him if he is unable to obtain employment to apply for unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 11 April 1986.  The social welfare officer completed the investigation on 23 July 1986 and the claim was received in EB13 section on 19 August 1986.  A deciding officer in that section decided the case on 25 August 1986, disallowing the claim on the grounds that the means, derived from the profit from his holding, exceeded the maximum rate payable in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal against the disallowance was received from him on 21 October 1986 and, arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal, his papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  The social welfare officer completed his report on 27 February 1987, having visited the claimant and been furnished by him with additional documentation in relation to income and expenditure.  The case was then sent to an appeals officer for consideration. Depending on the nature of a case an appeals officer may decide to <Col N="2472" /> determine the matter summarily or by way of oral hearing.  It is understood that the appeals officer has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case and that this will take place at an early date.  The person concerned will be advised as soon as a date and venue have been set.</P>
    <P>The lengthy time taken in processing the appeal in the case arose in the first instance from the need for protracted inquiries by the Social Welfare officer before the papers could be referred to the appeals officer and, more recently from the fact that it has not been possible for the appeals officer to arrange an oral hearing of the case because of the large volume of appeals on hand at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kerry is not in receipt of the maximum rate of disability benefit of £41.00 per week in view of the fact that she worked continuously for a period of 20 years up to November 1984; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit at the weekly rate of £38.00.  This is the appropriate rate for a person with 36 contributions in the 1985-86 contribution year which governs her claim.</P>
      <P>In order to have qualified for payment at the full rate, she would have required 12 more contributions paid or credited in that year.  If she feels that she may have had any additional contributions in that year, she should forward evidence to this effect and the position will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of times the amounts of old age non-contributory pensions payable to recipients are reviewed due to the fluctuation in the dollar exchange rate in relation to applicants who are also in receipt of small USA social security pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for pension purposes account is taken of the amount of cash income a person may reasonably <Col N="2475" /> expect to receive during the year succeeding the date of calculation.</P>
      <P>The old age non-contributory pension scheme does not allow for weekly or frequent adjustments to means and entitlements. Cases where a claimant's income includes income from foreign pensions such as USA social security pensions, are normally reviewed on an annual basis and fluctuations of exchange rates are taken into account.  An average may be taken over the quarter or over the whole year prior to the date of recalculation, or the latest current rate may be used, whichever is the most favourable to the pensioner. However, it is open to any pensioner if his means have changed to apply for a review of his entitlement at any time.</P>

      <P>Absenteeism in industry is essentially a management problem and can best be tackled at the level of the individual firm.  It is not a matter in which I, as Minister, can have a direct function. The Irish Productivity Centre, in 1986, initiated an absenteeism control programme to promote measures to reduce absenteeism including the installation by employers of standard measurement and control procedures and the creation of a general awareness in both management and workers alike of the social and economic effects of absenteeism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in order to impress on firms the importance of absenteeism controls, State agencies such as the IDA and SFADCo., require firms seeking grant assistance to provide information on absenteeism levels and control procedures and these factors are taken into account when requests for grants are <Col N="2478" /> being considered.  In the light of these activities, I see no need at this stage for further initiatives on my part.</P>

      <P>Under successive Restrictive Practices Orders since 1972 the number of petrol stations owned or operated by petrol distribution companies has been frozen at the number in existence at that time and, under the terms of the existing Order &mdash; Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit and Motor Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981 &mdash; new wholesalers or suppliers to the market may not own or operate more than 20 stations.</P>
      <P>Those provisions and others in the order are designed to guard against unfair practices and the danger of any abuse of a monopoly position by any one or more of the major oil companies and I believe that they do so satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>From inquiries made by my Department I understand that the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee recently circularised principals of its post-primary schools advising them of their budgets.  Principals were also asked for their views as to how their schools' programme for 1987 would be run so that the committee might ensure that its <Col N="2497" /> authorised financial allocation for 1987 is not exceeded.  In replying to the committee I understand that the principal of the vocational school, used by the voluntary literacy group in question for night classes, referred to the possibility of having to close the school for some nights from September next in order to maintain essential services within his approved financial allocation.  His views and the views of other principals are at present under consideration by the committee but the committee have taken no decision on the matter at issue here.  I also understand that the committee do not intend to reduce the amount of the grant-in-aid made annually to this group for its activities.</P>

      <P>St. John the Baptist junior and senior national schools, Clontarf, Dublin 3, have 26 class groups accommodated in 17 permanent classrooms and nine prefabricated classrooms.  A revised outline sketch scheme for the provision of an extension to, and the improvement of, the permanent accommodation is currently under consideration in my Department. It will not be possible to advance this project significantly in the immediate future because of my Department's capital commitments in respect of contracts recently authorised, and the large number of other projects for which tenders have been received or which are at an advanced stage of planning.  My <Col N="2499" /> Department's primary buildings branch will keep in touch with the school authorities regarding the further processing of their proposals.</P>
