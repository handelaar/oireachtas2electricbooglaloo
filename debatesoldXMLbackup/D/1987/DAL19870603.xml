    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the recent reduction in bank interest rates, the action he proposes to take to ensure that the building societies will reduce their rate of interest, in the interest of borrowers; and if he will make a statement on the matter, in particular the failure of building societies to respond to the latest market movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A 1 per cent reduction in the building societies' mortgage rates takes effect from 1 June for new borrowers and will take effect from 1 July for existing borrowers.  In common with mortgage holders, aspiring home owners and the construction industry, I welcome this reduction, which was announced following discussions between the societies and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree in view of the fact that the rate of inflation is so low it can no longer be justified that the building societies should continue to charge rates of interest which existed when the rate of inflation was about 20 per cent?  Will he agree that his consultations should be extended to include representatives of mortgage holders when he is considering what action should be taken against the building societies for the excessive rates of interest which they are now charging?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Government's economic programme is creating the right atmosphere for the reduction in interest rates, and that includes mortgage rates, and it is hoped that pattern will continue over the months to come.  We look forward to further reductions in mortgage interest rates in the not too distant future.  I am pleased the Deputy <Col N="270" /> opposite supports the point of view outlined in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a reduction of 1 per cent is adequate in the circumstances at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While we would all like to see greater reductions at all times, a reduction of 1 per cent was the most that could be expected at this time.  I regard it as a very positive step.  Certainly, from my investigations a reduction of 1 per cent is the most that could have been expected but we look forward to further decreases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying he accepts that the major element of the increase which the societies imposed some months ago was justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances that existed when the Deputy was Minister perhaps there was some reason for the movement in one direction.  The Deputy will be happy to know that a new air of confidence exists in the economy and that good relations exist between the building societies and myself.  They have been most forthcoming and are prepared to co-operate in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Were any assurances given to the societies at that meeting or meetings or privately which invoked an air of confidence and co-operation on their part resulting in a 1 per cent reduction in mortgage rates?  Was the Minister for Finance informed of any such assurances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter did not arise. Any meetings I had with the societies were well known to Deputies and the media.  There have not been any other meetings held and no assurances, like the Deputy is implying, arose or will arise. The Minister for Finance is aware of all matters concerned with development in the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, in relation to the prospects <Col N="271" /> of a disclosure of deposits with building societies, any assurance was given by the Minister which would lead the societies to anticipate a more benign régime than they might have anticipated from any other administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is getting at as that matter does not arise on this question.  However, I have signalled that new legislation in regard to building society development will be forthcoming and I hope it will be possible to conclude a package before the end of this year following the discussions taking place in the working party which I set up and which are going very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>From the reply to my earlier supplementary question, are we to take it the Minister is suggesting that there were reasons, other than financial, which prompted the building societies to impose an increase some months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not suggesting anything of the sort.  I do not think relationships between the Deputy and the building societies were too good for a period of his term in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the increase imposed by the societies was not merited by their financial circumstances at the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  Do not try to put words in my mouth.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if the number of civil servants in his Department has been reduced or if it is envisaged the number will be reduced in this financial year; and if so the plans he has to redeploy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of background I should say that there has been a significant reduction &mdash; over 20 per cent &mdash; in the number of civil servants in my Department since mid-1981.  During this time there was a substantial increase in the workload.  It has been necessary to constantly redeploy staff and to make other temporary arrangements to deal with priorities.  For example, the services of over 60 inspectors who were engaged on a temporary basis on housing grants work have been dispensed with recently, other staff have been redeployed and overtime working is being curtailed.</P>
      <P>Taking account of all staff movements, there has been a reduction of over 70 on my Department's payroll in the last three months.  There are likely to be further reductions in the current year arising from Government policy in relation to the control of numbers.  The need for further redeployment of staff is also likely to arise, for example, when the backlog of work in relation to discontinued housing grant schemes has been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>How many temporary staff are employed in the Minister's Department? Does he envisage that they will be let go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The likelihood is that other staff will have to be released as the year <Col N="273" /> goes on, particularly when the backlog of inquiries and dealings with the improvement grants begins to subside.  We would all like to see that happen in the near future as it would enable staff to be redeployed in other areas where they are needed and make savings so far as existing staff are concerned.  I do not know the exact numbers of temporary staff employed in the Department, but I will let the Deputy have the figure later on.</P>

      <P>Until this examination is complete I cannot say when I will be in a position to give consideration to the approval of this section of the scheme.

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the amount by which the sum of £142,700,000 provided in this year's Estimates for grants to local authorities in lieu of domestic rates falls short of the sums which local authorities would receive at current rate levels if domestic rates were still payable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the assumptions which would have to be made relating to rate levels, standards of collection, etc., nine years after domestic rates were abolished the value of any calculation on the lines requested would be problematic; such a calculation is in any case impossible since not all local authorities have so far determined their 1987 rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a matter of fact that an undertaking was given to local authorities in 1977, when the remainder of domestic rates were abolished, that the replacement grant would be kept in line with inflation?  Since the rate of inflation is not a matter of arithmetic assumption, the Minister's Department are in a position to calculate accurately the shortfall as sought by Deputy Clohessy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The inflation rate might not <Col N="275" /> create the same difficulty as the other matters I raised.  However, the determination of interest rates is often post the event and it would not be possible to exercise it in the calculation of Estimates in advance of knowing what the rate would be.  I should also like to point out that many of the authorities have not yet completed their business so it would not be possible to facilitate them in the way the Deputy suggested.  There have been many changes since 1977, particularly in regard to the SWA demand and internal capital resources which were allowed to be used towards revenue.  In all the circumstances, it would have been a very difficult task to seek the type of information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the high percentage of council revenue spent on loan charges, would the Minister agree that it is high time he allowed a 100 per cent subsidy on loan charges arising on water and sewerage schemes?  May I respectfully ask the Minister if he has any idea of what it cost the State to answer Question No. 9 by saying that a grant will be paid as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that should be the subject matter of another question but I am told that the cost is in excess of £100.  I do not know if that can be verified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into that as it would only lead to argument.  However, many questions raised are important and deserve a response.  If the question the Deputy raised about one-liners could be eliminated, extra time could be given to dealing with more important questions. In so far as charges are concerned, it is not possible to agree because of financial constraints and I do not see any change in the pattern of servicing loan charges for sanitary services at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, leaving aside his obvious reluctance to give a clearcut answer to Question No. <Col N="276" /> 7, that there has been a vicious cutback in the rate support grant payable to the local authorities during the current year and is he aware that as a result of these cutbacks that not a single penny is available for disabled person's grants or to build extensions to dwellings to facilitate disabled people?  Does the Minister accept that situation and is he satisfied with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is a need to cut back on the level of the rate support grants generally but I am not prepared to accept that it has caused the difficulties to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

Is it not a fact that when domestic rates were abolished in 1977 an explicit commitment was made, that the balance would be maintained on an annual basis in line with inflation?  The Minister's Department must know the answer to that question and frankly, he is failing to give the information to which we are entitled in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present position and prospects of the building industry in (a) the private sector and (b) the public sector indicating the steps, if any, the Government has taken or propose to take to stimulate the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are aware of and have set about addressing, the problems of declining output and employment facing the building industry. The key issue in this regard is the general state of the economy.  The measures <Col N="279" /> taken in this year's budget represent a positive step towards economic recovery, lower interest rates and reduced taxation. The results to date in terms of falling interest rates, including mortgage interest and the prospect of further falls in rates, show clearly that the Government's strategy is correct and is having an impact.  The crucial need is to create the conditions that will be conducive to increased private sector investment in the industry.  I am satisfied that the measures already taken by the Government are the right ones in this regard.  Notwithstanding the acute position of the public finances, the Government have maintained public expenditure on construction at the highest sustainable level.  The reality is that the State cannot continue indefinitely to finance over 70 per cent of construction output.  Public sector funding must be increasingly influenced by the state of the public finances.  The industry can only prosper in line with an improvement in overall economic performance to the achievement of which the Government are committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, that contrary to what he says, the very steps which have been taken by the Government since coming into office, the abolishing of grants and so on, have further depressed an already depressed building industry?  Would he agree that the Fianna Fáil Party before the election promised a substantial injection into the building industry and that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government have badly let down the building industry, both its entrepreneurs and workers?  Would he like to comment on the oft repeated statement of the Taoiseach before the election that their mandate was to get in there and do something and get things moving, and on the fact that while they have got in there all right they have slowed things down even further and are moving nothing?</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to refute what Deputy Taylor has said and I would like to point out that the Government are taking the necessary steps to bring back the economy to a position where it will be able to continue to expand and our commitment is no less than what it always has been to the building industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction output in the commercial and retail sectors in 1987, which is a key indicator of private confidence in the building industry should record its first increase in volume since 1981 and a second significant factor is that cement sales up to the end of April are up 3 per cent on last year and they were always taken by this House as an indicator of how things were going.  I am not saying for one moment that we do not have difficulties in the matter but at least the indicators now are that the economy is recovering from the mess it was left in by the previous administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an international firm of accountants in a report issued since the Government came to power have calculated that by 1991 the number of unemployed will reach 300,000 if Government policies are pursued; would he agree that the Government's policies are contributing, particularly in the building sector, to continuing massive unemployment and would he inform the House of what the Government's plans are in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen references in the media to the report the Deputy refers to but it would be just as well to put on record that the Government are aware of the high level of unemployment and are taking steps to do something about <Col N="281" /> it; take, for instance, our recently announced economic package which included the extension of the natural gas network to serve Dundalk and the development of the Customs House Docks site as a financial services centre.  I am satisfied that they will provide a welcome boost to the output and employment in the building industry and I am satisfied that that is on stream and is going to be a success.  Despite the termination of the home improvement grants scheme expenditure under that scheme will rise from £27 million last year to £100 million this year.  Listening to some of the Deputies, one would think there has been a terrible cutback.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with that in mind that our comprehensive package is being put together, in the hope that we can get the building industry back to the position in which it was some years ago.  I agree these are tough times.  However, to suggest that somehow or other because we terminate the home improvement grants there will be an increase in the amount of unemployment this year is just not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is untrue for the simple reason that an increase from £7 million two years ago to £27 million last year and to £100 million this year and to a very sizeable sum of money next year is a clear indication there will be more activity in that area.  Other areas have been suffering and we are trying to do something about that as well, with the gas network extension, the dock site, tourism development, infrastructural development in other areas.  The Government, from a very bad base line when they took over, are at least addressing themselves to the building industry and trying to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 34 together.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts give planning authorities considerable powers to secure the satisfactory completion of private housing estates.  Advice in regard to the framing of appropriate conditions in planning permissions has been given to planning authorities by my Department to allow for effective action to secure completion of estates to be taken at a later stage, if required.</P>
      <P>I have asked planning authorities to redouble their efforts to eliminate the problem of unfinished estates by using the legislative provisions to the full and by following the advice available to them. I have arranged for the precise extent of the problem of unfinished estates to be ascertained by way of a questionnaire to planning authorities.  I will review the position in the light of the response to see what, if any, new measures might be proposed.</P>
      <P>Section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, which enables the planning authority or a member of the public to seek a High Court Order in planning cases is one of a number of enforcement measures available under the planning Acts.  The section has been used effectively in a large number of cases.  I intend that any problems that have come to light in the operation of the section will be addressed in the context of the next appropriate planning Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously recognises this is a continuous and ongoing problem and that there are a great number of estates throughout the <Col N="286" /> city and country that are in a deplorable state.  The powers the local authorities have are either inadequate or are not being exercised to the extent that would eliminate this problem.  In view of that, would the Minister consider first that local authorities should be encouraged to take these estates in charge on a phased basis?  It would seem to bring more control into the whole area if that were done. At the same time, would the Minister also consider a system whereby a local authority would issue a certificate to the builders confirming that the estate either was taken in charge or, indeed, capable of being taken in charge and that such a certificate or document would be passed over as one of the normal conveyancing documents at the closing of a sale?  That system would, at least, have the effect of protecting purchasers of private houses from finding themselves in the appalling position in which many of they find themselves at present, in unfinished estates.</P>

      <P>I can sympathise with what the Deputy is referring to.  It is just too bad that many people who in good faith buy houses find suddenly that their estates are not completed.  They then find themselves in difficulties as to who is responsible for completion.  So concerned was I about that matter, because I am familiar with some of the difficulties in my own constituency, that I sought to get an exact detail of how difficult the position is nationally.  That questionnaire should be back before too long and whatever action is necessary at that time the Deputy can rest assured that it will have my full support in dealing with the matter finally.  The section 27 arrangement has worked reasonably well in some cases. Quite a number of applications have been granted under section 27.  At the same time it is not the complete solution.  I will take note of what the Deputy said in that matter and when the time comes to devise a new method of getting developers to finish estates properly I will keep it in mind.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider it desirable that in relation to the <Col N="287" /> purchase of new houses, a certain proportion of the cost of the house should be deposited with the local authority until the infrastructure of the estate has been completed?  Would the Minister also agree that in order to allow local authorities to take proceedings against developers in a less cumbersome way, the section 27 powers should be extended to the Circuit Court?  In relation to section 27 proceedings which prohibit the continuance of an unauthorised development, would the Minister agree that no power exists to have the lands reinstated to their original position?  There are no positive action powers under section 27 proceedings.  While developments can be halted the courts do not seem to have the powers to require the developer to reinstate the property.</P>

      <P>I readily agree with much of what the Deputy has said.  It was understood in discussions in this House some years ago that we would tackle this matter and that everything would be resolved.  That did not work out.  Some of the options put forward will have to be considered when we get a complete national breakdown as to the extent of the difficulty.  I am not sure that withholding a proportion of the cost of each house would be the most appropriate way of doing this but certainly we should have some system whereby developers have to give a binding commitment to provide enough money, irrespective of what happens to the developer, to allow some authority subsequently to finish off the job if the developer cannot complete it. Any suggestions made by Deputies should be forwarded to the Department. When we are talking about new planning legislation I will be delighted to consider their suggestions carefully and to seek the support of the House to clear once and for all what I would regard as nothing short of a national disgrace.</P>

      <P>I can see the Deputy's point.  At the moment many developers carry out the total servicing.  Local contractors tell me that if they did that first there would be a lot of traffic because of the building and consequently, they would often have to re-do the surfaces of roads, thereby involving further expenditure. I take the Deputy's point but for small contractors it might pose a large burden which they might not be able to carry.  It would be better if we could get an established binding agreement that irrespective of what happened to them, at least money would be there so that some agency could complete the work should they not be in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>While recognising that there has been a fundamental shift in the house building sector where site development and house building tend to be divorced within the context of the planning legislation, should there not be much greater powers to pass on the responsibilities? In County Dublin there are vast housing estates which have been left unfinished.  Builders build houses and the site developers do not comply with the requirements.  While the High Court has been reasonably satisfactory the procedure is far too cumbersome.  The Minister should consider making it a less cumbersome proceeding to retrieve the bond so that the county councils can take action much sooner.  Some estates in County Dublin have been there 15 or 20 years and have not yet been taken in charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with that in mind that I decided once and for all to establish the extent of the problem so that we could bring forward a package of measures to deal with it.  Planning authorities have considerable powers available to them <Col N="290" /> now under the planning Acts.  They have enforcement notices, prosecution procedures under the 1963 Act, warning notices and High Court proceeding notices under the 1976 Act.  Despite all this we still have the problem.  Obviously there is slackness in the arrangements in so far as the planning schedules are concerned and in relation to the enforcement of bonding and availability of money to finish estates.  The problem seems to be escalating despite all this legislation.  When we get the final report on the questionnaire we will be in a position to know what we have to do and how to tackle it.  At that time I will welcome the support of the House in achieving what we all wish to achieve.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that <Col N="291" /> there is a widespread belief in the planning authorities that the legislation to which the Minister referred is too cumbersome and that the burden of proofs which the planning authority must provide in the courts is expensive, time consuming and difficult to assemble?  Perhaps the Minister would consider in advance of amending legislation, issuing revised guidelines to the planning authorities suggesting that any bonding arrangement entered into is not of an annual and renewable nature but is a bond which must remain in existence until such time as the estate is satisfactorily taken in charge?  If that were considered it might help to alleviate some of the problems which emerge at present through bonds going out of existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have been in touch with the planning authorities about certain aspects of this I take the Deputy's point that perhaps I might resubmit revised guidelines to strengthen the position until such time as we get the new body of legislation.  A statistic worth putting on the record shows the success rate of section 27.  It relates to the rate of injunction applications under section 27 by planning authorities.  The number of applications in 1985 was 67 and the number granted was 62.  A fair amount of legislative power is available there to planning authorities at present, but I agree with the consensus of the Deputies that it is not good enough and needs to be strengthened.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I hope we will go further than just a review of this.  Would the Minister agree that there is a great deal of inconsistency now when people can break traffic lights or ignore pedestrian crossings and go into court and perhaps be fined £5 or else have the Probation Act applied whereas somebody who parks a car for two minutes over the specified time is automatically fined £10 or, if he does not display a tax disc, £50 on the spot?</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of inconsistency in this area.  Would the Minister not agree that we could relieve the time of the courts in dealing with minor traffic offences if, instead, we dealt with them by way of on-the-spot fines?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We were always at one in saying we would like to see better enforcement.  One reason the review of the on-the-spot fines system is considered necessary at this time is that the rate of payment on foot of notice and subsequent reminders issues is only 40 per cent.  The remaining 60 per cent of offences had to be dealt with through the normal court proceedings.  I see a statistic here of 750,000 notices each year.  That means that the system is still keeping about 310,000 cases out of the courts, which I suppose is not so bad, but there is room for improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that since the fine has been increased motorists will be more likely to comply with the law?  The statistic the Minister is giving relates to 12 months presumably whereas the on-the-spot fine relates to non-display of discs and at its present level applies to only the past three months or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to see an improvement here but it seems that, irrespective of the extent of the fine, people are prepared to take the risks involved.  What was introduced by the previous Government has worked reasonably well and perhaps it can be extended to other areas.  Certain areas were suggested and recommended last year and are being considered in consultation with the Garda.  I would have no objection to introducing that if I thought we were going to have a good response and a good take from it but I am against further expansion of schemes like this if they do not work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider extending the scheme?  Legally now we must display insurance discs on our cars.  If I do not display my insurance disc on my car I still have ten days in which to produce evidence of insurance at my local Garda station.  There is no need for that to remain.  I suggest that the scheme be extended to the display of insurance <Col N="294" /> discs on car windscreens.  More important, I ask the Minister to consider tackling this because of the scandal concerning the number of uninsured cars on the road.  There would be more encouragement and incentive for people to display such discs, to ensure they had insurance, if they knew they could be fined on the spot for not having a disc displayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have not the statistics here, let me say that a very worthy scheme was introduced last year, on 1 July if my memory serves me right.  I know the statistics are available somewhere. This has had a very good impact. It has had a beneficial effect and has led to a curtailment of the number of cars being used uninsured on the roads, a situation that has been a tremendous burden on all of us.  It represents about £70 per driver with an insured car on the road.  If we could reduce that number then the total cost of car insurance obviously would decrease as well.  Therefore, I think the disc has worked well.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is not relevant to what we are talking about here, but the Deputy's suggestion of an on-the-spot fine for lack of display of the insurance disc is worthy of being put to the review body.  I will suggest that to them and perhaps they will include it in their report.</P>

Could we have some short debate in the House to discuss the findings of the review group?  Will the Minister agree that it is not just a question <Col N="296" /> of money; it is a question of respect for the law and also a question of using our courts to deal with matters that should be dealt with quickly rather than having them clogged up with traffic offences?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair comment. As we are all aware, under the Local Authority (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975, the only on-the-spot fines which the traffic wardens can collect are for parking offences and the non-display of tax discs. I would be delighted to bring the matter of the inclusion of other items under that category to the review group and I will ask them to speed up their final report.  I see no reason why we should not get suitable time to discuss this matter in the House but I do not know what the proper vehicle for having such a discussion here would be.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether he intends providing additional funding for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to enable them to carry out their mandate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced, funding of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was suspended in the light of the severe budgetary constraints facing the country.  Having discussed the matter with the commission and with Dublin Corporation, and to end the uncertainty regarding the role and functioning of the commission <i>vis-à-vis</i> the corporation, I have decided to dissolve the commission with effect from 1 July 1987.  This will allow the commission time to complete the preparation of an improvement scheme in accordance with the schedule established by them.  I do not, in any event, intend to provide funding for the commission apart from the existing provision of £50,000 to meet liabilities already incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have impressed on Dublin Corporation the importance which I attach to Dublin city centre in the national context and my desire to see environmental improvements carried out there.  The corporation will continue to have special obligations towards the metropolitan central area by virtue of section 2 of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986, and I intend to keep in close touch with the corporation in <Col N="298" /> regard to the steps proposed by them to comply with these obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now telling the House that the Government propose to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission entirely and to negative and set aside all the work which has been done within his Department, in this House and in the other House in the enactment of the legislation to establish the commission and that the powers of the commission are being assigned to Dublin Corporation?  Is that the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some discussions with the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and with Dublin Corporation.  Following those discussions I felt there was no point in prolonging the matter any further in that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission indicated to me that they would be in a position to have their plan ready by not later than the end of June.  Following receipt of that it is my intention to have further discussions with the corporation with a view to seeking the implementation of that plan as far as possible.  I will be dissolving the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission with effect from 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that this news has not previously been announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it then that the specific powers which were assigned by this House to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to carry out a special task in the centre of Dublin are now being assigned to Dublin Corporation but without any funding being made available to them to enable them to carry out, if they were so disposed, the work which would be necessary as a result of the preparation of an improvement plan by the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the matter <Col N="299" /> very carefully.  The existing statutory authorities, principally Dublin Corporation, have powers to tackle the problems and to implement the necessary improvements and I am satisfied about that.  Much of the powers of the commission were paralleled in the planning Acts and are available to Dublin Corporation. I have asked them to take due notice of the fact that it is their primary responsibility to carry out these improvements and they recognise that.  I thought it fair of the commission to suggest, when I was speaking to them, that their real concern was to have the improvements carried out.  It was not a question of who carried out the work but that the matter would be attended to and I support that point of view.</P>
      <P>I have had a very favourable response from Dublin Corporation as a result of my negotiations with them.  They are willing to set up a special task force to deal with the matter.  Section 2 of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act places a duty on Dublin Corporation to have regard to the special importance, in the national interest, of the central area of the metropolis and the need to ensure a high environmental standard and a high standard of civic amenity and civic design.  I understand they will bring forward a realistic package of proposals to deal with that matter and they will have my full support in doing so.  They can be assured of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister suggested that Dublin Corporation previously had the powers which were specifically made available to the streets commission within their remit and yet they did not carry out any of the work which it was envisaged would be carried out by the commission.  Does it not then appear rather disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that, by restoring those responsibilities to the corporation without providing any funding to that body, there is even the remotest possibility that the work which the commission were to do and which was so widely welcomed by a variety of groups, from tourism to <Col N="300" /> commerce to business to city centre interests, will be carried out by the corporation? Is it not rather absurd to consider that they will do that work without any funding being provided to them in view of their failure in that regard during previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the corporation to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the commission at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but previous to that this matter was, and still is as far as I am concerned, the primary responsibility of the corporation.  I agree there is a lot to be done.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission interviewed many people and they have agreed, and it was very fair of them to agree, to pass over to the corporation all the information which they brought together, support they might have, financial support from private involvement and all other documentation, together with the plan of campaign which they will be submitting to me some time during this month.  In my dealings with the corporation to date I impressed upon them that I expect them to honour their responsibility in making the centre of Dublin a better and more pleasant environment and I got a very great response from them.  They said they would see to it that major improvements are carried out in the centre of the city. I can give an assurance to the Deputy and to the House that it is my intention to follow through on this.  I will be really disappointed if, coming into the millennium of the city, major improvements are not carried out in the city centre area over the next number of months and before the millennium starts.</P>

      <P>In view of the extraordinary move of abolishing a body established by this House as recently as the latter months of last year, does the Minister propose to have time made available in the House to discuss this matter?  The abolition of this body can only be considered as a politically vindictive move&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Deputy introduced this sour note into the discussions which I am having with the streets commission and the corporation.  All those consultations have been very pleasant, informative and supportive of the point of view which has been expressed many times by the Deputy, that is that we should improve the city centre area.  That is my aim.  The Deputy can rest assured that following the discussions with the corporation the task force, which they have agreed, will be established immediately to deal with this matter.  They are determined we will all be proud of the improvements of the amenities in the city centre area.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Sellafield Nuclear Complex.</Title>
    <P>37.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals, if any, he has to make a visit to the Sellafield nuclear complex in Great Britain with a <Col N="302" /> view to satisfying himself that the management of the installation is in no way a threat to the environmental condition of the Irish Sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have general responsibility for environmental matters, specific issues relating to the nuclear industry, including the Sellafield issue, are appropriate to my colleague the Minister for Energy.  Accordingly, I have no proposals to visit the Sellafield plant at this time.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that the Nuclear Energy Board visited the plant in December last and subsequently advised that, in view of obsolete design and shortcomings in the light of modern safety criteria, the Government should call for closure of the Calder Hall reactors and the Magnox reprocessing lines</P>
      <P>A report published last year by the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive following a safety audit of the Sellafield reprocessing plant states that it did not appear that the management of the plant has been in sufficient command of all the matters for which it was responsible and in possession of all relevant resources.  The safety executive concluded that the potential for a serious incident exists and that it could not be quite satisfied that all the relevant hazards have been estimated and that protective systems preventing escalation are fully satisfactory.  In these circumstances, the Government have pressed for the closure of the Sellafield plant as the only way to ensure the safety of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting of the EC Environment Council on 21 May, I drew attention to Ireland's concerns about radioactive contamination which relate particularly to the proximity to our shores of a number of major nuclear installations in the United Kingdom.  I pointed out that the Irish Government take a serious view of this matter and are pursuing it bilaterally and through relevant international bodies.  At the same time, we maintain that at Community level, a Community Inspection Force should be established <Col N="303" /> under Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty to determine independently whether installations within the Community are safe.  At that meeting, I called for greater firmness in addressing the issue of Commission involvement in the licensing and supervision of nuclear installations and indicated that we will continue to pursue this fundamental point.</P>
    <P>The closure of the Sellafield plant was called for by the Irish delegation at the meeting in Cardiff this week of the Commission of the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources.  Unfortunately, the motion did not receive widespread support from the participating countries. However, I understand that a further motion which we presented calling for the application of the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible any pollution caused by radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment is likely to be ratified today.  While the motion is not legally binding, its ratification would greatly increase the pressure to improve the technology in use at Sellafield.  The Government will, of course, continue to press for closure of the plant as this, in our view, is the only real solution to the problems it poses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like you, Sir, I am conscious of the time and, with your permission, I wish to ask one supplementary. Will the Minister not agree that in view of the widespread concern in this country about the total incompetence with which the British authorities appear to be running Sellafield, and in view of the fact that this House has unanimously called for its closure, a visit by him as Minister for the Environment representing all the Irish people, would lend strength and publicity to this demand?  In view of that position from which the Minister can only draw strength, would he not think it appropriate that he should make arrangements for such a visit in order to highlight the common position which we all share <Col N="304" /> on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to recognise the support that exists in this House, particularly since last December, for the closure of Sellafield.  If I thought my going there would speed up the closure of that reprocessing plant I would go right away but I am not satisfied that it would. However, I take the Deputy's point and I will consider this further.  The important point to be made here is that the safety executive report which concluded that the management at Sellafield was not up to scratch, also brought home to British Nuclear Fuels Limited that they have one year to meet the requirements of the Health and Safety Executive.  We all agree it may not be possible to meet that deadline and, if not, we will redouble our efforts to have the Sellafield plant closed finally.  I thank the Deputy and the other Members of the House who joined with us in making this a unanimous call for the closure of Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing this Bill. This is a Bill of some considerable importance in the area of legal reform.  We are one of the few countries in Europe that has not enacted the necessary legislation on foot of the European Convention on the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments.</P>
      <P>The reason this Bill is being withdrawn from this House and put into the Seanad &mdash; instead of this House fulfilling its legislative role &mdash; is that the Government party wish to close down this House as early as possible, and flee this House for the entirety of the summer months.  It is a relevant point to make.  This Bill, having been introduced and had a First Reading in this House some weeks ago, there is no logical reason this House cannot process Second Stage and the various Stages through before the summer recess and then allow the Bill to go to the Seanad. There is one reason only this Bill is being withdrawn today, that is the desire of the Government to get out of this House and to diminish the legislative role this House should play.</P>

In the context of the massive amount of legislation that needs to be enacted by the Oireachtas, including this Bill, there is no valid reason this House cannot process this Bill and other measures through the month of July, come back at the beginning of September and get on with the legislative process, which is what the general public and the electorate wish to see us do.</P>

I would like, in the first instance, before discussing individual aspects of the Bill, to refer to developments since the budget and to outline the Government's general approach to taxation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential strategy underlying the budget was to restore confidence in the economy, bring down interest rates, reverse the trend of outflows of capital and encourage investment.  To achieve this we had to demonstrate clearly our determination to improve the public finances and we also had to focus special attention on opportunities for development in productive sectors of the economy. The budget strategy is working even at this early stage.  Already interest rates have fallen significantly and further reductions are expected as the year progresses. Money is flowing back into the economy and this will be reflected in new investment and new job opportunities. There can be no doubt about our commitment to reaching the targets we have set for the public finances.  While this <Col N="425" /> policy has led to some cut backs in services, the reality is that there are no reasonable alternatives.  Excessive borrowing would simply drag the economy into a downward spiral and the consequence of this would be intolerable reductions in services at a later stage.</P>
    <P>We have recognised, however, that control of the public finances is not sufficient in itself to create the new sense of direction that the economy needs.  There must also be specific initiatives to promote development and new openings for employment.  We have wasted no time in taking these initiatives.  To illustrate what we are doing, I would draw your attention to the provisions in the Bill before us today to promote the new financial services centre in the Custom House area and to encourage more investment in shipping, tourism and the food processing sector.  This is by no means a comprehensive list; we are exploring specific possibilities in a whole range of sectors and the Government are regularly monitoring progress in each case.</P>
    <P>Despite the adverse reaction to specific measures, the general response to the budget has been encouraging.  There is a recognition among the public that something had to be done to stop the rot and that the Government have grasped the nettle.  There is now hope again.  It is early days to expect substantial results but I am confident that, as time progresses, people will come to see more and more the wisdom of what we are doing. We are not out of the wood by any means. I am already on record as saying that we will take whatever steps may be required as the year goes on to adhere to budget targets.  So far the indicators are that we are firmly on course.  The policy of correcting the public finances, however, will have to be continued into 1988 and later years, as necessary.  Otherwise, we will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The subject of today's debate is taxation. The Government have identified reform of the taxation system as a priority because this is an essential element in achieving the scale of economic progress that we need.  There is, it seems, a general consensus on the need for reform.  There <Col N="426" /> would seem to be wide differences of opinion, however, about the appropriate thrust of any such reform.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the reality that our tax levels are high, that they have a negative effect on economic activity and that they are a source of frustration to many people who feel overburdened. Too many people pay income tax above the standard rate and it is demoralising for the average worker to have such a high proportion of his earnings siphoned off through taxation.  High indirect taxes push up retail prices unduly and we have experienced the huge distortion of trade that this can cause.  The restriction of duty free allowances to genuine travellers has eased this situation to a significant extent but the underlying problems will remain if we continue to have high indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>High taxes are the price we have to pay for continuing high public expenditure. In the short term, the poor state of the public finances does not allow us to make any substantial reductions in tax revenues. This does not mean, however, that tax reform must be put on the long finger. On the contrary, we can and we must make progress, however modest, within the constraint imposed by the budget.</P>
    <P>It is a precondition for tax reform that the tax base should be widened and I think there is general agreement about this on all sides of the House.  A wider base allows for a better and fairer distribution and a consequent lowering of rates.  This can only be to the benefit of the economy and it will also remove much of the present frustration with the system. A wider base, however, requires new or increased taxes in some instances and an increasingly efficient collection process to ensure that all who are liable pay their due taxes.</P>
    <P>I do not intend here to set down priorities for extending the tax base.  This is a matter for Government decision in the context of preparations for the budgets of 1988 and later years.  I would point out, however, that taxes on some activities and goods and services here are much lower than the public perception and that it is wrong to suggest that we have high <Col N="427" /> taxes across the board.  The contribution from the business sector is low by international standards.  This is due in no small part to the very generous allowances that are available and I mentioned in the course of my Budget Statement that a review of corporation tax is being undertaken. The contribution from some other sectors is also decidedly low.  These are just examples of areas where taxation cannot be presented as a problem.  There are others but it is not my purpose to be comprehensive here or to identify priorities. Specific steps have been taken in the recent budget to widen the tax base.  In particular, the steps taken to check unreasonable losses of trade through travellers' allowances, and the assignment of additional resources to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will make a useful contribution in this respect.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have given a commitment to rapidly reach the stage where two-thirds of taxpayers pay tax only at the standard rate.  It was not possible to fulfil this commitment in this year's budget because of the extremely difficult situation we inherited.  Income tax reductions, however modest, are expensive in budget terms.  We had to make choices between lower borrowing and lower taxation and the priority had to be to reduce borrowing. As the public finances and the economy improve, we will be in a better position to reduce the burden of income tax and to fulfil our commitment.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent years about inadequacies in our collection system.  The feeling is widespread that arrears are on an enormous scale and that too many people can avoid paying a fair share of tax.  There is considerable misunderstanding about the true situation and some of the figures mentioned about arrears are wild exaggerations. It is a gross misrepresentation to suggest that problems can be solved and the tax burden reduced significantly for all if arrears are duly collected.  At the same time, it must be acknowledged that uncollected tax is a serious problem <Col N="428" /> and any tax reform package must incorporate measures to improve collection. Significant progress has been made in this respect in recent years.  There must be further improvement and this will be a priority with the Government.  It is not enough to have an equitable tax system; it must be demonstrably clear to the public that the system is operated efficiently and that it does not pay to evade tax.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the point of diminishing returns on some taxes.  Our budget problems will not be resolved by higher taxes or improved collection procedures. The emphasis must be on achieving better distribution of taxation in the interests of equity and a more efficient economy.  I am confident that substantial progress will be made in this direction in the 1988 and subsequent budgets.  In the months ahead taxation will be on the agenda for discussion with the social partners.  The Government will be anxious in these discussions to focus attention on the scope for better distribution within the constraints of the budget.  Any discussion on taxation that ignores or sidesteps the budget realities is futile.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak on individual sections of the Bill and to draw the attention of the House, in particular, to the more significant items.  The earlier sections of the Bill are concerned with income tax.  Section 1 provides for the renewal for a further year of the special PRSI tax allowance, which was first introduced in 1982.  The exemption from income tax available to lessors of agricultural land, who are aged 55 or over or who are permanently incapacitated, is being raised from £2,000 to £2,800 in section 2.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the particular attention of the House to the arrangements in section 3 for the credit on farm tax.  While the farm tax has been abolished, a small number of farmers are required to pay it in respect of 1986.  To qualify for a credit against last year's income tax, however, the farm tax due should have been paid by 5 April 1987. The deadline for payment is now being <Col N="429" /> extended to 30 June.  There have been substantial payments of farm tax in recent weeks but there is still up to £3.5 million due for payment to local authorities.  I expect that the extension of the deadline will now secure the early payment of farm tax still outstanding; there will be no further extensions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 abolishes in relation to Irish people working abroad the &ldquo;place of abode&rdquo; test for residence in the State for tax purposes.  Under that test people working abroad are deemed to be resident in Ireland for tax purposes, if they maintain a place of abode here and return, even for a short period, during the tax year.  In consequence, as residents, they are liable to Irish tax on their remittances home.  This is unfair and the change now being made will enable people to visit home and transfer savings without being subject to Irish tax simply because they maintain a place of abode and made short visits home.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the ceiling for relief on dividend income from an Irish manufacturing company is being increased from £7,000 to £9,000 where the company has an approved profit-sharing scheme for its employees.  This is intended as an incentive to companies to introduce profit-sharing schemes which are of benefit both to the companies and the employees and do much to improve industrial relations.  There is also a provision that this relief is to apply only in respect of bona fide ordinary shares.</P>
    <P>Section 6 implements the restriction on mortgage interest relief announced in the budget.  It provides that the relief will be restricted to 90 per cent of mortgage interest actually paid or 90 per cent of the tax limits of £4,000, £2,900 and £2,000 for married couples, widowed persons and single individuals respectively, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>This restriction is necessary in view of the high cost of this relief.  Mortgage interest relief would cost about £160 million in the current tax year if we had not taken action.  The restriction will claw back a small proportion &mdash; £10 million in 1987 &mdash; of this cost.  This clawback has been designed very carefully, so as to <Col N="430" /> ensure that the biggest clawback comes from those who have the biggest benefit from the relief.</P>
    <P>The new restriction must, of course, be seen in the context of the recently announced cut in the mortgage interest rate.  This cut alone goes a long way towards compensating mortgage holders for the reduction in tax relief.  A primary objective of the budget strategy is to force down interest rates and the success of this strategy in the home loans area will continue to be of substantial benefit to mortgage holders generally.</P>
    <P>The requirements for payover of retention tax by financial institutions are being altered in section 7.  The arrangements for crediting interest adopted by some financial institutions meant that they paid over to the Revenue Commissioners tax on less than 12 months' interest for the year 1986-87.  If this situation were not remedied, the 1987 yield from retention tax would be reduced significantly.  The section provides that these institutions will have to make up any shortfall in their 1987 payment by an extra payment and it also protects the yield for future years.</P>
    <P>I should say that the section does not alter either the level or timing of deduction of retention tax from interest on deposits.  That remains as it was.  It is concerned solely with the timing of the payover of retention tax to the Revenue Commissioners by some financial institutions. The retention tax is deducted at source, at the rate of 35 per cent, on interest.  There are refund arrangements for companies and persons over 65 years of age and charitable institutions are exempted from the tax.  There still appears to be some confusion about the impact of the tax on confidentiality and I would like to make the position clear once more.  In so far as resident depositors are concerned, there is no disclosure of information following the introduction of retention tax.  For non-residents there never has been disclosure and there is no disclosure now.  Genuine non-residents can rest assured that their deposits are held in strictest confidence and are not liable for retention tax.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill contains important <Col N="431" /> amendments to the scheme of relief for investment in corporate trades &mdash; otherwise known as the business expansion scheme.  The scheme provides for relief on certain conditions for an individual who subscribes for unquoted ordinary shares in an Irish resident company engaged in manufacture or in certain service activities.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been successful to date in generating additional investment for the activities to which it applies.  Since the relief was introduced in January 1985, over 120 companies and investments of about £12 million have been approved.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the business expansion scheme has been confined to the manufacturing and international services sectors. The Government propose to extend it on a selective basis to certain other areas which we have identified as offering significant potential for increasing output and employment.  The areas in question are shipping, trading houses and export tourism.</P>
    <P>I do not need to outline to the House the difficulties which have beset the shipping industry in recent years.  Positive action is required to enable the industry to recover from these difficulties.  In order to revitalise the industry, shipping will now come within the ambit of the business expansion scheme and, furthermore, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will apply to shipping activities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note the provision that the acquisition of a ship will qualify under the scheme only where such acquisition would be eligible for a grant under a grants scheme administered by the Department of the Marine.  This provision will ensure that all proposals to raise money under the BES to buy ships will be vetted in accordance with strict criteria by the Department of the Marine. This approach will also guarantee that revenue foregone under the scheme will be subject to the same level of scrutiny as the direct expenditure of Exchequer funds in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme is also being extended to trading houses and to <Col N="432" /> export tourism.  I will return to the trading houses at a later stage.  The Government have already highlighted the importance which they attach to tourism and they have demonstrated their commitment to the industry with the package of measures announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Transport and Tourism.</P>
    <P>The qualifying activities under the heading of tourism are set out in section 11.  The term tourist traffic undertaking has been defined in very broad terms to ensure that a wide range of tourist activities can be covered.  There is a requirement that in order to qualify for the benefits of the business expansion scheme a company must obtain approval from Bord Fáilte for a three year development and marketing plan which is primarily designed to increase tourist traffic and revenue from abroad.  The purpose of this is to ensure that qualifying companies are committed to the essential purpose for which the scheme is being extended to the tourist sector, namely to bring in more tourists from abroad.  It will also mean that the expertise of Bord Fáilte in the tourism area will be availed of in deciding on applications for relief under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this new incentive for tourism will give a major boost to the industry in its efforts to attract more foreign visitors to Ireland and that this in turn will have a significant impact on the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of the Bill gives effect to the scheme of tax deduction at source on professional fees paid by certain public sector agencies.  These fees are paid normally to either individuals who are taxed as self-employed or to companies who are liable for corporation tax.  Under the system of tax assessment for the self-employed current tax payments use as a basis for calculation earnings generated in a period which can date back over two years in some instances.  Under corporation tax, payments are due six months after the end of the accounting period to which they relate.  This contrasts with the deduction at source on current earnings under PAYE.  The new <Col N="433" /> system provides for deduction of tax on account, at source, on the publicly funded professional fee payments to which it applies.  Accordingly, from 6 June tax on account will be deducted at source at the rate of 35 per cent from all payments for professional services made by the bodies specified in section 13 of the Bill.  The new system is estimated to yield £25 million in 1987 and it is an important element of the budget for this year.</P>
    <P>There was initially a considerable amount of misunderstanding about the new system and some exaggerated comment as to its effects.  I would like to stress the following points in relation to the scheme.  First, no additional tax liability whatsoever is laid on the persons or companies affected.  Tax deducted at source will be fully offset against tax liability based on the period of account in which the deductions occur.  Secondly, there are provisions for the payment of interim refunds of tax.  These have been included to mitigate refunds of tax.  These have been included to mitigate some of the adverse cash flow effects which would otherwise arise from the new arrangements. Deputies can rest assured that the Revenue Commissioners will process applications for interim refunds with all possible speed, and, thirdly, while the position will vary from case to case it must be borne in mind that the cash flow gain to the Exchequer of £25 million will be spread across some thousands of individuals and companies so that the average charge will be small.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions for refunds and the fact that no additional tax liability is involved, some professional groups remain convinced that the tax will have serious adverse effects.  I have met with most of these groups and am fully aware of their views on the matter.  I am confident however that as the tax becomes operational it will be seen as a reasonable imposition.  Claims that it will force people out of business and that it is discouraging professional people from accepting work on behalf of the State are without foundation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that section 13 enables the list of accountable persons <Col N="434" /> who will operate the tax to be extended by regulation.  While the major public sector bodies paying significant amounts of professional fees are already included, I have arranged for a study of fees payable across the public sector with a view to possibly adding to this list at a future date.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to Chapters IV and V of the Bill and to draw specific attention to the principal items under these headings.  Section 24 provides that the restriction whereby capital allowances are determined on a net of grant' basis will not apply to companies in the food processing sector which purchase their own plant and machinery. This reflects the special priority which the Government attach to investment in the food processing sector.  This is an area where, for export purposes especially, we have significant potential to achieve a higher added value content and large-scale investment is necessary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to shipping and this provision is incorporated in section 26.  This concession is being accompanied by measures designed to curtail certain tax avoidance activities in the sector.  These measures impose restrictions on relief for trading losses of shipping companies and capital allowances in respect of ships used in a 10 per cent shipping trade.</P>
    <P>The intention underlying the anti-avoidance measures is to confine the tax benefit of capital allowances on ships and any accumulated trading losses within the shipping trade.  It has been possible up to now to set these allowances and losses against income other than shipping income by means of group relief and, in the case of capital allowances only, leasing arrangements.  The result is that other companies or individuals can reduce their tax liability artificially and the profits of shipping companies for tax purposes have been artificially increased.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the income of trading houses is proposed in section 27.  Trading houses are defined as companies carrying <Col N="435" /> on a trade which consists exclusively of the sale by wholesale on the export market of Irish manufactured goods.  It is envisaged that these will be private sector companies with no State participation.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government in promoting the establishment of trading houses is to develop a co-ordinated marketing function for Irish manufacturing companies.  Many such companies, although their products have strong export potential, lack the resources and often the capability to exploit this potential. This is largely a function of size, but the result is that smaller companies are put at a serious competitive disadvantage. Trading houses will act as conduits for goods manufactured by such companies.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 28 which relates to the establishment of an international financial services centre in the Custom House Docks site.  The special needs of the Custom House docks site were recognised and provided for in the package of tax incentives contained in the Finance Act, 1986.  These incentives were designed to foster the physical redevelopment of the site.  In order to promote this redevelopment, however, it has been necessary to identify and target specific economic activity which can be attracted into a portion at least of the accommodation being provided on the site.  It is obviously desirable that this activity should be incremental rather than that the site should attract operations already established elsewhere in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland which might be willing to relocate.  The Government believe that the establishment of an international financial services centre offers the best potential for development of the site.</P>
    <P>A low rate of corporation tax is recognised to be a necessary prerequisite for the successful operation of such a development.  Accordingly, provision is being made for the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to income derived from certified international financial services to be carried on in the Custom House docks site.  In defining the services to be permitted, certain services <Col N="436" /> for Irish residents and certain dealings in Irish currency are not included.  Furthermore, in so far as banking functions may be located in the Custom House docks site, they will be subject to the licensing and regulatory authority of the Central Bank on the same basis as banks located elsewhere in the State.  The requirements of the relevant European Communities banking directives will be fully met.</P>
    <P>The Government have notified the European Commission of the initiatives contained in sections 26, 27 and 28 and the normal procedures involved in such notification are being applied.</P>
    <P>Section 31 proposes a new rate of taxation of 45 per cent on the income of banks from home loan business granted after the publication of the Bill.  Incomes from existing home loan business will continue to be taxed at 35 per cent as heretofore and costs on all home loan business will continue to be available to be offset against income from other banking activities subject to the normal corporation tax rate of 50 per cent.  There is, therefore, no reason why those who already have home loans from banks should pay more, and a tax concession is still available in regard to new loans.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements result from section 28 of the Finance Act, 1976 which was introduced to bring the banks into the housing finance market at a time when they were reluctant to become involved.  Over the years, however, the banks have expanded their share of this market and this year both the AIB and the Bank of Ireland have substantially increased their allocations for home loan schemes.  Continuation of the section 28 concession is simply not justified in the present situation where the banks are setting out to be the major lenders in the home loan market and can use the favourable tax arrangement resulting from this concession to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of customs and excise, some relief is provided from excise duty on imported waste oil which is subject to processing to make it suitable for use as industrial fuel oil.  This change <Col N="437" /> corrects an anomaly and it also encourages processing of oil which otherwise would be dumped.  The Bill also confirms excise duty increases on tobacco and certain fuels which were imposed by Order last January.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with value-added tax.  As well as giving effect to the changes announced in the budget, the Bill contains a number of technical provisions. There is a reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the rate on photographic services, waste disposal services and driving instruction as announced in the budget.  In addition, I am extending the benefit of the reduction to admissions to cultural, historical, artistic and scientific exhibitions.  These reductions will have effect from 1 July and are intended as a further stimulus to the important services sector of the economy where, I believe, there is significant potential for job creation.  I am confident that this will improve the competitiveness of this sector and help combat black economy activity, as well as contribute to employment growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also confirms the reduction in the farmer's flat rate VAT addition to prices from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent which I announced in the budget.  This change, which has had effect from 1 May, is being introduced in order to compensate the Exchequer for the revenue foregone on the abolition of the farm tax. As I indicated in the Budget Statement, farmers retain the right to register for VAT and recover in full any VAT paid by them on their farm inputs.  I also mentioned in the budget statement that greater use will be made of the farm profile form in assessing smaller farmers for income tax.  The existing form is being revised and the new arrangements will be put into operation shortly.  The intention is that all farmers likely to have a taxable income should be assessed.  The profile form will enable an inspector of taxes to determine in many cases that no tax liability will arise.  For most other smaller farmers, the inspector will be in a position to assess the amount of tax due, without the need for accounts.  This simplification of procedures should remove the need <Col N="438" /> for smaller farmers generally to seek specialist accounting advice in relation to their tax affairs.</P>
    <P>The main technical VAT provision in the Bill involves an amendment to the rules for deducting input VAT by taxable persons.  Sections 37 and 40 recast the existing provisions along the lines adopted by the European Community in the Sixth EC VAT Directive and these more precise definitions will facilitate both the Revenue Commissioners and taxpayers in operating the tax.  The remaining provisions are of a minor definitional or technical nature.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of stamp duties, provision is made for the continuation of the bank levy to yield £25 million and for an increase in the levy on life assurance premiums from 1? per cent to 3 per cent. The contribution from the financial institutions to corporation tax yield is decidedly small and, while this situation prevails, there is no room for any diminution of levies.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage of the Bill enabling the making of regulations to allow VAT-registered garages a VAT credit in respect of their purchases from unregistered persons of secondhand motor vehicles for resale.  This will eliminate a competitive disadvantage suffered at present by registered garages compared to transactions between unregistered persons which do not attract any liability to VAT.</P>
    <P>There is one further item to which I would like to refer before concluding. The Government will be doing everything possible to increase industrial investment here by foreign-owned companies. Foreign companies already established here have surplus funds which they are, of course, free to repatriate to their parent companies.  I am anxious, however, to increase the range of investment possibilities for these firms so that they may have the choice and the opportunity of putting their surplus cash to work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An enabling provision was made in section 69 of the Finance Act, 1985, for the issue of securities on a tax-exempt <Col N="439" /> basis to eligible foreign-owned firms, thus matching what these firms can already do offshore.  The Government have now completed the scheme for implementing that provision.  Formal documentation is being finalised with the agent banks and I expect the first issue of the securities will take place in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>In this opening address on the Finance Bill, I have sought to outline the Government's general approach to taxation policy and to explain, in brief terms, the more significant items in the Bill.  There will be further opportunity, on Committee stage in particular, to discuss these items in more detail.  I look forward to listening to Deputies' contributions to the debate and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On 6 March 1987, the outgoing Fine Gael Government issued the following statement:</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Parliamentary Party considered the political and budgetary situation at their meeting today and noted the failure of Fianna Fáil to obtain a majority in the Dáil but recognised the likelihood that it would be forming the Government in the incoming Dáil.  It is Fine Gael's objective to use its parliamentary strength in the national interest to achieve a position in the public finances which will create conditions for increased employment and for a lasting cut in the tax burden without adding to debt service cost in future years.  In so far as the incoming Government introduces a budget which corresponds with the above objective, Fine Gael will not oppose it, or the legislative measures required to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of the last sentence of that statement is that not only would Fine Gael not oppose a budget which met certain targets but they would not oppose the legislation to implement that budget, namely the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  We said that our support would be conditional on the Government <Col N="440" /> achieving the position in the public finances which would create conditions for increased employment and for a lasting cut in the tax burden without adding to debt service costs in future years.  Our attitude to this Finance Bill has to be measured against that statement.  In the course of my speech I will assess this Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the last few months a series of U-turns of dizzying proportions by Fianna Fáil.  After 4 years of totally irresponsible opposition, and having fought an election campaign of astounding dishonesty, they arrived in Government without a shot in their locker and having no policy of their own.  They have now, it appears, adopted the policy on which we in Fine Gael fought the election. Fianna Fáil and the Government are entitled to do this as no party have a monopoly of any policy position.  In the national interest I welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil to our policies. This <i>volte face</i> by Fianna Fáil has dealt a stunning blow to the credibility of politicians and to this House.  The policies we put before the electorate were rejected by the people who voted for a softer option and returned Fianna Fáil to office. They on their return to office reneged on all they had promised and implemented a modified version of what had been rejected by the electorate.  Our democracy is not so refined that there is a direct ongoing input by the electorate to Government policy during the life of a Government, but there is a reasonable expectation that immediately on election a Government will not do the direct opposite of what their supporters thought they would do.  This is why this Government find it difficult to get the public to accept what they are doing.  While the Government have the general mandate to govern they have not a particular mandate to follow the policies they are seeking to pursue.  I raise this not to make a debating point but to emphasise one of the oldest principles of democracy, that democratic Government depends on the consent of the people.  A party who set out to mislead the electorate, as Fianna Fáil have done, need not be surprised at <Col N="441" /> the anger of the people at having to endure what they did not vote for and had no reason to expect.</P>
    <P>The question immediately arises, do the Government have an economic policy?  Did they not pursue power rather like the dog who ran after the car and did not know what to do with it when he caught up with it?  If there is an underlying policy there is little evidence of it in either the budget speech or in today's speech by the Minister.  This is a most disappointing Bill.  It is small, mean and unimaginative, a Bill of little content and with no underlying economic policy.  We have been told time and again since budget day that the Government rest their initial impetus on the economy on the prospect of reduced interest rates.  I would like to examine that proposition.  We argued probably stronger than anybody else that we should break out of the vicious circle of high expenditure leading to high deficits, leading to high interest rates and to unemployment.  The way to break out of that was to cut current spending so that interest rates would come down.  What are the benefits of declining interest rates?  First, there should be an immediate benefit to the Exchequer.  If money costs less on the home market than abroad there is less expenditure on debt servicing.  Secondly, there is a direct benefit to the consumer.  Any individual or businessman who has a loan or mortgage should be paying less to service it.  A consequence of that is an increase in disposable income which should lead to some boost of consumer spending thus giving some impetus to the economy.</P>
    <P>All of those are not the primary purposes of declining interest rates.  The real effect of a decline in interest rates is that people will no longer be tempted to buy Government paper because of the high return on it and will invest in the risk areas of the economy which will create wealth and employment.  To achieve that the people with money must be convinced that the regime will last, that the targets will be systematically met and that only the long term prospect of reducing interest rates which, when reduced stay down will give the impetus for the <Col N="442" /> investment, wealth creation and job creation the economy needs.</P>
    <P>We have a significant date coming up shortly &mdash; 30 June when the half year returns are published.  I hope the Government are on line on revenue and on expenditure.  I have reason to suspect they are not.  I hope that if they are not they will immediately take corrective action by further cutting public expenditure. It is only after 15 or 18 months that people or institutions will be tempted to risk capital in that area which will create wealth and jobs.  They will not do it on the basis of interest rates being down today and up tomorrow.  Last year's budget was welcomed in January by the business sector and financial institutions. Interest rates fell rapidly between budget day and 1 July.  They were a lot lower than they are now, certainly by mid June, but in the Autumn of the year they went back up again.  Investment decisions cannot be taken in an atmosphere of uncertainty.  Local uncertainty is within the control of the Minister but there is also international uncertainty and any of us could name four or five factors over which an Irish Minister or Government have no control, or the most marginal control, which can keep interest rates up despite the best efforts of the Minister and the Government.  We are told at the moment that there is a break on the decline in interest rates because we are awaiting the result of the British election. As soon as that is over, we can be sure that there will be a break on the decline in interest rates because we are awaiting the half year returns.  We have the situation in the Gulf, where there was an incident and continuing problems in trade between the US and Japan and so on.  I am just enumerating these things as factors which tend to create the international uncertainty which keeps interest rates up.  It is not possible to base an economic policy on the prospect of declining interest rates if that is the only plank of economic policy.  That is why I am most disappointed in this budget.</P>
    <P>A factor in Irish life which is a bigger disincentive than high interest rates is the high level of taxation and that position is <Col N="443" /> being maintained in the Finance Bill.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to at least put together the legislative structure which would lead to a reforming package to reduce taxation.  The most disappointing aspect of the Finance Bill is that it again increases taxes.  I object to the reduction of the mortgage interest relief.  I object to the abolition of farm tax.  I object to the proposals on withholding tax on professional fees.  I object to the proposal to increase the tax on bank profits on their home loan business from 35 to 45 per cent with consequent increases in mortgage interest rates.</P>
    <P>We are already overtaxed.  In a budget where the Government had not the scope, and I accept they had not the scope, to reduce taxation, where they had not the scope to index income tax allowances, where an extra £300 million is being taken in income tax this year from the PAYE sector, it is intolerable that they should now take steps to make home loans dearer and to abolish the farm tax.  We know the perception PAYE people have of that move.</P>
    <P>A person on a maximum home loan would as a result of this reduction have to pay up to £25 a month more in income tax.  In addition, there is the proposal regarding home loans from the banks. There is pressure to increase interest rates there.  Nothing, except repetition of it today as in the budget speech, has happened to the promise to reduce income tax to standard rate for two thirds of all taxpayers.  If the Government have not the financial scope to reduce tax this year, surely they could have availed of the opportunity to establish the legislative framework for widesprad tax reform commencing with a movement to self assessment, as promised by the previous Government and as endorsed by Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  We have reached a stage where lower interest rates would help companies but would not necessarily help the individuals who work in those companies.  A look at the financial pages of the newspapers in the past <Col N="444" /> two years will reveal all the publicly quoted companies making very large profits and doing extremely well.  They have a very good return on investment.  Day after day we see the returns in the papers. They are doing very well indeed, but the people who take the decisions which bring about these profits are not doing well because their marginal rate of tax is 65 or 66 per cent when you put PRSI and income tax together.  An executive who has a notional salary of £35,000 a year has take home pay of half that amount. The difference between being on £25,000 and £35,000 now is about £4,500.  If something is not done quickly to restore the incentive to work and to give benefits to people for the hard work they put into companies who are very successful and profitable, people will no longer accept their positions and take the risks.  Consequently we will all be at a loss.  It is not possible to operate simply on the prospect of declining interest rates, with all its uncertainty.  I say in all sincerity to the Minister that he will have to move quickly to reduce selectively the higher tax rates or in widening the bands.  He has given no legislative indication in this Bill that he is doing that.  He has missed such an opportunity.  I know he has refirmed the commitment to have two thirds of all taxpayers on the standard rate.  That does not cost a great deal of money.  I know that outlandish promises are being made about tax which cannot be fulfilled, but there is a real problem when those who work the hardest, who produce the results for their companies and whose companies are extremely successful, have no personal benefit from their success.  The Minister has moved again to enhance the tax regime for companies, the ship building sector, the tourist industry, the trading houses, the financial services and the Custom House Docks site development.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A strategy which works on the basis that declining interest rates bring about investment in the short term but which will create wealth and employment while ignoring the people who will be working in those positions will not be successful.  This policy cannot run on the legs that are under it at the moment.  I mentioned previously that competitively we are out of line with many of our neighbours in the EC.  I get various figures for the difference, but in the energy process alone the normal figure given now is that on average our rates on electricity are 30 per cent higher than those of our main competitors.  The same applies to telecommunications and to interest rates. Then we have the high tax rates.  In addition, we are on the periphery and far from the market.  The Minister has missed an opportunity here to give a very strong indication that he intends to move to reform income tax.  It is a pity that that is so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he is reviewing corporation tax.  That is important.  There are so many allowances, so many breaks, so many differences and so many attempts to extend the 10 per cent regime that it is time the whole structure of company taxation was examined.  I suggest that the principle should be to see if some of the allowances could be abolished on a trade off for much lower rates.  So far as I can see the effective rate of 50 per cent is being paid at the moment by only a small group of people in the service sector.  It is time all that was looked at.  I welcome the commitment in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> The Minister is aware that we are opposed to his proposals on withholding tax on professional fees.  First, we consider this to be inequitable and secondly, it will cause major disruption on employment and firms in the areas affected.  The Minister is probably aware that a number of employees have been put on protective notice.  It is genuine protective notice, not a lobbying ploy by the employers concerned.  Third, the tax will not produce the revenue gain anticipated by the Government if the hardship and rebate clauses are to be operated honestly and effectively, as the Minister said they would be, and with expedition by the Revenue Commissioners.  If that happens I do not think that revenue of £25 million will accrue.  The tax is inequitable because it aims to take from firms on a current basis sums which would amount to a great many times their tax liability in relation to either directors' or partners' incomes or corporation profits.  For many of the firms concerned final tax liability amounts to maybe 6 per cent of turnover or less.  The abstraction of 35 per cent of turnover before VAT would constitute a major reduction in cash flow.  If this were to be dealt with by increasing overdraft accommodation the inevitable result would be a substantial increase in interest charges, assuming that the lending institutions were prepared to increase overdrafts to the level required.  In many cases overdraft accommodation requirements would be multiplied by a factor of three and the increase in costs associated with higher overdrafts together with the drastic reduction in cash flow would lead firms to reduce substantially their levels of employment.  It is likely that, given a substantial contraction in the ability of firms in this country to trade successfully and in the provision of professional services, a substantial volume of work currently available would be undertaken by foreign firms with no employment effects in this country.</P>
    <P>The system as proposed by the Government includes a provision for interim refunds.  It has been explained that where the withholding tax deducted is disproportionate to the final tax liability for the <Col N="447" /> firm in their previous accounting year, interim refunds will be made.  The vast majority of firms concerned would be in a position which would justify interim refunds and would, therefore, be seeking them.  Inevitably it would take some time for claims for interim refunds to be processed and paid.  During that period the firms concerned will be at the loss of cash flow and suffer inconvenience and disruption.  Equally, unless the Government envisage excessive delays in the processing of such claims, the cash flow benefits to the Exchequer will be correspondingly reduced.  Thus, the system will create extra paper work, substantial inconvenience to the firms involved and a much smaller than expected cash flow benefit to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Taking all of those factors into account Fine Gael are opposed to withholding tax.  If the Government believe, notwithstanding all of those drawbacks in the scheme, that there is any basis for it in terms of suspected tax evasion, they might consider a system of exemption from withholding tax for firms which can show they have discharged their tax liabilities for their previous accounting period and, perhaps, that their current liabilities in terms of PAYE, PRSI and VAT are paid up to date.  Such a system would very substantially reduce the inconvenience caused to firms by the proposal. I would ask the Minister to propose an amendment along those lines on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why a Minister who has met the professional bodies involved, cannot see the sense of introducing an appropriate amendment.  Many professions are affected.  Those professions associated with the building industry are affected very severely.  I do not know what the building industry did to draw the wrath of the present Government on them but it is certainly a long way from an extra £200 million being invested, the VAT rate being reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent or the capital programme being implemented in full.  Here again it is the professions associated with the <Col N="448" /> building industry, architects, consultant engineers, design teams, who are most affected because of the depression in the building industry where there is little private work.  The larger firms are involved to the tune of 75 to 80 per cent in public work.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's commitment that the Revenue Commissioners will process claims with all possible speed and rebate moneys to anybody who experiences difficulty.  Frankly, I do not accept that commitment.  I have never seen it happen to date.  There are two ways in which one can get a rebate of money on withholding tax.  First, if one pays in excess &mdash; and many firms will pay in excess of their liability &mdash; one can claim the excess back when agreed audited accounts have been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  It has been my experience that they will not be in a position to make a claim in respect of what they have been paying in excess since 6 June this year until this time next year. By this time next year they will have paid a substantial amount of their 1988 withholding tax.  I am sure the Minister has looked at facsimile balance sheets, putative balance sheets, but I wonder has he been examining them on a one-year basis.  Take a company with a turnover of £1 million, employing a lot of people, all of whom pay their PAYE and PRSI contributions, whose partners are paid a monthly salary on which they pay PAYE and PRSI.  Their profit at present will be between 6 per cent and 8 per cent and 35 per cent of their turnover is being confiscated.  The Minister informs the House that they will get back the difference if they have a very good accountant and provided everything is agreed with the Revenue Commissioners this time next year.  I know firms who experience difficulty in submitting their accounts by the end of the year.  We all know companies with vast resources in the State and private sectors which are not in a position to publish their accounts until very late in the year and sometimes not in the calendar year at all.  Therefore, to tell people that they will have their money refunded if there is any excess <Col N="449" /> payment is a bit of a joke and one that is not going down very well at present.</P>
    <P>To revert to the point I was making &mdash; if one examines over three years rather than one year a balance sheet of a putative company with a turnover of £1 million, one will find that that company is permanently out of pocket to the tune of approximately £200,000, if they are a firm engaging in 75 per cent to 80 per cent State business.  That is the kind of firm about which we are talking at present in the professions associated with the building industry.  It constitutes a devastating imposition.  I do not believe they will be able to carry the overdraft.  Indeed I do not think they will get the overdraft.  They will not get the money back; they will be on permanent loan of approximately £200,000 to the Revenue Commissioners if they have the kind of turnover about which I am speaking.  That is why their staff are already on protective notice.</P>
    <P>The other provision for rebate is what could be described as the hardship clause, because that is the phrase used in the Bill.  That is extraordinarily loosely drawn.  Everything must be to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners. One does not reach first base at all unless a major proportion of one's business is in the public sector.  The terms used are very loose.  There is no attempt to closely define the type of company or person who can claim rebates on a current basis under the hardship provisions of the Bill. I hope I am not stretching the patience of the Minister or the House but I believe some of these sections were inserted to avoid a legal challenge.  I have had some experience of legislation.  I know how a Bill is begotten, born and eventually delivered into the House.  I believe some of the concessions in this Bill are not provided to relieve hardship.  Rather they are inserted deliberately to avoid a successful challenge in the courts.</P>
    <P>If that is the thinking, the Minister would need to re-examine the matter.  On the one hand there is a list of professions and on the other a list of State bodies who are paymasters, paymasters being instructed to deduct 35 per cent of any amount due to any of the professions <Col N="450" /> listed.  It is a crude enough instrument, its very crudity and simplicity probably protecting it from challenge to a large degree.  In any measure such as this where assets are confiscated, where tax is deliberately taken which is not due, then certainly rebate clauses have to be introduced.  Clauses to avoid companies closing down have to be introduced and be effective.  I am also of the view that a very strong claim for compensation could be made that a minimum in respect of the interest on the amount of excess withheld should be paid to the professions involved.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this because, as at present constituted, it is a very crude tax and does not hold the possibility of working well.</P>
    <P>There are other professions which will be affected, for example, doctors and dentists whose main work is in the public area.  In many cases service will be diminished by this tax.  For example, I cannot see what would substantially be a public health dental practice surviving when 35 per cent of its turnover is taken in this way.  The tendency will be for many professions to concentrate in so far as they can on the private sector where there is no withholding tax and to pick up public sector work only when in need or in the absence of other work.  The danger is that professionals working for the State will not get work elsewhere.  In present economic circumstances it could mean that the State would have very good professionals but if economic circumstances were to improve these people would not be available to the State.</P>
    <P>It has been openly stated by people in the legal profession that top-flight legal professionals will not be available for State work as a result of the withholding tax.  I say to the Minister that Fine Gael have a commitment not only to the implementation of a budget which means they have certain targets but to the passing of the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill but that was not an unconditional commitment.  I ask the Minister to move amendments on Committee Stage which would remove the inequity and the injustice from this tax.  Otherwise <Col N="451" /> we will be forced to vote against the section.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt briefly with the question of home loans.  It is ironic that a budget and a Finance Bill which, in the Minister's own words, is the vehicle which delivers the budget propositions, should have included in it a number of sections which drive interest rates up while the economic strategy is to get interest rates down.  You can argue that in the case of somebody who loses 10 per cent of his mortgage interest relief while his interest will not rise but his income tax will and he will end up worse off with less disposable income.  To couple that with the proposal to increase taxation on the profits on home loans which the banks lend is very unfair, very shortsighted and is a mistake.  The Minister, like any other Minister, said today that what we have here is the Bill which implements the proposals of the budget.  However, the proposal to increase the tax on banks was not included in the budget and, therefore, it cannot be included in the Finance Bill for revenue reasons because it is not in the calculations.  The Minister did not introduce this tax to get more money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If he had introduced it, it would have been in the budget; it would have been announced here and it would be a slightly different story.  Between the day of the budget and last week the lobbying was very strong. There is now a tilt on the pitch and there is a team who are expected to play uphill again.  If we are to use the imagery of level pitches, I do not mind whether the banks play uphill or downhill or whether the building societies play uphill or downhill. I am only interested in the person who takes out a loan.  If the Minister wanted to do something for the building societies, why did he not give them a break in the Finance Bill?  Why did he not let them apply a credit at 50 per cent rather than 35 per cent if that was the intent?  Instead of that, the banks are <Col N="452" /> putatively disadvantaged but, of course, they will pass it on.</P>
      <P>I would like to put another proposition to the Minister and it is important in the context of what I already said about interest rates.  I do not believe the banks will pass all of this on to people who have mortgages.  If they were simply to apply this to new loans they would go out of business.  It is difficult to get a figure on this but if banks were to apply the whole economic cost to new loans it would mean an increase in interest rates of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.  If they were to apply it across their portfolio of loans in the home loan sector obviously that figure would be reduced to 2 per cent or 2.2 per cent.  The banks will either increase mortgage rates slightly, as the Bank of Ireland have already done by increasing their rates by three-quarters of 1 per cent or, alternatively, they will hold their rate on the basis that interest rates will drop anyway.  To hold rates at a time of dropping interest rates is as good as an increase.  The banks will go beyond that and spread their losses over the sector. The Minister will find that the measure which he has introduced to help the building societies will act as a brake on interest rates on loans in the very area where he wants a reduction, in the area of investment, wealth creation and job creation. The banking sector will not give up the lucrative home loan market.  They will not put themselves out of business.  They will spread the penalty across their whole portfolio of loans.  The Minister has cut a stick with which to beat himself.</P>
      <P>I would like to examine the area of corporation tax.  I welcome very much the Minister's statement that corporation tax will be subject to a general review. That is very important.  There are notional rates which apply at present and, as I said already, only a small number of companies in the service sector actually pay the rates.  I am concerned about the piecemeal extension of the 10 per cent corporation tax which applies to manufacturing companies, to new areas of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows the normal rate of corporation tax is 50 per cent and the <Col N="453" /> effective rates are much lower than that. On average the actual corporation tax paid in Ireland represents only about 15 per cent of gross taxable profits.  Why should we have a 50 per cent rate of corporation tax with a mass of reliefs if the effective rate is 15 per cent?  That should be examined.  There is also the 10 per cent rate which is the most significant special rate and which applies to a corporate income by and large with regard to manufacturing companies and to a range of other activities.  The Minister and many Members of the House are aware of the full range of these activities. They include certain service activities in Shannon Airport and certain computer services &mdash; for example, data processing and software development.  It also applies to fish farming, mushroom cultivation, repairs carried out within the State to a ship wholly owned by persons not ordinarily resident in the State and also to certain design and planning services carried out in the State in connection with chemicals, electrical works and civil and mechanical engineering works executed outside the territories of the member states of the European Communities.  We also know there is a commitment that the rate will apply up to the year 2000.  Under section 39(a) of the Finance Act, 1980, the Minister can designate certain firms in the Shannon region to qualify for this percentage rate also.  What the Minister has done here is to simply extend the Shannon régime to the Custom House Docks.</P>
    <P>I would like to put down another marker here.  The piecemeal extension of the 10 per cent rate is going to cause difficulties with our partners in the EC, and particularly with the Commission. When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce there was a debate emerging in Europe on aids to industry. The general theory was that the centre was wealthy, that the golden triangle could resist the winds of market forces and that wealth could be created in the centre of the Community without State intervention.  The notional policy was that you help the periphery by low tax régimes and grants because of the disadvantages <Col N="454" /> of being on the periphery &mdash; the west of Ireland, Ireland as a whole, or Sicily &mdash; but that is not happening any longer.  Now, the Mezzogiorno has been defined to extend into the more fashionable suburbs of Rome.  Because of the decline in traditional industries, places like the Ruhr Valley, which we learned in school was the hub of European industry, are getting significant grants of 26 per cent or 27 per cent.  They do not work on averages in Europe.  If we worked on averages the grant rate might be 50 per cent or even 32 or 33 per cent, but they work on the maximum.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that the system of a State spending taxpayers' money to attract industry to a deprived area of the Community is beginning not to work because as much, if not more, is being put into developed areas of the wealthy countries.  I believe the debate which has already started will hot up in 1987 and 1988.  In that context Ireland can gain certain advantages but there are problems as well.  It is very difficult to argue that as an economic region the capital city is the disadvantaged part of the country.</P>
    <P>Under this proposal the Customs House dock site will have the lowest tax régime in the country &mdash; the 10 per cent rate on manufacturing industry extended to the services, and the rates remission which was introduced in last year's Finance Bill.  This means that through a combination of local taxes and corporate tax it will have the lowest tax régime in the country.  That is fair enough in one sense, but another principle of the encouragement of industry is this: one should help communities rather than regions. The EC schemes are to help the people living in the region, not the region itself. The people living in Gardiner Street and Sheriff Street flats are not the people who will benefit from a financial service industry in the Custom House docks. Therefore, it will be very difficult for the Minister and his officials to go to Brussels and argue it is the people in the inner city of Dublin who are being helped because obviously they are not.  I think it is dangerous to continue to extend the 10 per cent régime.  We risk losing not only <Col N="455" /> the level of grants which we apply to industry but also the tax régime for the better off parts of the country, and especially the Dublin area as a whole, if we push this too far.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the individual elements of what the Minister has done. I believe the 10 per cent régime for financial services can be justified and the 10 per cent régime for the new trading houses is a good idea.  I will come back to that in more detail on Committee Stage because, as drafted, it is extraordinarily loose and it would be possible to drive a coach and four through it.  I wonder what regulations will prevent somebody with a warehouse, having appropriate documentation, repackaging imported products and re-exporting them, claiming the 10 per cent régime?  It will be extremely difficult to administer this.  As a concept it is a good idea and is in line with what many of us have been saying, including the Minister, this is, that we are weak in the marketing area and if we had specific trading firms they might enter the marketplace, purchase Irish goods wholesale and use their expertise to sell them all over the world, and particularly in the Community.</P>
    <P>To return to the financial services, a second difficulty arises, and the Minister is probably aware of it.  In my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce a significant American finance house was interested in setting up a financial service enterprise in Dublin.  It was possible, by Government decision, to indicate that the 10 per cent régime would apply, even though the enterprise was in Dublin city, but they had problems with the cost of telephone calls to England because they were competing with a British location which could provide domestic calls over the same distance at about 10 per cent of what it would cost out of Dublin.  The Dublin call was an international one while the British call was domestic.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the transmission of voice rather than data, our telecommunication costs are completely out of line with what is going on in western Europe and particularly in the United <Col N="456" /> Kingdom.  The negotiations were coming along nicely and the IDA were doing a good job, but it was put on the back burner, and it took us two weeks to find out why.  The 1986 United States Tax Reform Act had become law.  It changed corporate tax and individual personal taxation and also changed the treatment of taxation of finance houses with offshore subsidiaries.  The new code would require the United States parent company to pay tax at the standard rate of United States corporation tax of 34 per cent.  There is something called the sub-part F provisions and overseas subsidiaries would have their earnings subject to the 34 per cent tax rate, whether those earnings were remitted and then credit would be given for any tax paid in the country of location.  Up to now the 10 per cent tax régime worked well for manufacturing industry and attracted many offshore companies, a significant number from the United States, but it was not possible for these companies to repatriate their profits directly.  Frequently they repatriated through plant in another country which was not profitable or which had very significant start up costs.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am taking the long way round but what I am getting at is this: the proposals in the Bill is that we apply the 10 per cent régime to financial services which would set up in the Custom House Docks.  As I understand it, the target market to a large extent would be American banks, American financial institutions and American stockbroking firms.  They would locate there and use our excellent telecommunications, even though the costs are high, to trade on the London market.  The problem with that proposition is that the 10 per cent is no longer an advantage because regardless of whether it is in Chicago, New York, Boston or Dublin, if the American unit makes a profit it will have to pay tax at 34 per cent.  An American bank, located in the Custom House Docks site will pay tax at 34 per cent as if it were at home. Therefore, the carrot of low taxation does not apply to American companies. If an American bank or stock-broking firm want to avoid the high rents charged <Col N="457" /> for accommodation in London and high salary rates, I cannot understand why they would not locate in Edinburgh or Bristol.  The British rate of tax is 35 per cent but they would pay 34 per cent here. If they paid 10 per cent to the Irish Government they would get that as a credit.</P>
    <P>The proposal for financial services in the Custom House docks site has gone off at half cock.  It will be extremely difficult to recover it unless the Minister moves very quickly.  It will be very difficult both in law and in practice to have a 10 per cent rate for the docks site while companies providing the same services located elsewhere will be subject to a 50 per cent rate.  For example, how do we tell someone located in Dame Street who is trading in futures that he will have to pay at the rate of 50 per cent while a person located in the dock site will only pay 10 per cent?</P>
    <P>It was thought that only manufacturing industry engaged in export was subject to the 10 per cent rate.  That was the original intention but it was impossible to confine it to one section of the industry. All manufacturing industry is now taxed at the 10 per cent rate.  The Minister should look at the whole proposal again because we cannot become involved in promoting the Custom House docks site internationally as a financial centre unless we have the full package in place.  I fear the risk of a major failure to attract appropriate investors to the docks site.</P>
    <P>We have double taxation agreements with 19 other countries.  There is increasing pressure in negotiating double taxation agreements to include obligations regarding exchange of information.  We need not look any further than the agreement we have with the UK to verify what I am saying.  The Minister will have to look at the areas of secrecy and confidentiality. He will have to legislate before the State agencies launch forth to sell this concept internationally.  I do not believe that the 10 per cent tax rate is a sufficient magnet any longer to attract in US companies.  It may be argued that it might be possible to attract in financial services companies and banks from <Col N="458" /> Europe.  The main concern will be to prevent people who trade in the docks site from becoming involved in the domestic market.  A symbolic fence will have to be erected to prevent them from taking deposits, making loans or carrying on many transactions in IR£.  There will be difficulties with exchange control and with the Central Bank's licensing system. The Minister said that the banks have the power, by means of licence, to provide a regulatory environment.  I question whether they have the power to apply one set of criteria in one instance and a different set in another.  At the end of 1988, the Central Bank will find it impossible to discriminate against a Luxembourg bank or a German bank setting up in the Custom House docks site.  There will be enormous difficulty in trying to confine their activities to the areas of trading we wish to confine them to.</P>
    <P>As politicians, we pick up bits of information about finance, industry, law and so on.  I do not have any qualifications but as I understand it the whole basis of banking confidentiality is based on contract law.  If the bank breaks its confidentiality with you, you can sue them for breach of contract.  However, there is no specific legislation, such as a banks secrecy Act, which protects the secrecy or confidentiality which exists between banks and account holders.  In the absence of such legislation, I doubt if Dublin will be a serious competitor with Switzerland, Luxembourg or New York. I would like the venture to be successful because it would be a great boon to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Shannon enjoys a 10 per cent tax regime already.  Companies which satisfy the Minister for Finance can be licensed to operate in Shannon and enjoy the benefits of the regime.  I hope we will not see an example of displacement economics as a result of the new centre.  There are certain attractions in any capital city and I hope the intention of those who are pushing the scheme the hardest is not to displace economic activity from one part of the city to another or to displace it from Shannon to the Custom House Docks Site.  I do not want to read in the <Col N="459" /> newspapers that GPA are thinking of moving to Dublin.  There will be no benefit to the economy as a whole if we become involved in that kind of displacement economics.  I do not believe that the Minister intends that this should happen.  I will return to that on Committee Stage because I am not clear how the regulatory scheme will operate and what holds are on the Minister or will be on his successors in the licensing and sanctioning of companies which operate on the docks.</P>
    <P>I dealt at length with the provisions of the Finance Bill and I will be elaborating on many of the points I made on Committee Stage.  Fine Gael, obviously, would like to see a Finance Bill passed. We gave a commitment and we have fulfilled it in trying circumstances since the change of Government.  The Government's economic policies, in so far as they exist, are too narrowly based.  A combination of activity and aspiration to reduce interest rates coupled with a strategy in a number of sectors will not move the economy.  It will contribute to the movement but as things stand I predict that the Minister will be a disappointed man this time next year.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister will have to widen his focus and look immediately at personal tax rates.  If that requires bringing in another Finance Bill in the autumn he should do so because if the Minister leaves this until next year's Finance Bill he will not have matters in place soon enough to inspire confidence.  If a structure was in place now which pointed towards serious tax reform with its consequent tax reductions for the over-burdened sectors it would inspire confidence even if no immediate benefit accrued.  I appreciate, as much as any Member, the constraints that were on the Minister and the lack of scope available to him but he has missed an opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment on corporate taxation and I hope that the report on that will be issued soon.  I welcome the initiatives taken in the Bill in regard to trading houses, financial services, the extension of the business <Col N="460" /> expansion scheme, in regard to the tourist industry and, as we had committed ourselves, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to shipping activities.  That proposal was put forward by Deputy Jim Mitchell when in office.  I deplore what the Minister is doing to mortgages.  It is running counter to his overall strategy.  To put it bluntly, a commitment to a particular group, the building societies, has brought about an inherent contradiction of policy in the Finance Bill.  The whole basis of the Minister's budget was to get interest rates down but he has brought in a proposal which at a minimum will act as a brake on their reduction and at a maximum will tend to force rates up.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of farm tax.  In my view that was a good tax which helped people in intensive activity.  It gave a great incentive to work hard and to produce and it is a pity that the Minister is abolishing it.  The last Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, in November announced a relief for farmers who were hard pressed and liable for that tax but the Minister appears to have dropped it and I appeal to him to reintroduce it.  There is little or no cost involved and the relief was welcomed in the wake of two very bad summers.  The liability still exists for farmers.  The relief was committed by the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not going to advise my party to oppose the Bill on Second Stage but I will be proposing amendments for Committee Stage and I will expect the Minister to accept some of them.  I do not believe the Minister is stubborn for the sake of stubbornness.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The signals the Minister gives on occasions indicate the contrary.  I do not think the Minister is stubborn by nature or conviction. There are two styles in handling legislation in the House.  There is the open accepting style where Ministers will accept amendments if they improve the Bill.  There is also the other style where the individual thinks he has dropped one <Col N="461" /> of the tablets of stone even when he defies logic by standing ground on the one spot and making no concession whatever.  In my view the Bill can be improved, particularly in regard to the withholding tax.  I expect the Minister to reflect on the debate between now and Committee Stage and introduce appropriate amendments. If he does not do so I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage and if they are not accepted by the Minister Fine Gael will oppose certain sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>(a)  to provide for reforms in the system of taxation;</P>

      <P>declines to give the Bill a Second Reading.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as the House is aware, gives the House an opportunity to review, alter, amend or improve the structure of our taxation system in each financial year.  It is, therefore, an occasion when the House should pause to reflect about the system of taxation we have.  I do not accept that the Bill is the mirror image of the Minister's speech on the occasion of the budget.  It is more than that; it is the opportunity given to the House each year to effect major reform in the taxation system.  It is on the latter basis that I am addressing it and moving my amendment.  It has been said about the party of which I am a member that it was founded to challenge the <Col N="462" /> existing fiscal arrangements which obtain here.  I have no shame in saying that on this occasion I am judging the Finance Bill not simply as the vehicle for the Minister's budgetary policy in the short term but as the occasion on which I as the spokesman on finance for my party, am asked to say yea or nay to the existing taxation system and to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to conserve it in its present form.  On that basis I have no hesitation in saying that the Bill is gravely deficient.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago that 500,000 people marched through the streets of Dublin &mdash; hundreds of thousands of others marched through the other cities and towns &mdash; to clamour and protest for tax reform.  It is not so long ago that they were given a commission in order to stop the clamour and to assure them that the House was at least in principle ready to contemplate fundamental reform of our fiscal arrangements. It is not so long ago that the last report of the commission, the fifth report, was made available to the House. However, it is manifestly clear that the five reports issued by the commission made not the slightest impression on the will of the Legislature to initiate change in our fiscal arrangements.  Our taxation laws have not become simpler but more complex; have not become fair but more unfair; have not become less of a disincentive but more of a disincentive; have not become more socially just but more socially unjust since that agitation and the promises of reform.  Without being over-dramatic, I say that is a scandal.  It shows that this House was willing to buy off popular feeling in the area of tax reform by a gesture but was never really willing to address the issues raised and the issues acknowledged to be valid when the commission was established.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that anyone in the position of the Minister today is in effect fighting a battle of containment. In many respects because the country is in financial crisis he is involved &mdash; without any disrespect to his office &mdash; in a ministry of crisis management.  I appreciate that it is difficult, especially in the context of changes of Government, for the necessary <Col N="463" /> head of steam to be built up in any political organisation or Government to initiate the thought, debate and the will to act for radical tax reform.  However, taking all those factors and mitigating circumstances into account, I look on the Bill as simply a statement in relation to the tax regime operating in this country. It seems, on the face of it, to be a statement that there is no need for radical reform.  The acceptance of the need for reform is not implicit in the Bill and nothing said by the Minister &mdash; with the exception, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, of the corporation tax related remarks &mdash; suggests that there is any strategy, philosophy or overall view as to how our taxation system should be reformed in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there were many conflicting views as to how tax reform could be brought about.  He also indicated that it was his intention to include the whole area of tax reform in a process of negotiation and consultation with the groups which he terms as the social partners.  I have a deep dislike of the phrase &ldquo;social partners&rdquo; because on many occasions meetings of social partners are meetings of unrepresentative sections of economic and social life without the clout they purport to have, without the representational value they accord themselves and without any real partnership except a partnership to conserve and to further their own sectional interests.  I have grave misgivings about meetings with the social partners to evolve a tax philosophy because it comes back to the point which Deputy Noonan made that it betokens a lack of direction, a lack of philosophy and a lack of commitment to taking any particular road in the area of tax reform.  If you have to go to the social partners to get their acceptance of any tax reform programme, I can promise the Minister that his tax reform proposals will not be radical or what is required; they will be another mish-mash of consensus, compromise politics with very little to offer this country in terms of breaking out of what Deputy Noonan <Col N="464" /> and his party referred to as the vicious circle we are in.</P>
    <P>What is missing in this debate is an indication from a new Government, who had been kept out of power for four years, with plenty of time to think about their attitude to taxation, that they have possible solutions but this Bill does not reflect any thought, merely crisis management. Although it is dogged in pursuit &mdash; the Minister is to be given some grudging admiration on this account &mdash; of his budgetary goals, he has not lifted his eyes to see where the country will be going in five, ten or 15 years, and what the tax implications of today's policies will be in the future.</P>
    <P>Things are occurring in the context of the European Community and the Single European Act so recently ratified which will have such a profound effect on the taxation climate in this country that we will do very badly by ourselves, younger people and children growing up if we ignore the implications of what we have agreed to.  The co-ordination of indirect tax rates implicit in the Single European Act will have profound consequences for this country.  In the Minister's speech there is not even a hint that these thoughts are in the back of his mind in planning the short, medium or long term taxation strategies of the Government. Whereas I have already conceded that this Finance Bill was born in the early days of a Government, no Government introduces more than three or four budgets, the average is less.  Recent experience suggests that it is far less and political pundits are far less optimistic than to suggest that this Government will introduce three or four budgets.  It is relevant, therefore, to ask when the process of clearly spelling out a direction on tax reform will commence.  That is the Minister's duty and he should not shirk it.  It is one which will not be well started if he hopes that it will emerge from the meeting to which I referred earlier between himself and the social partners with a view to attempting a national consensus.</P>
    <P>There are dramatic implications for this country in the co-ordination of <Col N="465" /> indirect taxation in terms of the tax yield, the goods and services which will be subject to indirect taxation and in terms of the budgetary implications of that co-ordination. It is worth while stating that no serious political thought has gone into the direct taxation implications of the Single European Act precisely because, in the context of the recent referendum, there was so much misrepresentation of the subject that eventually everybody decided not to discuss it or to think about it.  However, it is a real issue which we will have to face up to in the long term.</P>
    <P>Our system of direct taxation in terms of income tax is fundamentally unjust, anti-incentive and geared against people taking an active part in the economy.  It is anti-participative and that is my objection to the present system.  I do not fall into the ideological school of believing that low taxation must be ruthlessly pursued for its own sake regardless of the consequences but the Minister's speech grudgingly admits that the rates of taxation in this country have reached, in many areas, the point of diminishing returns.  I believe that we have long since passed that point in relation to direct taxation of personal income.  The combination of PRSI and PAYE is a major disincentive to participation in the economy by the great majority of the people. The time has come to stop talking about PRSI as a social insurance system and to admit that it is taxation, nothing more and nothing less, because it has no distinguishing features to set it apart from a direct system of taxation.  It is not, in any real sense, a system of insurance as it originally purported to be.  Combining PAYE and PRSI, seeing how they work and how they discourage people's willingness to work, to take risks and to work harder and longer have such a huge disincentive effect that they cry out for radical reform.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the report commissioned from the Commission on Taxation was one which sought for the first time to radically reappraise how we tax ourselves.  There are two schools of thought.  There is a significant school of thought which says the solution offered <Col N="466" /> by the Commission on Taxation was simple, easy to understand and attractive but was fundamentally unrealistic.  There are many people who contend that the report of the Commission on Taxation should not be accepted and never implemented and that the wide variety of tax breaks, allowances and incentives which exist in the present patchwork quilt taxation system is preferable, more socially flexible and economically adaptable than what was proposed by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I disagree with those views.  The thrust of the report of the Commission on Taxation is correct, that simplication of the tax system and the system of allowances, the removal of anomalies and the general thrust towards a proportionate system of taxation rather than a progressive one is correct, manageable and achieveable with radical political will.  It is on that basis that I find the Finance Bill so disappointing.  It contains nothing in terms of adding extra simplicity or fairness to our system of taxation. In fact, as Deputy Noonan has pointed out, this is a very short Finance Bill and a rather bare one.  He classified it as &ldquo;mean minded&rdquo; and I have to agree with him that there is an element of meanness in it.  There is nothing in it to unravel the injustices of the present taxation system as they affect ordinary people.  This Finance Bill is presented at a time when taxation remains an issue. Of course people are aware that taxation and public spending are linked and they are aware that you cannot offer tax bonanzas which cannot be financed but there is a growing conviction that we will never have economic progress until taxation is faced up to and tackled and until radical reforms are introduced.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan entirely when he says that a strategy based on interest rates and which totally ignores the need for tax reform, tax incentives and economic participation is walking on the thinnest of international financial ice. There is no sense in which it is safe to assume that none of the circumstances which Deputy Noonan referred to will not eventuate and thus cause this policy <Col N="467" /> to fall down in a shambles.  Deputy Noonan pointed out correctly that all these factors lie outside the province of any Irish Government because we are a small open economy but what does lie within our grasp is taxation reform.  It is sad that this annual occasion on which we are supposed to review, amend and reform the taxation system seems to be one where there is nothing in terms of taxation reform.</P>
    <P>Vague promises were put in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the general election and they have been repeated here in an even more vague way by the Minister, that it is his strategy to go as quickly as he can to the stage where two-thirds of taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate but that means one-third of taxpayers will pay above the standard rate.  At present, about 43 per cent of taxpayers pay above the standard rate.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil's plan is to change the status of 10 per cent of taxpayers from being above the standard rate to being standard rate taxpayers.  There are echoes of grandeur in saying &ldquo;let us bring two-thirds of taxpayers on to the standard rate&rdquo; but I put the reverse side of the coin.  The Minister in talking about changing the status of 10 per cent of taxpayers as his ultimate long-term goal is setting himself a very low and unacceptable target and one which no wide section of the public would regard as a worthy aim in terms of radical taxation reform.  To say that his long-term goal in relation to tax reform is to change the status of 10 per cent of taxpayers is a laughably small target.</P>
    <P>I will go one step further to say that the Minister's budget by failing to change the tax rates or to index them in any way has meant that the number of taxpayers paying above the standard rate rose from either 42 per cent or 43 per cent to 45 per cent or 47 per cent.  Far from going from the situation where one-third of taxpayers will be paying above the standard rate, the effect of the budget is to bring us inexorably closer to the stage where one-half of taxpayers will be paying super tax or surtax.  This country cannot afford to suppress its enterprise, its will to work <Col N="468" /> and its incentives to participate in the economy by having such a vicious system of taxation, where half the people are paying super tax by any other country's standards, not to mention the burden PRSI is putting on employment and on those participating in the economy.  We cannot afford to continue in this way.</P>
    <P>We live in a world of mobile capital and, unfortunately for so many young Irish people today, mobile labour, mobile resources and investment.  We are entering into a completed European internal market in which all of these factors of production will be as free to move, with the exception of land which is increasingly becoming unimportant in the development of the European Community, to where they are best remunerated. This country will be putting its head in the sand if it believes we can have as a long-term tax target the one adumbrated by the Minister which is to change the status of 10 per cent of taxpayers or to allow by fiscal drift the number of surtax payers to increase to 50 per cent. Truly, we have come to the stage, and I am not speaking on a partisan basis, where in successive Finance Bills &mdash; long before I was in the Dáil and that is not to exonerate myself from the blame &mdash; this House, the political system and all the political parties have imposed surtax on the people and have done so in a way which destroys incentives.  On the occasion of any Finance Bill nobody has stood up to protest against that process, to say it is wrong, that we are going in the wrong direction and that our taxation system is unfair and needs radical change. I am doing so now and that is why I tabled the amendment which I moved.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of features of which I approve and of which it would be hard to disapprove.  In so far as it is possible within the European framework to extend the 10 per cent taxation regime to areas of the economy where growth is likely and where revenue loss is unlikely that should be done.  I accept Deputy Noonan's reservations and the marker he is putting down that this process cannot be undertaken without regard to its consequences.  It is entirely logical to <Col N="469" /> extend the 10 per cent rate of taxation to the trading houses as provided for in section 27 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Although it sensibly puts private export promotion into a favourable category, I share Deputy Noonan's misgivings about the phraseology of the section.  On my reading &mdash; and I am glad that Deputy Noonan takes the same view &mdash; one could import things tomorrow and re-export them the day after and stay perfectly within the meaning of the section.  I do not know what the economic benefit to this country would be if goods were piled up here and sent out with little shamrock stickers and people could pay 10 per cent on the profits that they undoubtedly would seek to engender in their warehouses in Ireland.  It is a badly drafted section but the principle is a good and acceptable one.  I do not have any argument with that, as long as we do not push the principle so far as to end up exhausting the patience of the European Community and find ourselves in trouble.</P>
    <P>It is worth while saying that the provisions of the Bill which extend the 10 per cent taxation regime to tourism on the same basis and subject to the same qualifications are desirable, supportable and good in themselves.  Tourism needs a tax break but it does so in the sense that everybody needs a tax break.  I do not believe that the principles which apply to the tourist industry are so radically different from those which should apply to, say, the service industry.  The service industry seems to be the only one now subject to 50 per cent corporation tax and in diminishing proportions as all these exceptions creep in.  On that basis there is wide need for a radical reappraisal of the corporation tax system to scrap many of the allowances, to introduce as low as possible a standard rate and by that means to extend to all areas of the economy the great advantages which these sections want to focus on smaller areas of the economy.</P>
    <P>I go to the provisions that the Minister has introduced in this Bill in relation to the Custom House docks.  When first I heard of this scheme I was a little cynical, on the basis that I could not see why <Col N="470" /> Ireland was to be considered a more suitable place to locate these service industries than other places in Europe.  It seemed to have natural disadvantages. Subject to what has been rightly said about the distortion of the European market which these measures constitute and their lack of local and regional effect, which I concede must be acknowledged here, it seems to be legitimate to try to place in a city a critical mass of services with the requisite buildings, telecommunications and communication facilities and the available labour force. There should not be the displacement effect which Deputy Noonan talked about in relation to industries such as GPA located at Shannon.  There need not necessarily be that effect.  If Shannon was a proper place for more of these industries to locate, I should imagine they would have done so and there would not be any huge attraction to move to Dublin, especially since the particular company mentioned have an immense local commitment to the area.  I ask him not to feel that this represents a threat to the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>The most controversial feature of this Finance Bill is undoubtedly the one on which I have spoken in public on several occasions, which relates to withholding tax being placed on professional fees paid by various State and semi-State bodies to people providing professional services.  I want to follow a fashion in this House and lay down a particular form of marker which the Taoiseach specialised in when Leader of the Opposition.  I believe that the tax is unconstitutional.  I shall tell you why.  It is worth while stating today because it corresponds to one of my objections to it.  For the first time in Irish fiscal history, a system of taxation of an extremely brutal kind is being put in place.  It is not unfair to call it brutal.  The effect of the withholding tax bears no relation to the circumstances of the individuals, companies or businesses which it affects.  It is very similar in effect to the status of an individual who starts his first PAYE job and is taxed with emergency tax.  That is done solely for the purpose of getting him to come to grips with the <Col N="471" /> taxation system and become involved in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>This taxation system, for the very first time, constitutes a deliberate effort to take tax from people without any reference to their likely tax liability.  I ask the Minister rhetorically why did he not choose 25 per cent, 20, 10, 40 or 60 per cent or whatever figure came into his mind?  The 35 per cent rate bears no relation to any tax amount except the standard rate of income tax.  The standard rate of income tax has never been applied on any occasion to turnover or gross income, except in the case of gross income of PAYE workers who are debited with emergency tax.  To hold out the fact that PAYE workers pay tax each week as a justification for imposing this withholding tax in totally different circumstances at the 35 per cent rate is utterly devoid of rational content.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court will not strike down the tax on the basis that it is irrational.  If that were the basis on which taxes were struck down, we would have no taxes in this country because our tax system is entirely irrational.  The court will pay particular attention to section 18 of this Bill which on two separate grounds permits interim rebates of this withholding tax to be made.  I have no doubt that the challenge to this system of taxation will focus in on section 18 as at present drafted.  What the court will be told &mdash; and I think correctly &mdash; is that there is a two-tier system of hardship rebates; first, the inspector is entitled to rebate, remit, or refund on an interim basis tax withheld where certain criteria apply, one of which is the fact that the majority of a person's taxable income has to come from withholding sources and his tax affairs also have to be in order.  Then there is this added ingredient that the inspector has to arrive at the view that the withholding of tax without interim rebate would create undue hardship for the individual or company concerned. Unlike Deputy Noonan, I believe that is not a fair system of taxation and it will be interesting to see which of us is right.</P>
    <P>Although the hardship provisions may <Col N="472" /> have been intended to copperfasten this tax and make it safe from constitutional challenge, they would be the weakness in this taxation system.  The Minister is proposing to introduce here for the first time a discretionary tax which depends for its effects on the individual view of an inspector of taxation.  For the first time an inspector can alleviate the effects of a system of taxation solely based on subjective considerations.  Doubtless the Revenue Commissioners in their wisdom will lay down guidelines as to what constitutes hardship but if they do they are running into another legal problem, in that, in effect they are legislating for how the tax system is to work.  If the Revenue Commissioners lay down criteria which are to apply as between for instance Deputy MeDowell and Deputy Desmond and if I am entitled to a refund on one basis, is Deputy Desmond to be entitled to a refund on the same basis and are they to have legal effect?  Are these criteria to be available to everybody as a right, and if they are, have we not allowed the Revenue Commissioners to make up the law as they go along, to vary it as they wish and to apply it where they will.  The Supreme Court will strike down that Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>Later on in section 18 (5) of the Bill, we have the extraordinary situation that even when the criteria which an inspector is required to find present before he can exercise his prerogative of mercy, are absent, the Revenue Commissioners can override the whole thing completely and can excuse somebody completely from the tax on the basis of hardship.  According to section 18 (5) the Revenue Commissioners are entitled:</P>
    <P>(5)  In circumstances where the specified person claims and proves the presence of particular hardship, the Revenue Commissioners may waive (in whole or in part) one or more of the conditions for the making of a refund specified in this section and, where the Revenue Commissioners so waive such condition or conditions, they shall determine, having regard to all the circumstances and taking into account the <Col N="473" /> objects and intentions of the previous provisons of this section, an amount of a refund or a further refund which they consider to be just and reasonable.</P>
    <P>On the matter of discretion and subjective considerations it is open to the Revenue Commissioners to fully waive the entire amount of the withholding tax and to make 100 per cent rebates as they wish based on their view of hardship.  The Supreme Court will say that that offends the Constitution on the basis that it is not open to the Government to delegate the imposition of taxation or to delegate extensively the manner in which it affects individuals or to permit a body of people such as the board of the Revenue Commissioners to determine how a tax will take effect.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental flaw of this tax. I suspect that Deputy Noonan is right in saying that this was put in to try to save the measure from being regarded as arbitrary and confiscatory.  It will now open the tax not merely to the charge of being arbitrary and confiscatory but to the charge of being repugnant to the basis of our Constitution in that this House is the House which decides who will pay tax. This House is entitled to legislate for taxation, but it is not entitled to give to somebody else a discretion as to how tax will fall on one set of shoulders as against another.</P>
    <P>The reason that that has happened in this Bill is that it is fully conceded that this is an unfair tax and that it will cause hardship.  Section 18 would not be there if this tax were not going to cause hardship, it would not permit the inspector to make rebates in these circumstances if this tax was not going to cause hardship, and it would not allow the Revenue Commissioners to effectively waive the whole of the tax in cases of hardship unless that hardship were a real factor.  The effect of section 18 is to damage this withholding tax below the waterline in a way that will cause it to sink, because it is to admit that it is harsh in its effects, crude in confiscatory powers and it is to attempt to get around that situation by providing for a discretionary rebate system.  By the <Col N="474" /> very token of a discretionary rebate system, it means an unequal and arbitrary power given to uncontrollable people in relation to the manner in which this tax will take effect.  That will be held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach as Leader of the Opposition laid down constitutional warnings. I am laying down a very specific constitutional warning today.  It will be interesting to see whether or not I am right. This is not only unconstitutional, but a wrong form of taxation.  This House should never delegate to the Revenue Commissioners the functions which this Bill in this section proposes to delegate. It is wrong in principle.</P>

      <P>Local taxation is an entirely different matter.  Legislation permitted discretionary waivers in local taxation. The waiver system was always seen as a concession, but on this occasion it is an intrinsic part of the Bill and it will be the undoing of this section.  I may be wrong and perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla is right, but we will see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong also on the grounds set out by Deputy Noonan.  It is quite clear that it was conceived by people who did not take into account when they originally framed it the effect it was likely to have and the vast variety of different effects it would have on different classes of people. I know that the effect it will have on lawyers is not likely to be as serious as that on architects, engineers, people associated with the building industry and people who have a corporate existence <Col N="475" /> and who as Deputy Noonan pointed out are paying tax already on a weekly or monthly basis through the PAYE system. I know it will have an unfair and detrimental effect on them and that it is not conceived of as a withholding tax for the purposes of the Fifth Commission on Taxation report.  If one read that report superficially one might get the impression that the Commission on Taxation suggested that withholding tax should be applied as much as possible, but they gave special reasons why it should be done &mdash; to counter evasion, to minimise cost of collection and things like that. This tax regime is not being imposed for any of those purposes but only to bring forward into this year's Government's accounts a cash flow effect of £25 million. It is not there to prevent people fiddling the tax system, because no professional person or company could possibly hope to evade tax in relation to moneys paid by the State to them.  Neither a barrister nor a solicitor could hope to hide from the tax authorities the fact that they have been paid a sum by the State in any given year.  Those things are impossible to achieve even by the most skilled evaders. This tax was devised to have a cash flow effect which was to be achieved by plundering the working capital of professional bodies and bringing it into the hands of the Exchequer on an entirely arbitrary basis.  That is the purpose of it.  If the Supreme Court wear it, so be it, but it is not an attempt to improve the tax system but an attempt to plunder working capital because in the eyes of the Minister and presumably of the Department of Finance the working capital of professional firms constituted a fund of money which was open and vulnerable to this form of plunder.  In the last analysis it will not turn out to be a fair tax.</P>
    <P>It is curious that when you offer as an excuse that this affects the professions and that they are better off in some intangible way than, say, the PAYE sector you ignore the fundamental fact that they are better off in another way.  They are people whose skills and services are easily made mobile and it is the professional <Col N="476" /> people and people who are skilled in providing these services to the State who will have the greatest incentive now to move their location elsewhere, to join the great migration of talent, to go to England and set up there where no government would be foolish enough to introduce a tax regime as cruel and arbitrary as this.  The Minister will be paying the dole for the cleaning ladies, the typists, the porters, the canteen and the tea ladies in the offices when all the professionals &mdash; the yuppies as they are termed &mdash; have gone abroad.  When they are all in London the Minister will be looking at the mess they have left behind them, because an arbitrary and capricious tax system that is so unfair, unjust and so savage in its approach, has driven them out.  The feeling of hopelessness, of being ground down by a Government who do not understand the effect of what they are doing in this plunder in pursuit of their working capital will drive these people abroad.  I will be interested to see the effects.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that in other areas the services which some of these people provide to ordinary people will just deteriorate.  I also agree with him that the services which they will give to the State will be diminished as a result and the price of services will go up.  Ordinary people with their hard earned money will have to make up deficiencies in the working capital of these individuals if the Government are intent on plundering it.  Is that a step in the right direction? Is that building a new and confident economy?  Of course it is not.  It is going in the wrong direction.  It is easy when you see things entirely from a budgetary point of view and see this £25 million like Bugs Bunny with $ signs for eyes.  It is easy to disregard what the ordinary laws of economics determine will be the effect of this tax, that is migration of talent, increasing costs and diminution in services. Those are the effects of plundering the working capital of companies.  Any fool in a sixth year economics class in school can tell you that, but that point seems to be lost and people seem to think that this can be done without effect.  The <Col N="477" /> attitude is, &ldquo;Just give me the quick fix of £25 million to bridge a gap in this year's budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you bring forward taxation from next year to this year, then to achieve the same bridging effort next year you will have to bring forward more tax.  You will have to extend this system further and further so that it becomes like a chain letter running wild in every direction in order to maintain its fiscal effect in the books of the economy.  It is a temporary thing.  It is a cash flow matter and it will not have an ongoing, beneficial effect for the State unless it is extended, and I notice the Minister is talking about extending it.  I have no doubt it will be extended far and wide in various areas, but it will amount to putting the whole of the service sector on emergency tax and on that basis it is indefensible.  It will have devastating effects in the short and long term on our economic life.</P>
    <P>It is naive to think that people like me, barristers who are supposed to be the butt of all envy and so on and evoke no sympathy, are to be treated financially in the same way as a large company with 200 employees all of whom are on PAYE from directors down to the cleaning lady, and that the tax will have the same effect. Maybe some people will just take this and bear it, but the effects of all taxation are there to be seen and the iron laws of economics, of supply, demand and mobility, apply as much in this benighted country as they do anywhere else.  Other governments do not do this kind of silly thing and why we decide to do it in the middle of a crisis defies belief.  However, it is going to be done unless my colleagues on the left lift their fingers to stop it, and the damage done will be seen as a momument to inflexibility.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Noonan said regarding the effect of increasing the tax rate on mortgage interest in relation to house loans.  I have no doubt that when the history comes to be written it win transpire that the building societies in exchange for a quick reduction in interest rates were told, as Deputy Noonan so graphically put it, that the pitch would be tilted against the banks, and this all at <Col N="478" /> the behest of the building societies, because this measure did not appear in the budget.  It was not there for its revenue effect and is there now as a pay-off to the building societies for co-operation in what is generally seen to be a downward trend in interest rates.</P>
    <P>I believe the consequences of this would be a matter of entire indifference to everybody in this House because in a sense the tax régime applying to deposits in building societies and banks and the tax régime applying to banks' home loans is so artificial it is difficult to work up any moral indignation one way or another on the matter.  However, I share the moral indignation expressed by Deputy Noonan that when a change is made and when the tilt occurs the poor punter in the street has to make up the difference.  It is never tilted the other way where the man in the street ends up better off.  We always equalise things upwards, never downwards and against the ordinary man in the interest of the building societies.  At the very least, the building societies as a group require, close scrutiny and reform and huge controls imposed on the way they operate internally.  The have pulled the wool slightly over the Government's eyes and achieved a marginal advantage in their ongoing war with the banks for deposits and the like.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what was stated here about confidentiality.  I can see the reasons for confidentiality in relation to deposits.  I wish somebody some day would have the moral courage to say what they are.  Largely it is that people opt to pay tax at 35 per cent because they know they owe more tax than that.  They do not want to disclose where the money came from or how they got it or whether it is subject to taxation at a higher rate either in interest or as a capital sum accrued for something else.  Generally one must take the view in the long run that the confidentiality arrangements we apply to deposit interest reflect an institutionalised form of tax evasion and the practical consequences prevent any Minister from interfering with it.  However, one lesson to be drawn from it is the fact that our taxes are too high and people <Col N="479" /> are now involved in playing a little intellectual footsie with the Government which allows them to have total confidence and to be immune from discovery by the taxman when they pay deposit interest at the standard rate.  It is another example of the exorbitant level of taxes and the Government's acknowledgment of that state.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the occasion when this House faces up to its annual responsibility for the system of taxation.  The PDs oppose radically our present system of taxation.  We disagree with it and disapprove of it.  Therefore, it would be impossible for us, unless some huge national interest were to be served, to offer support for a Bill which even in its own terms does nothing to commence the process of tax reform but further worsens the taxation régime.  It would be impossible for us to offer support in the absence of a clearly stated philosophy and programme for tax reform by this Minister and we have neither here today.  We have no reform and no promise of reform.  We have this bauble of 35 per cent tax for two-thirds of the people, but we are going in the opposite direction.  It means little. It means a change in the tax status of 10 per cent for the taxpayers.  It does not add up to a programme of tax reform. What the Minister has stated here as his intended process to proceed with tax reform &mdash; that is, involvement of the social partners &mdash; is so devoid of a chance or prospect of success as almost to make you want to weep with despair when you think how unlikely it is to be fruitful in terms of reform.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons we propose the amendment tendered in my name, which is, to decline to give this Bill a Second Reading on the basis that it does not provide for reform of the system of taxation, does not alleviate the tax burden on workers, does not halt the burden of income tax which goes up 12 per cent this year, a 12 per cent increase in an already over-taxed economy.  It does not make any effort to amend the draconian, harsh and indefensible aspects of the withholding tax which were set out in the <Col N="480" /> resolution passed on Budget day.  It makes no attempt to alleviate them or to take into account any of the representations made to the Minister.  I say to the Minister that he can be obdurate he can be stone-like in his refusal to turn on this issue but I believe that the laws of economics, of supply, demand and mobility, of capital, labour and everything else will finally make the Minister into a King Canute, that he is attempting to direct back a tide, to order back the sea on this occasion.  That is not possible in terms of taxation.  The Minister should live up to the real implications of what the provisions of this Bill are likely to bring about.  The Minister is not doing that.  Therefore, regretfully we must move our amendment to decline to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>I shall confine myself to one broad comment, which is that slowly but surely, arising from the provisions of this Bill, particularly out of the budget strategy of the Minister for Finance &mdash; and it is very much that of the Minister for Finance and of the Taoiseach; I doubt if it is really of the rest of the Cabinet; it certainly is not of the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; there has been a fundamental shift in public perceptions relating to taxation, public expenditure and the provision of resources for essential public services in our community.  Slowly, and ever so slowly, we are undergoing a bit of political hygiene in this House and outside it, whereby the exalted promises of recent years and notably those of the last general election, are being shed.  If I may borrow a phrase from Deputy John Kelly, the carbolic soap is being applied to the body politic.  Some of the hypocrisy which the political parties attempted to foist on the electorate in relation to taxation, public expenditure and the provision of vital public services is being washed away.  That is a very good thing. My wish is that the Minister for Finance will succeed in that exercise.  I may differ profoundly with him as to how we should go about that exercise but my wish is that he succeed in it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Those canvassers were saying income tax was going to be reduced, à la the PDs &mdash; what was the famous formula &mdash; from 53 per cent to 41 per cent to 31 per cent, a rolling-over manifesto the likes of which had never been seen before.  People bought it. Deputy McDowell in Dublin South-East, Deputy Kennedy, and our fellow candidates in Dún Laoghaire convinced the people.  I was assailed at the doorsteps by people saying: give us back our money, it is our money you have, we want our tax reduction.  By God they have got a tax reduction.  When the nurses were fired in Loughlinstown Hospital last week they knew what a tax reduction was, as five of them, PAYE workers, were exited out the door, temporary staff following them, when Monkstown Hospital closes &mdash; as apparently now it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the bitter harvest of that kind of politics, if one wants to be savage about the politics of the PDs which produced 14 per cent, a comfortable seat in my constituency, sophisticated and all as it is allegedly.  It should be said that the Fianna Fáil Party went for the soft option as well.  The Minister, on assuming the Finance portfolio, did not just put his foot down, he put his two feet down, his head as well, and he will have to keep it down for about three years to save his party from the kind of political cop-out in which they engaged in the course of the election.  For the first week they said nothing, for the second they began to promise a reduction to the standard rate of taxation, by the third week they discovered that was untenable as a general thesis and, by the fourth week, they had an overall majority with which to bring the proposition through.  That is what <Col N="482" /> happened.  In that sense &mdash; and this is of great importance nationally &mdash; there is a new climate slowly building up.  Although some of us got a miserable 7 per cent national support, if one adds up the rest of the support on the part of those who would espouse us &mdash; although my colleagues in The Workers Party are very soft option people altogether, comfortable options, no such thing as a hard option there &mdash; one will see there was overall approximately 10 per cent support. Deputy Kemmy in his campaign in his constituency on the taxation front received about 10 per cent support, from people who said they were quite prepared to pay a reasonable level of taxation, which incidentally is not all that high despite all the comments of Deputy McDowell this evening.  It is not true to say that half the taxpayers of Ireland are paying the surcharge rate.  That is barrack room, High Court rhetoric of the worst kind and should not be visited on the officials of the Department of Finance, and certainly not on Deputies in this House.  That is the kind of rhetoric that would have a judge promptly excusing a Deputy from the case.  Slowly but surely we will boil down this debate to having a necessary level of taxation, a broadening of the taxation base, to provide sufficient resources for basic, essential public services whether they be in health, education or local government.</P>

      <P>The problem of Coolattin to which the proposed legislation by the Labour Party in this special Private Members' Bill refers is not new and did not develop overnight.  It would be true to say that it has been simmering for a number of years.  One has to ask the question as to why the Labour Party, as a partner in the last Government, did not, during their term of office when they had an opportunity to so do, introduce amending legislation to deal with this problem.  It seems the problem was ignored and that it took the interest and the special willingness of the Taoiseach and of this Government, who were anxious to investigate in a very thorough way and seek to find a solution to the Coolattin carnage, to jog the consciousness of the Opposition and awaken their members out of a four year slumber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to again put this whole situation into context.  By giving a brief history I want to refresh the memories of Deputies in regard to this matter.  The felling of trees is governed by the Forestry Act, 1946, which stipulates that, apart from certain exceptions, the permission of my Department is required before trees are felled.  Local authorities have powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to preserve trees on amenity grounds by making a tree preservation order.  Where such <Col N="484" /> order exists an application for permission to fell must be made to the local authority in question.  Where such an application is refused, however, compensation must be paid to the applicant.  I want to put the record straight that as far as the case of Coolattin Woods is concerned, all the felling licences which issued from the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, as it was at the time, were authorised by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>Coolattin estate comprises 500 hectares of woodland, 300 hectares of farmland and an historic 18th century mansion and was sold to its present owners, Bridgefarm Company Limited, at the beginning of 1983.  The company immediately applied for a five-year general felling licence and my Department issued a one-year general felling licence in the first instance.  This licence issued in December 1983 for the thinning of 75 hectares and the clear felling and replanting of 163 hectares.  Those trees were not subject to tree preservation orders and Wicklow County Council did not object to the licence on amenity grounds.  This licence has now expired and replanting has taken place.</P>
    <P>In March 1985 Bridgefarm Company Limited applied to Wicklow County Council for planning permission to fell some trees covered by tree preservation orders.  This permission was subsequently granted and my Department issued a further general felling licence to thin 14 hectares and to clear fell and replant 45.2 hectares.  Again the county council did not object on amenity grounds.  This licence expired in January of this year and replanting must be completed by January 1988.  Two further licences were issued, one on 9 September 1986 authorising the felling of 548 trees subject to an obligation to replant 24,000 trees and compliance with the conditions of Wicklow County Council's consent.  The most recent licence issued on 27 January of this year and this authorised the felling of 619 trees subject to an obligation to replant 36,000 oak trees.</P>
    <P>The area at the centre of the current debate, Tomnafinnogue, covers 66.5 hectares or approximately 164 acres.  It <Col N="485" /> mainly comprises oak, estimated to have originated about the year 1700 AD.  In 1978 the county council made tree preservation orders on the trees in Tomnafinnogue Wood.  Bridgefarm Company Limited recently made application for planning permission to fell trees in the wood and this has been granted by the county council subject to very stringent conditions which provide for phased felling and a replanting programme designed to mitigate adverse effects on the environment. Having received such permission, the company, as they were obliged to do under the Forestry Act, 1946, lodged a felling notice with my Department giving 21 days notice of their intention to fell the trees.  I immediately issued a prohibition order in response to this notice and no felling can take place unless a felling licence is granted.  The company were in contact with my Department following receipt of the prohibition order and they have indicated that they will apply for a felling licence. In considering the licence, I would have to take full regard of the conditions set by Wicklow County Council in their planning permission and serious consideration would also be given to the company's performance in relation to the conditions attached to previous licences.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I informed the House during the earlier debate on this Bill that following a preliminary survey of Coolattin by my officials certain disturbing features to the new plantation by the Bridgefarm Company Limited were uncovered.  On receipt of this information I instructed the inspectors in my Department to carry out a comprehensive survey with a view to finding out the facts as to whether or not this company had complied with the conditions specified in the granting of felling licences by my predecessors.  This survey revealed a more than inordinate mortality rate in the new crop of plants.  The numbers of dead, dying or very weakened plants varied between the differing species and were highest in the oak wood. My Department, during the years, have accepted that there will always be some level of failure in new plantations and, in <Col N="486" /> accordance with practice, will accept up to 15 per cent mortality rate.  However, in this instance, the rate of crop failure was considerably higher and was quite unsatisfactory.  A likely contributory factor to this development is, in my opinion, the rate of felling of these woods.  As has already been stated, about five-sixths of the wood has been clear felled and it could scarcely be regarded as good forestry policy to remove completely in such a short time and in one fell swoop trees that took 200 years to grow.  The oakwood species thrives in sheltered conditions.  The plant needs to be protected from excessive rainfall, frost and unwanted vegetation.  The older crop of trees afford this cover and structured and sensitive felling of these species over a long period so as to allow for the proper generation of new crops should be the approach.</P>
    <P>In spite of deficiencies in legislation which are an urgent priority for this Government, my Department have engaged in, and have openly encouraged owners of private broad leaf plantations to participate in agreements for the proper management of their woodlands. I want to further encourage owners of private woodlands to avail of these specialist services.</P>
    <P>Our few remaining oakwoods have been so depleted that we are in danger of losing the quality seed source necessary to rebuild the hardwood resource. Broad leaf high forests cover about 34,000 hectares and of that the oakwood species has a mere 11,000 hectares.  We import about £16 million of hardwood annually and, as the House knows, hardwoods are a fast diminishing resource all over the world and the remaining oakwoods in this country will continue to increase in money value terms.  The yield class of Irish oak equals that of pine in Finland and the quality of Irish oak has been famous internationally for centuries. We cannot, therefore, be indifferent to this valuable resource and, as a consequence, the needs of future generations.</P>
    <P>The debate which has resulted from the felling at Coolattin has highlighted <Col N="487" /> the need for a defined national strategy in relation to broad leaf species.  I am convinced of the need to increase the level of planting of broad leaf species by the State and of the encouragement of the private sector with a view to the needs of future generations.  It follows from this that existing plantations, particularly semi-mature woods, need to be protected and felling of mature trees permitted in a sensitive and planned way allowing for gradual removal only and simultaneous replacement of the species.</P>
    <P>I am setting out a programme to ensure there will be an annual increase in overall percentage terms in State planting of broad leaf species and also encouraging by way of special grants to the private sector, both to individuals and companies, to set aside suitable land for this purpose.  In this context I repeat my conviction that such a policy requires urgent attention.  It will have that from my Department, and the legislative framework and back-up will be put into place by this Government as soon as possible. This I believe can be achieved through the amendment of existing legislation and will not, in my view, require extensive changes.</P>
    <P>People who grow oak realise they will not benefit financially themselves.  They know it is a long-term activity.  It is in many ways an act of faith in the country. They do something special for our heritage. This Government have demonstrated in a clear and unmistakable way that they will not spare any effort in preparing the way, both legislatively and otherwise, to put this sorry spectacle behind us and to begin a new era in a more enlightened and positive manner.</P>

      <P>Last week when the Minister of State made his announcement there was a great sigh of relief at his decision to halt the tree felling at Tomnafinnogue Wood.  I welcome that decision without reservation, because Coolattin and the fate of those trees have been a source of considerable anxiety and frustration for some considerable time. Unfortunately, it will continue to be a matter of concern as long as there is some question of the reprieve of Tomnafinnogue Wood being only temporary, related not only to the beauty, amenity or antiquity aspects of the wood but to non-compliance with previous felling licence conditions as announced by the Minister of State last week.  While welcoming the Minister's decision, I found it mysterious because we had confusing correspondence about what was going on at Coolattin over aconsiderable period.</P>
      <P>I had a letter from the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry on 4 February saying that constant monitoring of forestry activity at Coolattin Woods had been carried out by officials of the Department and that the Department were satisfied all the conditions of the felling licences issued by them had been fully met.  The Minister of State said on 27 May 1987, at column 3094, Volume 372 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>...it was brought to my notice that the conditions which applied to the earlier licences had not been complied with.</P>
      <P>I say this is mysterious because things seem to have changed in just three months.  I want to know who inspected the woods prior to 4 February and who inspected the woods in early May.  Were two different people involved or did things change mysteriously in that period?</P>

I want an answer to this question.  The people who are concerned about Coolattin and the latest developments there might be forgiven for being confused and worried when changes like this happen.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 28 May the Taoiseach confirmed the decision announced in the Dáil by the Minister of State.  There was a sentence in that letter which read &ldquo;Any such felling cannot legally be undertaken at the wood at the present time&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;at the present time&rdquo; has an ominous ring, and perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  We have been told this problem will be sorted out.  I hope the best brains in the Department of the Environment and in the Department with responsibility for forestry, together with the Attorney General's Office, will be used to find a way to deal efficiently and fairly with the kind of case Coolattin presents.  My colleague, Deputy Carey, will deal in detail with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity for this extended debate.  Our country is not as wooded as it should be but, at the same time, we have a very strong responsibility to protect what we have while encouraging the forestry industry.  Those responsibilities present a very tall order because they embody some inherent contradictions. I compliment the many groups and individuals in County Wicklow and across the country who, in the best spirit of community concern, raised, and continue to raise, the question of Coolattin.  I hope their efforts will result in a final solution to this sorry chapter in our environmental history.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Hussey in welcoming the spirit in which the Labour Party brought in the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Trees and Woodlands) Bill, 1987. It was a major effort to bring about a quick solution to the serious problems which had developed at Coolattin.  I am disappointed with the petty arguments put forward by the Government side and their crowing about their goodwill <Col N="490" /> towards and interest in broad leaf developments.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach promised there would be an early resolution to the difficulties experienced at Coolattin.  The Government promised to bring in legislation but since examining the matter they have discovered there are huge constitutional difficulties involved.  The Minister for the Environment dealt at length with the matter.</P>

      <P>We will have to wait to see the new Bill before we know if he is correct about everything.  Exaggerated promises given in relation to private property will inevitably delay any progress towards a resolution of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and the Department with responsibility for forestry have serious roles to play but my experience would lead me to believe that they are poles apart.  The crisis at Coolattin should bring them together. Throughout the country county development plans are being drawn up.  People are looking at ways in which to protect the environment and develop scenic and amenity areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill cannot be supported because it has serious defects which would prevent it from achieving its avowed aim which is to protect trees and woodlands of special amenity value.  It would impede commercial development of our forests.  Any legislation dealing with this problem should include compensation at present use value for any person prevented from felling by a special amenity or preservation order.  It should define a system of appeal in regard to preservation or special amenity orders.  Any enactment brought forward should be referred to <Col N="491" /> the Supreme Court for confirmation of its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for State at the Department with responsibility for Forestry and to the mover of the Bill.  Deputy Kavanagh made serious efforts to protect Coolattin and its environment.  I was very disappointed to hear the notion put forward on the Government side that they were the saviours of this amenity.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil members of Wicklow County Council never objected to the various orders which were made for felling trees at Coolattin.  There would be unity in the House about the matter if the legislation was brought in. The Taoiseach made great headlines in regard to this promised legislation.  He made a famous trip by helicopter to Coolattin. This Government will be known as the chopper Government.  Every little difficulty is resolved by a helicopter visit. The Minister for the Marine made two trips by helicopter to the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> The Minister for Communications made a lightening visit by helicopter to Bord na Móna sites in bad weather.  I am sure the people in Bord na Móna could have informed him about the state of forestry development without his making helicopter trips to the various sites.  They are now seeking to make this matter a high profile one because it is emotive and is one of the &ldquo;green&rdquo; issues. The problem with the Government is that they do not have the legislation ready and it ill-behoves them to attack Deputy Kavanagh because he made a reasonable effort to bring in a Bill.</P>

      <P>There should be some agreement in the House about matters such as the protection of Coolattin Woods.  There will have to be considerable change before the Departments involved come to an agreement on it.  As <Col N="492" /> Deputy Hussey said, the order which the Minister of State has made is a temporary one and there is nothing to prevent a new application being made.  If they are commercial developers they will pursue their interests.  There were differences between the officials who visited the site to see if the conditions of planning had been met.  If these conditions have been met, if the oak has been planted and if there is less than a 30 per cent failure rate, say it is 10 per cent, what will the Minister of State do then?</P>
      <P>The Government are in a position to bring in the necessary legislation to save Coolattin and other such developments. I do not know if there is any good in uttering pious platitudes or giving lectures on botany about how one should grow oak or preserve the seed.</P>

It is worth checking the record of Fianna Fáil in regard to this.  What have they done about broadleaf?  There is not much evidence that they did much to develop this area before the crisis at Coolattin.  While my party do not propose to support the Bill we appeal to the Government to get their legislative act in order and make reasonable efforts to protect Coolattin.</P>

      <P>In introducing the Bill last week Deputy Kavanagh dealt at great length with the crisis at Coolattin, as was appropriate, but touched only briefly on the Bill.  In fact I note that in the somewhat rambling, twisted and convoluted contribution of the Deputy opposite the provisions of the Bill were only briefly touched on.  The woodlands at Shillelagh have been famous for many centuries and it is a tragedy that they are threatened in this decade.  Timber from those woods was used to roof Westminster Hall, Henry VIII's chapel at Windsor and King's Chapel, Cambridge.  It is also said <Col N="493" /> that Coolattin oak was used in the Stadt House in Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>The debate tonight is welcome because it highlights what has happened in Coolattin. The distribution of Deputy Kavanagh's time in the debate seems to indicate certain pangs of conscience on his part. Indeed, it is a great pity that his awareness of Coolattin, and its plight, was not exhibited when he was in a position, as Minister, to do something about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The inaction of the last administration stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Government.  On 6 December 1968 the then Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism indicated, in correspondence with another Wicklow Deputy, his satisfaction with the way things were being run at Coolattin. It is not right to suggest that I am wrong in my statement.  In that letter the Minister spoke of his satisfaction with matters at Coolattin and of the replanting obligations being fully completed to a high standard.  Anybody who has a passing familiarity with the woodlands of Coolattin will know that the replanting obligations imposed on Bridgefarm Limited have not been adhered to, have not been completed to a high standard and have been met in a sinister and cynical fashion.</P>
      <P>The letter to the Deputy in 1968 stated that felling at Coolattin estate had been closely monitored by officials from the Department and Wicklow County Council over the previous three years and there was no indication that the owners had any intention of exceeding the terms of the felling licences issued to them.  The fact is that rather than cut down individual trees or take down one-third of the trees at Coolattin, Mr. Tatten and his servants have devastated five-sixths of the estate.  They have clear-felled it and, to add insult to injury, moved bulldozers in and scraped the land.  Not only have we not had proper husbandry there but we have had widescale devastation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that the Bill in some way is aimed at protecting Coolattin is a <Col N="494" /> sham.  When one looks at the stewardship of the last administration, and of the Deputy who introduced the Bill, we will see that there is every reason to understand the cynicism we sometimes attract as Members of this House.  We got a lot of hot air from the last administration about our heritage and our environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party are adept at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast to the attitude of the last administration the Government moved swiftly to deal with the problem at Coolattin.  Their action was decisive in so far as the small portion of Coolattin Wood that was left was concerned. On 21 March the Taoiseach visited the woods to view at first hand the devastation that had taken place in the last two years of the Coalition.  Following that visit the action of the Government was swift and decisive.  The Minister concerned was requested to review the position urgently and come up with remedies. The woodlands were properly inspected to see if Bridgefarm Limited had complied with the conditions laid down in the felling licences which had been granted to them.  A special amenity area order covering Tomnafinnogue Wood was prepared and passed by Wicklow County Council.  On 27 May, the day the Bill was introduced, the Minister of State at the Department of Energy issued a prohibition order preventing the present owners of Coolattin Estate from any further felling of trees at Tomnafinnogue Wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take up two points relating to those actions which were raised by Deputies Hussey and Carey. Those Deputies, by the nature of their questions, appear to express disappointment at the decisive action of the Minister of State.  Obviously, his decisive action did not suit them.  In the course of her four minute contribution Deputy Hussey tried to find flaws in the positive manner the Government are adopting in dealing with the problem.  In my view she cannot find a flaw in it.  Coming <Col N="495" /> from the garden county that Deputy surprised me with her evident lack of knowledge about plant life.  An assessment of young forest crop in mid-winter could never be entirely accurate.  Obviously, it takes the spring growth to indicate what is happening to young trees.</P>
    <P>I visited Tomnafinnogue Wood recently and walked the lines of replanting. Anybody with an eye in his head could see that the owners of the wood have behaved in an extraordinarily cynical manner.  They have not met their replanting obligations and have put in sceach oak here and there.  When one gets to the headlands the lines of oak replanting disappear.  The number of conifers replanted vastly outnumbers the number of young oak.  It takes an interested citizen to walk those woods to see what happened while the Coalition were in office.  Shame on them.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister's action was effective.  In signing the prohibition order the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, did more at a stroke to save an irreplaceable part of the nation's heritage than the whole cabal of Labour lawyers could do in one year's consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prohibition order not only on behalf of the people of Wicklow but on behalf of all people who truly care for Ireland's heritage.  I submit that to allow Bridgefarm Limited loose in Tomnafinnogue with a chainsaw, given their past performance, would be as recklessly irresponsible as letting a bunch of gurriers loose in the Louvre with an endless supply of spray cans.  What has happened there is a shame and a disgrace.  I should like to hearthily congratulate the Minister on what he has done.  Deputy Carey suggested that this is only a temporary order but I have every confidence that the Minister, if he receives any further applications from Bridgefarm Limited, will take a long time to consider them and will treat them as he has treated the most recent application.</P>
    <P>The events at Coolattin illustrate two things, the need to revise our planning laws &mdash; in particular the need to revise them in so far as they touch on the issue <Col N="496" /> of compensation &mdash; and the need for a carefully drafted piece of legislation which will not allow a buccaneering company to run a coach-and-four through it.  In other words, we need legislation covering some of the points nominally dealt with in the Bill.  The Forestry Act, 1946 requires notification of intention before felling any woodland.  That Act requires the Department of Forestry to review an application in order to see whether it is in order from a silviculture point of view and whether there are any objections from the amenity point of view.  The 1963 Act also needs to be looked at.  If a tree felling order is made as we tried to do in Wicklow County Council &mdash; although Deputy Carey does not seem to be aware of what the county council have done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know &mdash; if not he should not be spokesperson &mdash; that that is an executive decision. There are two Fianna Fáil Deputies from County Wicklow both of whom are members of the county council, who have assiduously attempted to protect the woodlands at Coolattin and to reverse the effect of the devastation resulting from the irresponsible and reckless behaviour of the former Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with the nub of the problem between the Acts of 1946 and 1963 and with the issue of compensation which is a major problem given the considerable body of case law which has grown up from the constitutional protection in Article 40 of property rights. Deputy Carey dismissed at the outset of his extraordinary speech the Minister's report of the Attorney General's views which are on record on the issue of compensation. After speaking for about two minutes Deputy Carey found new constitutional problems and the necessity to refer certain matters to the Supreme Court.  He did not make it clear whether he supports the Bill.  At one stage he said he could not support it.  He seemed to be <Col N="497" /> criticising the House for not supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of twisting or turning will change the facts.  Look at the dates of the felling orders and see who was in office.  All this may be unpalatable but it is the truth.  The Bill, laudably, attempts to deal with the compensation issue which is a very difficult one as it hinges on constitutional problems.  Sadly, the Bill, while well intentioned, fails to reconcile its good intentions with the requirements of the Constitution.  The Attorney General advised that the Bill is unconstitutional.  In the circumstances it would be irresponsible of the House to pass the Bill as it would land the hard-pressed taxpayers with more lawyers' bills and would not protect a single tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should make about the Bill is that it will not and cannot have a retrospective effect.  Instead of rushing through this legislation, the wiser course of action is that suggested last week by the Minister for the Environment in announcing his intention to set up a working group to urgently review the position on compensation and planning laws. Everybody in the House is in agreement that such a review is needed, especially in so far as compensation is concerned. The group the Minister promised to establish will make recommendations on legislative, administrative and organisational aspects and this is where there <Col N="498" /> was some thread of validity in Deputy Carey's remarks about the distance between two Government agencies. There should be no distance between those Government agencies because they are both charged with the protection of the common good.  Administrative, legislative and organisational issues are raised by the Coolattin case.  In the area of trees and woodland, this group should learn from the experience at Coolattin; they should attempt to establish a restrictive definition in law as to what constitutes a tree because that has been a problem in the past.  Is a piece of sceach elder left behind by the bulldozer a tree?  It is difficult, this is a weakness in the law which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The group should also harmonise the provisions in forestry and planning legislation. They should also look at the way in which we can reconcile the amenity uses of our woodlands with the need for their economic exploitation.  Above all, the group must explore fully the means whereby tree felling is regulated.  They must set down the conditions which can apply to any tree felling because one of the problems arising from the Coolattin experience is that tree felling is extremely difficult to control.</P>
    <P>The tragedy at Coolattin cannot be redressed by the Bill because it cannot recreate woodlands out of the devastation at Shillelagh.  Deputy Kavanagh, when introducing the Bill, suggested that its passage might protect the remnants of Coolattin but, even if the Bill was not flawed, it could not do that, because, as I have already said, it would not have a retrospective effect in law.  The immediate crisis at Tomnafinnogue has been averted by the swift action of the Minister and there can be no doubt as to the Government's concern, not just for our woodlands, but for our heritage in the widest sense.  The House can confidently accept the course of action recommended by the Minister and the Government. There was good intent in the Bill but, given the extent of its weaknesses, unfortunately, the House has no option but to reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the order made by the Minister of State which will put an immediate stop to the further destruction of the woods mentioned by previous speakers.  Indeed, I recall that one of the very first questions I tabled dealt with this topic some weeks ago and I am glad that action has been taken which will temporarily put a stay on the activities of the present operators of Bridgefarm and their destructive consequences on the woods in question.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to remarks made by the Minister for the Environment in opposition to this Bill and repeated by implication by Deputy Roche.  This raises an extraordinary question concerning the legislative process.  Last week, despite repeated requests, the Minister for the Environment did not state precisely the objections on constitutional grounds to the Bill before the House.  In the Official Report of 27 May 1987, column 3081, the Minister for the Environment said:</P>
      <P>I have sought the advice of the Attorney General on the question of whether the provisions of the Bill are consistent with the relevant Articles of the Constitution.  I have to tell the House that the Attorney General has advised that the Bill would not withstand a challenge on constitutional grounds.  In his view, legislation which would amend the Planning Acts so as to abolish compensation in the event of a refusal of consent to fell woodland trees would be found unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that the provisions of the Constitution which would be contravened are Article 40.3, and Article 43.  Last week I made repeated requests to the Minister to specify how Article 40.3 and Article 43 are offended by the proposed legislation.  That is the nub of the issue before us.  As Deputies decide whether or not they can support this Bill, they will have to ask themselves whether they are willing to pose this challenge. With regard to the people who are speaking against this Bill on constitutional grounds, there is an enormous danger they are damaging the concept of the common good.  By firing away the <Col N="500" /> question of compensation initially, they are putting a powerful tool into the hands of those who want to get away with the notion that compensation is somehow supported in the Constitution.  There is no such explicit defence of the concept of compensation in the Constitution. Deputy John Kelly in his seminal work on the Irish Constitution, at page 658, summarises a review of the case law in relation to compensation as follows:</P>
    <P>It will have been noticed that the cases presented so far occasionally refer to compensation as an element which may validate or make acceptable constitutionally what otherwise would be an objectionable inroad on private property, or to absence of compensation, as an element confirming the injustice of the interference.  Yet there is no settled doctrine on the constitutional status of compensation.  The cases disclose dicta which appear to permit a range of possibilities, varying from simple expropriation, through partial compensation at less than market value, in full market value, and even (where because of the temporary fluctuation the current market value might not be a just compensation) something more than it.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy John Kelly's conclusion after a series of examinations of very specific cases of Irish case law dealing with the question of compensation.</P>
    <P>I wish to follow this point as it is a point of the utmost importance in relation to the present Bill.  We have to ask ourselves what is the role of the legislature in relation to the Office of the Attorney General and what is the role of the legislature under the Constitution.  It seems extraordinary that the legislature will not justify which cases are being used to strike down different sections in this Bill, wilt not offer a whit of evidence and will just say, in a grand way, that Article 40.3 and Article 43 would be offended.  That indicates a conservatism and a caution which is not even present in the courts.</P>
    <P>Let me give a practical example of what I mean.  Deputy Kelly, whom one would hardly call a radical and expropriation <Col N="501" /> mad socialist, offers the opinion in his book.  Equally, if one looks back over the Supreme Court judgments and the case law in relation to a number of tests which have been made, one will find that the courts have given hints as to their interpretation of the compensation clauses. Surely it would suit the legislature far better to be pushing a Bill out and testing the ground in relation to the compensation issue rather than seeming to accede to the most conservative possible interpretation of the case law.  I believe the common good will be very badly served by such a cautious, conservative and narrow interpretation within the bounds of property.  It is a conception of property which has not enjoyed a positive interpretation by the courts and is one which does not exist in relation to the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the House the problem which faces the Minister, Deputy Flynn.  He suggested that Article 43, for example, is affected by the Bill which the Labour Party have placed before the House.  I would like to ask him a specific question to which I hope he will reply.  Which interpretation of Article 43 is affected by the legislation which is before the House?  Article 43 prohibits the abolition of the general right to ownership, the right to transfer and to inherit private property.  Article 43.2 contains a proviso which entitles the State to delimit by law the exercise of this right to private property.  There is an explicit provision &ldquo;with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole point of having law which pushes out the limits in this regard is to force an interpretation of the common good but the advice given to the Minister by the Office of the Attorney General is that we should be so cautious that we are unwilling to test the concept of the common good which might be interpreted by the courts in a more modern way.  Certainly, it would be interpreted differently in 1987 than it would have been in the sixties when there was a far less ecological awareness than there is now.  There is enormous merit in abandoning <Col N="502" /> this rather narrow, conservative and damaging concept of the Constitution. In fairness I do not believe the Constitution was framed &mdash; and I have been one of its critics &mdash; to be used in this particular way.  Some people have taken the opportunity to force the courts to define the common good and to take account of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to Article 40 of the Constitution which makes reference to the personal rights of the citizen.  Article 40.3, which was referred to explicitly by the Minister, guarantees &ldquo;to respect and as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen&rdquo;.  Article 40.3.2º states, &ldquo;the State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.  A question arises immediately on the interpretation of that Article.  Will the Minister tell the House where that Article is offended by the legislation which is before us at present?</P>
    <P>Let me make a comment from my own reading of the commentary on the case law.  The onus is on those who would be affected by this legislation to show that they, in fact, have been subjected to an unjust attack and that the unjust attack was such as to erode the concept of the common good.  There seems to be a double protection there.  In the previous clause of the Constitution one is protected by the interpretation of the common good and in relation to the second example mentioned by the Minister one is protected by the fact that the individual is not being singled out for specific mention.  This arose in a famous case in relation to an archaeological site. In that case in so far as the individual did not have just one of these sites on his property and it had been diminished in value, you could proceed and not be shown to have an unjust measure directed specifically at the individual.</P>
    <P>I worry very much about the principle of developing the concept of the common good eroding the notion of there being compensation for something which <Col N="503" /> should never have applied in the first instance and about which the courts are reconsidering their decision.  We in this legislature should not be taking a cautious view, throwing away whatever gains might be made through a decision of the courts and what gains might be possible in relation to the protection of our national assets and so forth.  It has implications far beyond the question of Coolattin Woods.</P>
    <P>To summarise this section of my argument, the Minister is under an obligation if he invokes Article 40 to tell us where and in what form an attack on personal property rights is contained in the Labour Party Bill.  I remember the time someone would say when things were very bad that people should go down the country to say that there would not be enough money to pay the teachers or the nurses and people were supposed to accept that.  Perhaps people did accept that kind of nonsense from time to time.  We are all Members of a legislature and when the Minister quotes the Constitution and suggests that there is an impediment there is an onus on him to justify it.  He cannot just cite Article 40.3 or Article 43 and walk away from that simple assertion.</P>
    <P>As I said, the implications are far-reaching. This is a matter which has already been tested in the courts.  For example, it was decided by Mr. Justice Kenny in the case of the Central Dublin Development Association and Others against the Attorney General in 1969 where the plaintiffs had challenged the constitutionality of a substantial part of the 1963 Planning Act including part 3 which dealt with development plans, part 4 which dealt with development and attention of certain structures and part 6 which dealt specifically with the issue of compensation.</P>
    <P>In reaching his decision Mr. Justice Kenny followed that of the Supreme Court in Foley versus the Irish Land Commission, 1952, Irish reports, page 118 where the court held, at page 153:</P>
    <P>The argument put to this Court on behalf of the Appellant when reduced <Col N="504" /> to its logical conclusion, seems to involve the proposition that any limitation placed by the Oireachtas on private property, which may result in the loss of that property by the owner is repugnant to the Constitution, and, accordingly, void.  If this argument be sound, the Constitution has certainly placed serious fetters upon the legislature in dealing with property rights and the court is not prepared to accept such a far-reaching proposition.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kenny goes on later as follows:</P>
    <P>If any of the rights which together constitute our conception of ownership are abolished or restricted (as distinct from the abolition of all the rights) the absence of compensation for this restriction or abolition will make the Act which does this invalid <i>if it is an unjust attack</i> on the property rights.</P>
    <P>It was accepted by the plaintiffs in the Central Dublin Development Association case that planning and control of buildings or land was required in the interests of the common good.  What the plaintiffs attacked was the constitutionality of the section giving power to make development plans on the ground that such plans would result in a reduction of the value of some property.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kenny stated:</P>
    <P>I do not think that the giving of power to a Planning Authority to make a development plan after they have considered and heard objections to the draft is an unjust attack on property rights.</P>
    <P>Place that parallel with the appropriate section in the Labour Bill.  Mr. Justice Kenny continues:</P>
    <P>A plan of development for each City and town is necessary for the common good, someone must prepare it, and the Planning authority who have staff trained in this work seem to me to be the best persons to do it... The making of a plan will necessarily decrease the value of some property but I do not think that the Constitution <Col N="505" /> requires that compensation should be paid for this as it is not an unjust attack on property rights.</P>
    <P>That was Mr. Justice Kenny's interpretation of what constitutes the common good, of what constitutes an unjust attack and justifying, if you like, the full requirements of planning law.  At page 90 of the report he said:</P>
    <P>Town and Regional Planning is an attempt to reconcile the exercise of property rights with the demands of the common good and Part 4 defends and vindicates as far as practicable the rights of the citizens and is not an unjust attack on the property rights.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part 6, which dealt with compensation, he said:</P>
    <P>The restriction and limitation on the amount of compensation payable under Part 6 is not what the Plaintiffs described in their Statement of Claim as an arbitrary confiscation or partial confiscation of property in a manner which is contrary to the principles of social justice...It is not in any sense a confiscation of the rights, it is a provision that interference with one of the rights of the property is not lo be the subject matter of compensation and it is not a breach of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That case law is there and those opinions are there.  It seems an extraordinary view of the Attorney General's office to be advising a senior Minister such as the Minister for the Environment in the way in which it has been reported to the House.  It has implications of a more conservative kind that go far beyond the question of Coolattin Woods or the trees and woodlands, because it spills over into the whole area of amenities and compensation. To run away from the whole issue of compensation by seeming to accept it and establishing a working party which would deal with the nuts and bolts of the establishment of levels of compensation is to fire away the principle before one even has begun to test it.  The appropriate way for the legislature and for Government is to frame the law with <Col N="506" /> prudence and care, as speakers have said; that having been done, to make the assumption of constitutionality and let others test it before the courts.  I doubt if they would enjoy such a welcome as the Attorney General's Office seem to anticipate before the courts.  That is a very important point.  I have dwelt on it at some length because I listened to contributions this evening and they seemed to come back again and again to the suggestion that the Labour Bill is flawed on the grounds of constitutionality.  I reject that.  The onus is on those who suggest that it is unconstitutional to point specifically to where the Articles they refer to the Constitution are offended.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the justification of the approach taken in the Labour Bill.  In a curious way, what we are dealing with &mdash; and the reason for this discussion before the House &mdash; has been the appalling developments that have been presided over by the owners of these woods, Bridgefarm Company Limited.  I am reminded by a previous speaker that the destruction of the woods preceded the existence of this company and that we should be talking about the activities of the individuals who bought the lands in question almost immediately from the time of their purchase which gives a date of 1978.  One has the specific actions of Bridgefarm from their formation in the early eighties to the present time.  I am not interested in quibbling about that.  I welcome the temporary measures that have been taken to preserve what is left.  I am very grateful, like the previous speaker, to the different interested groups, particularly those in the local action committee to save the woods and also the botainists of Trinity College and others who wrote to people like myself a while ago and from whom I was grateful to receive information.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things provoked by this discussion.  One follows on logically from the opening point which I took concerning the Constitution.  I doubt if even the most conservative framers of the Constitution in 1937 would have wanted it to be interpreted as conferring a licence to do what has taken place in Coolattin <Col N="507" /> and the adjacent woods.  Did they, I wonder, ever think that there would exist some people to whom the rights of commercial exploitation would be so predominant that they would destroy the heritage of several generations that had gone before them and would remove the value of the woods from several generations that were to follow?  Unfortunately, the kind of society in which we live and its conservatism and the notion of expropriation of an unqualified kind is one that has produced this kind of mind. Thus it appears that not only was the despoliation of the woods taking place but the material was for the most part being exported, depriving people who live in the vicinity of any opportunity of developing such crafts as are possible from the use and availability of high-class materials and so forth.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have had this discussion here reflects something that is positive in a time in which matters are often construed very negatively.  It shows that there is now far greater ecological awareness and responsibility, particularly among young people than there was previously. Indeed, the great advantage of all the groups who broke silence on the question of what is taking place in the woods is their great achievement of drawing the attention of so many people and the media to the proper appreciation of our ecological responsibility in relation to woodlands.</P>
    <P>There is a point made in Deputy Roche's contribution in which I am very interested.  Again it is a problem that arises in relation to the reform of other legislation.  Indeed I would support that. It is that the concept of proper silvaculture should be addressed from amendment of the basic forestry legislation. While the details of what took place were revealed before the House, it became very clear that one had not only assertion and counter assertion but that when one stripped away the rhetoric one found that the basic principles of forest management had not been applied at all, that the notion of replanting was barely kept.  In addition, what was replanted was <Col N="508" /> nothing of the nature that would restore the wood over a period of generations to its previous character.</P>
    <P>There was the pathetic offering of excuses and so forth.  One of the more valuable contributions I received through the post was that from the botanists of Trinity College who took the trouble of writing to me and to whom I am very grateful and who replied point by point to the present owners and operators.  They said that much of the state of the wood such as, for example, the parts imperilled by bad waterlogging and so forth are, in fact, directly the result of poor management by the present operators and owners, those who previously enjoyed licences to fell oaks and so forth.  They also point out the serious defects in the replanting, as I mentioned.  They point out the high mortality of what has been replanted and the inadequacy of the so-called radial circular development which would have exposed to even further danger a greater portion of the oaks themselves.  They point out that the oak forest is valuable not only because of its age but because it is sheltering a range of flora and fauna which is terribly important and that as the oaks are interfered with so also is there a huge ingress on those matters of enormous ecological value.  The botanists gave us indisputable testimony as to the fact that Tomnafinnogue Wood constituted a unique site in terms of the concentration of a large number of oaks of very considerable age.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new atmosphere in which licenses are given and monitored, to what extent are ground rules laid down which can be monitored easily, effectively and with some enthusiasm by the Departments involved in granting those licences, so that the principles of proper silvaculture can be met?  We were given an immediate problem to which we had to respond.  I remember the reply of the Taoiseach when he was questioned in the House by me, among others, in relation to what was taking place at Coolattin woods.  The Taoiseach's strategy as a pragmatist was to try to achieve something immediately.  What was possible <Col N="509" /> within some of the Acts by way of refuting the felling licences has been done by the Minister of State.  I welcome that but it would want to go beyond the temporary nature of that.  One would want to think in terms of further obstructive measures. That is one road down which one can go. There is the road of developing obstructions to stop the immediate despoiler of one of Ireland's oldest and most unique forests from doing what he is doing, that is damaging something which will not only affect us and our generation but which will affect the future.</P>
    <P>The second strategy would be to look at the defects in the law which made possible what we have just described this week and last week.  The Labour Party have chosen the second road, to look at the whole question of the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963 and particularly at the interpretation of the compensation clauses that have flowed from that.  We have sought to develop within the concept of amenity, certain trees and woodlands definitions which would remove the compensation requirement where an order had been made and where An Bord Pleanála had decided that the area was one of amenity and where the process had worked itself out.  The argument that that constitutes an infringement of the rights of the individual, or that it is an unjust attack on property is very hard to sustain. Indeed, all the statements made in this House develop the notion of the common good and the idea that there is an element of property that precedes us and certainly will succeed us, that it transcends private usage, that there is a concept of social usage involved and so on.  The speakers here are making a case for the second approach which is to amend the law and remove the compensation requirement. With the removal of the compensation requirement one could reconstruct what would have been possible had such legislation been in place.  It would have immediately unfettered the hands of the local authority who would have been freer to move in a far more aggressive way.  There is no doubt in the history of this sorry affair that many people who <Col N="510" /> are well intentioned wanted to act but felt that, because of the possibility of compensation, they should not do so. This acted as a constraint on them.  Not only for this case, but for every other case, there is an enormous value in taking the second role of legislation.  It is for that reason that I justify the approach taken by the Labour Party in developing a general rather than specific response.</P>
    <P>If I was outside taking note of the discussion just taking place and had to take measures directed against a transgressor, I would feed into a legal system the possibility that actions were directed against a specific individual and would come close to the wind in their suggestion as to what might be an unjust infringement of an individual's activities.  There is considerable merit in avoiding that risk in all of what we are doing and going for a general review of the legislation and the removal of the compensating clause for all trees and woodlands within the general definition of amenity.  In relation to the case law that has developed from those sections of the Constitution which are appropriate, we would put ourselves on much firmer ground.  I hope, on reconsideration of their position, the Members of the House will see that there is very considerable merit for going for an amendment of a defect in the law that would apply in every case, the onus being on the potential despoilers to test the matter in the Supreme Court, but if one were to fall victim to an excessive conservative caution that would roll over into all aspects of legislation and would be highly regretted.  I would ask the Members of the House to carefully consider these points before they decide whether they can support this Bill.  I hope they will support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is my naivety as a new Deputy which prevents me from understanding how a discussion on an item such as the preservation of Coolattin Woods can develop into something of a political dog fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coolattin Woods are only 20 miles from my home and are well known to me.  Their proximity heightens my regret <Col N="511" /> and sense of hurt at what has been allowed to happen there.  I would thank anyone, including the former Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, for his attempts, albeit unsuccessful attempts, to prevent what is happening at Coolattin Woods. The preservation of these woods is not just a local issue.  It has national implications and what has happened is a national scandal.  A national treasure has been allowed to be raped and plundered for financial gain.  The cry &ldquo;Save Coolattin Woods&rdquo; has been reverberating throughout Ireland.  It is too late to save Coolattin Woods but is not too late to save for the benefit of future generations that which remains of the glorious oaks in the area of Tomnafinnogue Woods.  If we failed in this rescue we would deserve the odium of future generations who would be deprived in this respect.</P>
    <P>On 26 March 1987 a detailed planning application was submitted to Wicklow County Council by Bridgefarm Company Limited, the current owners of Coolattin Woods.  This application was for the selective felling of specified trees at Tomnafinnogue, Ballyraheen, Ballykelly and Coolattin Park Townland, Shillelagh, County Wicklow.  This application refers to trees covered by tree preservation order, reference No. 32/82/78 (a).  The intention in respect of the application was to complete the devastation by removing the last of the Coolattin Woods.  What has been done at Coolattin is claimed to have been within the law and to a great extent that is true, simply because there are deficiencies in the relevant law.  In accordance with the provisions of section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 the local authority in the event of planning permission being refused would become liable for compensation.  That is precisely the big stick that can be and has been waved, and the size of the big stick in relation to the Tomnafinnogue Wood application is £900,000 plus at this time. Clearly no local authority or any other authority can live with that.</P>
    <P>While we have laws through which the proverbial coach and four can be driven, <Col N="512" /> this kind of situation will be with us.  As a Wicklow man and an Irishman, for me the first ray of hope of the survival of the remaining oaks at Coolattin emerged a couple of months ago when the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, indicated his deep interest in the matter by visiting Coolattin personally.  His visit with its obvious implications was a great comfort and a great boost to those people in Wicklow and throughout the country who are interested in preserving our natural amenities and treasures and the Coolattin oaks in particular.  As a Wicklow public representative, I welcome the initiative taken by the Taoiseach in this matter and the resulting action taken by various Ministers in his Cabinet.  In particular, I welcome the action taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, in the last few days.</P>
    <P>In the context of the action taken it is interesting to review what precisely has happened in Coolattin to date in relation to felling and to compare that history with the most recently proposed plan to fell Tomnafinnogue Wood.  Upwards of 80 per cent of the oaks at Coolattin have been felled to date.  This felling was allowed to proceed under certain conditions pertaining to replanting.  There is little evidence of the promised replanting having taken place and any effort in that regard has been half-hearted.  Therefore, there is no reason on God's earth for any credence to be given to the possibility of any goodwill in the most recent felling proposals.  Here again replanting is promised. Bands of trees left to preserve the aspect were promised.  &ldquo;Once bitten, twice shy&rdquo; must be the approach at this stage.</P>
    <P>Again I compliment the Minister on the stand he has taken in the matter. Future generations will bless him for it.  I hope and expect that the tale of Coolattin Woods will be a lesson to all of us and that henceforth we will see greater care, vigilance and attention given to the natural treasures God has given us and that in our collective wisdom we will very soon have laws capable of protecting those treasures.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat.  Since I have only five minutes and I had geared myself to not speaking at all and since much of what I had planned to say has been said already by Deputy Higgins, I will be very brief.  I compliment the Minister for the action he has taken in relation to Coolattin and I hope that it will bear fruit and that he will succeed in arresting any further destruction of those woods that we should all seek to preserve and pass on to the next generation.</P>
      <P>My party and I support fully the substance and spirit of this Bill before the House this evening because we think that it is essentially good in itself in what it aims to do.  We see it as having a much wider application than just to Coolattin Woods, important as the preservation of those woods might be.  Though the Bill derived directly from Coolattin, we recognise that if its provisions are adopted and its aims and objectives are met, other woodland areas of high amenity value, like Fota Island in County Cork, will be protected.  Fota Island is a famous wooded island of great natural beauty with woods dating back 200 years which now stand to be partially destroyed because of proposed commercial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically this Bill deals with two areas, the first being compensation.  That has been discussed at great length in the House tonight so in the few minutes left to me I will talk about the other area of the Bill as I see it.  In existing legislation I detect a failure to describe definitively what is meant by &ldquo;woodland&rdquo;.  As I understand existing legislation it is possible for a local authority to put a tree preservation order on a single tree or on a small cluster of trees but they cannot so do in an area that is described as a woodland.  Section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, refers to &ldquo;trees ... comprised in woodlands&rdquo;.  If permission to fell is not granted in such an area, <Col N="514" /> compensation must be paid under existing legislation even if the trees are of very high amenity value and are so known and described.  If they are set out in an area described as &ldquo;woodland&rdquo; and if a preservation order is put on them or a felling order is refused, compensation must be paid.  That is the flaw in existing legislation.</P>
    <P>We must bring areas that are comprised of woodland directly under the provisions of the 1963 Act, but first we must define what we mean exactly by the kind of woodland to which this should apply and we must make a clear distinction between forestry developed for commercial or agricultural purposes and trees planted merely for ornamental purposes on the one hand and trees that have a very high amenity value, heritage value or great historic value on the other hand. Having made that distinction we must bring trees set out in woodlands and of high amenity value under the protection of the existing Planning Acts.  If we succeed in doing that we will have gone half way to meeting the aims and spirit of this Bill.  Unless we succeed in doing that, then compensation will continue to be able to be claimed.  I agree entirely with what has been said by Deputy M. Higgins and his interpretation of the Constitution. The Government's interpretation of the Constitution in relation to this Bill frightens me; they have taken the narrowest possible interpretation. When I have more time I will read the relevant Article of the Constitution, as I think it ought to be interpreted for the common good.  In defining the common good we cannot exclude any part of our heritage.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,649,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>In this debate we are covering the Estimates for Energy, Forestry and Communications. I will deal with them in that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Energy Estimate is relatively small, representing less than 1 per cent of the total Estimate for the Public Service. The size of the Estimate, however, does not reflect the relative importance of the role of my Department or the wide range <Col N="516" /> of activities for which it exercises responsibility.</P>
    <P>The stance that was adopted by the Government in framing the Energy Estimate and related policy measures now before the House for discussion reflects the economic and financial situation at home and developments in international energy markets which affect the cost and availability of our energy supplies and natural resources.</P>
    <P>In economic terms the role of energy policy is to: (a) meet the needs of economic development and consumers; (b) to underpin security of supplies while maintaining reasonable costs; and (c) to maximise the gain to the national economy from the exploitation of our indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Energy Estimate is concerned, the priority of the Government to restore order to the public finances has been carried through into the Estimate before the House and, above all, in the provision for capital expenditure in the energy sector contained in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Gross expenditure in the Energy Vote has been reduced by 3.5 per cent as compared with a growth of 3.5 per cent in total supply services.  This reduction must be assessed against a background in which the expenditure in the Vote for Energy is now not significantly different from that in 1980 when the Department of Energy was first established.  On the capital side, major reductions are being made on investment to complete programmes for electricity production and distribution and bog development but it is necessary to continue development of our natural gas resource.</P>
    <P>With regard to future developments, I intend to pursue a programme as rapidly as possible: (1)  To revitalise our oil and gas exploration programme.  Our immediate objective is to delineate certain discoveries of oil and gas off our south coast and to promote their commercial development; (2) To exploit our natural gas resources by the extension of the gas grid to serve the horticultural industry and to the Drogheda/Dundalk area; (3) Taking advantage of the lower <Col N="517" /> prices now prevailing for coal, oil and gas to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of electricity supplies, for the benefit of industry and of the householder; and (4) To urge the European Community to make positive moves to strengthen and integrate electricity and natural gas supply, particularly in the peripheral regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>Considerable attention has been focussed recently on the drilling operations on Block 49/9 in the Celtic Sea.  While oil flowed in that well, it has not, unfortunately, fulfilled the oil companies' expectations for it.  The data obtained from the well is being integrated into the companies' existing data banks to assess further the potential of Block 49/9.</P>
    <P>However, the potential of the entire Irish offshore, or even of the Celtic Sea basin, does not hinge on the results of any one well.  I can, of course, accept that the results of this as every other year's drilling will have an important bearing on our exploration programme, but it must equally be accepted that we have a long way to go before offshore Ireland can be regarded as fully assessed.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism in industry circles concerning the terms being offered by Ireland as compared with other exploring nations.  I want to take this opportunity to assure all concerned that I am undertaking a major review of our licensing terms for oil and gas with particular emphasis on marginal fields.  It is my intention to ensure that our terms will be clearly seen to compete favourably with régimes in place elsewhere.  I place great importance on this particular sector of my Department's activity because it requires a medium-sized oil development only to make this country self-sufficient in oil and to improve our balance of payments significantly.</P>
    <P>An initiative which my Department recently launched sets 1 July as the closing date for licence applications for a five-block package in the Celtic Sea which the Department believe offers an attractive prospect for the oil industry.  Presentations have been made to a number of companies of the integrated geological and geophysical interpretation of the <Col N="518" /> blocks.  I look forward to seeing the companies' interest in the presentations translated into licence applications.</P>
    <P>Natural gas now supplies approximately 20 per cent of Ireland's primary energy needs.  Sales of natural gas to the utilities and industry now represent 26 per cent in volume and 31 per cent in value of total sales.  When the Government decided to build the pipeline from Cork to Dublin they did so as part of a national energy policy and strategy. Natural gas is a premium fuel and Dublin is the largest premium market.  It also supplies ESB at Dublin as well as Cork. The pipeline was completed in 1982 and the conversion of the city was completed in September 1986.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas development programme ran into difficulties which have been fully aired on so many occasions that I do not intend to elaborate on them this evening.  However, I am pleased to say that present indications are for continued steady expansion in natural gas sales in Dublin &mdash; particularly in the premium sector.  Progress towards viability of the Dublin Gas Company has been slowed to some extent by the heavy pipe repair programme consequent on the tragic events of January last.  This rapid increase in Dublin Gas Company's repair programme will, of course, reduce the future need for such works and, consequently, enhance the future prospect for the viability of the Dublin Gas Company.</P>
    <P>The Government have already decided upon and achieved the completion of a bid by Bord Gáis Éireann for the assets of Dublin Gas.  The contract for the acquisition of the assets is due to be signed in the near future and Dublin Gas will then be integrated into Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>These and other issues facing Bord Gáis Éireann in the near future will require some amendment to existing legislation.  This amending legislation, which I propose to introduce shortly, will allow for the transformation of Bord Gáis Éireann from being essentially a gas-transmitting body to being a fully integrated, safety conscious, streamlined modern and efficient national gas company <Col N="519" /> with responsibility for the transmission and distribution of natural gas.</P>
    <P>After the tragic events in Dublin last January the question of safety must be a top priority for any gas utility.  The recommendations of Cremer and Warner have been accepted by the Government. On foot of these recommendations the Government appointed a task force, under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to identify potentially vulnerable buildings, provide technical guidance on the implementation of practical remedial measures and to identify all relevant codes and standards that need to be reviewed and updated.  The task force will report to the Minister for the Environment before the end of July.  The recommendations specifically relating to Dublin Gas are being implemented by Dublin Gas and the implementation is being monitored by my Department.</P>
    <P>On 26 April 1987 the Government approved the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk as part of a policy of extending the gas grid to the north and north-west.  The pipeline is designed and routed so that supplies can be offtaken in the region for industry, for horticulture and for domestic purposes. Project planning and acquisition of rights of way is under way by Bord Gáis Éireann who expect to have the project completed by summer 1988.  The estimated cost of the project is £30 million approximately.  The routing and design would allow for possible interconnection of a supply of gas via the UK should that be the option which commends itself to me and to the Government.</P>
    <P>This project represents a major extension of the natural gas grid and a significant growth in the market for natural gas.  I expect that the availability of natural gas in the region will clear the way for the expansion and development of new industrial and commercial opportunities.</P>
    <P>My Department's energy conservation programme is designed to improve the awareness of the consumer of the value of saving energy.  It is important in the long run that the impetus on conservation <Col N="520" /> should not be allowed to decline.  It is basically in the interest of users of energy to continue to use it efficiently.</P>
    <P>In December 1986 this House unanimously called for the closure of the Sellafield reprocessing plant.  The operation of the plant has been of major concern to the Irish people for some time. The increasing number of incidents there has led us to the conclusion that the plant was inherently unsafe and that the Irish people were living with the threat of serious nuclear contamination on our doorstep and this has been borne out by the report on Sellafield published by the UK Health and Safety Executive a few days after the passing of the Dáil resolution.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's international campaign for the closure of Sellafield and the elimination of radioactive discharge to the Irish Sea the House will, no doubt, be aware that the Government tabled a number of recommendations for adoption at the meeting of the Paris Convention in Cardiff which finished today.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Paris Convention has adopted an Irish recommendation concerning discharges from all nuclear industries.  The recommendation provides that &ldquo;the Contracting Parties to the Paris Convention for the prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources declare their firm intention to apply the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible any pollution caused by radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Paris Convention agreed on the basis of an Irish proposal to establish as a first step a system for reporting of unplanned discharges from nuclear installations in member countries.  It was also agreed that Ireland, as lead country would undertake the responsibility, with the Secretariat of the Commission to identify any improvements to the reporting procedure adopted by the convention today.</P>
    <P>The Government also tabled for the first time at an international conference <Col N="521" /> a recommendation for the closure of Sellafield. While the recommendation was not successful, nevertheless the Government were heartened by the expressions of understanding, support and sympathy about this menace on our doorstep which we received.  The Government intend to resubmit a similar recommendation for next year's meeting of the convention in Portugal.  I want to assure the House here tonight that the closure of the Sellafield complex will be pursued relentlessly by this Government as it poses a threat to the health and safety of our people and our environment.</P>
    <P>I have allocated £895,000 to the Nuclear Energy Board for 1987. Approximately £300,000 is for the provision of new laboratory facilities in Clonskeagh. The acquisition of better analytical facilities will improve the environmental monitoring programme. These measures are consistent with my intention to place increased emphasis on radiological protection and monitoring through the establishment of the National Radiological Protection Institute.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the House in a reply to an oral question on 8 April 1987, I propose to replace the Nuclear Energy Board with a National Radiological Protection Institute.  I am at present considering the legislative measures that will be appropriate and I propose to introduce the necessary legislation at an early date, in the autumn session.</P>
    <P>Turning to the minerals prospecting and mining sector, I see this as an area with potential for considerable expansion and with capacity to play a significant role in the economy of the State.  I need not remind the House that the period 1960-1970 was one of intensive prospecting activity which led to a number of significant mining developments.  These greatly benefited the State in a number of ways in terms, for example, of jobs created and the positive effect on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>We have been unable to escape the worldwide recession in the minerals sector in recent years which has led to a downturn in prospecting activity and <Col N="522" /> consequently in new mining developments. What we must ensure is that no factor within our own control will have a dampening effect on such activity.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the oil licensing terms there has been criticism of the State's practice in relation to mining lease terms. The approach has been not to define these terms in advance but to settle them on an individual basis at the time that a commercial orebody has been fully delineated and the economies of the mine development have been evaluated. Prospecting companies have put it to me that this creates a degree of uncertainty as to what the State will ultimately seek as its share of the revenues arising from a project.  This, they say, contrasts unfavourably with the situation in other countries where lease terms are defined in advance.  It is my intention to remove this uncertainty.  I have put in hands a complete review of existing policies in this regard and I expect to make an announcement shortly of clearly defined terms which would ensure a fair return to all parties.  I hope that the industry will then respond with increased exploration activity.</P>
    <P>As regards developments of current interest I might mention first that there has been increased activity recently in investigating the country's gold potential with a number of encouraging areas being identified.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, the main talking point on the Irish mineral exploration scene during the past year has been the identification of highly encouraging mineralisation at Galmoy on the Laois-Kilkenny border.  A major benefit of the find has been to focus once again the attention of the major international mining companies on the potential Ireland offers for further mineral discoveries. Already there has been renewed interest and increased exploration activity as a direct result of this.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing high level of interest in prospecting and development in the Leinster coalfield.  I will be responding in a positive way to this interest and I have approved of certain measures aimed at a comprehensive programme <Col N="523" /> of prospecting and mining in the coalfield.  I will be making an announcement about this in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are just starting to recover from the worst two years in their history with the very wet summers of 1985 and 1986.  The board have reviewed their operations; taken steps to get production back, weather permitting, to full swing; taken measures to improve the financial state of the business and stepped up horticultural peat output.</P>
    <P>The Government have included a number of developments by Bord na Móna in their proposals to the EC for Valoren aid.  This, together with EURO-loans approved earlier and State support for exchange risk will help the board to complete some elements in its third development programme which would otherwise have been delayed or abandoned because of the difficulties of recent years.  The task now is to rebuild stock, get up to full production and to strive for greater efficiencies all round.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that on 28 April 1987 I announced the contents of the programme, approved by the Government, which Ireland has submitted to the EC for funding under the so-called Valoren Regulation.  This regulation, which was adopted by the Council in October 1986 is a regional policy measure aimed at promoting regional development in Ireland and in parts of other member states by assisting in the exploitation of specific indigenous energy resources.  Under this scheme assistance of up to about £19.2 million is available to Ireland over a five year period and the programme which we have submitted to the Commission aims at drawing down our full entitlement to funds.  The essence of the scheme is one of matched funding, with Community assistance coming to not more than 55 per cent of the total costs of the programme to be assisted.  The total cost of Ireland's programme over the five-year period is about £35 million.</P>
    <P>With the appointment of a new chief executive which is under way at present &mdash; interviews are being held &mdash; it is an <Col N="524" /> appropriate time to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation, to ensure its effectiveness and to affirm its role for the future.  I am particularly anxious that Bord na Móna should concentrate all the efforts of their management and of their very loyal workers towards their main purpose of maximising the production of peat products in the most cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board's non-voted capital expenditure for 1987 will be of the order of £127 million.  This represents a decrease of 20 per cent of the 1986 outturn of £168 million, and reflects the continuing trend of reduced capital expenditure by the board as the Moneypoint generating station nears completion.</P>
    <P>Favourable trends in oil prices and interest and exchange rates as well as the savings accruing from increased coal fired generation made possible reductions in electricity prices on two occasions in 1986.  I am very anxious that Irish industry, commerce and domestic consumers should continue to benefit from a downward trend in prices.  I am pressing the ESB for further economies in their operations which should allow for further price reductions.  Supply of energy at a more competitive price is a priority for the Government and as Minister for Energy it is one to which I attach critical importance.</P>
    <P>The 1986 fall in oil prices was very welcome for the economy.  Prices to consumers showed a notable downward drift. The Irish National Petroleum Corporation had a good year due, at least in part, to the fall in crude oil prices and their operations have continued overall in a satisfactory manner.  Concern has been voiced that the full benefit of the oil price fall is not being passed on to the consumer as a result of the abolition of the National Prices Commission in January 1986 by the previous Government. Arrangements have been put in place to enable the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Energy to monitor movements in oil prices.  While the area of price control is a matter for the Minister for Industry and <Col N="525" /> Commerce under the prices Acts, I can assure the House that whatever measures might prove necessary will be taken to ensure that Irish consumers of oil products benefit fully from movements in the international price of oil.  At this stage I question the wisdom of the decision made by the previous Government to abolish the price control mechanism which was in operation until 1986.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Forestry Vote.  The Government are convinced that forestry is an area which can contribute significantly to the resolution of this country's economic and social difficulties through generating increased employment, improving our balance of payments, as well as contributing to the national tourism drive through its wildlife conservation and amenity programmes.</P>
    <P>State forestry has passed the difficult development years of estate formation, planting and species experimentation, <i>et cetera</i> and has reached a point where it is timely and opportune that it be separated from its present role within the Civil Service and be given a more prominent profile. Forestry is one of the great economic and social achievements of this country and an activity, I am glad to say, which has received the support and encouragement of all parties and successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Programme for National Recovery indicated that it would be the Government's intention to stimulate investment in the forestry industry and to restructure it to cater for market needs.  The Fianna Fáil Government are committed to arranging for a commercial semi-State structure to be established to develop the potential of our forestry industry.  This approach was also the conclusion of the Review Group on Forestry.  We have decided to establish such a semi-State body.  I am keen to have this new body operational as soon as possible and to this end the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, and I are preparing the necessary legislation to give effect to the Government decision.  I intend to introduce this to the House later this year.  May I take this opportunity to thank my colleague, the Minister of State with <Col N="526" /> responsibility for Forestry, Deputy Smith, for his commitment to the forestry area and for the work he has done since his appointment.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, in a decision on the Estimates for this year, decided that the forestry service should raise £3 million by the forward sale of the standing timber in non-amenity immature State forests &mdash; the money so raised to be used this year principally to fund the acquisition and planting of 1,000 additional hectares over and above normal planting.  This Government support this decision, particularly since it will not involve the sale of the land which in time will revert to the production of a new timber crop.  What are being offered for sale are stands with approximately 20 to 25 years of their rotation still to run. My Department have selected the initial group of stands which are being advertised for sale within a week or so.</P>
    <P>The sale of the timber in immature State forests enables the State to acquire additional 1,000 hectares and to plant a total of 8,000 hectares this year.  This, coupled with an expected 3,000 hectares of private planting, will give a national planting total of 11,000 hectares &mdash; which will be an all-time record in planting in this country.  The future of forestry is dependent on maintaining a sustained yield by adequate levels of annual planting and it is the Government's intention to vigorously pursue this desirable objective.</P>
    <P>Total production and revenue from timber this year will be 1.25 million cubic metres and £17.25 million respectively. The dramatic improvement in these figures can be judged by a comparison with the performance in 1980 when total production and revenue stood at 530,000 cubic metres and £6.6 million.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Communications Vote, I would first draw the Deputies' attention to the establishment of the Departments of the Marine and Tourism and Transport and I will, therefore, restrict my comments to the items that remain in the Vote for the new Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his financial <Col N="527" /> statement on 31 March talked about the need to give the economy a new sense of direction, that people were dispirited and that there was a prevailing lack of confidence in our ability to achieve progress. The State sector under my responsibility clearly demonstrated what can be achieved.  An Post, Telecom Éireann and Radio Telefís Éireann are three major success stories.  In the case of An Post, they have reversed a loss-making situation, having achieved a modest profit in their financial year ended 31 December 1986.  Mail traffic volume is now 14 per cent higher than when the operation was set up.  Quality of service is high with 90 per cent of letters being delivered on the working day after posting. An Post have been active and inventive in the introduction and extension of measures to develop the postal service. The company are giving a high priority to the expansion of their express mail service and now operate an international network extending to some 50 administrations. Thre are plans to extend the express service even further.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to be able to note that basic postal rates rose for the first time in almost four years in March 1986 and that An Post are committed to keeping rates at current levels until the end of 1987 at least.  The company have shown their capacity for achievement in the way they are operating the national lottery. The results to date have vastly exceeded expectations.</P>
    <P>An Post have been allocated £8 million in the 1987 public capital programme. There will be no draw on the Exchequer as the entire allocation will be funded by a combination of borrowing and internal sources.  The bulk of the money will be spent to effect further improvements in the standard of accommodation and security at post office premises and on replacement of part of the company's extensive motor fleet.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann took over responsibility for the telecommunications services on 1 January 1984, and since then, building on the accelerated development programme laid down by the Government in <Col N="528" /> 1979, they have over the past three and a half years made dramatic improvements. There are now 750,000 subscribers connected to the network.  The telephone system is now fully automatic.  The technical quality of the network has been transformed.  With 40 per cent of subscribers connected to digital exchanges, we are at the forefront in the use of the most advanced telecommunications technology in the world.  Bord Telecom Éireann have been allocated £120 million for their telecommunications capital programme. This expenditure will be funded entirely by the company from non-Exchequer sources and substantially from internal sources.  It is expected that 78,000 consumer connections will be carried out in the year.</P>
    <P>To turn to broadcasting, the Estimate for Communications provides for payments of grants-in-aid to RTE under subheads F1 and F2 of amounts equivalent to the net receipts from television licence fees and cable television licence fees respectively.  The Estimate provision for television licence fees is £40.125 million, representing an increase of over 4.5 per cent on the 1986 outturn and therefore considerably in excess of the annual rate of inflation.  The provision in respect of cable licence fees is £1.674 million as compared with an outturn of £1.28 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also provides for a payment to An Post of £4.95 million to cover the cost of collecting television licence fees.  RTE has on many occasions expressed dissatisfaction with An Post's achievements in this area and has sought to take on the work itself.  I am also concerned to ensure that the maximum number of television households are correctly licensed and that this work is carried out in the most cost effective manner.  I know that An Post have put a big effort in recent times into the introduction of new procedures and computerised systems to improve performance.  I will be reviewing An Post's performance over the next 12 months in this area.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefis Éireann is another success story.  In their financial year ended <Col N="529" /> 30 September 1984 they had a deficit in excess of £100,000, an overdraft of the order of £10 million and they were over-dependent on borrowings.  Their accounts for the year ended September 1986 show a profit of £3.5 million after tax; dependence on borrowings has been virtually eliminated and the need for overdraft is only an occasional occurrence.  I have every reason to believe their financial performance this year will be even better.  Some 43 per cent of all television output is now home produced and RTE have consistently achieved their highest multi-channel audience share in many years.</P>
    <P>The winning of the Eurovision Song Contest by Johnny Logan means that RTE will host the competition next year. I know that RTE are actively involved in making satisfactory financial arrangements to cover the costs involved while at the same time maintaining their satisfactory financial performance.</P>
    <P>The one dark spot in broadcasting is the failure of successive Governments to tackle the problem of illegal broadcasting. For ten years now they have operated virtually unhindered, resulting in a chaotic situation on our airwaves, not to mention the impact such actions have on respect for law and order generally. I am determined to tackle this problem once and for all.</P>
    <P>I said in a speech in Cork recently that I believed that we are no longer in a situation where unduly elaborate and costly State structures have to be established to provide and regulate local radio services.  I also said that there were many people &mdash; be they business people or enterprises, community groups or co-operatives &mdash; who have the capability, the talent and the resources to get involved in providing broadcasting services on the modest scale of local radio. My task, therefore, is to create the right environment in which as many as possible of those who wish to do so can gain entry to local radio within the technical constraints of the number of radio frequencies available for local radio use.  I have already been examining the options <Col N="530" /> available to me and as I said in this House last week I intend to bring legislative proposals to provide a legal framework for the licensing and regulation of local and community sound broadcasting before the Oireachtas in the autumn session. I intend to seek the Government's approval to re-introduce the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985, in the autumn session in parallel with the legislation dealing with local and community radio.</P>
    <P>I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and hope he will have a fruitful term in that office.  I am very concerned at the trend in the pricing of oil products in the last number of years. The most recent copy of the EC bulletin which reviews oil prices on a weekly basis reveals that the price of various oil products was way in excess of the EC average. In the case of premium petrol it was 33 per cent; regular petrol was 37 per cent; motor diesel was 37 per cent and home heating oil was 16 per cent.  Combined this represents an excess cost that the Irish consumer has to bear of £90 million. I am sure the Chair, coming as he does from a Border county, will feel the full impact of what this higher pricing means in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most worrying feature is that this rise above EC levels is of comparatively recent origin.  In 1980 we compared very favourably with average EC prices.  On average we were less than 3 per cent in excess of EC prices in general.  By 1983 this had widened to 20 per cent and in 1986 it exceeded 40 per cent.  It continues at a very high level at present.  It is very important to bear this deteriorating trend in mind when considering the various explanations put forward.  The oil companies have attempted to portray that heavy distribution costs can explain this feature.  Heavy distribution costs were always a feature of the Irish scene and they succeeded in living within a 3 per cent price margin over EC margins in 1980.  There is no reason why our high distribution costs should have led to a trend where they went from 3 per cent to <Col N="531" /> 20 per cent to 40 per cent ahead of EC prices.  That argument must be seen for the smokescreen that it is.</P>
    <P>We often hear complaints from the oil companies about the operation of Whitegate and its potential to add to the cost of petrol and oil products.  As we have seen from recent annual reports of the INPC, Whitegate is producing products at a price equal to and sometimes below the price of the major companies imported product.  It is not adding in any way to costs at present and it nails that explanation as a possibility for this deviant trend.  We should also dismiss what the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested at the week-end, that was that there was a question mark over EC bulletin prices.  There is some doubt expressed about EC prices but as the Minister should know, the National Prices Commission in 1984 employed consultants and conducted their own research.  They used independent price data which corroborated the evidence of the weekly data published by the EC.  To hear that argument trotted out again as a possible explanation is merely trying to deflect attention away from the root cause.  I heard recently that the oil companies claim they have operated the prices commission formula since 1986.  If that is the case it says more about the formula which allowed this problem to emerge than it does about what the companies are doing.  In fairness to the NPC, in 1984 they said that while they were prepared to accept the then 28 per cent mark-up for retailers and oil companies they intended to examine it and noted the lack of competition in the retail market as a major contributory factor to our high oil prices.</P>
    <P>The issue of achieving competitive pricing for oil products is the nub of what the Department of Energy say they are about.  It is important to confront these problems in a serious way.  We should have a maximum prices order linked to EC prices and we should further examine competition in the retail market through the normal Restrictive Practices Commission procedure.  The evidence is there <Col N="532" /> to show that the oil companies and retailers have been substantially increasing their margins in recent years.  They have been taking advantage of falling prices to increase profitability.</P>
    <P>I find it particularly difficult to understand the attitude of the Minister for Energy to this problem.  In reply to a question on 27 May he said he was ready to co-operate with the Department of Industry and Energy but he disclosed no knowledge of deviating price trends other than reports he had heard.  The following day we learned that his Department was actively involved in a study, and had been for some days, on deviating price movements. Either the Minister did not consult with his officials or he failed to account to the Dáil for what was going on in his Department.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy products for Ireland is a crucial question.  The Minister rightly highlighted the need to tackle the wider issue of the cost of energy, particularly electricity.  His party indicated their intention to get to grips with this but developments to date give the lie to their intentions in this area.  There was no mention of any new measure being considered by the Minister or that he was putting it up to the ESB to bring down their prices. He must have had the benefit of the Jakobsen report which is available in his Department.  A rates payment was exacted from the ESB which it is believed is three times the true rates bill that would have been levied on them if they were on a proper valuation basis compared to other commercial bodies.  We have seen concessions in the form of a pay agreement in excess of the pay guidelines and discount electricity concessions to ESB workers which are adding to costs and reducing revenue in the ESB.  Those measures, to which the Government have been a party, will add to the cost of electricity and further worsen the competitive position of those who are trying to compete and have to pay our high energy prices.  I was disappointed that what appeared to be a very strong commitment on the part of the Minister has not been delivered by him in his actions to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I should like to return to the question of Dublin Gas.  The report on Raglan House highlighted the serious problems in this area.  It identified poor procedures in installing piping, the failure of gas piping to withstand stress from overhead traffic, a breakdown in the proper procedure for investigating gas leaks, a poor system of follow-up, inadequate building standards and so on.  The Minister has responded to this by appointing a task force to examine buildings.  However, I fear that the most important long term requirement highlighted by the disaster has not been addressed, that is, the need for a proper regulatory framework for gas distribution.  In reply to questions in the House the Minister referred to the gas company's liability at law under the 1847 Act &mdash; an Act which was passed during the Famine &mdash; but the conditions of gas supply have dramatically changed since then.  We have seen only too plainly how safety standards suffer under the day to day pressures of managing a company in a tough commercial environment.  The gas company's responsibility needs to be clearly spelled out in new legislation.  The most important element of that new legislation is the need for a watchdog to act on behalf of the public.  I submit that it is not the job of the gas company to certify that leakages which have been discovered have been made safe.  I submit it is not their job to maintain a record of leakages and mishaps.  It is not their job to monitor progress of safety action programmes which they may be implementing or to keep a check on the installation and handling practices in their company.</P>
    <P>I submit that those tasks should be the responsibility of a person independent of the gas company.  It is disappointing to learn that the gas company, in the wake of Raglan House, are losing customers. The only way to address this problem is to have a proper piece of legislation updating the 1847 Act and have somebody to monitor leakages, to keep a public record of the leakages and accidents that occur and to ensure that progress is made in the safety area.  We are very strong in our requests for similar procedures to be adopted at Sellafield <Col N="534" /> and we should learn something from our own advice to the British in regard to Sellafield.  In the case of our gas company we should have independent monitoring of leakages and accidents so that the public can feel assured that the standards of safety are of the highest possible order.</P>
    <P>The emphasis the Minister made in his reaction to the Raglan House report was misplaced.  He referred to an agency to investigate major disasters and he cited the Stardust and the <i>Betelgeuse</i> tragedies as incidents that such a body could investigate. We want an agency to prevent problems occurring, not to sift through the debris after an accident has occurred. The need for a more active piece of legislation has been underlined by the latest series of accidents, the Nicholas Street explosion and the more recent accident. The Minister told us that the commercial position of Dublin Gas is continuing to cause concern, particularly in the light of high cost replacing network that has arrived.  I should like to ask the Minister to be extremely careful in the transfer to An Bord Gáis of the Dublin Gas company. It must be realised that Bord Gáis are a cash rich company, a concern which take on behalf of the Irish people the benefits from the natural gas resource we enjoy.  The new structure for running Dublin Gas must be carefully established to ensure that it has an effective commercial plan and is at a considerable distance from the cash source that Bord Gáis enjoy.  A danger the Minister must address is that the cash facilities of Bord Gáis could conceal a continuing commercial problem unaddressed in Dublin Gas.  It would be a sad day if that occurred.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the issue of natural gas on a wider plain and the whole question of the use and pricing of our natural gas resource.  In his party's manifesto, confirmed by the Minister as Government policy, it is stated that there is a need for change in the present approach to natural gas which creams off the maximum short term profit for the State through high prices.  That manifesto promises to supply gas at favourable rates to key areas.  I would be anxious to hear <Col N="535" /> that policy elaborated on and I regret that the Minister did not do so in the course of his speech tonight.  My understanding is that at present the price of natural gas is based on the price of the fuel it seeks to replace but that is a price which gives the person taking up natural gas a margin which makes it considerably profitable for him to do the conversion. That is the sensible way in which to price a scarce resource belong to the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Revenue from the sales of gas is the only way our people reap benefit from this resource.  Discounting from the existing pricing policy amounts to using the public's money in a way which is not controlled by the Dáil to subsidise industries which we cannot say will provide returns to the State.  If subsidies are required for certain industries they should be made known so that the Dáil can examine the justification for them.  It is completely unfounded for the Minister to suggest that industries should be subsidised through discount gas.  That may prove very short sighted because in a little over a decade we will find ourselves without a gas resource unless new discoveries are made.  With that in mind we should be insistent on the gas being used by those who can make best use of it and I am not talking about people who have to be subsidised.  In ten years' time if we have to import gas we will be doing so at a full cost import price.  What will be the position then of the companies who have been getting discount gas?  Will they have to get a continuing subsidy to survive? The strategy the Minister has proposed, but which he has not elaborated on today, is one which is fraught with danger.  I suggest that the Minister think again about that policy.</P>
    <P>The long term security of the gas industry is far from established.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is considering the possibility of an interconnector. That will be a crucial development to secure the future of the gas industry in Ireland.  At present we are highly vulnerable in that we have but one source and no reserve capacity.  An <Col N="536" /> interruption in that source, for whatever reason, would cause grave problems for the industry.  The need for an alternative source will become more pressing in the coming years and this has been drawn to the Government's attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of Sellafield and the nuclear threat that faces this country.  While there is certain pleasure in the Minister's speech about the adoption by the Paris Commission of his motion we have to temper our joy about that.  In 1984 the countries involved in that forum agreed to take account of the best available technology in order to minimise discharges.  It is not something new to adopt this motion.  Perhaps the wording is slightly strengthened but not dramatically so because the crucial words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been recognised and has been referred to by the previous speaker that this country needs to develop a comprehensive energy <Col N="537" /> policy, particularly relating to energy pricing, in order to ensure that the twin objectives of growth in industrial output and the creation of jobs can be achieved over the coming years.  Industry is a major user of energy in various forms and in 1985, the last year for which I have figures, manufacturing industry consumed approximately 36 per cent of all energy consumption.</P>
      <P>Obviously the price of these energy inputs has a major effect on the competitiveness of industry and, consequently, on the rate of job creation.  An overall energy policy must have, as its main objective, security of supply at the lowest possible cost and the development of indigenous energy resources.  The Government obviously have a major role to play in the implementation of an energy policy and the prices charged for energy inputs through the direction they give to State energy boards and semi-State companies.  In some cases the Government are forcing semi-State companies to carry out instructions with which they would not comply if they had the freedom to make their own decisions. For instance, electricity costs to industry in Ireland are by far the highest in Europe.  There have been changes in the past year in the right direction but they still have a very long way to come down to make us competitive in comparison with our European partners.</P>
      <P>Some of the reasons for the high cost of electricity here can be attributed to things like the rates bill &mdash; to which Deputy Bruton referred &mdash; levied on the ESB.  It is not a genuine rates bill in the sense that it has not been calculated in the normal way in which rates on property are calculated.  In 1986 it amounted to £25 million which I understand is the equivalent of about one-seventh of the entire revenue collected nationally for rates on property.  Clearly, it is excessive and arguably about two-thirds greater than what would have to be paid if rates had been calculated in the normal way. That is an indication of the costs of the ESB which ultimately add to the overall cost of electricity to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is that the ESB have to <Col N="538" /> pay a hydrocarbon tax which is twice the level that industry pays.  The ESB pay £16 per tonne while other companies in the State pay £8 per tonne.  Through An Bord Gáis, supplies of natural gas are sent to some ESB generating stations at a price that helps An Bord Gáis to make a healthy profit, which amounted to £94 million in 1985.  Is there any point in allowing one semi-State company to make a large profit at the expense of another State company, particularly when the end result is that there will be dearer energy costs for industry and for consumers generally?</P>
    <P>It could be argued that another contributory factor to the high cost of electricity is the money paid to Bord na Móna for turf for peat-fired generating stations which are inefficient and demonstrably more expensive to operate.  I accept there is a question of social policy in this regard which may be difficult to resolve in one fell swoop but the problem must be addressed by defining a new role for Bord na Móna which recognises that peat production will decline and that there is a necessity to develop a policy to utilise the cut away boglands left behind.</P>
    <P>The main impact of the measures to which I referred is that they increase the burden on the ESB and push up the price of electricity, particularly to industry.  A comprehensive Government statement or policy on electricity pricing, including policy positions on the pricing of other indigenous fuels used by the ESB, is long overdue.  There seems to be wasteful competition between the various energy bodies, the ESB, Bord na Móna, the National Petroleum Corporation and An Bord Gáis.  A pricing policy for any body cannot be decided on in isolation and has to be dealt with in the framework of a national energy policy.  This is an urgent and complex matter and the Government must tackle it immediately.  Too many reports have drawn attention to this and the position has been ignored for far too long.</P>
    <P>One of the factors in relation to ESB prices which I should also like to mention is that of the overall payroll costs which in 1982 were at a peak level of 13,300 <Col N="539" /> personnel.  I know that through a corporate ESB plan these numbers have now been reduced and I hope that trend will continue which will ultimately give rise to a much needed reduction in the cost of electricity which, as I said earlier, is the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister covered exploration in his speech, especially the policy in relation to oil and gas.  He said it would be of enormous benefit to our balance of payments and a shot in the arm for the economy if we could discover a commercially viable oil field.  It is everybody's wish that that would happen very soon.  The incentive to the exploration industry to discover oil is in licensing terms and those on offer to the industry up to late last year at any rate were very unattractive. Consequently, exploration activities which should have taken place in the Celtic Sea in the early eighties did not take place.  The recent changes are welcome but they are too little and too late. Exploration activity has decreased considerably due to the fall in world oil prices and, even though exploration costs are now one-quarter of what they were some years ago, there is very little drilling activity.  For instance, in certain parts of the world, I understand it is cheaper to buy proven reserves than to drill for oil, discover it and to bring it ashore. However, oil prices are gradually increasing and the only priority for the Government should be to establish a set of oil exploration terms to ensure that Ireland is competitive as a location when exploration takes off again, as it inevitably will. Ideally, those terms should be marginally more attractive than those available in the North Sea, the only other significant area in this part of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister said tonight that he will not hesitate to adjust the licensing terms to ensure exploration and exploitation of oil resources.  I urge him to do that and not to allow the 1983 position to obtain again.  With regard to gas exploration, at the present rate of take-off from the Kinsale field reserves are projected to be completely depleted towards the very end of the century.  We all know there has <Col N="540" /> been a substantial investment in pipelines which will be rendered uselss unless long-term supplies are assured through future Irish gas discoveries or taking supplies from the European grid through an interconnector to the UK.  From Ireland's point of view, further gas discoveries in the Celtic Sea would be the ideal solution but at present there is no incentive to the exploration industry to find the gas as the home market seems to be catered for up to the end of this century and the lead time from discovery to production could be as short as two to three years.  Therefore, the industry's attitude to some extent is, having found it, what would they do with it.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage drilling and to lead, one would hope, to a discovery which would guarantee Irish supplies for a long time, favourable licensing terms and a favourable price regime should be drawn up, a condition of it being that if a new large field is discovered, and there is every hope and expectation that there will be one in the Celtic Sea, permission would be granted to export this natural gas through an interconnector into the European grid.  The Minister recently announced an extension of the gas grid northwards to Dundalk.  He referred to that again this evening, and indicated that there is a possibility that there could be an interconnector across the Irish Sea. On a previous occasion he stated that he was having discussions with his opposite number in the UK.  Perhaps he might inform us whether these talks have taken place and, if so, what progress has been made.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in relation to natural gas which I would like to raise and that is the supply of natural gas to NET who absorb about 30 per cent of the output of Kinsale gas each year.  We have to ask ourselves if this is a proper use of such a vital resource in so far as NET is a lossmaker and has been for years. Though some improvements have been made in the company the inescapable fact is that the market for fertilisers seems to have collapsed.  The long term outlook for the fertiliser industry is not good as there is also an excess worldwide <Col N="541" /> capacity.  The question is whether we continue with that wasteful process or whether the position should be looked at again as it seems to be costing the State a lot of money.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to deal with the area of forestry.  The Government have stated on several occasions that they lay great store on developing the forestry industry and intend giving it special attention.  Indeed, as we have heard again this evening, a new commercial body is to be appointed to administer the operations of the Forestry and Wildlife Service.  This is recognised as a good development as the industry is in need of being put on a proper commercial footing.  Mistakes have been made in the past in this area and I would particularly like to raise at this stage the question of the supply contracts entered into by the Forestry and Wildlife Service in the early eighties with two pulpwood companies, namely, Medite Europe Limited, who are based in Clonmel, and Finsa Forest Products Limited, who are based in Scarriff, County Clare.</P>
    <P>These contracts provided for very favourable terms for both of these companies. The Forestry and Wildlife Service seemed to have panicked as a result of closures in the pulpwood industry in the late seventies and early eighties and consequently entered into these two sweetheart contracts with Finsa and Medite.  The full terms of the contracts were not disclosed to the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on the record the terms of the contracts which were entered into with these two companies.  First, they guaranteed a supply of pulpwood to the two companies at less than market price.  In the case of Medite this was for a period of 20 years and in the case of Finsa for a period of at least ten years.  The prices were to be reviewed only after ten years and then every subsequent five years.  In other words, the prices were not index linked on an annual basis and timber inflation, given that timber is in short supply, is far greater than money inflation.  In addition, any review upwards can only take place if the net profits over a five year period on an annual basis exceed 25 per cent of sales.  The price would be reviewed downwards only if profits of less than 15 per cent of sales annually were obtained. This is totally out of line internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Average profits in this industry are 3.8 per cent of sales according to <i>Fortune 500</i> mazagine.  The whole thing defies logic. Apart altogether from the price factors there are other aspects of the contracts which are having a detrimental effect on the timber industry generally.  Before <Col N="543" /> these contracts were entered into the saw log industry supplied chip to the board manufacturers and 50 per cent of what the saw log industry took in went out as pulp to the board manufacturers. Now, because of these contracts there is no outlet for this pulpwood and it has to be dumped or, alternatively, exported.  As a result, many of these saw log companies are now unprofitable and faced with closure.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem which makes these contracts even more ridiculous. When these companies are allocated a section of forest for thinnings there is no control over what is taken out and there is now a situation where trees in excess of 14 centimetres in diameter, which are properly trees which should be going to the saw log industry and not the pulpwood industry, are being sold back to the saw log industry and in many cases at prices very much over and above what these two companies originally paid for them.  I suggest that these two contracts need to be looked at either by the Minister or by the new incoming authority which will be in charge of forestry.  The contracts should be renegotiated in the interest of the industry as a whole and full details of them should be disclosed to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to turn to the area of broadcasting and to the local radio Bill.  The Minister has stated on several occasions that the Government intend to introduce a new local radio Bill in the Autumn.  A local radio Bill was introduced in the House over two years ago. I do not know whether the Government intend bringing forward new legislation or reintroducing the Bill which was brought before the House two years ago. In any event it is a provision which the Progressive Democrats would like to see brought forward as soon as possible.  The Minister has pointed out that there is a geat deal of ongoing priate radio broadcasting. He bemoans this situation and said we will have to wait until the autumn before the problem can be tackled.  Perhaps he might persuade his colleagues in Government to extend this Dáil session <Col N="544" /> beyond 26 June and give us two weeks in which to clear up this entire matter by way of the introduction and enacting of a local radio Bill which would cope with this ongoing problem of pirate radio broadcasting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I would like to make.  The comprehensive report which was referred to by the Minister contains many items which the Labour Party would welcome.  This is a better Estimate than most in so far as it appears a lot more positive in its approach to some of the more serious problems we have been facing or are about to face.  The Minister might be a little fortunate in that some of the near disaster areas of four years ago have been turned round for one reason or other and many that looked like absolute disasters now look like success stories.  I hope the good work put into that Department by my colleague, Deputy Spring, will be continued by the present Minister.  I wish him every success in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to energy prices on which all sides of the House have been harping continuously, the Single European Act has been confirmed by referendum and I assume has been ratified.  We had much talk from all sides of the House during that debate in relation to the price of energy and the harmonisation of prices within the Community.  I find it very difficult to understand how we can effectively be a member of the Community and yet have the highest energy prices in the Community.  With the ratification of the Single European Act there is now no excuse for not having complete and absolute harmonisation of energy prices. I wonder if under the Single European Act it would not be illegal for us to charge higher prices for electricity and other energy than are charged in the Community? It is probably a little early in the day for the Minister to be able to reply in detail to that type of question, but this <Col N="545" /> thought was running through my mind very much during the course of the referendum debate and particularly since then.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a Border area, I am very pleased that we now have a very positive statement of intent to proceed with the extension of the gas pipeline to the Border area.  I thank the Minister and I am delighted he has taken up the initiative of my colleague and followed it through in positive terms.  I am sure I speak for all political parties in County Louth and the general Border area.  We have been pressing on all sides of the House for this facility for a number of years now.  I got the impression at one stage from discussions with various interested parties that the political will was there but that the gas pipeline project was being obstructed within the Department itself.  It was suggested, not alone by interested parties in industry and the service but also at EC level, that there was a definite lack of commitment within the administration.  I am delighted the Minister has shown very strong leadership. I am quite sure that he will see this through, particularly in the light of his statement that he would expect it would be in place by mid-1988.  I wish him every success in that.</P>
    <P>In my own town, for example, Premier Periclase, as the Minister will well know, would probably use as much natural gas as the whole of Dublin city put together. I could never understand the statements coming from the Department that it could be uneconomic to extend the gas pipeline from Dublin city to the Border when one manufacturing unit in one town would use as much gas as the whole of Dublin city.  I am glad the Minister has recognised that that did not make sense. The question that remains to be answered is that as Bord Gáis are apparently funding this operation have they the necessary funds and will they get the necessary support from the EC?  I am sure that the Minister will pursue this.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the constituency there are companies like Dundalk Gas who has hung on by a thread while many other companies would have gone out of <Col N="546" /> business.  They kept their staff working and paying them in a very unprofitable and a very competitive situation.  The subsidy was withdrawn from them last year &mdash; something of a lifeline for them for the previous number of years.  Companies like that were staying in business in the hope that gas would flow.  There is the idea of having a two-way entry system in so far as if the Kinsale Gas head runs out at least we can go a shorter distance across the Irish Sea and secure gas at the other end, it is hoped with a little more co-operation than we had from the Brits on the last occasion when we tried to sell gas to them.  I hope that will not be necessary and that more gas will be found, perhaps not in the Kinsale area but somewhere else in the country.  While the emphasis is being placed on oil, and probably rightly so, nevertheless the development of Irish industry in relation to natural gas is equally important.  I do not know of any serious efforts being made in the exploration for natural gas.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to the many hundreds who have conveyed their fear in relation to Sellafield.  My own area is very close to this plant and there is there a genuine fear.  This is not a political football.  This is a fear shared by many in every sector of the community.  The recent report indicated that the excessive levels of radioactivity found in the soil were due to Chernobyl but in the minds of the people in County Louth and the Border area and across the Border in County Down that is not the case.  I share the view of the vast bulk of the people that this has been in part, if not completely, caused by emissions from Sellafield and that the radioactivity preceded Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister indicated in one of his replies on the subject last week that there would be consistent monitoring of the situation in the Border area.  Perhaps that could be co-ordinated with their opposite number in the appropriate Northern Ireland Department.  It would be important to compare the situations. Nobody will ever convince me that a cloud of radioactive dust came all the way from Russia and landed in Counties <Col N="547" /> Louth and Down.  That would be too much of a coincidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will have a very careful look at that situation. Naturally I am pleased to know he intends to proceed with the new Local Radio Bill and accompanying legislation. In my capacity as chairman of my own parliamentary party, I spent much time with the Minister of the day, Deputy Mitchell, in dealing with this Bill.  While we found difficulty in reaching agreement on it, mainly because of differences in party policy, nevertheless we went very close to agreement.  We were anxious as a party to ensure that the licences would not be handed into the care of private individuals who were not interested in the community as such but were only interested in making a fast buck.  It will be very difficult for anybody to make money out of local radio.  If and when legislation is passed, we will find that many of these stations operating at the expense of others by extracting news from the national or local media, will be unable to continue in profit when they have to pay for it under statute.  It is in the minds of people that licences will be handed out to the boys and there is a danger that stations could become the vehicle of a political party or parties.  For that reason, we were anxious to ensure that the local community held an interest and that the State held a 49 per cent interest in local radio stations.  The Minister will see from the files the many proposals and suggestions that were considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the Minister as the Minister has not yet produced proposals.</P>
      <P>In relation to telecommunications, there has been a noticeable improvement in the service but much more must be done.  In some countries one can get a phone within 24 hours.  We should consider for instance local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> When local authority houses were built in the thirties, forties and fifties, there was not even a provision to park a car outside of the house and nowadays cars are parked on narrow housing estate roads as a result.  About 50 years later some architect put forward the idea that there should be a place to park a car and the design of future houses was altered slightly to facilitate that.  So that we will not end up in that situation in relation to phones there is no reason why a facility cannot be put in for a phone, when the house is being built just as there is a facility for the installation of electricity. It would cost money initially but it would save money in the long term in that there would not be a need to dig up footpaths or to dig holes in people's front gardens or to dig up floor boards in order to instal a phone.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, I take the point made by the previous speaker about the examination of the forestry department by the Committee on Public Expenditure. We had a lot of difficulty in that we were not able to secure the information we required in relation to the special contracts which were arranged with the two companies.  It is a great pity that we could not get the detailed information the previous speaker had. We could not get the details of that contract even though we were a statutory committee of the House.  If preferential treatment has been given to these companies, rather than doing away with the preferential treatment, we should give the same benefit to the native people.  While they had fixed guaranteed prices and could do the job on a better costing basis, the native Irish companies had to submit tenders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was a lengthy costly process and it was soul-destroying in many cases because they could not plan their production.  Native Irish companies should get the same facilities as the other two companies rather than doing away <Col N="549" /> with the facilities which those two companies have.  The employment in those two companies is important and they are obviously two companies which are earning money for this country through exports and so on.  There is a lot of positive thinking in that report and I welcome it.  I hope that the initiative which the Minister has decided to take in many areas is followed through.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Chair if my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, can have the next few minutes of my time to say a few words.</P>

      <P>I thank the House and the Chair for allowing me a few minutes to deal with the Forestry Estimate.  I do not intend to deal with Deputy Bell's query about semi-State industries.  That goes back to a previous Fianna Fáil administration and I am sure the Minister for Forestry will get an opportunity to answer that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the continuation of the policy in the Department of Forestry in the area of setting up a semi-State structure to deal with the commercial aspects of forestry, although I would query what is in the Minister's brief when he says that he is following on the review group's conclusions to set up a semi-State structure. That is not strictly what the review group came up with as a conclusion.  They proposed a national forest enterprise which was somewhere between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  It is important. It is something like the Revenue Commissioners which is staffed by civil servants and which has much closer ties with the Department than, for instance, the ESB or another semi-State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> I am glad the Minister said that we have decided to establish such a semi-State body.  Therefore, I assume that he will let the commercial side of forestry be totally separated from the Department.  I would like to know if, for instance, the interests of Bord na Móna in a total takeover of forestry is under consideration?  I would have some reservations about that but only the Minister can say whether he is considering that course.  In any event, there is concern about the policy in the forestry industry, particularly among people who have worked in forestry in the Department and in the forests over the years.  I hope the Minister will make it clear in the near future.  I gather from what the Minister said that he is considering a total semi-State body.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the increase in the appropriations-in-aid this year from £19.2 million of an out turn last year to £22.1 million this year.  We are now almost half way through the year and the Minister seems to be saying in the House that he intends to find this extra £3 million by selling off or at least offering for sale some mature timber.  I have grave doubts first about the figure he says he is going to take in.  He says that £19.25 million is to be taken in on revenue from the sale of mature timber.  That is down on what was achieved last year.  In the whole Estimate, even with the extra £3 million there is a reduction of £677,000.  In view of the various remarks before and after the election about forestry being one of the areas for development, I am disappointed that the net Estimate shows a decrease because it will take additional moneys to ensure this expansion.  The Minister is putting a great deal of emphasis on private investment in this area, as I did in my time.  However, if we are to see more employment in the industry and the greater expansion he hopes for in planting, we should not have a net reduction in the Estimate.  I was glad the amount of planting has been on the increase in the past few years and I welcome the Minister's target figure of 11,000 hectares for the coming year.  I wish him well in that but I have some doubt about it being achieved on the basis of figures in the <Col N="551" /> Estimate and what the Minister said in his brief, since so much of the year has gone by.</P>
    <P>We could talk about many aspects of this very important industry.  I know the Minister's concern for forestry: the way he has briefed himself on it in such a short time shows he is endeavouring to do the best for this industry in the future.  I wish him well and offer him my full support in what he is trying to do.  However, he starts off from a difficult base if he is hamstrung for cash.  I plead with him for the many people involved in the industry and who work for the Department.  Their fears should be removed very quickly about possible redundancies in that area which were threatened as a result of the introduction of some privatisation into the industry.  With the proposal to sell 1,000 hectares of semi-mature timber at this stage, many of the people who work in the areas that will be indicated in the next few weeks will be wondering whether their jobs will be secure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to join the Minister for Energy in the presentation of this Forestry Estimate particularly when the Department are well on the way to achieving a new national planting record.  It is now confidently expected that total planting between the State and the private sector will reach an all-time high of 11,000 hectares or 26,500 acres this year.  I assure Deputy Kavanagh that that target on the basis of the most upto-date information available to me is on.  This is a commendable achievement <Col N="552" /> given the financial resources available.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Energy has stated, this Government are determined to promote forestry as a strong economic arm. With its vast and growing resources of marketable produce, forestry is identified as one sector which can make a substantial contribution to growth in our economy.  Therefore, the Government have decided that the task of developing and marketing this resource is such as to require the undivided attention of one organisation.  Legislation, therefore, is being prepared to establish a new State company who would be charged to operate as a full commercial enterprise.  The new company will operate in any part of the chain from commercial forest growing to harvesting, distribution and marketing. They will assume full responsibility for the forest assets of the State and will enter into commercial ventures in land use associated with commercial forest growing.  They will have the power to borrow, invest money and operate under a board of directors with freedom to undertake all commercial decisions.  Commercial production in forestry will, as a consequence of these changes, achieve greater efficiency.  The emphasis will be on results and performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the most basic level, the new forestry company will be charged with development, husbandry and marketing of the State's wood resource and making the new structure ultimately a profitable one.  This company will take over at a critical time when the industry has to gear itself to process growing amounts of timber reaching maturity and marketability. The challenge to the sector is to adapt in order to achieve the best results for the country and to develop the necessary skills to achieve pre-eminence in the marketplace with high added value wood products, thus creating worthwhile employment and substituting homemade products for imports.  The Irish taxpayer has contributed substantially to this development and it is crucial that every aspect of the industry is developed in the most efficient way.  Therefore, we are seeking to transform land with low or <Col N="553" /> maybe no prospects in agriculture into some of the most productive and well managed forests in Europe.</P>
    <P>Forestry has a true regional significance. Some of the best land for afforestation is located in the poorer regions. For instance, some of the best and most suitable land for growing trees can be found in the wet mineral soils of County Leitrim.  We have no wish to see Ireland afforested at the cost of disrupting the rural scene but properly developed, this enterprise will help to halt the slide towards social welfare dependence and will contribute to keeping more of our people in rural areas with a prospect of a real income.  Therefore, forestry as an aspect of agriculture and of land use has a very important part to play in the future development of rural areas.  Land in this category can produce valuable forest crops without reducing our agricultural potential.  Given the pressures on farmers from the super-levy and other EC measures to limit production, forestry is a very good diversification of land.</P>
    <P>Why should we invest in forestry?  Why should the ordinary individual be asked to do it?  It is because we believe investment in forestry offers a prospect of real growth and the development of real assets.  It also offers protection against inflation and the effect of economic cycles.  Wood prices are likely to remain firm and become even firmer as we move towards the end of this century and further.</P>
    <P>There is a favourable tax treatment régime.  The EC pays more for imports of wood and wood-based materials than it does for any commodity other than oil. The UK, our nearest neighbour, imports over 90 per cent of its requirements.  We ourselves import £300 million and over of timber requirements and all over the world consumption of wood, particularly pulpwood, newsprint and paperboard, is growing all the time.  Therefore, we must capitalise on this renewable resource which has proved in the course of centuries to be extremely versatile.</P>
    <P>In order to help the Exchequer finances and fund expansion of State forestry the Government decided to raise at least £3 <Col N="554" /> million by the advance sale of immature, non-amenity forest crops in 1987.  The sale is being done in two phases in order to create a competitive climate and the first phase of approximately 400 hectares in a countrywide spread of 18 lots should yield about £1 million.  The second phase, designed to raise £2 million, will go for tender early in September 1987.  As I have said, these plots are spread all over the country in order that they will have the least possible disruption on our labour force.  In many ways this could help to tidy up and rationalise some of the developments in that area.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, at this first opportunity which the Government have had to promote this sale, to ensure that we obtain the highest possible price and the commercial value of these semi-mature forests. As has been explained, we will not be disposing of the land.  This will return to the State later, but the forward sale of semi-mature forests is a concept which is vital in the context of encouraging private sector involvement.  It represents a tiny percentage of our total assets in this regard, but it does not suit every owner perhaps to retain ownership of a plantation for its full life span.  Therefore, it is necessary that we be able to produce value for a plantation at any stage in its growing chain.  This facility opens up new possibilities for short term and medium term investment and shortens the waiting time for real income for the producer.  I am conscious of the necessity to bridge this income gap.</P>
    <P>The funds available from the EC under the western package grants scheme have boosted private planting from what in earlier decades was an annual rate of 250 hectares to 2,500 hectares in 1986.  This scheme will be extended shortly to cover the disadvantaged areas of the eastern region.  Also ready for transmission to Brussels are two new proposals, one which will provide full time farmers in all parts of the country with grant aid covering afforestation, forest roads and fire breaks.  The other proposal of some significance in the context of what I said earlier in relation to bridging this income gap is to allow farmers, in receipt of <Col N="555" /> headage payments in respect of livestock, to continue to receive these payments for a period of 15 years if they afforest all or part of their land.</P>
    <P>Senior officials of my Department visited Brussels recently to explore the possibility of obtaining substantial aid from the Community to fund our expanding programme of State and private forestry. I am now more convinced than ever &mdash; given the obvious comparable advantages of this country over any other European state for tree growth and given the difficulties posed by surplus agricultural production with the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; that Irish forestry must have its claims pressed more vigorously in terms of access to the Regional, Social and other funds of the EC.  Arrangements are now being made to exploit all of those possibilities to the full.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the involvement of a number of investment groups, small co-operatives, the ICOS and would welcome the involvement of the whole co-operative movement in trying to spearhead a further drive down the road to private afforestation.  In comparison with our European partners we have a much lower percentage of private afforestation.  This is an area we need to develop vigorously. I would particularly welcome the help of the co-operatives because they can identify individuals with land available for afforestation.  They can promote forestry to farmers at local level and also to co-operative shareholders.  They can assist in the supply of material, labour and other services.  We need to develop flexible structures for combining land ownership and capital, bringing them together in a variety of ways so that we are able to release growing acreages for afforestation.</P>
    <P>We have also an interesting and good tax climate with regard to encouraging people in the private sector.  Profits arising to an individual or company from the ownership and management of forests on a commercial basis are exempt from tax. When a forest is sold the amount received <Col N="556" /> for trees on the land is excluded from capital gains tax.  We also have a reasonably favourable gift and inheritance tax system which, in respect of lands in excess of a certain market value carrying an inheritance or gift tax liability means that up to 50 per cent of the market value of such afforested land is excluded subject to a limit of, I think, £200,000.</P>
    <P>In addition there is the grants structure which acts as a form of tax incentive in the 12 western counties.  I have dealt already with the possibility of extending that as quickly as possible.  I am also anxious that funds will continue to be made available &mdash; as is indicated in this Estimate &mdash; for research by the IIRS in close association with my Department aimed at promoting greater use of Irish timber.  The overall objective is to ensure that the increasing volume of material now becoming available from State forests is utilised to the best national advantage though the substitution of Irish timber, properly cut, finished and presented for imported sawn wood.  This objective is being achieved by a combination of measures, for example, by improving the image of Irish timber, stimulating higher sawmill standards, encouraging the use of stress grading and other quality assurances, developing new products, applications for Irish timber and promoting its use by various specifiers and users.  Considerable valuable information has been gathered on the properties of Irish timber.  It is intended to incorporate the results into a national standard for Irish timber in the near future.  The Irish National Standards Authority have initiated a process under which all the data accumulated in the various quality studies will be incorporated into a code of practice for the use of Irish timber on work sites.  This will enable architects, engineers and specifiers to designate appropriate standards for Irish timber in design and construction in the confident knowledge that they are dealing with a proven product. We must bury the bias against homegrown supplies.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to encourage architects, engineers and others involved, to examine <Col N="557" /> some of the processing and dry kilning going on in two centres in particular, in order to satisfy themselves that we have now a product comparable with some of the best being imported and which should be used extensively in the interests of promoting employment here.</P>
    <P>All of this work is in harmony with the general strategy of the IDA for the development of the timber industry.  The effect has been a remarkable increase in penetration of the home market by Irish timber which now holds a close on 50 per cent of the market compared to just 13 per cent in 1979.  We want to travel down that road as quickly as possible, toward 70 per cent to 80 per cent, as opportunities present themselves.</P>
    <P>I might deal with questions raised by Deputy Pat O'Malley with regard to the accusations levelled at the Department arising from the Medite and Finsa contracts. At the outset I should say that the Deputy is approaching this matter on a very simplistic basis.  He will have to recall the situation obtaining in the later seventies when we were exporting the thinnings from our forests in absolute raw form to Sweden at ridiculous prices.  At one stage it will be remembered that we entered into a contract for three years. The House will recall at that time also that Athy Chipboard, Munster Chipboard, Scarriff and one other I cannot recall at present were going out of business. We had a real problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> the use of thinnings, which are such a crucial element in the management of our forests. In relation to the contracts entered into, Medite had made an investment of £60 million.  It is very simplistic at this stage to refer to opening up the possibility of renegotiating contracts.  The international climate at that time should be remembered.  The Leader of the Deputy's party, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was anxious to encourage investment from outside.  In order to do that there was incorporated in contracts long term possibilities for supply of timber as an endemic part of those contracts, not just here but the world over. I should love the contracts to be better. I should love more money to be available. <Col N="558" /> But the practical position obtaining at that time meant that the Government had to tackle the problem.  I am sure that under the Deputy's party leader, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, the best deal possible was achieved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the copy of the contract I should say there is a nondisclosure element in quite a range of contracts of this nature, relating not only to my Department but right across the whole spectrum of Government activity. If one wants to operate a Government business on the basis of disclosing to one's competitor what is entailed in those contracts I would contend that one would be undermining many procedures developed comprehensively over a very long time.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in relation to the wildlife and conservation aspect of the activities of my Department.  I am happy to say that the programme of work of the Forest and Wildlife Service is proceeding satisfactorily despite the effects of present financial constraints in some activities.  During 1986 11 new nature reserves were established, bringing the total number of statutory reserves to 38, and I am confident of being able to add to that list shortly.  The long term aim is to establish a national network of nature reserves representative of the various types of habitat found throughout the country.  I am particularly concerned to ensure progress in this field.  Here I should like to acknowledge the co-operation of Bord na Móna in this area.  They have already donated two bogs, Redwood and Raheenmore, to my Department and are in the process of transferring Clara Bog, County Offaly, for conservation.  I believe they are also considering the possible transfer of some other valuable peatlands.</P>
    <P>An essential part of any wildlife programme is research.  A variety of research projects relating to both wildlife habitats and species is being carried out.  The Department are maintaining their educational role by disseminating information and literature to the general <Col N="559" /> public.  The wildlife conservation programme is funded out of subhead H of the Forestry Vote for which a sum of £0.154 million has been provided in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>Subhead G of the Vote is a closely-linked wildlife provision, covering primarily the salaries and expenses of 46 wildlife rangers.  The success of the wildlife conservation programme depends to a large extent on the ability of the Department to implement the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  It is the primary function of wildlife rangers to enforce these provisions and they also assist in the carrying out of wildlife surveys and censuses. In addition they provide an educational and advisory service for schools and other interested groups.  The provision, under subhead G, in this respect is for £0.561 million.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by telling the House that while we have set a national record for 1987 we do not see that as being the end of the road.  We are now preparing our Estimates for 1988 and we intend to set a new national record in the context of State and private planting for that year also.  I would like to tell the House, as Deputy Kavanagh who was involved in the preparation of Estimates in the Department will be very fully aware, that a provision was included in that Estimate for £3 million which was to be raised in the same way as we are proposing to raise it.  We are happy that the provision which has been made &mdash; we would like if it was bigger &mdash; will enable us, with perhaps some change in practices, to continue down the road of ensuring that this potential is exploited to the full.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with my colleague, Deputy Bruton, in congratulating the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments and in wishing them well.  Their brief seems to be very wide.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the contributions of people from all sides of the House.  I am confident that both men who have taken this brief will carry out their work conscientiously and well.  They have shown their ability in the way they have come to terms with the various details they have dealt with tonight.</P>
      <P>These programmes are very much in the public eye.  When your knowledge ranges from RTE to gas to oil and forestry you are educated.  The public would have to see what is in this for them if something positive is to come from this debate.  With regard to the use of oil, will the Minister say tonight whether he is concerned about the extra 50p a gallon the oil companies are charging and which discriminates against us in the EC?  We would see a positive result to the debate on the Estimate on Energy if the Minister, Deputy Burke, was to say, as he is wont to say in regard to everything he tackles, that he will insist on the oil companies reducing the price of a gallon of petrol by 50p because, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, they are discriminating against us.  That would be a positive outcome to this debate.</P>
      <P>I know that both Ministers enjoy the fullness of debate and exchanges in the House.  For instance, they revelled in Deputy O'Malley's embarrassment at finding out that his leader had agreed the Medite arrangement.</P>

      <P>When prices were negotiated the company that was established demanded the same terms and got them, though not for the same length of time as provided for in the contract agreed with Deputy O'Malley.  I have no objection to that because Finsa are making proper commercial use of all aspects of forestry. As has been encouraged by the Minister, Deputy Smith, Irish wood products are being used extensively in that company. Demand for those products is increasing all the time and there are indications that the company will export some volume of wood to the UK market in the near future.  There is a bright future for companies that are well run commercially.  I commend the Finsa management and also the Department of Forestry for the way in which they have continued to work with this company in making use of our natural resources.</P>
      <P>In regard to the future of forestry, we are mainly concerned with land usage.  I am impressed by the way the Minister of State has grasped all aspects of forestry. Obviously he has studied the subject in great detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like him to pay more attention to the role being played by ACOT in encouraging private forestry development.  The ACOT officers in my constituency are doing their best to encourage investment on the part of farmers who have marginal land.  There was some difficulty in getting many of them to agree to this because they had not the details of the headage payments and this is becoming an urgent requirement. I request the Minister to impress on his officials the need to have this scheme fully documented and available for the autumn of 1987.  The co-ops and the farmers, whether in the west or the south west, need to know the position with regard to headage payments in 1987. I believe proposals to plant will come to a halt.  One co-op of which I am aware have proposals to plant 400 acres in the coming year.  They have impressed on me <Col N="562" /> that their members will not proceed with this work unless they know exactly where they stand with regard to headage payments. This matter should be given priority.</P>
      <P>I know criticism has been levelled in various reports at the rapport that exists between the Department with responsibility for forestry and the EC.  Many problems arose because the brief for forestry comes under Agriculture.  I do not know whether the current Minister has taken the proper officials from that section of the Department of Agriculture to proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his expedition in this regard.  I do not believe the marketing programme appeared out of the sky.  I would say that previous Ministers played some part in the unique record of 11,000 hectares which the Minister claims were planted. I know an instant decision was not made to plant trees.  Farmers, banks and co-ops would have been encouraged by the various incentives and techniques used by Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy O'Toole when they were Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has to do a big sell with the farmers, but I have found him very reluctant to get involved in this area, despite forestry costings given by ACOT which indicate that the cost per hectare would be approximately £800 and the grant would be £800.  If the farmer carries out this work, there would be no labour costs involved but if he does not do the work himself, the labour cost will be £200.  That is the problem and this will cause a great deal of delay.  According to the figures given, trees will cost £375, fencing £150, a Hymat digger £200 and the interest on any money borrowed &mdash; say, £700 for six months at 15 per cent &mdash; giving a total cost of £800.  In the first year 75 per cent of the grant is paid.  That too is a stumbling block to which the farming organisations take exception. They want to know why the full £800 is not paid in the first year.  The Minister <Col N="563" /> might take another look at this.  The fact that 25 per cent of the grant is paid some years later is proving an irritant.  Could the percentage be revised downwards?</P>
    <P>The figures given on the capital value following forestry investment are interesting. This is what the Department should be selling.  ACOT say the first felling after 15 years of 60 cubic metres would yield £900; the second thinning after 20 years would yield £1,000 and clear felling after 30 years would yield £12,500.  This shows that harvesting is of value to the small farmer, and it will provide him with continuous work.  If farmers get involved in forestry it will lessen the pressure for alternative employment in rural areas.  This problem needs to be urgently tackled.  I would recommend that the Department and ACOT get together over the summer and have a marketing programme to get small farmers to make greater use of marginal land.</P>
    <P>Another point raised in discussions with me was about the resources and the funds provided by companies to small farmers.  Allied Irish Banks will not give money for investment in forestry unless they can purchase the land.  Their line seems to be that leasing is a new concept in this country and it therefore will not work, whereas there is widespread use of leasing in the United Kingdom and it works so well that commercial banks will lend money to farmers to develop marginal land.  My question to the Department is this: how can we encourage the banks to make greater use of the model leases which have been drawn up by the Department of Agriculture?  There has been a lot of disappointment expressed by the farmers' associations, particularly the ICMSA, about this area.  They are very concerned that small farmers should have alternative land use especially when one remembers the milk quotas and other difficulties the EC is undergoing at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Burke, always raises a hare or two when he goes around the country.  He made one foray to the midlands and told us he was going to have <Col N="564" /> a new role for Bord na Móna.  In their programme for national recovery Fianna Fáil said they would examine how Bord na Móna could be developed into a resources development corporation. Now the Minister said he was giving Bord na Móna a new role in forestry.</P>

His proposal for activity by Bord na Móna in the forestry area needs to be explained.  If we take this to its logical conclusion it means the Minister will be taking resources from the new forestry company, about which the Minister of State has been telling us. I welcome the setting up of this new forestry body on a commercial basis.  I do not understand why the Minister found Bord na Móna unsuitable to take on this function since they have commercial and marketing experience which the Forest and Wildlife Service do not have.</P>

      <P>I want to join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister and his Minister of State and to ask them if they would look at the western package electrification scheme, a scheme which <Col N="565" /> has been of great benefit to the west over the last number of years.  I am very disappointed that since 1983 the scheme has been so rigid that fewer people are qualifying for it.</P>
      <P>I have some figures which will show what has happened.  In 1983 and 1984 1,444 farmers benefited from this scheme but that figure dropped to around 350 at the end of 1986.  One of the reasons for this is that the scheme is so rigid that farmers' sons, people on social welfare and old age pensioners living alone cannot qualify because the income from social welfare is now taken into consideration. I hope the scheme will be made more flexible, that more people will qualify and that money will be made available.  At the end of 1986, money was left over because the scheme was so rigid.</P>
      <P>I hope the scheme could be extended to include quotations for electricity for local authority constructions.  Many local authorities do not build houses in rural areas if the quotation for electricity is prohibitive.  Under this scheme I believe they would be able to do that.  We are losing money from the EC because the scheme is so restrictive.  It seems ironic that the Western Health Board and other health boards have house repair schemes in operation and yet they cannot find money for the installation of electricity. We must ensure that deserving people benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of a package costing £19.2 million for Bord na Móna.  It is very important that sod turf burning stations and milled peat and briquette factories be helped under the scheme.  The Minister pointed out that under this scheme and under the hydro-electricity scheme, 13 countries will be helped.  It does not matter to me if the Minister tours areas or not.  Deputy Carey was worried about that.</P>

      <P>Instead of people being laid off, approximately 7,000 people are now employed in the bogs.  It is important that Bord na Móna be seen as an employer in rural areas.  In the Derrynafadda station 30 people have been taken on.  I hope that the milled peat which has been harvested there will be used in the briquette factory.  It would be better to do that than transport the milled peat over bad roads to the midlands.</P>
      <P>Farmers were not the only people to lose out as a result of the bad weather. Private bog developers also lost out.  They should not be forgotten when we talk about grants for swamp diggers and so on.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on the mastery of their brief. I welcome the 11,000 hectare planting target.  It is a very important decision.  I take Deputy Carey's point that it is not something that came out of the air but is part of the continuity of Government. The most welcome aspect of the Minister's speech was his statement about the State-sponsored body to deal with forestry.  For far too long, the forestry brief passed from Billy to Jack within the Civil Service structure.  There can be no doubt that the ministerial responsibility that applies within the Civil Service has pressed down very heavily on forestry and has prohibited the development of that area of national enterprise.  Not only has it prohibited development but it has prevented forestry investment from reaching its full potential.  By saying that I am not in any way attacking the Civil Service.  What I am saying is that forestry, <Col N="567" /> which is a potentially commercial activity, operated as an anomaly within the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey referred to the marketing side.  This suffered greatly from its existence within a departmental structure. The decision to establish a separate State-sponsored body to deal with forestry is very important.  Like the 11,000 hectare planting target it is an historical decision.</P>
      <P>I welcome clarification given on the question of the involvement of Bord na Móna.  I have always felt that the idea of attempting to tie Bord na Móna, which is basically an extractive industry, to forestry, which is a regenerative industry, would not be the right direction to go in. I am pleased that the point was clarified even to Deputy Carey's satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision on the experiment with the forward selling of standard timber is a welcome innovation. This is an alternative to privatisation.  It is a welcome measure in that it will provide some funding for additional activity and employment in the area.  The important aspect is that the land will revert back to the ownership of the State and can be further developed for forestry products.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that it is very bad to have the headquarters of State-sponsored bodies in Dublin.  It is part of the Government's policy in the longer term to decentralise as much of public administration as possible.  That is a very welcome reversal of the centralist policies adopted by the previous administration. I cannot think of anywhere more appropriate to have the headquarters of a forestry enterprise than in the premier forestry county.</P>

      <P>The hour is late and it is not possible for me to cover all the very constructive and interesting points made by Deputies from all sides.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  Those who contributed were Deputies Bruton, O'Malley, Bell, Kavanagh, Carey, Kitt and Roche.  I take this opportunity to say that in the short number of months I am in the Department of Energy I have found the level of efficiency, loyalty, support and advice that I received from the public servants something this nation can be proud of.  Our public servants have in the past come in for unfair criticism of their commitment to the nation.  I take this opportunity to say my respectful thanks to them for the co-operation which I have received since I went into the Department.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me it will not be possible to answer all the points made by the various Deputies.  I assure Deputies I have taken note of the points made and I will follow them up.  I thank Members who extended good wishes to me on my appointment.  I can assure them of my full co-operation and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Smith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The oil price control issue was raised by Deputy Richard Bruton.  I am sure there is no need to remind him, a former Minister of State, that responsibility for price control does not rest with the Minister for Energy but with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would have thought he would be familiar with that and would be aware that it was a Deputy from his side of the House, one with whom he has a close connection, who, when Minister, abolished price control.  I considered the contribution of Deputy Carey on forestry very positive but it was unfortunate that he slipped into the area of price control by calling for a 50p reduction in the price of a gallon of <Col N="569" /> petrol.  The latter proposal surprised me because it was his Minister who eliminated price control but he may have forgotten that.</P>

      <P>With regard to forestry, I should like to tell the House that there will be a separate commercial semi-State body responsible for the development of forestry and it will be separate from Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna have a special responsibility to develop our bogs to their full potential.  They experienced great difficulties in the past few years, mainly due to the adverse weather conditions.  A new chief executive has been appointed and it is important that Bord na Móna will look to their principal remit, the development of our bogs.  That task is a big one and I do not see any reason why they should be asked to get involved in forestry development.</P>
      <P>Questions in regard to Dublin Gas were raised by Deputy Richard Bruton. It is my intention to bring legislation forward in this session in regard to that company.  It is unfortunate that the taxpayers will have to endure a big burden as a result of the guarantees given to the banks by the previous administration.  It is unfortunate that we have to take over those guarantees.  We have succeeded in getting Bord Gáis to complete a bid for the takeover of Dublin Gas.  I look forward to a detailed debate on the legislation. Had ideological rows not taken place in the last administration I do not think the burden involved in the takeover of Dublin Gas would be as great as we expect it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Malley for his complimentary comments in regard to my appointment and I can assure him I will be pushing for a reduction in ESB <Col N="570" /> charges.  The Deputy was concerned about the cost to the ESB of supplies of peat for electricity generation.  The social implications of cancelling such orders would be so horrendous for the midlands and other areas where Bord na Móna operate that they do not bear consideration. It has been stated that NET is a dead loss and I was asked if we should continue with what was described as the wasteful exercise of supplying that concern with subsidised gas.  I do not see it in those terms.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Deputy's comments about the need to introduce legislation to provide a legal régime for local and community radio and to restore order to our airwaves.  I welcome his support and I should like to assure him that the matter is being urgently dealt with.  I will have the legislation before the House in the autumn.  In conjunction with that it is my intention to introduce legislation to put the pirates off the air because I do not think we can have one without the other. It is regrettable this has gone on for ten years because it has brought the law into disrepute.</P>

      <P>Yes.  With regard to exploration I should like to tell Deputy O'Malley, who called for an exploration programme, that when I took office on 10 March this year I discovered that the only commitment for exploration in 1988 was for one well.  That is what the previous Government left and I find that unacceptable.  That is one of the reasons I have had to revise the terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Bell for his comments in regard to the extension of the gas pipeline to Drogheda and assure him that it will take place in 1988. I should like to thank Deputy Kavanagh for his comments on forestry.  Most of them have been responded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith.  I should like to tell Deputy Michael Kitt that I share his concern that the western package electrification scheme is used so that <Col N="571" /> deserving people benefit.  I will do everything in my power to ensure that.  We have taken steps at EC level to ensure that the sons of farmers and those who are on what is called dole income can be included.  I can assure the Deputy that his representations in regard to this have been noted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's concern for the Derrynafadda bog, I am aware of the financial commitment involved in that area.  I am delighted the weather has been kind to us and that the management and staff of Bord na Móna have been able to take advantage of it.  I hope we will have a good season this year because it is vitally important for the industry.</P>
    <P>I can confirm to Deputy Roche that there will be a semi-State body for the forestry area as Bord na Móna have a major responsibility for bogs.  As far as decentralisation is concerned, we are now going ahead with this plan and I take note of the Deputy's suggestion in relation to the site of the new forestry board.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the support which the Government and I have received in relation to our approach to Sellafield.  I assure the House there will be constant monitoring of pollution of the Irish Sea and we are setting up a national radiological institute to replace the NEB.  I should also like to express appreciation for the support we received at the Cardiff Conference which ended today.  I should like to thank member states who supported our resolutions and to assure the public that we will continue to fight to protect the health and safety of the people in line with the unanimous resolution passed by this House in December 1986.</P>

      <P>Deputy Griffin gave me notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of subsections (3) (4) and (5) of section 38 of the Health Act, 1970, in respect of their relation to health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise this grave and urgent matter and for bringing it to the attention of the Minister.  I am pleased he is present to give his views and to answer the queries I raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged to bring to the attention of the House the concern and disquiet felt by the public at the proposed closure <Col N="573" /> of many hospitals throughout the country, particularly in the South Eastern Health Board, where it is proposed to close five hospitals.  This is being done in an arbitrary off-hand way without an in-depth investigation of the medical and social implications of these closures.  It is purely a book-keeping exercise.  The allocations for this year by the Minister for Health are totally inadequate and many CEOs are in an impossible position as they have to cut their cloth according to their measure and trim many services. The closure of hospitals is totally outside their jurisdiction.  If they close they are doing so illegally and irregularly and against the spirit and the letter of subsections (3) (4) and (5) of section 38 of the Health Act, 1970.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>A health board may and if directed by the Minister, shall discontinue the provision and maintenance of any premises provided and maintained by it under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>A health board shall not exercise its powers under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanatorium or home save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give a direction under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanatorium or home save after having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the discontinuance.</P>
    <P>Those subsections give the definitive view of the role which a health board or a CEO may take in the proposed closure of hospitals.  Those subsections are in marked contrast to Document F.127 which emanated from the office of the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board dated 30 April 1987.  If the Minister so wishes, I will give him a copy later.  Under the heading &ldquo;Proposals to Reduce Services and Costs in 1987.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Paragraph I says:</P>
    <P>Finance Report F.126 dated 24.4.1987 set out the financial picture for the Health Board for 1987, and outlined the proposed approach to making the decisions necessary to reduce the scale of the Board's operations in order to remain solvent and avoid collapse of the services all round.</P>
    <P>It goes on to list a number of reductions and (ii) is pertinent to this case as it refers to reducing the number of small support hospitals.  Further on at paragraph 3.2 under the heading, &ldquo;Reduction in number of support hospitals,&rdquo; it lists the hospitals which will be closed as in-patient centres.  The Auxiliary Hospital, Kilkenny, will have a closure of 36 beds with a loss of 19 posts and will have an annual expenditure of £280,000.  The hospital in Bagenalstown, County Carlow, will lose 35 beds and 17 posts and will have an annual expenditure of £260,000.  The hospital in Brownswood, County Wexford, will lose 112 beds and 64 posts and will have an annual expenditure of £780,000.  The hospital in Lismore, Co. Waterford, will lose 21 beds and 12 posts and will have an annual expenditure of £140,000.  In my native town of Tipperary, St. Vincent's District Hospital will lose 42 beds and 24 posts and will have an annual expenditure of £390,000.  I am particularly aware of the case of St. Vincent's Hospital, Tipperary, which is a 42-bed hospital.  A fortnight ago the CEO directed the matron not to admit further patients.  As a result of that on Friday in that 42 bed hospital there were no patients.  The CEO persists in instructing the matron not to admit further patients.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the last page of that document that:</P>
    <P>The effects of these cuts may be summarised as follows:... Para 3.7 Reduction in the number of support hospitals ...</P>
    <P>The CEOs and the health boards by instructing its members to adopt this proposal are acting contrary to the Act and what is being attempted has no basis in <Col N="575" /> law.  What is being done is in flagrant disregard of the Act and is usurping the power of the Minister to whom this House gave in 1969 the sole right to discontinue the provision and maintenance of a hospital and that only after the hearing of a local inquiry.</P>
    <P>To ensure that I would not misinterpret the Act I went to the trouble of reading the debates on that legislation when it was discussed in this House.  As reported at column 2019 of Volume 242 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Health, the late Deputy Childers, said as follows:</P>
    <P>As regards the closing of a hospital I propose that we repeat the sections in the 1947 Act so as to provide a democratic procedure and provide that the Minister must hold a local inquiry before directing the closure of a hospital or institution.  I hope that will satisfy the House.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>If I had the time to notice this obvious difference between the 1947 Act and this Bill, I think I would have said to my officers: &ldquo;In modern times and with the need for greater communication and with more interest being shown by people in institutions we should have that inquiry arrangement put into the Bill&rdquo;.  I am sorry I did not do it.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to do it and I hope that satisfies the House.</P>
    <P>He went on to say as reported at column 2027:</P>
    <P>As I have said, you can give the widest interpretation to this Bill.  I guarantee an inquiry before the closing of a hospital or an institution and I do hope the House will bear with me in regard to this.</P>
    <P>Later on in the debate he was commended by many Members on all sides of the House for taking their point of view into consideration.  On Report Stage the then Minister moved an amendment to the Bill.  Apparently, when drafting the <Col N="576" /> Bill the two relevant subsections which I quoted were omitted and, as reported at column 923 of Volume 243, the then Minister moved the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 21, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  A health board shall not exercise its powers under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanatorium or home save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister shall not give a direction under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanatorium or home save after having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the discontinuance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which relates to a request from all sides of the House that a local inquiry should be held before a Minister would direct the discontinuance of a hospital, sanitorium or a home and restores the position in this sector of the Bill to what it was under the Health Acts 1947 and 1953. The same thing applies where a health board takes the initiative in the discontinuance of a hospital, a sanitorium or home.  The consent of the Minister will be necessary for the closure.  I do not think that these kind of inquiries are likely to arise very much.</P>
    <P>If a building is not in a state of collapse or hopelessly outmoded and outdated, then within the next 20 years there will be some use for it, either as a geriatric institution or for some purpose or other.  Nevertheless, I heartily agree with the suggestion that there should be a local inquiry.</P>
    <P>Before the amendment was agreed to, the late Deputy Hogan inquired:</P>
    <P>... but as regards the discontinuance of an institution which is mentioned here &mdash; a premises &mdash; he mentions holding a local inquiry.  Does <Col N="577" /> that mean just a private inquiry or is it a local public inquiry?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>No, it would be a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hogan then remarked as follows:</P>
    <P>Because in the amendment the words &ldquo;a local inquiry&rdquo; are used and that may be interpreted as merely a private inquiry.  &ldquo;Public local inquiry&rdquo; is mentioned elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>We did not think it necessary to put it in there because it is inconceivable that you could have a private local inquiry about such a matter.</P>
    <P>The amendment was then agreed to. Therefore, I am further strengthened in my belief that if any CEO or any health board directs that a hospital be closed they are acting contrary to the spirit and wording of the Health Act, 1970 and I ask the Minister to state unequivocally and definitively tonight whether he has given his consent for any health board to discontinue the provision and maintenance of a hospital and if he has, to give us the details here tonight.  I would also like him to tell us if he has caused or is about to cause a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the continuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital and if so, to give us the details. If he is not about to cause a local public inquiry to be held it is illegal and irregular for a CEO or a health board to order the closure of a hospital.  I ask the Minister to countermand tomorrow any such illegal or irregular orders which have been made to date to any health board by a CEO and to allow these hospitals to continue to admit patients until the Minister has consented to and held a public local inquiry into the desirability of the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital.</P>
    <P>As can be witnessed daily from television reports there is much public concern over these closures.  Nurses and domestic staff and others concerned with <Col N="578" /> the future of the health services have taken to the streets to show their opposition to the proposed health cuts.  I ask the Minister to reply to the questions I have asked.  I hope that if he has not given his consent or has not caused a local inquiry to be held, he will inform the CEOs of the health boards tomorrow that they have acted illegally, irregularly and in contravention of the Health Act, 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point made by Deputy Griffin was that the allocations were inadequate. I would like to point out to him that the total amount of money was agreed to by the Government and that I then allocated an amount to each health board.  The total amount agreed to by the Government to be spent on health this year was £1,314 million.  This is an increase of £16 million on what was the Government's intended expenditure last year.  As everybody both inside and outside of this House knows, the real problem facing the health boards at present is that they are now obliged to effect savings as a result of an over expenditure of £55 million during the past two years, £36 million in 1986 and £19 million in 1985, an over expenditure which was allowed by the previous Government which included Deputy Griffin's party.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in the Estimates produced on 20 January by the Fine Gael Party the health boards would not have fared any better.  In many cases they would have fared much worse than under our Government.  I ensured that each health board would get an increase over the allocation which they received last year.  It is also interesting that exactly two weeks ago this night the House agreed with the total expenditure on health, and the amendment of Deputy Griffin's own party, Fine Gael, to the Progressive Democrats' motion included in its first line &ldquo;living within the allocation for 1987.&rdquo;  It is important to clear that point.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of the closure of hospitals, there are two avenues under section 38 of the Health Act of 1970 by which a hospital provided and maintained by a health board may be closed.  In the first instance, a health board may decide, for whatever reason, that a hospital should be closed.  In this case the board's decision is covered by section 38 (3) of the 1970 Act.  They can close the hospital only after obtaining my consent to the closure, which I give under section 38 (4) of the 1970 Health Act.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, there is a provision under section 38 for a hospital to be closed on the direction of the Minister without the consent of the health board. In this instance I could not have a hospital closed without first having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the closure under section 38 (5) of the Health Act of 1970.  Listening to Deputy Griffin quoting the late Deputy Erskine Childers, the then Minister for Health, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not giving any direction or have not done so in relation to any hospital in the South Eastern Health Board area.  I have not given a direction to close any of the five hospitals referred to by Deputy Griffin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent past, no hospital has been <Col N="580" /> closed on the direction of the Minister and by the holding of a local inquiry.  It is not my intention to proceed to close any hospital in this way.  However, a number of health board hospitals have been closed by a decision of a health board and with the consent of the Minister. Two examples in recent years were the closure of the small maternity hospital at Trim in my own health board area and the surgical hospital at Long-ford. In both these instances the health boards concerned felt that a more effective service could be provided by making alternative arrangements and the decision was made to close the hospitals with the consent of the Minister for Health.  Recently the South Eastern Health Board decided to close five district hospitals at Kilkenny, Bagnalstown, Brownswood in Enniscorthy, Lismore and Tipperary town.  The board sought my consent to these closures and having considered the issue very carefully, I gave my consent as requested since the maintenance of these five hospitals was not a priority with the board in the context of their non-capital allocation.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is not my intention to discuss the future role of any individual hospital because I have, as the House is aware, asked officials of my Department to visit again the health boards and, indeed, the voluntary hospitals to ensure a rational health service, and until such review is complete I do not intend to deal specifically with individual hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 June 1987.</P>

      <P>I assume the question relates to the local authority posts of clerical officer and library assistant.  The prescribed regulations under which local authorities make appointments to these offices provide that, where candidates are selected on the basis of the results obtained by them in the leaving certificate examination, the leaving certificate subjects, on the basis of which points are attributable to candidates for the purpose of placing them on panels for these offices, must have been taken in the same year. <Col N="315" /> The purpose of this is to ensure a fair system of competition between eligible candidates.  I might add that an overall review of the selection procedures for these offices is being carried out by my Department.</P>

      <P>The licensing provisions of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, came into effect on 1 April 1987.  Provisional figures for the month of April indicate that approximately 63,000 dog licences were purchased during that month.  While it is too early at this stage to comment on the overall effectiveness of the legislation, the initial signs are encouraging.  Licence receipts for April 1987 compare very favourably with figures for previous full <Col N="316" /> years. Most counties have established dog control schemes which involve the appointment of dog wardens and the operation of shelters and I expect that the remainder will make appropriate arrangements in the near future.</P>

      <P>The combined provisions for road grants and local improvements schemes for 1987 is £169.95 million, which is the same as the combined provisions made under these headings in the January Estimates.</P>
      <P>Following a review of those provisions in the context of the budget of 31 March, it was decided to increase the provision for local improvements schemes by £1.85 million and to reduce the provision for road grants by an equivalent amount.  In addition, it was decided to increase the total grants allocated for county road strengthening from £10 million to £15 million.  These revisions, together with other minor variations in the road grant allocations notified on 28 January, necessitated a reduction of £7.2 million in overall grant allocations for major improvement projects on national and major urban roads.</P>
      <P>The reduction in allocations for major works was spread over 18 separate schemes and it will not result in the abandonment of any project.  Work on the Dunleer by-pass, Mullingar by-pass and the Tallaght by-pass extension will not now start in the current year.</P>

      <P>As pensionable members of non-officer grades and non-pensionable persons employed by local authorities are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, the Redundancy Payments Acts would apply to them.  In addition, the superannuation provisions relating to payment of preserved pension and lump sum at age 60, or immediate return of superannuation contributions, as appropriate, would also apply to pensionable non-officer grades.  The superannuation provisions governing the payment of gratuities would apply to non-pensionable persons.</P>
      <P>While the Redundancy Payments Acts do not apply to pensionable officer grades in local authorities, I would refer the Deputy to the superannuation provisions which provide in certain circumstances for the immediate payment of pension and lump sum and for the grant of additions to service, where an officer is removed from office for a cause other than misconduct or unfitness or his office is abolished in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Acts and relevant regulations.</P>

      <P>The only reliable estimates of migration are those for net migration between successive censuses of population, that is the difference between the inward and outward flows in the period.

According to the provisional 1986 census of population figures the actual increase in population in the same period was 94,000.

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer has been accorded all personal allowances and reliefs for purposes of PAYE to which he is entitled for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with normal practice, which is founded on the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations, 1960, tax free allowances under PAYE are restricted so as to enable the full tax on the taxpayer's Civil Service pension and on his social security pension, including any increase in the latter pension payable <Col N="326" /> during the current year, to be deducted in as even a spread as possible throughout the year, on payment of his Civil Service pension.  As a corollary, his social security pension is paid without deduction of tax under PAYE.</P>
    <P>Any alternative treatment such as that implied in the third part of the question would be administratively impracticable in the field of PAYE because of the very large numbers of taxpayers who would be likely to be affected during the tax year by such a charge.  However, statistics are not compiled in such a manner as would enable a precise indication of the numbers of taxpayers involved to be given.</P>

      <P>The Department have a policy of developing more modern payment facilities using the most up-to-date computer systems.  The possibility of providing pensioners with the option of having their pensions paid directly into post office or bank accounts has been under active consideration for some time. Development work is still in progress and preliminary discussions have been held with An Post and the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of surveys carried out by the Department suggest however that only a small percentage of pensioners are interested in having their pensions paid directly into a post office or bank account. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, the vast bulk of payments to pensioners will continue to be made by means of books of orders cashable at post offices. <Col N="333" /> As a first priority, therefore, it has been decided to concentrate the Department's computer resources on developing a computerised pension and allowance book-printing system.  This system is being introduced on a phased basis from July 1987 and will provide greatly improved security features for pension order and other books.  It will also make the administrative system for handling these books much more cost-effective.</P>

      <P>The Department's office in Mallow is run by a branch manager who provides office accommodation and staffing under contract.</P>
      <P>Following a review in 1986, revised arrangements providing for signing and payment on Thursday afternoons were introduced to alleviate pressure at signing-on times.  The signing hours prior to that were confined to Thursday and Friday mornings.  With the revised arrangements, the premises and staffing of the office are regarded as adequate to cater for the approximately 600 claimants attending at the office.</P>
      <P>Each claimant is allotted a specific signing time which is designed to ensure uniform attendance over phased intervals on their respective signing days but many claimants arrive at the office in advance of their signing time and queue outside. Queueing could be avoided if claimants attended at their designated signing times.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the conditions that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned left his employment voluntarily on 5 February 1987.  He claimed unemployment benefit on 10 February 1987 and inquiries had to be made to ascertain whether he satisfied the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  On completion of these inquiries a deciding officer disallowed his claim on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work by virtue of not having made efforts to obtain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has appealed against the disallowance and arrangements have been made for an oral hearing of his case by an appeals officer at the earliest available <Col N="342" /> opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>The position is that the 75 per cent EC crewing requirement for Irish vessels has been challenged by two Irish registered companies.  Once case is currently before the European Court of Justice and is scheduled for hearing on 2 July 1987.  In the meantime the company involved was granted an interlocutary injunction by the High Court preventing me or my agents from enforcing the crewing provisions against the company's vessels. The case of the second company has yet to be heard by the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition three United Kingdom <Col N="349" /> registered companies have challenged the 75 per cent EC crewing regulations applicable to UK registered vessels operating in the Irish waters.  That case is scheduled to be heard in the High Court today.</P>
    <P>I understand that another UK registered company, has challenged in the courts of the United Kingdom the 75 per cent crewing requirement provided for by UK legislation for UK registered vessels operating in UK waters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the serious deterioration in the condition of Lough Sheelin as a trout lake with its related amenities for tourism and jobs, caused by the pollution of the lake from pig slurry; the action, if any, he <Col N="353" /> proposes taking in order to ensure that the quality of the lake's water is restored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the tourist industry centred on inland fishing in the area of Lough Sheelin, County Cavan, is now at serious risk as a result of the continued pollution of the lake; the proposals, if any he has to take any action to reverse the present disastrous situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the condition of the lake has deteriorated recently and on the possible implications of this.  The problem in the lake has historically been associated with the spreading of pig slurry and there is little doubt that this has been the major source of the nutrient load entering the lake and the adjoining streams.  In 1986, Cavan County Council issued over 40 notices to pig producers under section 12 of the Local Government Water Pollution Act, 1977, banning slurry spreading during the winter months and restricting it during other periods.  I understand that these notices were complied with but that there has been little improvement in the condition of the lake.  The Lough Sheelin management committee has established a technical sub-committee which, with the assistance of the co-ordinator, is at present drafting slurry management plans for the major producers in the area. This will allow more systematic control of the nutrient inputs from this source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reasons have been put forward for the deterioration of the lake. The bad weather conditions during the summer months of 1985 and 1986 has been a contributory factor but does not appear to be the sole cause of the problem. I am considering what further investigations may be necessary to determine more precisely the causes of the recent <Col N="354" /> decline in the condition of the lake and the additional measures which may be required to reverse the situation.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive programme to provide accommodation and other services for travellers was announced in July 1984. Within the context of that programme, primary responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of travellers and the planning and initiation of schemes to meet these needs are matters for individual housing authorities.</P>
      <P>The distribution of travellers between the different local authorities varies greatly as does their accommodation needs.  Over many years local authorities have been encouraged to provide appropriate accommodation for travellers in their area.  Such provision can either be by way of serviced caravan parks or housing, depending generally on the wishes in this respect of the persons involved.  In all cases, the cost of providing the accommodation in question is met in full by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Over the last four years 16 serviced sites were completed, three are under construction and 13 are at an advanced planning stage.  In addition, seven group housing schemes were completed, two are under construction and five are at an advanced planning stage.  The average yearly number of travelling facilities accommodated in standard housing is in the region of 150.  These arrangements substantially provide for the accommodation needs in some local authority areas but in the case of Dublin the number of travellers is greater and therefore a more substantial programme is necessary and is currently under way.</P>

      <P>The basic criteria for participation in respect of the social employment scheme and the Teamwork scheme are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Social Employment Scheme</P>
      <P>Sponsors should be non-profit orientated and community based and can be either public sector bodies or voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>Participants must be over 25 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance</P>
      <P Just="Center">or</P>
      <P>over 25 years of age, registered as unemployed for over 12 months and in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>(b)  Teamwork Scheme</P>
      <P>Only voluntary non-profit making, community based groups, independent of statutory bodies, which have primarily social or cultural objectives, may act as a sponsor.</P>
      <P>Any young person over 17 and under 25 years of age at the time of recruitment, who has left the education system and has been unemployed for more than six months immediately prior to obtaining employment can join Teamwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All young workers must have been registered with the National Manpower Service for at least four weeks prior to being referred by the National <Col N="391" /> Manpower Service to the sponsor for interview.</P>
    <P>Supervisors, who may be over 25 and need not necessarily be unemployed for six months, should, however, be registered with the National Manpower Service for at least four weeks before the project commences.</P>
    <P>No changes have been introduced in the eligibility criteria since 10 March 1987. With effect from 1 April 1987, the allowance payable to new SES participants has been reduced from £70 to £60 per week. The wages grant under the Teamwork scheme has also been reduced from £70 to £60 from 1 April 1987 for new participants.</P>
    <P>In April 1987 guidelines issued to placement officers regarding the Job-search programme.  The guidelines state, among other things, that people who do not accept the reasonable offer of a place on a manpower scheme (including places on the social employment and the Teamwork schemes) should be notified to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 284 and 306 together. Donaghmore national school, County Limerick has three teachers.  Classes are accommodated in two permanent classrooms and one prefabricated classroom. Following the usual title investigation in respect of a site offered by the school authorities for a new school building, sketch plans for such building were approved in September 1986. Agreement was reached in February 1987 on a suitable local contribution towards the project costs, resulting in formal grant sanction for the project being issued during the following month.  Because, however, of the extent to which my Department's 1987 capital allocation for the national schools building programme had already been committed prior to my assuming office, rescheduling must inevitably occur in the processing of other projects.  I find that I am not likely to be in a position to advance significantly the Donaghmore project during the balance <Col N="399" /> of the current financial year.  My Department's Primary Building Branch will, however, keep in touch with the school authorities regarding the further processing of their proposals.</P>

This is to result from a saving of 1 per cent of the gross pay bill in the calendar year 1987 and a further 3 per cent in 1988.</P>
    <P>The application of the Government's Budget Statement in the HEA sector is still being considered.  While the educational institutions are still considering their position in this matter I have no reason to believe that essential activities in the third level sector will be seriously curtailed by the application of the Government's decision.</P>

In order that more experience may be gained of its operation I have sanctioned transition year courses for the 1987-88 school year in those schools which are currently providing such courses.  This decision has enabled transition year programmes to be sanctioned in a total of 74 schools for the 1987-88 school year.</P>

      <P>Tender documents for the proposed new national school at Moylough, County Sligo have been prepared by my Department.  It will not, however, be possible to advance this project significantly in the immediate future because of my Department's capital commitments in respect of contracts recently authorised, and the large number of other projects for which tenders have been received or for which tenders have been invited.  My Department's Primary Building Branch will keep in touch with the school authorities regarding the further processing of their proposals.</P>

A decision in the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities at the earliest possible date.</P>
