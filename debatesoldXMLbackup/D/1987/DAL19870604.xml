    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I propose to deal with six aspects of the Finance Bill.  First, I want to refer to the appalling slowness in the reform of our taxation system.  Secondly, I want to put up some alternative measures on taxation.  The Minister has rightly challenged those who wish to see reliefs introduced or to see the general level of taxation reduced and he has asked them to suggest alternative measures to obtain Exchequer resources. It is not unfair to say that Deputy McDowell last evening put forward several measures on tax reduction but not a shred of an alternative proposition for meeting the inevitable reduction in Exchequer resources.  Thirdly, I want to deal with the land tax decision by the Government and, fourthly with the very exceptional decision of the Government relating to the building societies and the banks and the policies issued here.  Then I shall deal with the exclusion of the VHI from retention tax, something I regard as a serious anomaly.  I refer to the exclusion of contribution payments by VHI subscribers in respect of consultants.  Finally, I shall be making some observations on the international financial services proposal which is being hyped up beyond all merit and prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding taxation reform, time slips by rapidly both in this House and in terms of reform.  It slips by so rapidly that it has resulted in the conversion of the Taoiseach who has decided to go for broke in restoring the nation's finances to some order.  He saw from 1981 to 1987 valiant efforts on our part but nothing emerging from his own assessment in 1980-81, and he has decided to undergo a massive conversion. That is to be welcomed.  It is in the areas and methods of conversion <Col N="587" /> where we in the Labour Party part company with him, but in view of the overall thrust and necessity of bringing some sanity into financing Exchequer expenditure we do not cavil in any way at that policy approach.</P>
    <P>It is now five years, July 1982, since we had the first report of the Commision on Taxation which pointed out on page 70 in paragraph 1.11 that turnover tax was introduced in November 1983, wholesale tax in 1966 and VAT in November 1972, that there was an extension of income tax to certain farmers in 1974, that estate duties were removed in 1975 and replaced by capital acquisitions tax, that the gift tax was introduced in 1974, that inheritance tax then changed in 1975, that capital gains tax and wealth tax were introduced in that year, that wealth tax was abolished in 1978 while corporation tax on company profits was introduced in 1976, that rates on private houses were abolished in 1978 and the PRSI contributions system was brought in in 1979.  I suppose since then the only other major reform has been the DIRT which was brought in a year or so ago.</P>
    <P>We have not in any way, contrary to anything the Minister said yesterday evening, broadened the tax base to any necessary extent.  We have not made the tax system fairer and we have now introduced a multiple series of allowances within the tax system.  This causes enormous confusion to the taxpayer, imposes great difficulty in the administration of the taxation system and encourages a great deal of tax avoidance and tax evasion within the system, so much so that we have a very substantial black economy. It is difficult to estimate the size of that but I would not be surprised if it is in the region of 10 per cent of GNP because the more I remain a Member of the House, whether in Government or Opposition, the more I become aware of the manner in which so many people operate outside the formal system, apparently with some success.  That is the only conclusion I can come to from seeing the way some people live and how they have disposable income readily available <Col N="588" /> to them.  The House and successive Governments have failed to enter into fundamental reforms in the tax system as called for by successive reports of the Commission on Taxation onwards from July 1982.  It is not unfair to say that successive Ministers for Finance are little more than what one might call Exchequer firebrigade officers and expenditure controllers to a degree.  As each Minister knows well, every month a budget trend report, a revenue trend report, an expenditure trend report is presented to the Cabinet.  Most Ministers for Finance spend most of their time just policing the expenditure, fighting battle after battle in Cabinet, preventing the expenditure from rising ever more and trying to ensure that revenue is brought into the State.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a fundamental question about the organisation of Government which impinges very much on the Finance Bill.  I do not think it possible for a Minister for Finance, in our current Cabinet structure who is required to bring in some six or seven thousand million pounds a year in tax revenue and the best part of six or seven hundred million pounds in non-tax revenue, to do all that work and simultaneously act virtually as a Minister for public expenditure and control the multiple Votes of Cabinet. Within six months most Ministers for Finance have either declined into virtual ill health because of the pressures on them &mdash; there is not a Minister for Finance who has not undergone that trauma &mdash; or have discovered how obdurate are their colleagues in terms of acceptance of their views or the views of the Department of Finance.  Remember that Ministers for Finance must take on virtually the whole Government and fight battles on a very lonely basis.  In the end, most Ministers for Finance after two or three years and particularly coming up to an election, tend to throw in the towel.  Their real target in the long term, in turning around the taxation system, in introducing fundamental reforms and, above all else, ensuring that people pay their taxes becomes an almost impossible task to discharge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> There is a need for the reorganisation of Government.  It is no secret that, in Government, the Labour Party put forward a view that perhaps there should be a Minister who would be responsible for public expenditure &mdash; just on the expenditure side &mdash; a senior Cabinet Minister responsible for controlling expenditure, responsible for what one might call the perennial, bilateral debates with other Government Departments.  The Minister is currently engaged in bilateral discussions with his colleagues, probably with a view to a mid-summer budget. There is all the smell of a mid-term budget about it at present, bearing in mind in particular the letter which was issued from the Taoiseach's office.</P>
    <P>Within the structure of Government if the Minister for Finance were relieved of the appallingly difficult job of controlling public expenditure, requiring only to take macro-decisions relating to expenditure, then he could sit back and become somewhat more reflective in his work.  Above all else, he could occupy himself with taxation reform.  With profound respect it is my opinion that we do not have a Department of Finance in this country. In fact, what we have is a department of public expenditure control.  Most departmental officers in the Department of Finance at Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Principal Officer level are busy with their own Votes, particularly on the expenditure side, operating at second remove from the Revenue Commissioners and it means that, as such, we do not have a Department which is innovative in terms of taxation reform, a Department which can sit back and take a long hard look at the requirements of, for example, the First Report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I spent four years in Government, during which time there was not a response from the Department to the commission's report and very little internal discussion in relation to the various reports produced.  Admittedly there were all sorts of reasons X, Y or Z reform could not be introduced or implemented. The officers of the Department were <Col N="590" /> unstinting in assisting Government Ministers in those discussions.  Nevertheless, a small Government Department with a limited number of experts available, working at second remove from the Revenue Commissioners, is not in a position to introduce fundamental reforms into the system.</P>
    <P>It is strongly arguable that perhaps Cabinet responsibility should be split.  I have no desire to introduce further divisions of labour within the Department of Finance.  We saw the chaos that ensued when we had a Minister for Economic Planning and Development, when the Department of Finance declared war on other Departments.  Eventually that Minister was subsumed out of the body politic, the Department being brought back into line but there is a very strong case to be made that in the Cabinet one Minister should be responsible for public expenditure and another for the revenue system.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the revenue collection system has broken down.  It has been acknowledged that it has broken down. Despite the best intentions of successive Ministers for Finance, there is widespread evasion and widespread avoidance.</P>
    <P>I come now to a proposal which would stop all that.  In fairness to Deputy McDowell I should say he was totally honest last evening when he said the main reason people were not objecting to the deposit interest retention tax or other taxes in relation to disclosure is because they know they are getting away with substantial hidden benefits by virtue of not having total disclosure of moneys lodged in bank accounts, building societies or in the system generally.  I hold the view strongly that we will never have here a fair taxation system and we will never be able to eliminate the black economy unless there is total disclosure in the banking system.  That is an imperative. Otherwise one can wipe out any real prospect of fundamental reform of the taxation system.</P>
    <P>I well remember the assurances given by successive Ministers.  Particularly when the deposit interest retention tax <Col N="591" /> was introduced, I remember well the trenchant and quite ridiculous allegations made at the time that we were taxing children's confirmation money, widows' savings, that we were imposing penal taxation. No sooner were Fianna Fáil in office than they immediately accepted that that fundamental reform was needed as far as the country was concerned.  I am very much in favour of it.  Mind you, the Department of Finance were not in favour of the deposit interest retention tax and there were some strong objections raised, allegedly because it was thought it would cause havoc in the banking system.  Needless to remark, it has not.  In fact, the banking system tried a very smart move last year in the crediting of interest.  They are caught this year under the provisions of the Finance Bill, which means we have recovered back moneys we had anticipated we would get in 1987 and which they tried to dodge in terms of payment.</P>
    <P>I come back to the fundamental plea for disclosure.  The ordinary industrial worker here has nothing whatsoever to worry about in terms of disclosure.  He has no money to disclose full stop: he has no money.  He spends every penny he earns in a week.  If his earnings have not been spent on Thursday evening certainly they have on Friday evening.  He does not have any savings.  By and large in terms of the ordinary industrial worker there is no money to be saved &mdash; a person bringing home, say, £95 or £120 a week, or a pensioner with £47 or £50 a week, that is all they have and they spend it. But there are people &mdash; and it is widely known &mdash; in manufacturing industries, in personal service industries, in a whole range of industries, who keep two books. One is on an official counting basis and the other is on a cash basis.  The cash is deposited and the cheques and the ordinary invoice payments are for the Revenue Commissioners.  No matter how clever the Revenue Commissioners are, there are always people who are up to dodges and money goes into deposit accounts, building societies and banking accounts.  We saw recently several major <Col N="592" /> cases &mdash; constituting the tip of the iceberg only &mdash; when the Revenue Commissioners caught up with a few people, when they had to pay £1 million or £0.5 million in revenue assessments which were proven but they got away with those which were unproven.</P>
    <P>That boils down to the fundamental question.  The overwhelming majority of ordinary income earners have nothing to fear from the disclosure of income.  I have no doubt whatever that if the Revenue Commissioners had a fundamental right to simply ring up a bank and say: &ldquo;I want a print out of the depositors in the Carrick-on-Shannon branch&rdquo; they might have found a fish deal much faster and it would be interesting in that case to find out who was signing a promissory note for a couple of million pounds.  That would be more satisfactory.  At present the Revenue Commissioners are virtually precluded from getting a schedule of depositors.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Social Welfare for the best part of four years and I found some very interesting cases of people who applied for non-contributory pension and they had deposits which the Revenue Commissioners would never hear about in a thousand years under the current system.  There is massive objection to the disclosure of income.  There is not a solicitor in a government who would not run a thousand miles from disclosure. Solicitors keep clients' accounts on the basis of confidentiality and non-disclosure. Most Dáil Deputies, particularly those who come from rural constituencies and those who come from a business background, would run a mile from disclosure. They and their closest constituents would literally whip people from one end of a townland to another at the very thought of them standing at a chapel gate and advocating disclosure.  It would be regarded as the State inquiring into the private affairs of a citizen, but there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>The taxation system could be regarded as just fulfilling about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of its true purpose of ensuring that people who earn money pay a <Col N="593" /> modest proportion of it to the Government of the day to enable the running of our essential public services.  That is the purpose of taxation.  Most people want and demand services but are very reluctant to pay for those services.  We should have to pay tax on the basis of total disclosure of income.  I make that general point because it is a fundamental aspect of our taxation system which is ignored time and time again in the House.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of reform to which I want to refer, which would ensure that the Government would have some reasonable revenue in 1987 with which to run the country and which would at least be an answer to those who, as the Minister correctly claimed, advocate tax reliefs and simultaneously refuse to indicate from where the alternative sources of revenue should come.  I want to refer to the Minister's confirmation, in relation to the Finance Bill, of the reduction of the VAT refund scheme for unregistered farmers from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent. I do not have the exact yield figure but I think it is about £9 million in 1987.  The Minister should have abolished the refund scheme or should have reduced it by 50 per cent.  I would have reduced it from 2.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent and I would have availed of the extra £8 million or £9 million in 1987.  The reduction by half of that amount would have meant a legitimate income to the Exchequer.  I would have abolished it completely in 1988.  Our taxation system is such a multiple mess of allowances and refunds that I sympathise with any civil servant who tries to administer it.  The reason I home in on the VAT refund system for unregistered farmers is that successive Governments have, for all practical purposes, abdicated their responsibility of ensuring that the same system of income taxation applies to the farming community as applies to the PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>There is multiple evidence in this Finance Bill of successive Governments who chopped and changed the basis for taxing farm incomes.  In real terms they have actually reduced substantially the level of taxation of the farming community.  That is a disgrace and there is great public <Col N="594" /> anger about this matter.  I was proud in Government that at least we had some system of rationality in this regard although it was not a perfect system. Farm tax was introduced in 1986 for 2,150 farmers with 150 adjusted acres and upwards, despite vociferous opposition from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am glad the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in Government reached agreement on it.  It was a singularly important achievement just as the DIRT tax was very important and produced the best part of £150 million a year which was critically necessary revenue with which to run the country. It was envisaged that from 1987 the farm tax would apply to all farmers with above 80 adjusted acres and the estimated yield for 1987 was about £30 million, but the Fianna Fáil Party decided to abolish that tax.  We had envisaged that in the three to four years between 1987 and 1991 the farm tax would be extended to cover all farmers above 20 adjusted acres.  It was being brought in slowly but surely on an effective basis.</P>
    <P>We spent £4 million or £5 million setting up the farm classification office.  It was an excellent office which uncovered some very valuable information in relation to the farm structural system.  As I said already, one office found that a couple of greyhounds owned a couple of hundred acres of land and those greyhounds had very good surnames.  Other offices discovered that people who lived in towns owned land but you would not think they owned their backyards.  Slowly but surely, for the first time in the history of the State, the farm classification office was doing exceptional work which would have been tremendously valuable when considering the higher education grants in future and also to the health boards in terms of applications for medical cards. It would have been invaluable also when doing household budgets.  The information that those offices would collect would have been invaluable in future taxation profiles and the Revenue Commissioners would have had fundamental information available to them.  All the information would have been brought together by dedicated public officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> Admittedly these officers were employed on a contract basis; many of them were not employed full time in the public service.</P>
    <P>I have been very critical of the role of the Department of Finance but I know the Department worked well in bringing in the farm tax system.  They deserve credit for their efforts.  What happened? The Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil Party, to placate a few raucous farm leaders, said during the general election that they would abolish the farm tax. Have they done so?  Not yet.  We are running out of time in 1987.  The House will adjourn on 26 June or thereabouts and I suppose we will not be back until 15 October.  Will the revocation and the abolition of the land tax, the formal legislative measure, go through between now and the summer recess?  Will it go through between October and December?  It is highly unlikely.  I doubt if we would even get it through in time for the next Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, to add insult to injury, we had the High Court case in Youghal last week.  An Act of the Oireachtas relating to the health contributions of 1979 was signed and promulgated for 6 April. Deputy Haughey as Minister for Health probably inadvertently &mdash; I do not hold him responsible because it was more a departmental matter than a ministerial fault &mdash; signed the order for 4 April thus invalidating the order.  This means that any farmer can refuse to pay and once again one section of the community who can afford to pay, for all practical purposes, will not be paying a reasonable contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister for Finance, in January 1987 he mooted the possibility of a farm tax being introduced for all farmers above 20 adjusted acres on an interim basis of self-assessment.  I went along with that because I thought it was an effort to accelerate the general application of the farm tax.  That has been abolished by this Government.  The option of self-assessment for 1987 would have allowed the Government's farm tax reform programme to be implemented to <Col N="596" /> the fullest extent in 1987.  It could be argued that all farmers with the ability to pay were being brought into an effective tax system this year.  I was glad to note that the ICMSA were not particularly hostile to bringing forward the self-assessment system for the farming community and I thought that was a useful and valuable development and one which I, in Government, strongly supported. The main advantage of that option was that compliance of the farming community would be ensured and then slowly but surely the system would have gelled together.</P>
    <P>I bitterly regret that this Government have made a fundamental error which they will have great difficulty in living with particularly in urban constituencies when people point out to the Fianna Fáil Party the formal abolition of the land tax and the virtual non-replacement of any other form of taxation.  The question of accounts will be disputed and will be the subject of enormous administrative delay.  In the long run and once again we will drift into the non-collection of a reasonable contribution from the farming community.</P>
    <P>I make that point because I do not think it has dawned on the Irish body politic the extent to which there is a maltransfer of resources within the community. I will give a couple of examples. I brought in the child benefit scheme &mdash; £15.10 per child &mdash; which was a valuable innovation.  What are we doing this year? We are giving the farming community about £27 million in child benefit, a straight transfer of child benefit to the farming community.  We abolished the £100 tax allowance for PAYE workers in lieu of child benefit but we increased the children's allowance from £12 to £15. Members of the farming community benefited from that but they paid no tax. Effectively there was an additional net transfer of resources to one section of the community.  I do not think it is fully appreciated when we see cutbacks in local government, that the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land &mdash; running at about £125 million &mdash; is a very substantial <Col N="597" /> transfer of resources, and there is nothing coming back.  This is the reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the data. There is £175 million being paid by way of old age pensions and widow's pensions directly into the farming community on a non-contributory basis, and there is nothing coming back.  A farmer will hand over his farm to his son so that he will qualify for the old age pension.  Six months later he will get an old age pension for himself and his wife, if she is over 66 years of age.  He will have free travel and he can travel at his leisure because his son is working his farm, which he has been working for the past ten years.  If people realised the extent to which money is transferred from the Exchequer to the farming community there would be an uproar.  We can add to the pension free travel, free television licences and free electricity to the tune of how much? In 1986 the figure was £23.8 million.  If the Ministers have any problems with my figures, all they have to do is ask the Department of Finance for an up-date. The last date I have is 28 October 1986.</P>
    <P>I said to the previous Government, &ldquo;In the name of God, what are we doing?&rdquo; We are crucifying ourselves and this Dáil for a lousy £6.5 million raised by way of £10 outpatients' charges.  The Department of Finance go into a frenzy of public spending cutting from people who go into a hospital and all for £10 million or £12 million.  We introduce all sorts of micro cuts which amount to £6 million or £7 million.  At the same time the really big money lies untouched because politically it would be dynamite in certain constituencies to touch it whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or, in some cases, the Progressive Democrats who are involved.  Indeed, in some rural constituencies the Progressive Democrats would run a thousand miles from any effort to touch such money.</P>

      <P>That is the position.  I do not suffer in any way from chronic <Col N="598" /> urban anti-farmeritis.  Most of my relatives come from the farming community and they regard PAYE and PRSI as a kind of sick Dublin joke.  They put the creamery cheques behind the clock or, occasionally, lodge them.  Their main concern is to get to the mart on time. That is the position in regard to the two societies that exist here and it should be changed by the Government.  Money should be collected from this source and the Government should be prepared to say to the farming community that as there is massive State support for them there is no reason why they should not pay their fair share in taxation.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with another matter that irritates me profoundly.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, told us that money was flowing back into the economy.  Perhaps it is but why money flows out and money flows back into the economy is a very interesting topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Bill exerts any profound influence on this matter.  It should be noted that the commercial banking fraternity, and the building societies, make a lot of money whether we are talking about the Bank of Ireland making a profit of £105 million before tax or AIB making about £140 million before tax &mdash; in both cases one could deduct £45 million in tax.  The bank levy in the past three years has remained at £25 million although those institutions made huge profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have the squandering of money by building societies.  There is not a social democratic country in western <Col N="599" /> Europe that would tolerate the administrative expenses &mdash; they amount to people drawing fat salaries, the building of new luxury offices and putting up signs in front of them calling them building societies &mdash; being paid from our money. Money for housing, my eye.  Most of the money goes on big salaries.  It is worth noting that some of the executives of those concerns earn salaries that are three times that of a Minister or five times the salary of an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Finance.  Those executives have many other perks and we do not know the extent of them because there has never been a full scale examination of the administrative expenses of the building societies.  With due respect of the Registrar and the Department of Finance, I do not think they have time to carry out such an examination.  The Revenue Commissioners have enough to do without chasing after some of the big wheelers in the building societies.  If they did chase after them the first thing those individuals would do is hit the Fianna Fáil Party over the head with many threats, as they did with our Government.  I can recall the attitude adopted by them in regard to the Coalition.</P>
    <P>There should be full disclosure of deposits with building societies.  The only way to run the system is to stop the nonsense. If we had full disclosure I do not think there would be an extraordinary outflow of money to the Cayman Islands, to Swiss banks or across the Border to Newry.  Had the bank levy introduced in 1981 been index linked today it would be bringing in between £35 million and £40 million.  Once the banks knew the levy was indexed we would not have the perpetual pleas to abolish it.  We would not have submissions to the Minister for Finance that the levy will result in a massive reduction in banking confidence or that interest rates will rise.  We would not have the Governor of the Central Bank sending his memo to the Department of Finance asking them to get rid of the levy because it was upsetting international banking services.  Such statements are little more than a load of hooey.  It is no <Col N="600" /> different to the perpetual blandishments that go on about the payment of a reasonable level of taxation.</P>
    <P>By and large, the banking and commercial sector are a law unto themselves. I can recall the way they put the frighteners on the previous Government, particularly in regard to the collapse of ICI.  It was an eye-opener to me to see how AIB behaved on that occasion.  I was amazed to see how a major financial institution here would try to railroad a Government.  They may have railroaded some of the officials of the Department of Finance but they did not railroad the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We recovered well from that and, to his credit, the Minister for Finance in regard to the application of the retention tax on ICI handled the matter with great competence.  In my view the commercial banking sector who are doing very well and the building societies who are doing even better could well afford to make a substantial tax contribution to Exchequer resources.  That proposition merits the support of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the UK general election there has been a debate about reform of the rating system there.  They are also debating capital taxation.  It is a tragedy that taxes here on property and asset wealth have almost been abolished.  We might as well abolish them all and forget about them.  At the moment those taxes bring in about 3½ per cent of Exchequer revenue, or maybe less, and they involve a complicated process of assessment. One wonders if it is worth chasing after <Col N="601" /> that money.  When domestic rates were abolished in 1977 I had a liability of £350 for rates on my house and had we kept the rating system I have no doubt I would be paying £700 in rates annually.  I now enjoy a property which is totally free of rates.  Such a system is unique, not just in Europe, but in the world.  I well remember when I went into my first and only dwelling in 1964,23 years ago.  If the State was still receiving money from rates on property it would amount to about £700 million and the Minister for Finance would not have to indulge in making penal reductions of £40 million or £50 million in the health services.</P>
    <P>There should be a fundamental review by the Government on the question of taxation of property and asset wealth generally because this is a fundamental defect in the system which the main political parties created.  I was a Member of the House in 1977 when domestic rates were abolished and ever since, slowly but surely, the taxation system has gone askew on reform.  My proposition merits further examination because the current yield from that area is a derisory £35 million per year.  No other Minister for Finance in Europe would put up with that system.  Some of my European colleagues were aghast at the rates system in this country.  I had to explain, rather shamefacedly, that perhaps it was because we were so poor we could only afford to pay about £34 million per year.  They laughed at me as they drove around the country and saw the exceptionally fine housing stock provided mostly by a massive subsidy transfer with virtually no payment of taxation.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer briefly to the retention tax and the VHI.  When this resolution was introduced in the budget, I pointed out that the VHI were given an exemption.  I recall when I was Minister for Health that I repeatedly raised the fact that if a system of taxation of this nature was brought in, inevitably, we would have to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would get a schedule of payments made by the VHI to subscribers in respect of consultants.  There should be a fundamental new section in <Col N="602" /> the Finance Bill to ensure that such information is transferred.  When I tried to get such information on a direct basis, as Minister for Health, I was told by the VHI that under the 1957 Act I had no entitlement to it.  I relayed this back to the Government who set up an informal inter-departmental working group.  The view of officials of the Department of Health was that the Minister for Finance should include a section in this year's Finance Bill to ensure that the VHI gave that information to the Revenue Commissioners. We are talking about an income of £30 million and even with a 35 per cent tax rate you are still talking about £8 million or £10 million.  There is no reason not to bring in that reform because if nothing is done all hell will break loose.  For example, an ordinary doctor will get his GMS payment cheque at the end of June and instead of the £3,000 he expects he will get £2,000 because of the 35 per cent clawback.  Simultaneously, the VHI will be paying out cheques to subscribers.  Admittedly, the subscriber need not pay the consultant. That is the problem but it can be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not deal with it when he was Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The subscriber could go on a holiday with the cheque and indeed some of them do but the information is available on the computer of the VHI relating to the consultant.  If the consultant has received £800 for a cardiac bypass or £300 for administering an anaesthetic that information is on the computer and it can be given to the Revenue Commissioners in confidence.  The Revenue Commissioners can quite easily say to the consultant they have reason to believe he received £60,000 last year from the VHI on top of his common contract of £34,000 or £35,000 and that they intend to treat it as an income.  If the consultant says he did not receive that amount he should be required to produce evidence to that effect.  However, it would at least mean that the Revenue Commissioners could keep a tab on the consultants.  It is <Col N="603" /> manifestly wrong to impose a retention tax on GMS payments for GPs without bringing them into the system.</P>
      <P>The State, for example, provides for VHI tax relief on medical insurance to the tune of £30 million.  If you are in the VHI you get tax relief at the top rate.  I am not anti-consultant; many of them work very hard and their life span, in terms of their skill, is relatively short. Most of them are dedicated public servants who work extremely hard and with great diligence for their public patients. They also have private practices and there is nothing wrong with people paying tax on their income from private practice. Many consultants fully declare their income and pay taxes but some do not. If we protest that we are reforming the financial system we must do so without selectivity or fear or favour for people in certain circumstances.  That is necessary and fundamental to reform of the system. I urge the Minister to bring in an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that that particular system is brought into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Another fundamental criticism which I have to make of the system is its ongoing failure &mdash; this brings up the question of the way in which the Government are administering the system &mdash; to match revenue records with social welfare records. It is a scandal that the administrative system has failed to bring about that match.  Let me give one example which will shake the House.  I remember pointing out to the previous Government around 20 Deireadh Fómhair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there was a major gap between income tax records which cover 350,000 tax paying families and social welfare children's allowance records which cover 480,000 recipients. There is a black hole and it is a huge one. There has been a failure to match social welfare records with income tax records. That is not the fault of the administrators <Col N="604" /> but of the politicians.  Ministers for Finance chase three-legged rabbits of £2 million or £3 million public expenditure while the big stuff flies by right over their heads.  They have no time to sit back as they have to do their constituency work in order to get themselves re-elected.  All Ministers for Finance suffer incredible odium, no matter who they are.  Therefore, they have to keep in touch with their constituencies in order to ensure that they get re-elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are aware income tax records are set up on the basis of a husband's RSI number whereas the social welfare and children's allowance file is set up on the basis of claims made by wives.  Apparently, as of yet there is no common characteristic which permits the information on the children's allowance file to be associated with the corresponding information on the revenue file.  One or two fine officials have now gone into the private sector and one former assistant secretary in the Department of Finance who transferred to the Department of Social Welfare was particularly preoccupied with this terrible gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of work was done in the Department of Social Welfare in matching child benefit records against the Department's central records file in order to pick up the RSI numbers. When some trial runs were carried out some alarming information was shown up as the Department of Finance well know. I urge the Minister to dig out the memoranda from which he will have little difficulty in seeing that a black economy has resulted from RSI numbers not being matched to children's allowances/child benefits.  As a result, the taxing of short-term social welfare benefits, particularly disability benefit, which is a policy with which I concur, cannot be done.  There has been one interdepartmental working group after another and I was involved in establishing one in December 1985 which reported in the same month.  It was estimated that the optimum full year <Col N="605" /> yield from the taxing of short term benefits would be about £70 million.  Twenty seven million could be raised from unemployment benefit but that figure would now have decreased as a result of the cuts in pay-related benefit which are now in operation.  If disability benefit was regarded as taxable income the best part of £40 million could be brought into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A contributory old age pension or a retirement pension is taxable.  A widow's pension or a widow's contributory pension is taxable.  Deserted wife's benefit is taxable.  An invalidity pension is taxable. The orphan's contributory allowance is taxable and, as we know, all of the others are means tested, yet disability benefit is not subject to tax.  There are people who go on a roller coaster through the system. That is one anomaly which I desperately tried to take out of the system but I failed as you cannot match the revenue frame with the social welfare frame.  I do not blame the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners, I blame us politicians as we have not knocked our heads together for eight or nine years or taken the system by the scruff of the neck.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the fundamental thesis at this point to say that the Minister for Finance and the current Government structures cannot deliver.  The Minister for Finance has to do everything.  He screams at the Revenue Commissioners to keep up buoyancy and he is being pestered by the major companies who owe a stack in tax to see if he can do something about it.  He is besieged by Deputies who want all kinds of routine supplications answered and as a result he falls between all of the stools.  He has to attend every Government meeting and he has to represent the country abroad at meetings of the IMF, the World Bank and the devil knows what.  He must attend these meetings because if he does not do so the Opposition will crucify him. Therefore, he ends up flying Concorde to and fro dragging the unfortunate secretary of his Department with him who writes his scripts on the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the end, the Minister for Finance falls disastrously between the stools.  When it is suggested that a senior Government Minister should be responsible for revenue, which I have suggested previously, who might be called a Minister for Taxation or a Minister for Revenue Collection there is an aghast silence in the Department of Finance.  There are cries of &ldquo;our empire is going to be trembled. It is bad enough having one Minister but now we could have two and they would end up fighting with each other and we would have different divisions.&rdquo; The Revenue Commissioners lapsed back into sullen disapproval with chants of &ldquo;here we go again&rdquo;.  The memoranda and aide memoires started flying again in order to stop this lunatic proposal.  They had one Minister for Finance whom they could control and if they kept him busy with memoranda eventually he would either go away or he would get so worked up that he would just disappear and not bother them too much.  In any event, the secretary would eventually end up in the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>That is what is happening.  There is no innovation and no fundamental reform. Even the Taoiseach will get more and more edgy.  I think he will start to shout one of these days.  I will not blame him as he suffers from the generation problem which I and most politicians over fifty also suffer from.  We think we can do everything ourselves.  We cannot delegate as we have never been trained to do so.  We are very bad administrators. The Taoiseach, like most Taoisigh, thinks he can do everything and in the end very little is done and at the end of four years in office all there is to show is three and a half tons of paper.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I come back to the fundamental proposition that there should be a restructuring of Government which would involve those unfortunate altar boys, the Ministers of State.  I was one of them and had an enchanting eight months with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.  It was an extraordinary experience and I enjoyed enormously working with him, even on the budget which blew up in our faces in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> However, it is a joke.  We have 15 Ministers of State and by and large the most important thing is to make sure that a Minister of State never gets your Cabinet papers.  If he did you would never know what might happen; he might tell somebody else in the party and if somebody else in the party found out what was really going on in Cabinet everybody would get terribly edgy.  It is important to keep the Ministers of State six or seven miles out there and get them to do as many functions as possible.</P>

The Minister must ensure that Ministers of State do not exceed their mileage and cause a bit of a problem for the party or for the Government. Frankly, I would take three or four Ministers of State by the scruff of the neck and send them to the Revenue Commissioners to do a bit of work.  Have we thought of a Minister of State specialising in VAT collection, for example?  He should sit in the office where perhaps the union might feel he should not be.  Get somebody else to specialise in capital taxation and get the money in.  The politicians of the day crucify themselves on public expenditure questions and simultaneously are supplicants to the Revenue Commissioners.  I well remember them saying to us that we were going to be short £180 million at the end of 1986. There is not a Minister for Finance who does not prepare a budget trends report around May or June and says &ldquo;Tell them revenue will be short £200 million.  We will never get any cuts unless you really lay it on.&rdquo;  At the end of the year you are short £70 million or £80 million.</P>

      <P>If Ministers of State <Col N="608" /> were involved in the public expenditure decisions and, above all else, in revenue collection, we might have a better system of administration.  I feel sorry for the Ministers of State; I felt sorry for myself as one.  Apart from indulging in forays in respect of Knock Airport and a few such matters, I did not manage to become involved in the system.  One's prospects of involvement are always better in a monolithic party.  When people are reluctant to become involved, then the situation is quite different.</P>
      <P>I make a plea direct to the Minister regarding the taxation system on the revenue side which has become quite unacceptable. It is absolutely imperative to reform the structure as a matter of the utmost urgency.  In that respect, the use of the junior Ministers would be of enormous value.  I say that because the Fifth Report from the Commission on Taxation found that the administration of taxation has virtually broken down.  That report contained many recommendations for change, a number of which were implemented.  There was very exceptional work done by the previous administration in bringing in reforms on tax avoidance and tax evasion.  I stand over that valuable work.  However, we still have a long way to go before the fundamental reforms of structural Government are introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are not afraid to say to the Irish people that they must collect revenue from the citizenry at large for essential social welfare and public services. We have never been afraid to advance that fundamental thesis.  That question is now before the Irish people in a very stark way, particularly in relation to the health services.  I find it extraordinary that 4,500 to 5,000 people lost their jobs &mdash; about 1,200 in local government.  There are 2,000 jobs gone in the non-filling of vacancies in the health services and about another 2,000 temporary staff have been declared redundant. Did anyone suggest a 1 per cent solidarity levy to protect those jobs?  No; nobody cared.  My trade union colleagues occupied themselves with the prospect of <Col N="609" /> a private deal with the Taoiseach, possibly in Dundalk, for 3 per cent in 1988 of a public service pay increase but at what cost?  Five thousand fellow public servants in the Civil Service, in the health boards, in the voluntary hospitals, in the local authorities lost their jobs.  If it is your unemployment, that is your problem. If it is my salary, that is my privilege; that is my right.  I take a fairly jaundiced view of what happened in that regard.  I take a somewhat cynical view of some of the selectivity that has gone on in relation to some of the protests.  It will be very interesting at the end of the day to see if we have this national accord, with such a manifest loving going on in certain circles at the moment.  It will be very interesting to see if anything much will come from it.</P>
    <P>I remember arguing in Government about a solidarity levy of 2 per cent.  I said I was prepared to pay 2 per cent out of my public service income &mdash; and I had no other &mdash; in order to conserve £60 million, so that we would keep jobs. Admittedly, we would all have a slightly lower income but other people would have their jobs.  We would contain the public service and would not have the present mayhem.  That is a possibility but it requires courage, particularly on the part of my trade union colleagues in the public sector.  It is not a question of advocating a cheap labour policy.  I have often asked people if they want to preserve their pension and their permanent status and the job of the woman down the road who is a nurse and whose husband is unemployed with no prospects of employment.  I have asked would they care a thought for her losing her job but I have often been met by a blank stare while another pint is ordered.</P>
    <P>If somebody walked into the Dáil and suggested that to keep the essential public services going we add another 2p to the price of the pint and another 4p on the pack of cigarettes, I would have no objection. These three price increases could bring in between £28 million and £30 million in revenue.  That would keep the public services going for another year until next year's budget so that we can <Col N="610" /> keep the current budget deficit down to 6.9 per cent.  I have no objection to paying these increases.  If the Minister for Finance comes into the House and says he is going to increase health contributions from 1¼ per cent to 1½ per cent so that he can get another £11 million from that I am quite willing to pay this increase because we must pay for what we consume on the public services side.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1981 when I put down six amendments to the Finance Bill all hell broke loose but I do not think he will lose his Finance Bill this year.</P>
    <P>I met consultants, architects, engineers and quantity surveyors and I had it hot and heavy with them over the retention tax.  I told them that if, as principals of their companies, they were paying their full updated PAYE on the full current PAYE schedule and A1 rates of PRSI and if they had tax clearance certificates, I would not mind saying to the Minister for Finance why not consider an exemption in respect of the professionals on the construction side.  I would not be unduly worried about not giving an exemption to barristers, solicitors, GMS doctors, estate agents, auctioneers or the other professionals who have got together in the inter-professional group.  There is a case to be made for an exemption in the case of the construction industry that has been hit very hard in the budget.  The professionals in that industry are in a state of shock at present.  If those professionals and their employees are on current PRSI and PAYE contributions and have tax clearance certificates perhaps they should get an exemption.</P>
    <P>I do not know what this exemption would cost because I have not broken down the segments of it.  Relatively speaking, it probably would not cost a great deal, perhaps £4 million, £5 million or £6 million.  It is a point which the Minister might consider.  Of course, he is faced with the problem that all the other professionals will descend on him like locusts demanding exemptions.  If the Minister decides to bring in an alternative measure to match up the revenue I have no objection to this because this country <Col N="611" /> cannot afford to have reliefs brought in all over the place and, at the same time, lose essential revenue.</P>
    <P>I look forward to having an interesting discussion with the Minister on Committee Stage in relation to the points I have made.  I regret delaying him excessively this morning but, as he and his colleagues know, it is the occupational disease of politicians, particularly when they are in Opposition and do not have prepared scripts never to stop talking.  I hope I have put out a few pointers and highlighted the areas where we can get to grips with the appalling problem of restoring the public finances to some order, maintaining essential national confidence and, at the same time, maintaining vital public services which so many people would decimate for entirely the wrong reasons and which must be protected by all of us in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Desmond for his very constructive and interesting contribution which was designed to be helpful.  Many of the thoughts expressed by him will be translated into action by the Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The matter of the efficient and equitable collection of taxation over a broad area which are two difficult criteria to square, is a fundamental aspect of Government policy.  In relation to confidence, Deputy Desmond referred to the reasons why money came and went.  Confidence is a psychological area that affects money both in terms of outflows, inflows and in particular in respect of investment. That confidence, that psychological factor which affects the flow of money, depends largely on political stability and on an appreciation on the part of investors in regard to the political stability of the Government and administration in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became evident during the last 18 months the previous Government were in power that there was not a steady hand on the tiller, to use a nautical phrase. That directly resulted in a perception on <Col N="612" /> the part of investors that this country was not being run properly and was not a safe place for investment.  This was the psychological spur to the outflows of money that occurred during the last 18 months of the Coalition Government.  No one can deny that.  This Government have sought to re-establish that confidence in our economy, to put the public finances into order and to restore the level of investment and to target it to rapidly increase the level of investment to deal with the fundamental underlying problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is designed to implement the budget and the purpose of the 1987 budget is to lay the foundations to ensure that national recovery can take place.  The Government have clearly spelled out in their Programme for National Recovery that the first requirement is to secure the base of the economy by getting order and balance into the public finances, and then to undertake and implement a series of measures which will restore confidence and stimulate investment, economic growth and employment as a consequence.  The objective of getting order and balance into the public finances is vital to national economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The absence in recent years of effective policies makes our task more urgent now because of the size of the increase in the number of unemployed which has become a serious social evil and the doubling of the size of the national debt which occurred during this period.  This Government have clearly seen and understood the implications of the situation. We are prepared to confront this and are determined to see that Estimates for every area of public expenditure are examined rigorously and in detail and cut back to an irreducible minimum.  Public expenditure last year was 56.2 per cent of GNP.  As a result of the present budget, it will be reduced to 55 per cent of GNP in 1987 and this will be a good and proper start to a process which we mean to continue.</P>
    <P>This process will lead to a restoration of confidence in the economy by both domestic and foreign investors.  It will <Col N="613" /> lead to the maintenance of stability for our currency, to the reversal of the outward flow of money and to the further reduction of interest rates from their present high levels.  It is essential in order to stimulate the investment process. There are already clear signs in that the process is starting to work to good effect. When it is fully under way it will allow growth and development to take place on a solid basis in contrast to the stark and unacceptable alternative of increasing our present burdens and thus jeopardising our children's future.</P>
    <P>The restoration of confidence will in addition allow us to capitalise on our present low inflation rate, to maintain the competitiveness of our exports and build on the benefits accruing from the current reduction in the external deficit.  Deputies will recall that our trade balance has been moving into increasing surplus. Facing now as we are into the completion of the internal market in the European Community by 1992, with all the potential that that prospect holds for us, it is all the more important that the state of our economy allows us to take full benefit from it.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the importance of the export sector to national recovery. Exports already provide nearly 50p out of every pound of our GDP &mdash; one of the highest ratios in the developed world. Two out of every three Irish jobs are dependent, to one degree or another, on exports.  Since 1973, 80,000 jobs have been created here by foreign investment in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>To underline the significance of exports to the European Community I would like to compare our trade statistics with other EC countries for the first four months of this year and last year.  Last year in the period January to April we imported £2 billion worth of goods; this year the amount of imports was reduced by £100 million to £1.9 billion.  In contrast, our exports to the European Community from January to April 1986 were worth £2.1 billion whereas the figures for the comparable period in 1987 have moved forward to £2.3 billion, thus increasing even more our surplus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> This is a most welcome trend and I hope it will aid in demonstrating not only the potential but the actual existence of growth when the underlying mechanisms are favourable and in good working order.  In a climate where despondency is reluctant to release its hold and where many people refuse to believe that improvements can and will take place, I believe it is important to note this particular positive element.</P>
    <P>The Programme for National Recovery does not stop at outlining the basic necessary framework.  It goes on to demonstrate and enumerate the areas where there is scope for growth and development. I would like to dwell for a moment on one area which has important beneficial side effects, through constructive linkage with several of the other fields; I am referring to the services area.</P>
    <P>Services have taken on growing importance in the economy in recent years.  They now employ twice as many people as are employed in manufacturing industry.  This is the sign of a growing sophisticated society.  Their potential in the export area is becoming increasingly evident.  A number of Irish semi-State bodies and companies have already established a presence abroad, in both developed and developing countries, and are selling expertise in a variety of areas, including management, public utilities, training for technicians and skilled workers, health and environmental services, and consultancies in engineering and physical development.</P>
    <P>The export of these services is clearly beneficial in terms of the return to our economy, whether this be direct from the country concerned or from an international agency such as the European Development Fund or the World Bank. Irish companies and semi-State bodies are able to gain a foothold in foreign markets and also to build up a reputation with the international agencies which will put them in a position to compete for future contracts.  The raw material &mdash; if I may describe it as such &mdash; which we put into this area is what we have in greatest abundance &mdash; our skilled youth and manpower. The provisions of the Bill are <Col N="615" /> calculated to encourage Irish people to become active in this area by enabling them to remit their income home under favourable conditions.  This is a unique provision in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>An area of service which is of particular interest is tourism.  We have suffered both as a result of two bad summers and of events on the world scene, beyond our control, which affected traditional tourist flows to Europe.  Even though our exports of manufactured goods exceeded our imports in value this year and last year, the balance of payments in both years has been unfavourable, to a considerable extent because spending by Irish people on holidays abroad exceeded tourism income here.  This is a situation which gives cause for concern but is also one which is within our power to rectify, through an active campaign aimed at improving our tourist attractions and amenities, making ourselves competitive in terms of price and promoting Ireland more effectively as a tourist destination. The provisions of the Finance Bill and the guidelines laid down in the Programme for National Recovery address the need to improve our record of recent years in tourism, put in place incentives which will enable people in the tourism industry to offer attractive conditions and facilities and exploit the undoubted potential which Ireland has in this regard. The recent package in regard to air and sea fares is part of this overall package to further develop Ireland as an attractive tourist destination for the current season and for future seasons, because it is in the area of reducing costs into this country that we can get a more effective return.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Financial Services Centre in Dublin is already well under way.  The potential which we have for an enterprise of this kind is clear &mdash; our young, highly educated, computer-literate work force with a degree and range of skills which compare favourably with those of people in established centres of internationally traded financial services.  Utilising the basic brains and skills that are so predominant in a young <Col N="616" /> population to a higher degree than in any other western European area, although it poses problems and challenges, also gives us a decided advantage in an area such as this.  Our location in proximity to major European centres and between the financial markets of the Far East and the US will also work to our advantage.  It is the Government's policy to provide the best available facilities in terms of infrastructure, accommodation and communications for further development in this area.  We already have a well developed computer and software sector. Living standards, amenities and accommodation costs make Dublin attractive by comparison with other European locations.  Finally, the incentives provided for in the Bill will constitute a persuasive argument for multinational banks and corporations active in the financial services area to locate here as their base of operations.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier the Government's determination to confront the problem of the public finances and to control the costs of the public sector.  Most public attention has focused on the Government's attempts to reduce expenditure in the health sector but to do so is to miss the essential point.  This is something which is taking place in every possible area of the public finances.  It must be re-emphasised that the record level of services provided through the public sector was based on unsustainable levels of borrowing which were snowballing out of control.  That arose out of the very political nature of the last Government, where there was a constant tug of war between the two parties in Government in continual conflict over expenditure and cutting expenditure. That constant tug-of-war during a number of years eventually spelled out in very great detail why the last Government failed to secure re-election, because the inherent conflict gave rise to a no policy in terms of collective responsibility. That lack of firmness of purpose was appreciated and seen by the electorate, and the main reason the electorate decided in the last election to reject the outgoing Government was precisely the <Col N="617" /> absence of any sense of cohesion or collective will on the part of that Government to deal basically with the financial management of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government when they came in were faced with two options: either to introduce remedial action which, while regrettable in a more ideal context, is absolutely indispensable in the present reality, or to ignore the problem which had been ignored for some years because of the inherent instability or tug-of-war between the two parties constituting the last Government.  To take the latter course of ignoring the problem would clearly involve more painful and harmful consequences in the long run, harmful in both the national sense and the personal sense of doing untold hardship not just for one year but for a number of years and possibly for a generation.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the problem will be right across the full spectrum of the public service, and that has been our approach in introducing the budget and this Finance Bill and will be our approach to the management of the public finances and the administration of the country in the years ahead.  Each area of activity will be scrutinised to see if its continuation is necessary.  Where it is not, the required action will be taken on a collective basis by Ministers who participate in collective Government decisions.  Overlaps or duplications will be abolished and necessary redeployment will be implemented so that the final result will be a more rational and efficient use of our limited resources.</P>
    <P>I mention by way of illustration that in so far as my Department are concerned during the past four years staff numbers have been cut by 10 per cent at headquarters, and this is in the context of the overall budget for Foreign Affairs of less than half of 1 per cent of the total expenditure of Government Departments. Other areas where further cuts may be made are being examined with a view to planning the necessary expenditure cuts for 1988 and 1989.  Every Government Department are at present working along those lines.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise the Government's <Col N="618" /> awareness of the extent to which control of health expenditure affects every member of our society because of the escalating bill, overruns and overdrafts involved in expenditure by the various regional authorities.  The Government are very aware of the special concerns that exist in relation to the very young and the elderly and are determined to make every effort to shield the more vulnerable groups in our society to the maximum extent possible within our framework of having realistic expenditure in regard to health, hospital and medical services generally.</P>
    <P>Irish health services have seen a major expansion and modernisation since 1970. Total numbers employed in the health services have increased by 10,000 since 1976.  I need hardly remind Deputies of how favourably Irish expenditure on the health services sector compares with a number of European countries whose basic financial capacity to provide such services far exceeds our own capacity in this respect.  I must point out that even when present Government targets and reductions of expenditure are achieved in this area, the percentage of GNP which will continue to be spent on health will still be very significant, for instance larger than amounts spent by some of our bigger and wealthier neighbours.  Indeed, even in spite of the painful adjustments we are making in the health services this year, the Government are increasing expenditure on health from £1.298 billion in 1986 to £1.315 billion in 1987.  That is allowing for the adjustments in regard to what have become known euphemistically as cuts.  Making allowance for that, the expenditure on health has increased &mdash; I repeat the figures &mdash; from £1.298 billion in 1986 to £1.315 billion in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern that has been expressed about the adjustments which have been found necessary in various areas funded by public expenditure.  I can assure Deputies that no Government like cutting back on services provided for the public.  Obviously, we are doing this because it has to be done.  We feel obliged to do so now because we accept the <Col N="619" /> reality of the current economic and financial situation.  We realise that the exigencies of that economic and financial situation which we face are such that we can deal with the problem only by restoring balance in the public finances and safeguarding our prospects for growth in future.  By restoring balance in the public finances one can proceed to where there will be inflows of capital instead of outflows and then to where interest rates will fall and where there will be stimulation of domestic and foreign investment here.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the contribution which increased exports of goods and services can make to the process of recovery and growth.  Indeed, this country is and must be an international trading country. Any future investment designed to deal with our unemployment problem must be in export-led industry because there is no scope within our small market for the intensification of investment based on the home market.  We have long passed that point.  Therefore, growth must be export-led, and that emphasises the importance of our continuing involvement within the EC without which such growth would not be possible, and of providing Ireland as a location for the increased investment that can participate in a market of 320 million people that will be a free internal market totally without restriction or prohibition by 1992.</P>
    <P>I find it incredible that anyone would gainsay or deny the fundamental fact that as an exporting country, we are dependent on exports and on employment for growth.  We have to be involved in a Community of that kind, of which we have been a member now for 15 years. Within that Community we can publicise the advantages of Ireland as a location, particularly to third countries, to utilise Ireland as an operational base for manufacturing services to be provided within that expanding Community in the years ahead.  It is on the basis of the exports of goods and services, provided by capital from home and abroad and based on a solid foundation of confidence that we must make the progress so urgently <Col N="620" /> required in the Ireland of today.  The two dimensions, balance in public finances and promotion of enterprise, are not contradictory but complementary facets of a single process which, if carried through with determination, will restore balance and confidence in the economy and secure the future for all our people, in particular that of the new generation we have educated and trained here &mdash; through an excellent system of education and training &mdash; providing the necessary outlets for them in the Ireland of the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill we are debating is significant in what it does not contain.  For the first time in many years the Minister for Finance has come to the House with a Finance Bill containing no concession whatsoever for the PAYE sector.  There is not so much even as a token nod in the direction of a fair and equitable tax system.  It should be remembered that the main purpose of a Finance Bill is to set out the taxation strategy and system.  As in so many other areas since Fianna Fáil came into Government, their pre-election pledges on taxation have been cast aside and the electorate treated with some contempt because a fair and equitable tax system constituted one of the fundamental parts of their manifesto.  Their manifesto described a fair and equitable tax system as of paramount importance but that will become an even more distant prospect if this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach speaking in the budget debate of 5 February 1986 said that the then existing levels of taxation, particularly personal taxation were in very large measure responsible for the prevailing mood of frustration, low morale and lack of confidence.  The Bill before us will increase the level of personal taxation &mdash; income tax on the PAYE sector &mdash; by approximately £300 million.  Presumably the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance accept that this will increase the prevailing mood of frustration, low morale and lack of confidence.  That is precisely what it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill probably constitutes <Col N="621" /> the greatest setback to the campaign for tax equity since the famous tax marches of 1979 and 1980 which, surprisingly, were referred to by Deputy McDowell of the PDs, when three quarters of a million people came on the streets throughout the country on a certain day early in 1980 demanding justice in the tax area.  From all those tax marches, all the wrath about the inequitable taxation system at that time, the only real achievement was the establishment of the Commission on Taxation which produced five separate reports over the following five or six years.  Those reports contained various recommendations, many of which we would agree with and others with which we would not agree.  Nevertheless they have been set out for Government.  I do not know whether successive Ministers for Finance have even read them.  Certainly the political will to deal with the problem of inequity in the taxation system did not exist in the lifetime of the last Government despite Deputy Desmond's references to the problems.  I do not know whether he raised all those issues at Cabinet level in the previous Government but certainly they were not dealt with.</P>
    <P>This, the first Finance Bill of this Government, indicates that they will not deal with the political problems, the real problems arising for Government in implementing a fair and equitable tax system; in other words, hit the people with the money, hit them where it hurts. Successive Governments have refused to do that.  Since the seventies successive Governments have misled the PAYE sector in their talk of their commitment to genuine tax reform.  This Government are no exception.  In the course of the general election, the subsequent budget and Finance Bill, this Government have confirmed, in a painful way, to workers that parties of the right will not deliver a fair deal for the majority of our taxpayers. There is nothing whatsoever for the PAYE sector in this Finance Bill. Section after section contains concessions of a major or minor nature to farmers, businessmen, traders and industrialists. There is no concession whatsoever to <Col N="622" /> workers and their families who pay the bulk of taxation.  A reading of this Bill would lead one to believe there was nothing fundamentally wrong with our taxation system, that all that was required was a minor adjustment here or there, a slight shift in this or that provision.  Of course the reality is very different.</P>
    <P>In 1979 when the tax marches to which I referred took place PAYE workers paid 87 per cent of all income tax, the balance of 13 per cent being paid by the self-employed and farmers.  That was very bad and people marched in their hundreds of thousands because of that inequity.  Yet, in 1986, the proportion was much worse.  Last year the PAYE sector paid 90.3 per cent of all income tax, with 9.7 per cent only of all income tax being paid by the self-employed and farmers, a much worse situation than had obtained when those tax marches took place in 1979 and 1980.  This year the burden on the PAYE sector will be even greater because the provisions of this Finance Bill do not tackle the inequitous position of the PAYE sector.  This year they will pay an extra £300 million because of the refusal to ensure indexation in the provisions of this Bill.  On average the PAYE worker pays 50 per cent more tax than the self-employed, three times more than the large farmer because they are the large farmers only who have been assessed and taxed.  It should be remembered that the amount the large farmers pay constitutes one-third only that of the average PAYE worker.  Rates on agricultural land raised £36 million in 1979.  In that year, when all those tax marches took place, farmers paid £36 million in rates and £16 million in income tax, making a total of £52 million. In 1986 farmers paid only £33 million altogether in income tax and they paid no rates.  The total tax collected from farmers has dropped from £52 million in 1979 to £33 million in 1986.  Allowing for inflation the difference would seem to be far greater.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know the actual number of farmers in the country.  There are figures for landholders and so on but there are at least 130,000 farmers.  Some <Col N="623" /> figures are as high as 150,000, 160,000 or 180,000 with land holdings of three acres and five acres.  If we take the figure of 130,000, only 17,500 of those paid any tax in 1984-85.  In that year 80,000 farmers were not even asked to fill in a tax form to find out whether their incomes were taxable.  The IFA cry about the Government asking small farmers to pay tax but nobody is asking them to do so. They were not even sent a tax form.  It is the big farmers in the IFA who are using the small boys as their argument for not paying any taxes.</P>
    <P>The position of the Government in bowing to the needs of the IFA is absolutely reprehensible.  They said they intend to abolish land tax and that is riling PAYE workers even more.  They see that their share of tax is being increased but land tax, which they thought was beginning to tackle the problem of getting a fair share of tax from farmers, is about to be abolished.  The Workers' Party always believed that the land tax would not only help to ensure a fairer return from the farming sector but would also encourage the more efficient use of agricultural land which is our greatest natural resource. Deputy Barry Desmond drew attention to the fact that we are unique in the world in not having property taxes on houses. There is no property tax on land either. A person can own as much land as he likes and will not have to pay tax on it.</P>
    <P>The Farm Tax Bill, 1985, was a weak measure and its shortcomings were compounded by the failure of the Coalition Government to ensure that farm holdings were properly assessed for liability.  As a result, the return from the land tax was even smaller than it should have been. Deputy Desmond said today that the Farm Tax Bill which the Coalition introduced should have brought in £30 million this year.  I would be surprised, if the Coalition were still in power, if they intended to raise £30 million from the land tax.  That figure would be seen as a reasonable sum.  As farmers paid £36 million in rates in 1979 it would not be unreasonable to take £30 million from them in land tax nearly ten years later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> To abolish the land tax would be a great step backwards.  It would increase urban-rural confrontation particularly as there seems to be no effort as yet to put an income tax system in place which would ensure that all farmers pay their fair share.  There were many indications that the land tax was acceptable to many farmers.  A number of them came out against the IFA and said, &ldquo;Yes, give us a land tax.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil capitulated to the big farmers at the top who do not want to pay any taxes whatsoever.  Not alone will they not pay land tax or income tax but they will not pay health contributions and they will demand and get their health service even though they do not pay any taxes for it.  The poor suckers pay the tax to provide all the facilities and services.  The big farmers who can well afford it want to avail of everything and to pay nothing.  They want to make sure that all their family get third level education as is their right.  The family of the ordinary worker will never receive third level education and many of them will not even get second level education. That is the next area that will be hit, as we will see in September.  At present the health cuts are taking the headlines but when people in the autumn discover what is happening in schools, education will then take the headlines.  Free education is now a thing of the past and even primary education is not free anymore.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the other sectors is just as bad.  Business tax reliefs cost more than £800 million in 1985-86. The real yield from capital tax is down once again and has been going down consistently since 1974.  The black economy has increased massively since 1979.  It is now up to £1,500 million per annum which would result in a tax loss of about £600 million per annum to the Exchequer.  Over £700 million in collectable taxes is legally due.  All the processes have been gone through but this tax is still unpaid.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister for Finance when he said in his speech, when referring to tax evasion: &ldquo;There is considerable misunderstanding about the true situation and some of the <Col N="625" /> figures mentioned about arrears are wild exaggerations&rdquo;.  He said there is considerable misunderstanding about the true situation but why did he not tell us what the true situation is, as he sees it? What figures are wild exaggerations?  It is very difficult to get figures.  The Comptroller and Auditor General who has reviewed the whole situation has possibly seen that hundreds of millions of pounds have not yet been properly assessed but would have been assessed if sufficient staff was available.  He gave the figure of £700 million which is legally due and is collectable but as yet it has not been paid even though all the processes have been gone through.  Of that £700 million, £140 million is made up of PAYE and PRSI which is taken from workers by firms, held by them and not paid over to the Government.  That is highway robbery. It is pure, unadulterated theft. These firms have stolen the money from the Exchequer.  They take the money from the workers and do not hand it over to the Government but yet they are not prosecuted, they are not seen as criminals, they are not put in jail and the money is not collected from them.  The Minister then says that the whole matter is exaggerated and it is a gross misrepresentation to suggest that problems can be solved and the tax burden reduced significantly if all the arrears are duly collected.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it might be a gross misrepresentation to say that but it is not a gross misrepresentation to say if these taxes were collected the Minister for Health would not have the problems which he now has.  If one-seventh of those taxes, £100 million of the £700 million, was collected the Minister for Health would not have to close hospitals.  If another one-seventh was collected the Minister for Education would not have any problems.  If the Minister for Finance is doing his job he could be of great assistance to these other ministries.  His attitude yesterday was most disappointing to say the least.  When talking about tax collection, he said &ldquo;... it must be acknowledged that uncollected tax is a serious problem and any tax reform <Col N="626" /> package must incorporate measures to improve collection.  Significant progress has been made in this respect in recent years.&rdquo;  That is the reverse of the truth. We have moved backwards in recent years.  Significant progress has not been made.  I do not know where the Minister got this information or how he could make a statement that &ldquo;significant progress has been made in this respect in recent years&rdquo; when all the evidence shows that things are getting worse.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago we discovered that VAT bills outstanding for more than three years were being written off.  The Minister did not say if that directive from the top had been quashed and it is time he told us if it was.  He should assure us that VAT bills of three years or more, or ten years or more for that matter, will be pursued because if a PAYE worker owes tax, he will be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners who can go back as far as his first day at work if they wish.  How the Minister can say that progress is being made while at the same time, VAT bills outstanding for three years or more are not being collected is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>There has been no real attempt to stamp out tax evasion because the number working in the Revenue Commissioners is insufficient to deal with the problem which is getting worse by the day.  Anti evasion legislation was introduced but it was not used.  The tax collection system is in a shambles and many people are saying this daily.  Ninety-five per cent of all returns from the self-employed are accepted without question under a Revenue Commissioners pilot scheme.  The tax commission estimated that the chances of being caught evading taxes were 100 to 1; in other words, the chances of being caught today are slimmer than ever before, in spite of the Minister saying great progress has been made and even on those rare occasions when people are brought to court, the fines imposed are often derisory.  The average fine in 1984 was £424.  Even then, penalties were imposed in a little over a quarter of the cases.  In other words, no fines were imposed on three-quarters of the cases brought to court and in those <Col N="627" /> cases where a fine was imposed, the average was £424.  That is not tackling tax evasion.  The only cases brought to court have been lying there for years but in present circumstances a case has to be really bad before it is brought to court. Even then, the odds are three to one that the person will get off without a fine.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill before us fails to address these issues and should, therefore, be rejected by the Dáil.  The only really new element in this year's Finance Bill is the provision in Chapter III which provides for the deduction at source of tax at a rate of 35 per cent for payments for professional services made to individuals and companies mainly in relation to services provided for Government and other public bodies.  In the debate on the financial resolutions on budget day, The Workers' Party speakers welcomed the principle of the move pointing out that it was not a new tax but simply a method of bringing forward the collection of tax which would be due anyway.</P>
    <P>I am sure most Deputies, like ourselves, have been the subject of some very intensive and professional lobbying from groups and individuals on the subject of the withholding tax.  I would like to read from one of these letters which shows that many of these groups accept the principle and purpose of this tax. This letter points out that it appeared the intention of the proposed legislation was to effectively deduct tax at source from self-employed professionals, mainly doctors, barristers, self-employed engineers and architects, whose tax settlement is invariably in arrears of the income received.  They went on to say that in this respect the intention was not only understandable but it was indeed to be commended.  In other words, it is accepted and understood that the principle and purpose of this tax is correct. This letter went on to say that the situation in consulting engineering companies was fundamentally different &mdash; I do not understand how it is fundamentally different but they say it is &mdash; and that it will create great problems. They accept the principle of the tax but <Col N="628" /> they end by stressing they have no objection to the principle of introducing tax equity in relation to the self-employed professionals.  There is no reason why they should not pay as they earn like the PAYE worker.  We accept that but we also accept that the manner of its implementation may in some cases produce difficulties and problems for those affected.  In particular we urge the Minister to ensure that the manner of its implementation does not threaten jobs in small firms which are particularly dependent on fees from public bodies.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that the PAYE system produces great difficulties and hardship for workers and their families but we do not have any professional groups lobbying on their behalf.  It also has to be said that there are fairly generous provisions in this Bill for interim refunds to alleviate hardship in cases where a substantial proportion of the fees in question is paid out to meet the expenses of the business or practice involved.  There are on the other hand, no hardship clauses for people in the PAYE sector. People have to pay out week after week, month after month, irrespective of whether it suits them or if it creates financial difficulties for them.  They never get this money into their hands no matter what their difficulties or hardships.  The money is deducted at source.  It is only at the end of the year when their income is assessed that a refund of tax may be due to them.  As I said, there is no hardship clause for the PAYE worker but there is a hardship clause for the withholding tax.</P>
    <P>An additional point is that this withholding tax will apply only to fees paid from the public purse and does not cover fees from private work which would normally constitute a major part of the income of any practice or group.  The system which allows the self-employed and businesses to pay their tax, when they choose to pay it at all, on a year late basis &mdash; that is, paying tax in 1987 on their earnings in 1986 &mdash; gives them a great advantage over the PAYE sector who must pay each week or each month. Chapter III of the Finance Bill makes some small progress towards dealing with <Col N="629" /> this anomaly.  We urge the Government to resist the pressure being exerted on this issue and to stand firm on the principle of the tax ensuring that genuine difficulties and anomalies are ironed out.</P>
    <P>If the professional groups and practices who are directly affected by this innovation are genuinely concerned about its impact, there is an obligation on them to come up with firm suggestions or proposals for a tax system which would ensure that they pay a fair share of tax and that they do not enjoy any advantages over the PAYE sector.  I have yet to hear anyone come up with any such ideas.  In some respects it is like the IFA who insist, of course, that they are not against farmers paying tax or paying their fair share of tax, but they simply refuse to accept any of the suggested methods for paying them.</P>
    <P>Has anybody ever heard them propose a fair tax system?  They have not.  They oppose anything that is suggested, say they will not pay it and the Government write if off or, as one Government did, refund anything that has been paid.  The Government then think of something new, operate it for a few months and abolish it because the farmers announce that they will not pay it.  The country would be in a bad state if the PAYE sector announced that they would not pay their taxes or if they threatened to take the issue to court to test its constitutionality. However, other taxes can be declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy McDowell of the PDs tried to imply that the withholding tax was unconstitutional. He seemed to indicate that if the Government passed that tax they would try to have it declared unconstitutional. The attitude of the PDs to taxation is absolutely hypocritical.  At the outset of his contribution Deputy McDowell referred to the need for tax reform, recalled the tax marches and the reports of the Commission on Taxation. He highlighted the need for a fair and equitable tax system but when an effort is made to spread the burden by the introduction of another tax he calls for its <Col N="630" /> abolition.  The PDs do not agree with the land tax and have called for its abolition. They do not want the farmers, the self-employed to pay tax but how do they expect the burden on the PAYE sector to be reduced?  They are trying to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>We cannot have a fair and equitable tax system, a reduction in the burden on the PAYE sector, unless we increase other taxes.  Tax reform and equity is all about increasing the tax on property, on wealth and on capital and reducing the burden on the PAYE sector.  Otherwise it will be necessary to adopt policies similar to those being pursued by the Minister for Health.  If we do not have tax reform and if the Government are not prepared to pursue those who owe taxes to the State &mdash; the Minister for Finance has indicated that he is not prepared to do that &mdash; all Ministers must effect cuts.  We will have hospital closures, the postponement of operations and we will be playing Russian roulette with people's lives.  That is happening at present because the Minister for Finance will not collect the taxes that are due.  He will not collect the health contributions that down the years many people refused to pay.</P>
    <P>The Government refuse to tax farmers, to impose a tax on property or on capital at the same rate that applies in other European countries.  They are putting lives at risk by cutting health services and propose to cut services in the field of education.  Those cuts will be felt next September.  The collection of outstanding taxes, and the introduction of a system that will ensure that everybody pays their fair share of taxes, are matters that should be dealt with in a Finance Bill but they are not in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond dealt at length with the question of tax on capital, wealth and property.  I hope he pushed that line very hard when in Cabinet.  However, I did not hear anything from the last Government about taxes on capital, on wealth or on property.  If he was making such proposals at Cabinet he did not get anywhere with them.  In my view the provisions in the Bill will fail and that is why The <Col N="631" /> Workers' Party have tabled the following amendment:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, noting that the Finance Bill, 1987,</P>
    <P>(1)  fails to honour the pre-election commitment given by Fianna Fáil to move towards the establishment of a fair and equitable tax system;</P>
    <P>(2)  fails to index tax allowances or bands, with the result that almost every PAYE taxpayer in the country will pay more tax;</P>
    <P>(3)  fails to introduce any significant measure to deal with tax evasion or avoidance or to ensure that unpaid outstanding taxes are collected;</P>
    <P>(4)  will result in an increase in the income tax of more than £300 million this year, most of which will be paid by the PAYE sector;</P>
    <P>there declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Desmond putting the blame for the loss of 4,500 jobs in the Civil Service on permanent civil servants.  He seemed to indicate that the permanent staff should have paid a levy to keep those people employed or at least forego any increase, even the 3 per cent increase which was not sufficient to keep pace with inflation, to keep those unfortunate people in work.  I do not know why workers in one sector should be asked to carry the burden, why they should be asked to pay special taxes or levies to keep others at work when they are aware that millions of pounds due in taxes is not collected.  Civil servants are aware of those who are not pursued and can see that people are ripping off the Government.  It is wrong to suggest that those who never missed paying one penny in tax should take a cut in pay or pay an additional levy to prevent others losing their jobs.  That was an unbelievable suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> I have confined my remarks to the area of taxation because that is the main purpose of a Finance Bill but it is no harm to refer to the strategy of the Government in regard to job creation.  All the evidence is that unemployment is increasing rapidly and will reach the 300,000 mark very soon.  In the recent election job creation was a big issue but the Government have not produced a plan to tackle that problem. They have not put any money aside for that purpose or produced any proposal to broaden the tax base to raise more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy it strikes me as a little strange to be discussing the Finance Bill half way through the year and to have a budget presented when a quarter of the financial year has gone. It is a strange way of doing business and underlines why we are in our current economic mess.  Having said that, I should like to commend the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet on their speedy and decisive action in drafting the budget in the short three weeks they had.  I also commend them for the imaginative action they took despite the time constraints and other constraints imposed on them by a reckless spending spree indulged in by the Fine Gael Party during the four weeks of the election campaign.</P>
      <P>It is also strange that Ministers in the outgoing Government entered into contracts and committed huge sums of public money without any reference to this House during that period.  Many examples of this were given over the last six to eight weeks but probably the worst was in the primary school building programme where the outgoing Minister signed contracts in January worth approximately £30 million, just prior to the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an excellent move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Another example on a smaller scale was seen in relation to the amenity grants allocated in the run up to the election.  The schemes under which these grants were allocated were originally for severely disadvantaged areas <Col N="633" /> but I can only deduce that the Government redefined a severely disadvantaged area during the period of the general election as one where Fine Gael were in danger of losing a seat.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that public money could be used and allocated in such a fashion prior to a budget or without approval from this House.  I wonder if this type of action is legal and, if so, I am not surprised that the economy is in its present state.  If this action is legal the Minister for Finance should ensure that the law is tightened in this regard.  When one considers that all these things took place under a party which in 1981 talked about restoring order to the public finances by &mdash; I will quote from their documents &mdash;&ldquo;the publication in September each year of the budget for the following year and its discussion by the Dáil over the following two or three months&rdquo;, it underlines the necessity for some action to be taken in this area so that it will not happen again under any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the budget and the Finance Bill, the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Noonan, talked about previous targets set by Fianna Fáil Governments not being met and he attempted to give Members a history lesson about what Fianna Fáil did when in Government.  If the Deputy wants to talk about targets not being met or commitments not being honoured he need only look at his own party's record in Government over the past four years.  In 1984, two years into their term of office, they produced a document called <i>Building on Reality</i> which set out a programme of action for the period between 1985-87.  That programme was launched with a huge fanfare of publicity, targets were set, policies were expounded and action was promised. Some of the targets mentioned in the document were that unemployment would be reduced to 210,000 by 1987 but the figure now is much higher than that. Employment was to be increased to 1.134 million but it decreased to 1.074 million. Taxation was to be at 36.5 per cent of GNP but it ended up at about 37 per cent of GNP.  The current budget deficit which, according to the <i>Joint Programme for Government,</i> was originally to be <Col N="634" /> wiped out by 1987 was then revised to a figure of 5 per cent of GNP for 1987 and ended up at approximately 8.5 per cent of GNP.  Exchequer borrowing was to be 9.75 per cent but ended up at 13.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Noonan repeated his opening remarks in the budget as he tried to claim credit for the policies pursued by this Government.  He talked again of Fianna Fáil stealing Fine Gael policies and doing U-turns but, in the next breath, he criticised Fianna Fáil for not having any policies.  I do not accept his contention about stealing Fine Gael policies but if Deputy Noonan believes that, I fail to see how he can now declare that we do not have any policies.  Fianna Fáil have policies and, more importantly, the courage to implement them.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong in my initial contribution in the House to be negative in my approach to the Bill or to the Opposition Members who have already spoken.  However, certain things must be said.  It is important to put the Bill firmly in context and to reiterate the circumstances in which it has been put to the House.  It is for this reason I intend to deal initially with the macro-economic aspects of the budget and the Finance Bill in general and then to deal with some of the positive and imaginative aspects.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the major problem facing the Government on taking office was how to stimulate growth and confidence in the economy because, as we pointed out throughout the election campaign, the only realistic hope of countering the serious financial difficulties facing us was to achieve real economic growth.  The challenge was not new, it faced our predecessors and previous Governments.  However, in facing this challenge, we were presented with a unique set of constraining parameters within which we had to operate if the best interests of the country were to be served. For example, as I outlined, we inherited an unacceptably high level of direct public expenditure, a staggering millstone of foreign debt which doubled in the four years of the last Government, <Col N="635" /> the lowest levels of private investment in living memory and an enormous drain of funds to foreign banks and money markets. To all this must be added the endemic structural problems of high unemployment, unprecedented numbers depending on social welfare payments, an unacceptable burden on taxpayers in order to support the unbalanced dependency ratio and the unhelpful world market forces which impact in times of depression on a small, open economy like ours.  There were &mdash; and are &mdash; no easy solutions and no part answers.  Hard choices must be made.  We need no further proof than the last four years that increased Government spending and high levels of borrowing provide no solution, they only make the problems more difficult.</P>
    <P>Restoring order to the public finances had to be the foundation for tackling the problems.  Unless we do that our resources will be wasted in debt service to pay for current costs.  Interest rates will be too high and will act as a disincentive to further investment.  This is why the amendments tabled by The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats have more to do with political posturing than with any real analysis of the situation and possible solutions to it.  Their approach to this Finance Bill is akin to a mechanic trying to repair the brakes of a car as it crashes headlong down the hill. Obviously, the real problems must be faced first, not just the symptoms of those problems.  We must control public expenditure, we must try to achieve some real economic growth and we have to create a climate for business investment not by means of handouts but by rationalising our incentives and supports.</P>
    <P>As has been said by every other speaker so far in this debate, we must also reform our tax system to make it fairer to all and above all to widen the tax base.  In addition, we must take strong social measures to remove inequalities in our society.  We had to ensure that the hard choices were made in such a way as to achieve an equitable balance between financial rectitude, protecting the weaker <Col N="636" /> sections of our community, which unfortunately have grown numerically stronger in recent years, and stimulating growth.  We had to do so by providing a framework within which the defeated private sector could once more acquire the confidence and the opportunity to make a positive contribution to growth.</P>
    <P>We have started on that particular road with the provisions of this Finance Bill. The road we have embarked upon is more difficult but not unlike that travelled by Seán Lemass with his First Programme for Economic Expansion.  The reward for success now is as great as it was at that time but the price of failure now, I fear, is greater.  We are, in effect, at probably the most important crossroads we have faced.  The task of leading us down the right road has proved to be too much for others.  This budget is the first step in providing strong leadership down the right road.  The signs are already there that the economic strategy chosen is the correct one.  We have taken a firm and businesslike approach to the problems facing us.  Our strategy is based on identifying and targeting areas of growth.  We have concentrated on stimulating market effectiveness in a positive manner and on getting on with the task of selling the country and its strengths on the international front.</P>
    <P>We have picked up those areas where the pursuit of weak policies has eroded our capacity to make the best use of the resources and talents at our disposal. There is already a marked and noticeable increase in economic activity and a sense of confidence is returning and hope is beginning to replace the defeatism we had all become too familiar with.  This budget proposes to reduce the current budget deficit from 8.5 per cent to 6.9 per cent of GNP.  That is an important step in correcting the imbalances in the public finances.  However, it should be realised that it still implies that the Government's current expenditure will exceed current income by over 6.9 per cent of GNP.  As I say, it is a courageous first attempt to reduce the deficit.  Much will now depend on interest rates and as <Col N="637" /> Deputy Noonan mentioned in his contribution yesterday, it would be a mistake to assume that it would be beneficial in the short term if interest rates come down.  We have to look for a long term reduction in interest rates.</P>
    <P>What are the signs which show that we can face the difficulties ahead with some confidence?  Firstly, we can look at the downward trend in interest rates which I have referred to as a very positive sign.  We received much criticism because we refused to divert public expenditure or tax concessions directly to sectoral interests, for example, in the construction area.  In terms of sectoral initiatives the Government rejected the usual approach of providing incentives to certain key sectors such as industry and the construction sector and the absence of sectoral initiatives is a feature of this budget.  However, there is a provision for incentives for financial services and these are contained in section 28 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was also an expansion in the incentives to tourism which that industry has been looking for for some time. However, we believe that real growth in those areas can only come about in any sustained way when the problem of high interest rates is tackled.  They are still too high but the continuance of our policies will ensure a continuing downward trend and only in this way can we guarantee the longer term buoyancy in areas such as the construction sector.  The days of short term expediency are long since passed.</P>
    <P>Second, we can take heart from the vibrant activity on the domestic money market and the already encouraging signs of an upward trend in private investment. There are very positive indications that we have turned the corner and there is reason to believe that we have plugged the gap in the black hole and that the debilitating drain of private funds out of the State has been stemmed.  I am optimistic that we are now seeing a repatriation of some of the funds which were previously taken out of this country in response to the misguided financial and taxation policies.  In this regard, the Minister's move in section 4 of the Bill is <Col N="638" /> to be warmly welcomed.  I am sure that this too will result in a steady flow of funds back into the country and will encourage our exiles to repatriate their money.</P>
    <P>On a macro-economic level, we should be encouraged by the success of the Department of Finance in negotiating a loan on very favourable terms in Japan. This long term loan has been negotiated at a staggeringly low interest rate of 4.5 per cent and will enable existing higher interest rate loans to be repaid at a considerable saving to the Exchequer.  This loan had to be negotiated in the face of bad publicity, particularly during the general election campaign, in regard to the economic and financial health of the country.  I have before me a copy of the <i>Bangkok Post</i> which contains an article entitled &ldquo;Ireland joins the world debtor countries league&rdquo; and the source of the article was attributed to none other than the son of the outgoing Taoiseach, Dr. John FitzGerald, who is an economist. That is only one example of the bad publicity we received at that time.</P>
    <P>That bad publicity was fuelled mainly by speculation and statements made by Government Ministers.  More recently, there is the example of Deputy Spring meeting with his socialist friends in Europe when he emerged as a born again socialist.  After four years in the wilderness he suddenly found his way and was welcomed back to the brotherhood. Where his socialist principles were during the last four years is anyone's guess.  I do not mind if Deputy Spring wants to attend socialist jamborees anywhere in the world but I strongly object to him using these occasions to deride and decry this country.  There has been enough of that nonsense.</P>
    <P>What we now need is a positive and aggressive promotion of our country throughout the world and in this respect I would like to welcome the appointment of Deputy Séamus Brennan as a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing.  It is a tribute to the steps we have taken in marketing this country in a positive way that that loan which I referred to earlier was granted.  It is also <Col N="639" /> very tangible proof of the confidence being shown in our economic policies and a clear indication of the support we can expect now that a strong line of correct leadership in economic matters can be identified.</P>
    <P>So far, I have concentrated on macro-economic policies.  It is important to do so because we must now build on the firm base that has been established.  This is not a time for ideological arguments which will show the country in further bad light to our international partners. Confidence, growth and marketing are the key notes of success.  We have made the right start and must maintain that impetus.  This Finance Bill will do just that.  I ask all sides of the House to join in the concerted campaign we have launched to sell Ireland in a positive manner.  The theme of the recent IMI conference in Killarney, Ireland plc, was not entirely inappropriate for the times we find ourselves in and the challenges we face.  It behoves all of us in this House to realise that the marketing function of Ireland plc resides here with us and in this respect, at least, we should present a united front.</P>
    <P>This budget and the Finance Bill have allowed us to make some real progress. That progress has been achieved while we protected the weaker sections of the community.  Because of the difficulties facing the country and the attention that has been focused largely on economic, financial and social aspects of the budget, and possibly the cutbacks as they are called, it would be a pity if some of the innovative and positive steps we have taken in areas were to go unnoticed. Budgetary strategy aimed at stimulating the economy by giving greater emphasis to certain development areas requires to be underpinned by major structural change in the machinery of Government.</P>
    <P>A new Department of the Marine has been established to capitalise on the scope for major development of our marine and marine-related resources which will benefit the economy in terms of wealth creation and additional employment.  The distribution of functions between other <Col N="640" /> Departments has been rationalised in order to restore a clear sense of direction in such areas as finance, tourism, transport, energy and industry and commerce. Of most significance in the longer term will be the establishment of the new offices, each headed by a Minister of State with responsibility for key sectors of development.  Areas targeted for significant attention on growth include food, trade and marketing, horticulture, finance, technology and forestry.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill contains sections which will help in a very positive way to develop these areas.  The developments outlined represent the most radical overhaul of the public sector in recent times and contrast starkly with the rhetoric of public sector reform which has been prevalent for some time.  Furthermore, this radical change which will yield significant benefit in future years has been achieved through the redeployment and rationalisation of existing resources rather than through additional expenditure. The process of ensuring that the public sector is adequately geared towards making a positive contribution to growth will be a continuing one.</P>
    <P>We are already committed to developing the semi-State sector as an important arm of Government for social and economic development.  For example, there are already 20 State and semi-State institutions with a combined staff of 3,400 providing aid of one form or another to industry.  We need to take a cold, hard look at how these efforts can best be provided so as to reduce unnecessary duplication and overlap.  For too long now we have accepted that major areas of Government expenditure are committed before we even sit down to draw up the budget.  The only accountability that exists in any real sense for such expenditure is the formal reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas of how appropriately it was spent.  Despite attempts by various committees, no one has yet succeeded in introducing a more meaningful accountability in relation to the use of taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>We can no longer afford to allow expenditure to be committed without <Col N="641" /> looking at value for money or allow services to persist without looking for a value added contribution from them.  We must now make it a priority to introduce the concept of value added to all our Government expenditure.  State services provided directly by the Civil Service Departments and indirectly by semi-State and other grant aided bodies must be subjected to the most vigorous scrutiny as to the value for money they represent. They must be made accountable for performance rather than expenditure. We must begin to do this in a systematic manner.  As part of this process we should look at the contributions and future prospects of our semi-State companies.  Bord na Móna are perhaps a case in point. Here we have a major semi-State company which have made a substantial socio-economic contribution in the past and have been a mainstay of employment in rural areas.  But do we really know how effective they have been?  As for the future, do we know what they should be doing, given that they depend on a finite peat resource which will be exhausted in the next 30 years or so?  I am convinced we need to take a fresh look at many areas like this as part of our ongoing economic strategy.  The budget points the direction for new initiatives in public sector management and structures and for the emergence of new forms of accountability to take account of value for money and value added.  This should be our emphasis for the future in public sector management.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the proposal to establish the financial services centre in the Custom House and also to comments which have been made, some adverse, some favourable, by Members of the House and by outside financial institutions. There has been some scepticism as to whether this will work but I would just call the attention of the House to the fact that since 1978 the Isle of Man has been developing as an offshore financial centre.  At present there are 42 banks licensed there, 36 insurance companies licensed to write insurance business outside the island and 19 British based companies with Manx offices.  In addition, <Col N="642" /> there are ten other deposit taking institutions, 51 accountancy firms and four stockbrokers, also 40 fund management and investment companies and 25 trust companies.  When one takes into consideration that in the Isle of Man in 1978 bank deposits were about £345 million and are now over £3 billion, we can see how successful the operation has been.  I refer to Jersey where there is a staggering £24 billion on deposit.  This year the Isle of Man expects the amount on deposit in the financial institutions to double from £3 billion to £6 billion.</P>
    <P>We can certainly learn from the Manx experience and, in addition to the incentive proposed in this Finance Bill, we must also ensure there is proper control and regulation of these institutions that will be established here so that we have only the highest standards from the institutions and so that the investment we make is not ruined in one form or other by cowboy operators.  There is no doubt that the Isle of Man enjoys certain advantages we have not got; not least among our own disadvantages are the 58 per cent personal tax rate, the bank levies, the exchange controls, etc.</P>
    <P>All these will have to be looked at and action taken to ensure they do not act as a disincentive in this development.  I am glad to note that in relation to the financial services sector the Finance Bill starts the process of looking at this matter with the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the recently announced package for the tourist industry.  This is welcome and essential for the restoration of tourism as a substantial earner of foreign revenue.  Following the ravages of last year particularly it was necessary to act decisively to re-establish Ireland as a tourist centre.  The extension of the business expansion scheme to tourist related activities and exports should be welcomed by all in the House.  We have assets in our tourist business that no other country has; I refer, of course, to the beauty of our scenery, to our heritage and the friendliness still of our people. These are assets that we should protect and promote as much as possible.  We should be aggressive in our promotion of <Col N="643" /> tourism.  I hope that in the coming years Bord Fáilte will be given a larger budget so as to ensure that tourism promotion continues and expands.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the removal of the land tax.  Deputy Desmond spoke at length on this issue.  He lamented the fact that Fianna Fáil had removed the tax thereby keeping a promise made some time ago, and not as the Deputy contended, made during the general election campaign.  I have heard Deputy Desmond and Deputy Mac Giolla, too, talk on many occasions about the necessity of having equity in the tax system.  The land tax was inequitable.  It bore no realationship to a farmer's ability to pay.  We should be trying, and I believe we are, to ensure that everybody pays tax on the same basis, that is on accounts.  I have no objection to a land tax <i>per se</i>; it is when it is used as an income tax that it becomes inequitable.  A land tax has a place in an overall tax system as a method of raising local tax for local government. It would be as equitable then as the current charges operating at local level.  That is the way forward in relation to land tax rather than putting it forward as income tax.  Deputy Desmond glossed over the fact that the money foregone in the land tax will be subject to the clawback from the VAT refund scheme for farmers.  In this way the farming community will pay the same amount of tax as they would have paid if the land tax had been left in place.  I believe very strongly that the farming community must not only pay their fair share of tax but must be seen to pay it.</P>
    <P>Another controversial issue in the Bill relates to the tax deduction at source on professional fees paid by certain public sector agencies.  Despite all the comments and the political hullabaloo that has been made about this tax by various parties and Deputies, it is now clear that there will be no additional tax liability on the persons or companies affected by this law.  The scheme contains a measure to mitigate any adverse consequences which have already been adverted to by many <Col N="644" /> Members of this House.  It seems ridiculous that the State should pay out millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to people who owe money to the State in the form of taxation.</P>
    <P>We have had a great furore during the past month about uncollected taxes. Deputy Mac Giolla made a long contribuiton in relation to this.  There has been an ongoing debate over many years about self-employed people and the amount of tax they pay.  Regardless of whether it was the intention of the Minister for Finance, this tax will help to ensure that there will be a considerable improvement in the tax collection rate from this sector and that it will be paid very much earlier than at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the remarks made by Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to the letter he received from a consultant engineering firm who agreed in principle with the Bill.  They thought it was a good idea and agreed that we should get money in much quicker.  However, they went on to make a case as to why the consultant engineers in particular should not pay their taxes earlier.  It is the same story with everybody; we all believe that more taxes should be collected from certain sectors, that there should be cutbacks in State expendiute and so on but that it should not affect any of us individually. The Deputy should know that that is the principle on which that letter was written to him.</P>
    <P>The deduction of tax at source will be welcomed by every PAYE taxpayer as a move towards a more equitable tax system.  I welcome the assurance given by the Minister that there will be no undue delay in the repayment of any overpaid tax under this scheme.  This is important because it will affect the cash-flow situation but provided firms have their tax paid up to date, it should not unduly affect them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move to put export trading houses on the 10 per cent corporation tax rate.  We are all aware of many small, well estalbished Irish companeis who have been in operation for some time and who are on a very firm footing on the home market.  These companies would <Col N="645" /> benefit substantially from some expansion into the foreign markets but simply because of their size, or of their personnel or lack of capital and marketing expertise they cannot do so.  The provisions of the Finance Bill and the encouragement which will be given to these trading houses will act as a tremendous boost to our small industries, most of which are indigenous.</P>
    <P>During the past eight weeks or so I have had to defend outside this House the budget and the Government.  I am pleased to have the opportunity of supporting today in the Dáil the Government and their budgetary strategy, I defend the budget, not particularly because I like it or because that is a popular thing to do, but because I see it as the only hope we have.  I see the moves that are being made by the Government as the only hope for thousands of intelligent, educated young people who are currently in our educational system and will be leaving our schools and colleges seeking employment and opportunities during the next few years.  I defend the budget for the sake of the many thousands of young Irish people who have already been forced to go abroad.  These people have no one to speak for them.  I would like to put the thoughts of one young person on the record of the House.  These thoughts are in the form of a letter which was written by an emigrant from Kilkenny to one of our national papers some months ago.  He says:</P>
    <P>I had great interest in the general election, but I wasn't voting, because I wasn't in my own country, I'm living in the USA, and have been since October.</P>
    <P>What brought me here?  Need brought me here.  The need to earn a living.  The need to have a better way of life and a better standard of living. The need to be a useful member of society.</P>
    <P>Unemployment brought me here. My enforced absence from the Irish workforce lasted four years, and I regard my exile as an escape from the prison of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I don't speak on anybody's behalf <Col N="646" /> but my own, though I am sure lots of people share the same sentiments. When historians come to write about the '80's, they'll mention unemployment and emigration, just like what was written in the '50's and early '60's.  Have the thoughts and feelings of any emigrant Irishman or woman ever been recorded?</P>
    <P>I'd like my views on politicians, unemployment and emigration to be heard.  I regard myself as a rejected and forgotten member of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I joined the expanding ranks of the unemployed in September 1982.  Later on that year, Garret FitzGerald's Coalition Government came into office.  They were elected with a reputation of untarnishable integrity.  I helped elect one member of that Government.</P>
    <P>In my home town we used to have one employment exchange.  Before I left, we had two.  One for each of the Coalition TDs who represented us.</P>
    <P>Politicians have rarely spoken honestly about unemployment.  Oh, they'll mutter the usual phrases: &ldquo;Unemployment is deplorable&rdquo;, &ldquo;It's sad and something needs to be done&rdquo;.  Their utterances are nothing more than gratuitous concern.  Politicians only care about people when it affects their election chances.  Our present representatives can't convince people otherwise.</P>
    <P>Despite their numbers, the unemployed aren't a strong lobbying force. They aren't privileged and prominent, like many other groups in our society.</P>
    <P>What do politicians know about the unemployed?  Can they even try to imagine what it's like to be unemployed? Do they know how it feels to face each new day without work? Would they relish the thought of spending years of their lives in idleness? Do they know what it's like to try to exist on parsimonious unemployment assistance?  Do they know how it feels to be utterly penniless and in debt?  Who do they think they are? They don't have a mandate to pursue policies that will consign people to long <Col N="647" /> years of unemployment.  Nor do they have a moral right to do so.</P>
    <P>No TD in Government, or in opposition, can stand innocent.  All of them knock on our doors and request our support at election time.  All of them want to be at the centre of decision-making. All of them, with few exceptions, possess more ambition than ability. When they are elected, they forget it's their constitutional duty to assist all Irish people achieve a better way of life and a better standard of living &mdash; in Ireland.  Every employment exchange should be a monument to every TD. Every emigrant is an indictment of their failure.</P>
    <P>A vast number have left Ireland, never to return.  What would they come back to?  They are lost to their country, and they are also lost to their families. I'm speaking from experience as my own family has suffered the insult of emigration.  I've got two brothers and a sister living and working in Britain.</P>
    <P>In the 1950's, a generation of politicians depopulated Ireland of approximately 500,000 people.  Now another generation of politicians are doing the same.  But one thing must be remembered. The opinions of emigrants are unimportant.  They won't be around to vote in the General Election.</P>
    <P>Is it one million of our people who are in receipt of benefit from social welfare?  Our population is approximately 3.6 million.  That means an excessively high percentage depend on social welfare.  That's a scandal and the members of Dáil Éireann should hang their heads in shame.</P>
    <P>Surely, there's a better way to run the country.  Surely, there's a better way to organise the nation's finances and distribute the nation's wealth in a just and equal manner, so people will be independent.</P>
    <P>Where are the ideas?  These days, imagination is a stranger in Leinster House.  Long before I became unemployed. I was finding it increasingly difficult to exercise my right to vote. The choice of candidates and the lack <Col N="648" /> of ideas of the elected ones left something to be desired.  But, somehow, I always voted.  Gradually, my spirit broke.  The years of unemployment disheartened me.  I no longer cared. No longer did I want to listen to the long-winded assertive and empty academic who was the Taoiseach.  No longer did I want to hear the leader of the Labour Party remind everybody he was looking after the needs of the less well off.  As one of that unfortunate group, I gradually remained unconvinced and unemployed.  No longer did I want to remain in my own country.  I left Ireland a necessity emigrant and an embittered emigrant and at present I hope I never again have to seek employment in my own country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That letter was written by a young man from Kilkenny who is currently resident in New York.  I would not agree with some of the things he said in it but it is important to put it on the record of the House.  That is the bottom line in this budget or in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It is part of the long term strategy of this Government to restore order to our economy to enable us to provide our people with employment and a satisfactory standard of living.  If we shirk that responsibility, in the years to come thousands of young people from Ireland will be in foreign lands; they will never want to set foot on our shores again and they will indict every Member of this House for its failure to tackle the real problems.  I hope that I will be able to say at the end of my time in this House that I did the right thing, faced the real problems and had the courage to see them through to the end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Dempsey was making his maiden speech. I wish him a long tenure of office.  A lot of the content of the speech lacked any knowledge of recent Irish history.  If the Deputy had had the benefit of being a Member of this House in previous terms he would have seen that Fianna Fáil had the unique capacity in Government <Col N="649" /> between 1979 and 1981 to run up supplementary estimates in each Department of no less than 45 per cent and sometimes as high as 80 per cent and that in Opposition between 1982 and 1986 Fianna Fáil still steadfastly opposed every step that the last Government tried to make to redress the country's financial imbalances.  I do not share the Deputy's sense of optimism about turning the corner.  There is a prevalent attitude that the last one out should turn out the lights and lock up the shop.  There is total depression among health workers looking at protective notices, among people suffering under the crushing weight of taxation and among people mystified by the U-turn that Fianna Fáil made in their pre- and post-election position.</P>
      <P>While Fine Gael will give the type of co-operation that Fianna Fáil never gave in Opposition it must be emphasised that Fianna Fáil successfully duped the people into believing that there would be an easier and a better way, when in fact they found just the opposite.  Unfortunately this Government's economic strategy is far too narrow in focus.  It is zoned in on something that we emphasised in the election.  We produced literature about the vicious circle.  Fianna Fáil have not only grasped hold of this principle of high spending leading to high borrowing leading to high interest rates, leading to job losses, with vigour, but they have also adopted it as a sole economic policy.  It is limited because interest rates depend on currency as much as anything else. While the Irish punt is stable at 90 pence against £1 sterling our interest rates will come down.  It was only when the instability of the speculative time of 1986 arose that interest rates, especially deposit rates had to be increased to induce money into this country.  What is needed is an overall economic policy and not just a look at interest rates.  We need to examine our current tax structure to see how it is crushing people's hopes of economic recovery and their economic spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our clear philosophy of &ldquo;Ireland plc&rdquo; must be that the only way we will create sustainable employment is by earning more abroad and by increasing our percentage <Col N="650" /> of world trade.  This Government have failed to set any goals of trade such as are necessary in order to implement any policy subsequently.  Our trade goals should be the immediate setting about of a proper import substitution plan.  There are £700 million worth of industrial goods that can be produced by the existing capacity of Irish companies and a further £300 million of consumer goods can be produced by existing capacity and capability particularly in clothing, grocery, food products and so on.  We must set a target of 50 per cent of our indigenous manufacturing small firms exporting, preferably to the North or the UK.  At present 80 per cent of our manufacturing firms do not export at all.  That is an indictment.  We must zone in on markets such as West Germany and sell as much <i>per capita</i> to them as we do to the Dutch. Until we set out a firm economic agenda and the means of achieving it, we cannot create jobs or raise standards of living. This Government have too narrow a focus and strategy in their economic policy and, therefore, unfortunately, are limited in the eventual results.</P>
    <P>I cannot support some aspects of this Bill.  The withholding tax, which is provided for in Chapter III of the Bill, is unfair, penal, inequitable and perhaps unconstitutional.  It proposes to confiscate 35 per cent of the turnover of many small businesses.  In no way is it compatible with DIRT which only taxes 35 per cent of income, nor is it compatible with the C.2 certificate in the building industry or the C.45 deductions whereby if you do not have a tax certificate 35 per cent of your income is deducted.  Withholding tax has no precedent at all in tax law.  It is a simple confiscation of turnover irrespective of tax liability or tax owing to the Revenue Commissioners, and, therefore, is totally unfair.</P>
    <P>The wording used in different sections to facilitate interim refunds is unworkable. Anyone who has experience of VAT returns will know that you are plagued with inspectors, form filling, and penpushing before you get your VAT refund.  This withholding tax will force <Col N="651" /> many architects, engineers, veterinary surgeons and doctors into a cash flow crisis in their business that will force them under.  Two-thirds of the work of many architect companies is comprised of State business.  What will be the effect on their cash flow if 35 per cent of their income is taken away?  All of these companies have their tax affairs up-to-date.</P>
    <P>I would not oppose a tax like the C.2 system in the building industry which provides that if your tax affairs are not up-to-date then you have to pay withholding tax, but this is simple confiscation which will force doctors and dentists to cut back on their staff, to cut down on their standards and to charge more to the public, the taxpayers, for the services they provide. I will be a part of the Fine Gael team in this House who will be vigorously examining Chapter III of this Bill on Committee Stage and if the Government do not accept the relevant amendments they will be opposed vigorously.  It is totally unfair that from next Saturday, 6 June, the contracts that many of these professionals have entered into are being rewritten by this tax.  There should have been consultation on this and there is still time for that.  This is a precipitous way of doing business which will rebound on this and future Governments and I do not believe it will bring in the expected £20 million revenue.</P>
    <P>Let me suggest what I would like to see in this Finance Bill that it lacks.  Every speaker on this Bill today has referred to unemployment, the creation of employment and the reversal of the trend of emigration as our economic and social priority.  Unfortunately, there is very little, except a few minor sectoral changes in shipping, tourism and the trading houses, that will create even one job.  I have four proposals for the creation of jobs by way of restructuring the tax system and using it to allow those who are in a position to create jobs to do so.</P>
    <P>First, other countries have a jobs tax credit system which works on the basis that if an employer takes someone off the dole or employs anybody for a year he will get tax credit of, say, £1,000 against <Col N="652" /> the company's tax liability.  That could be corporation tax, net VAT payments or PAYE-PRSI liability.  If the employer holds the person for a second year he will get a further refund of, say, £500.  This system could be operated easily by the National Manpower Service who could give a voucher to certify that someone had been taken off the dole and was employed.   There we would have a direct tax led incentive to create jobs.  Such a system would be simple and easily operated. When people remit their cheques for tax liability such as VAT, employer's PRSI, PAYE or corporation tax they could enclose a voucher which would act as payment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, jobs could be created through promoting an early retirement scheme.  If people were to retire from employment at 55 years of age we could say we would not tax any retirement pension, superannuation pension or retirement benefit until the person reached pension age of 66 and the pensioners would have that income from early retirement entirely tax free.  That would be a real incentive to create jobs.  It is reckoned that if you reduce the old age pension age from 66 to 60 years of age you would create 10,000 jobs on a once-off basis.  A modest adjustment such as I have suggested would be much cheaper than reducing the pension age and would effectively create 5,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in relation to job sharing it is possible, particularly with married couples, that some people in the public and private sector would be interested in half a job with half a salary.  For instance, women with family commitments, young children and so on, might wish to retain an interest outside the home and have an income other than, say, their husband's but, at the same time, could not hold a full time job.  Such people are at present employing full time babysitters in the black economy.  I suggest that we increase the PAYE allowance from £700 to £1,000 for participants in any approved job sharing scheme in the public or private sectors. Again, that could be administered by the NMS who at present are just taking in inquiries from jobless people who <Col N="653" /> cannot place the vast majority of them in employment.  This would not involve loss of competitiveness whereas reducing the working week would involve such a loss. Such a tax incentive in the nursing profession and certain administrative work in the public and private sectors would be successful.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we could create an adjunct to our tourist industry in relation to emigrants who wish to retire home.  A very large Irish ethnic community in the UK and in the US have one wish in their retirement and that is to die in Ireland where they were born and reared.  We should introduce a change in our tax code to ensure that any foreign retired person coming to Ireland would be exempt from income tax here provided they were not dependent in any way on the Irish State, that they had sufficient means, would be taking up a home of their own.  That would constitute an extension of the provisions of section 4 of this Bill.  Those four proposals, the jobs tax credit, the early retirement scheme, the job sharing scheme and a scheme to attract foreign residents to retire here would successfully and realistically create jobs on the ground.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to tax reform.  I have in front of me the weighty volumes of the different reports of the Commission on Taxation, of most significance their First Report which dealt with direct taxation and was published in July, 1982.  The commission sat for over three years and had quite a lot to say about our whole taxation system.  They made a number of recommendations in the area of direct taxation, that is income taxation.  I am looking now at pages 45, 46 and 47 of their First Report where they recommended that income tax relief on mortgage interest should be abolished, that medical insurance relief should be abolished. They believed that the deduction of premiums payable on permanent health insurance schemes should be withdrawn and any benefits accruing from such policies paid free of tax.  They also recommended that no change should be effected to extend tax relief in respect of expenses incurred in travelling to and <Col N="654" /> from one's place of work and no further relief should be introduced in respect of educational expenses.  I disagree with all of that.  The Commission on Taxation were given an impossible brief in terms of reconciling their terms of reference of coming up with a simple, equitable code, which they did, because the more equitable our tax code the more complex it will be.  Therefore, the simpler it is the more unfair it will be.  While they leaned on the side of simplicity in terms of direct income tax it has to be said that the more blunt our taxation system the more unfair it will be.</P>
    <P>There are many recommendations set out in the different reports of the Commission on Taxation that are worthy of consideration and in respect of which the Fianna Fáil Party had given a commitment. Yet nothing has been done in that respect by way of the provisions of this Finance Bill, a source of great disappointment. The first is in the area of self assessment for Schedule D taxpayers. A discussion document was published by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, but nothing has happened since.  I would hope that self assessment would be introduced.  It would free up manpower resources in the Revenue Commissioners to get at the black economy. Another way in which reform could be carried out without involving any loss of revenue is by way of a switch from tax free allowances to tax credits.  What that means is that, instead of having a personal allowance of, say, £1,500 one would have a tax credit of £1,500.  If one has a tax free allowance and one is paying tax at 35p in the £, that is worth less than if one had an allowance of £1,500 when one is paying tax at 58p in the £.  Therefore, the present structure of tax free allowances benefits those on the highest tax bands most because their allowances are worth more to them.  A tax credit would allow a given amount of income tax remission but would be progressive in so far as the highest earners would pay the highest rate of tax.  A replacement of tax credits for tax free allowances is not only progressive but is fair.  I would hope that the Minister for Finance would set about <Col N="655" /> establishing urgently a system of self assessment, a system of replacing tax credits for the existing tax free allowances.</P>
    <P>In the lifetime of the last Dáil I sat in the House throughout many Stages of Finance Bill debates, particularly on Committee Stages, when standing where I am now was the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy who tabled amendments to our Finance Bills in each of the last four years.  He spoke most eloquently and passionately, tabling the same amendments each year, amendments relating specifically to dependent children in respect of whom the tax free allowance was abolished.  He argued that no account was being taken within the tax system of large families and family needs.  He went on &mdash; and I can produce the records on Committee Stage of this Bill &mdash; to show that dependent elderly and incapacitated relatives should be kept in the home instead of receiving institutional care which costs at least £150 a week.  That is something which, on face value, one could not but support.  Unfortunately, in this Finance Bill not only is there no provision for any tax free allowance in respect of children, there is no change whatsoever in respect of incapacitated or elderly relatives and no change in relation to Deputy O'Kennedy's hobby-horse, the tax free allowance position of widows.  It is reasonable to ask; will Deputy O'Kennedy be contributing to this debate and, if so, will he be mindful of his contributions to Finance Bills over the past four years?  I would hope that Fianna Fáil would recall their past commitments in this House.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of my contribution to the budget debate that the group hit hardest in the last budget was the low to middle income group.  They would now be liable for all the new charges &mdash; increased school transport charges, new hospital charges and increased local authority charges.  They are being hit savagely.  As Deputy Mac Giolla pointed out, unfortunately, for the first time, the provisions of this Finance Bill allow for no relief whatsoever of the <Col N="656" /> income tax burden on that group.  While I understand the overall economic parameters and limits to the tax relief available this year &mdash; and I support that general macro position &mdash; it should have been possible to introduce minor changes to deal with the problems of this group, the real new poor.  I am thinking of people in council houses, who have to travel to work, people who would be better off on social welfare with pay-related benefit, people who pay high rents on local authority houses, people just beyond eligibility for a medical card.  Given that overall tax changes could not have been effected, surely specific changes could have been made in respect of a married man with, say, three children occupying a council house, so that he would have been given some relief in respect of his rent payments, in respect of his medical and educational expenses and in respect of his travelling expenses to and from work.  None of those factors is taken into account in assessing his eligibility for anything. We must realise that these people constitute the backbone of this country in terms of extra productivity, extra output. They represent an essential grouping in so far as the incentive to work is concerned because, if those people do not have an incentive to work, the dole queues will never shorten.  The only treatment of those people under the provisions of this Finance Bill is a restriction for the first time ever in their mortgage relief, down to 90 per cent of interest payments as outlined in section 6.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on to an area particularly in need of reform which is not addressed by the provisions of this Bill at all, that is our whole system of pay-related social insurance contributions.  I have been speaking for many years on the need for reform in this area.  It has been studied by the ESRI and other groups but unfortunately nothing has been done.  At present we have a tax on employment in the form of employers' PRSI contributions.  The more people you employ, the more PRSI contributions you pay, and the more labour <Col N="657" /> intensive your sector, whether it is construction, personnel-related or the tourism sector.  It is unfair that employers should be penalised through this tax for employing more people.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation in their first report recommended that this system was unfair and outdated and that it should be changed.  They stated on page 53, chapter 21 of their report:</P>
    <P>Social insurance contributions should be replaced by a social security tax, levied at a single rate of all income including realised capital gains, gifts and inheritance.  The yield from this social security tax should be paid into a separate fund along the lines of the present social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In present circumstances the rate of social security tax should be about 5 per cent.  The balance of the fund proposed in Recommendation 113 should be raised from indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Social Welfare is in the House, I ask him to realise the direct effects which employers' PRSI contributions have on employment and on employment intensive sectors.  I ask him to immediately examine the imposition of a social security tax at 5 per cent or at the appropriate rate to ensure that the burden of social welfare is shifted away from the employment-generating sector of the economy and borne by all those who can afford it.  There are other sound arguments from a non-tax perspective for doing so because at present the rate of unemployment assistance is higher than the reduced rate of unemployment benefit. Many people who work on and off in the construction industry and who are currently in receipt of benefit get less money than if they were on unemployment assistance and they are not allowed to break their claim and draw unemployment assistance at the maximum rate.  In many cases recipients of non-contributory old age pensions are within a whisker of getting the same amount as someone who worked throughout his life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> There is a particular problem in relation to the public sector where people should be paying the full class A.1 PRSI contribution but they are not doing so. There is no justifiable argument for not proceeding with that.  One of the consequences is that retired postmen, retired health workers and retired local authority workers, people who have given years of service, are now on a lower pension and are not entitled to any of the fringe benefits of the social welfare code by virtue of the fact that they were in a different social insurance scheme.  I ask the Minister to urgently review that area.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has taken place on the Finance Bill to date in relation to farmer taxation.  I do not wish to dwell in detail on the rights and wrongs of farm tax and land tax <i>vis-à-vis</i> income tax other than to say that in other European countries a two-tier system is successfully operated whereby for small farmers there is a notional form of income tax and large farmers pay tax on accounts.  Such a system could and should have been devised here.  I ask the Minister, when responding on Second Stage, to tell us what way the farm profile form will work. This was tried in 1980 and 1981 and it did not work because of industrial action and other problems with the Revenue Commissioners. What efforts will now be made to ensure that the accounts system works?</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record of this House that farmers were duped by this Government.  While they honoured their promise to abolish land tax, with the other hand they drastically changed the farmers' VAT refund system, saving £9 million.  They took that money directly out of the pockets of farmers irrespective of whether a farmer was making or losing money and irrespective of whether he was a big rancher or a small-time subsistence farmer.  They also drastically increased the levies and contributions under the TB eradication scheme.  They have drastically cut back on the farm improvement programme grants system and tied it up with red tape.  They have almost abolished the county committees of agriculture.  They have abolished the <Col N="659" /> installation premium aid for young farmers who wish to get land.  They have introduced new charges for ACOT and they have given no commitment to extend the EURO-finance scheme which we introduced to provide working capital for farmers.  While some farmers have gained in a very short-term way, nearly all farmers have lost heavily under the changes proposed and enacted by this Government.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I say a few words about the Revenue Commissioners. Questions have to be asked about their level of performance.  In 1986 gross expenditure of the Revenue Commissioners was £96.8 million.  This year it is £109 million.  In net terms, the figures for 1986 and this year are £84 million and £95 million, respectively.  In gross and net terms that represents an increase of 13 per cent which no other Department received.  I wonder how cost effective, how efficient and how productive the Revenue Commissioners are at present? The collection system has fallen into total disarray.  The Collector General's Office in particular is not in control of the current tax arrears situation.  We should decentralise our tax collection system so that collections are made at local level.</P>
    <P>At present the local tax district office makes the assessment and if the case is not appealed it goes to the Collector General's Office, then to the Revenue Commissioners and then to the sheriff. Last year 100,000 certificates passed through the hands of the sheriffs and they could have done much more if the whole system was not jammed up.  Professional consultants should be employed to review the operations of the Revenue Commissioners. The debt collection function should be privatised to professional debt collectors with full computerisation facilities, to ensure that arrears are not allowed to build up.  In order to rectify the situation, an amnesty on interest on certain outstanding taxes should be given to ensure that these taxes are collected as per the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few brief words on local taxation.  Under the current system, <Col N="660" /> rate support grant cuts, the abolition of rates and dependence of central Government have crippled local authorities. There are charges for refuse and water, planning fees and now there are charges for caravan parks.  The current system of financing local authorities cannot and does not work.  What we need is a new system of local taxation based on a full credit &mdash; for every £ you would pay of local taxation you would get a full credit against your income tax &mdash; or, alternatively, funds would be diverted through the VAT structure so that VAT paid locally would be sent to the local authorities.  If we do not have proper financing of local authorities we will endanger our fire services, house repairs will be put on the back burner and roads fencing will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I wish to make many other points but time does not permit.  Fianna Fáil have reneged on the construction industry through cuts in the public capital programme, the abolition of grants, the failure to honour the promise on VAT and failure to honour the promise on residential property tax.  I hope this Government will extend their sectoral policy by providing a proper financial structure for research and development as proposed by the NBST in 1984 to set up a proper infrastructure for bio-technology and advanced manufacturing technology.  I hope also that a marine research laboratory can be established in Wexford.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financial services centre, particular consideration should be given to a futures market whereby people can hedge against the future value of certain commodities and, alternatively, people can speculate.  I believe one thousand jobs could be created in this way and it is much more viable than the current basis for the financial services sector.  I hope the motor industry will be given special consideration later this year if a second budget is introduced by way of a change in the excise duties and some modification of the stringent benefit in kind régime.  I believe we have reached a stage of diminishing returns as regards the motor industry and employment <Col N="661" /> therein.  In the past it has proved to be very successful.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will oppose certain aspects of this Bill on Committee Stage, particularly the withholding tax and some glaring omissions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in the context of the Government's commitment to decentralisation, he will set up a division or divisions of the Labour Court outside Dublin in order to improve the machinery available for the speedy resolution of industrial relations disputes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of decentralisation of the Labour Court has been raised from time to time.  The distribution of Labour Court hearings would not however justify the location of a division of the court outside Dublin.  This position was supported by the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations.</P>
      <P>The court held 999 hearings during 1986, of which 637 were in Dublin.  The remaining 362 hearings were held in 28 different locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Labour Court that the fact that all four divisions are based in Dublin has not resulted in any undue delay in cases being heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there are considerable delays, particularly at conciliation level in hearings? Given the number of people who reside outside Dublin and want access to the Labour Court, would the Minister accept that these people feel they have a grievance because the four divisions of the <Col N="662" /> Labour Court are located in Dublin?  Will he look at the matter again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that because the four divisions are located in Dublin many people would have to travel great distances and that this may create difficulties. However, this matter has been examined on a number of occasions but I am not against having a look at the earlier reports.  Most of the reports state that since the contacts are in Dublin and the four divisions are meeting regularly, the location of the Labour Court in Dublin is of benefit to all.  From the earlier reports by the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations I read that the delays did not affect the conciliation and arbitration service.  However, as I have already said, I am prepared to examine the earlier reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Government have made a song and dance about decentralisation, this strikes me as one area where the Government could prove their bona fides.  Would the Minister not consider catering for a large section of the country, like the courts, by setting up a division of the Labour Court in say, Cork as an alternative location?  I would like to see this division being permanently located in Cork but perhaps the Minister would consider it on a trial basis for 12 months?  That would be of enormous benefit to the people living in the southern half of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I will look at the earlier reports.  Of the 999 hearings held during 1986, 637 were in Dublin, in Cork there were 16 visits and 57 hearings, and for the total Munster region there were 58 visits and 185 hearings.  This is a very small proportion of the total number of cases heard.  When the Labour Court were consulted and examinations were carried out, they were not in favour of locating a division on a permanent basis outside this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations.  I am sure he will <Col N="663" /> agree that that is outdated by some years for this purpose.  Would he ascertain the views of the social partners during the discussions he is having with them on industrial relations generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They, too, have been consulted and hold the Labour Court view.  As regards decentralisation, I accept that people would prefer not to have to travel quite so far to have their cases heard but the unanimous view of the social partners and the Labour Court seems to be that the Labour Court should be located in Dublin.  However, I will look at the earlier reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the decision to set up Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta was a good one.  The hotels have done extremely well.  They look on a major programme of renovation and refurbishing.  I take this opportunity to congratulate them on their profits of £386,000 last year, and a projected profit of £400,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he regards running hotels as a proper area of State activity?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The previous Government asked the people concerned to see what they could do.  They did a very good job by turning a loss into a small profit.  They are working to a programme to enhance the hotels.  My personal view is that I would be reluctant to sell off these hotels but I will bring the memorandum to the Government at as early a date as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to ask the Minister for his personal view.  I am aware that he has made supportive statements to the hotel groups in the past.  As one who has always had a particular interest in this area, I ask him if he will make a statement giving his views on whether the hotels are doing a good job and if there is a future for them.  I can assure him that I will be very supportive of these hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known in this House on a number of occasions.  I am supportive of the present operation but the Deputy will appreciate that I am bringing a memorandum to the Government giving all the figures and the projected figures.  The people running these hotels are extremely efficient. There may come a time when the hotels should be sold but at present the management are working to a programme. They had a very difficult task and I am in favour of letting them complete that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="665" /> confirm that some of the people who have been most associated with the progress made in the last year are anxious to see the hotels go into the private sector because they believe what has been achieved now means they are in a position to make their way very successfully in the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that. The deputation of the management and board of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann and the unions have been with me and are very supportive of the present proposals. No individual has written or spoken to me about a contrary view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply and his statement that he is anxious that the group proceed further, is he speaking about a further expansion by the purchase of new premises?  If this is the case, would it be welcomed by him?</P>

      <P>The amount of money which Ireland has received in 1987, to date, from the European Social Fund is £105.2 million.  This consists of advance payments for 1987 operations of £80.5 million and £24.7 million in respect of operations carried out in previous years.</P>

    <P>In addition to the payments already received, Ireland has outstanding claims, relating to pre-1987 operations, amounting to £36.6 million lodged with the European Commission.  If the current EC budgetary problems are resolved in the near future, I would expect at least part of those claims to be paid in 1987.  At this stage, it is not possible to estimate how much.</P>

      <P>To the best of my knowledge &mdash; this is only a guess &mdash; the figure has increased.  Balances are brought forward from previous years and they complicate the issue because 50 per cent of the approved assistance, or 30 per cent in the case of a pilot project, is paid on approval of the application.  Applicants have 10 months after the completion of the operations to lodge claims for outstanding balances.  The 50 per cent advances in respect of 1987 programmes have been received and claims for the balances must be lodged in Brussels by October next.

We put forward our views at those meetings and I am anxious that we get as much money as possible for schemes that have a realistic chance of creating long term employment, not necessarily age related.  Negotiations will continue through the year and it is my belief that we will not have final proposals on the ESF until early next year.</P>

      <P>The joint venture arrangements, including those relevant to worker participation, have been negotiated between the Department of Industy and Commerce, NET and ICI.

      <P>The Minister will be aware that there are worker directors on the board of the existing NET company and that as the law stands, under the new joint venture workers will not be entitled to have worker directors on the new board.  What is the Minister's attitude to this?  Will he ensure that the rights the workers in NET have achieved are maintained and transferred to the new company?</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the joint venture agreement between NET and ICI are a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Arrangements for that joint venture, including worker participation proposals, were approved by the previous Government. However, we are trying to initiate discussions between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself with the unions concerned.  I have met the unions and I am aware of the arguments they are putting forward.  It is correct to say that NET is one of the seven enterprises that has worker directors.  I do not <Col N="669" /> think the details of the joint venture have been finalised and I have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet the unions concerned.</P>

      <P>The resolution of problems of absenteeism is a management responsibility and is best tackled at the level of the individual firm.  Any initiatives at national level should not be regarded as a substitute for effective absenteeism control programmes in the workplace.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by different agencies to highlight the problem.  The IPC were given a mandate by the Department of Industry and Commerce to raise awareness of the problem of absenteeism control nationally. The IMI have an absenteeism control programme, which is designed to assist managers implement prevention and control procedures.  The IMI booklet &mdash;&ldquo;Absenteeism &mdash; The Missing Facts&rdquo;&mdash; is a source of information about absenteeism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report published recently on absenteeism in the public sector was commissioned from the Institute of Public Administration by the then Department <Col N="670" /> of the Public Service.  Also, the Department of Finance are to issue guidelines for the Civil Service with a view to improving absenteeism control procedures further.

      <P>In recent years there has been a greater awareness about the problem.  A task force, consisting of the IMI and the IPC, were asked to get involved in this area and their efforts are meeting with success.  A recent report on absenteeism by the Institute of Public Administration revealed an absentee rate of 3.3 per cent in the Civil Service which is below the national average.  Where programmes and control procedures have been used there has been a great deal of success.  My view is that a lot more can be done in this area because in any big organisation, including the public service, absenteeism represents a costly part of the pay bill.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason for the discrepancy between the budget as set out in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; accompanying the Budget Statement on 31 March last for the enterprise allowance scheme under his Department's Vote and the published revised Estimates, as the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; envisaged a saving of £1.5 million and the revised Estimates allowed for a saving of £2.5 million, which represents a reduction of 26 per cent on <Col N="672" /> the previous year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>A revised enterprise scheme was introduced on 29 December 1986, which was designed to improve the effectiveness of the scheme by having greater regard to the personal business skills of applicants, the viability of the enterprise and avoidance of displacement of non subsidised operations elsewhere in the economy. These constraints would result in reduced expenditure under the scheme in 1987 and a budget of £9.744 million was originally allocated under subheads H and T of my Department's Vote.  This compared with an expenditure out-turn of £11.273 million in 1986.  The budget allocated was intended to cope with carryover commitments from 1986 and to permit an average admission of 80 persons per week in 1987 under the revised scheme.</P>
      <P>There was a lower take-up in the initial months of 1987 under the revised scheme than the anticipated 80 new entrants per week.  In the circumstances, I agreed with the Minister for Finance to reduce the original budget for the scheme in 1987 by £1.5 million to £8.244 million.  This reduction was alluded to in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In regard to the prospects for the enterprise scheme for the remainder of the year, it is expected that the revised budget will adequately cater for demand under the scheme.  No worthwhile projects which are eligible will be refused assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the enterprise allowance scheme has been one of the most successful interventions in the labour market, offering many thousands of people the opportunity to move from unemployment into self employment and then into entrepreneurship?  Does he also agree that in those circumstances, the Book of Estimates provision for a 26 per cent reduction over last year's outturn is wholly unacceptable?  Does he accept <Col N="673" /> that his assurances to the House that worthwhile projects will not run into difficulties are not in accordance with what is happening in Manpower offices around the country where people are being put off when they go in to discuss worthwhile proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction taken into account was based on the figures available.  The abridged volume of the Book of Estimates allowed for £9.744 million and the revised volume allowed for £8.244 million, a reduction of £1.5 million.  If the Deputy has any other information I will be glad to look at particular cases but, under the scheme, there is room to cater for any proposals which are within the new guidelines issued in December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree in general terms that if someone is unemployed but believe they have an idea which is worth considering, they should be encouraged and that there should not be an unduly critical or censorial attitude adopted?  People who have the confidence to strike out on their own deserve every encouragement and it is unacceptable that there should be any element of selection or quota operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy but it was felt necessary to carry out a review last year with the aim of improving the scheme.  It was not a particularly radical review, one point was that there should be a more precise screening of applicants with a view to achieving quality of submission rather than quantity in regard to concepts of viability and displacement, tighter administrative controls in relation to lump sum payments, devolution of the bulk of administration, greater emphasis on monitoring the black economy activities and a weekly payment related dependancy rather than marital status.  These were all reasonable guidelines to build into this scheme and if they have reduced the intake there is a need to highlight the scheme which perhaps was not the case in recent months.  I will <Col N="674" /> review the matter if lower intakes continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in assuming the Minister said that after the review took place the revised scheme restarted last December and that the take-up was lower than had been expected?  Did he agree with the Minister for Finance to reduce the expenditure on the scheme by a further £1.5 million although it had already been reduced in the proposed budget as set out in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;?  Am I right in assuming that that all took place as a result of the revision of the scheme?  Presumably there was a hiatus in which the numbers would fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a gradual decline in the numbers taking part in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could that be said to result from the administrative problems with the scheme?  Did the Department not have the heart to continue it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I agree with what has been stated by Deputy Birmingham. It is a good scheme but the take-up figures have not been high enough.  I will continue to review the scheme as 80 new entrants per week are anticipated.  As I said earlier, there may be a need to highlight the scheme to see if it could be made more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a 26 per cent reduction in the proposed expenditure on this scheme is a scandal when you consider that we cannot offer jobs to people?   We should be encouraging people to become as independent as possible and if even 50 per cent of those participating in the scheme become independent of State transfers that in itself is a recommendation for increasing the amount of money spent on the scheme and in highlighting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will highlight the scheme but the figures are of little value <Col N="675" /> as the scheme was not taking up the money available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit there are reasons for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it will be clear in a few months whether the figures level out.  People who participate in the scheme are more likely to be in long term sustainable employment than in alternative schemes; I take the Deputy's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the scheme has been streamlined and modernised, can the Minister say whether the Department will now be in a position to monitor the success rate of people at the end of the 52 weeks cycle with respect specifically to whether they are in self-sustainable employment or if they are entitled to revert to social welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something which I would like to see done.  At present, it is not part of the scheme.  Some surveys were carried out by the Youth Employment Agency some time ago on different schemes.  It was not built into the scheme last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a reduction in the take-up which is to be expected after three or four years as there is a ceiling on the demand for many of these services.  In order to fine tune the scheme, which has been a success, the displacement and the failure rates need to be measured and only the Department of Labour can do that now that the system is computerised.  Is the Minister in a position to give an undertaking that he will try to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly try to do so.  The points I outlined earlier resulted from attempts to get to that position. We should have some way of continually monitoring schemes rather than letting them continue for a number of years without monitoring.  There is no <Col N="676" /> value in continuing a scheme which is purely short term.</P>

      <P>When the Minister comes to the promotion of the scheme will he target it at those groups to whom the scheme has been of least benefit?

Young people have not provided the proportion of participants that one might have expected and if the Minister is going to promote the scheme would he target his promotion at those groups in particular?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the anxiety among voluntary sponsors of the social employment scheme regarding the delays in making payments to them; and the steps, if any, he proposes to take to remedy the situation which has caused considerable hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my speech on the Estimate for my Department, I am aware of the concern among some voluntary bodies at delays which have been experienced in the processing of claims for payment of social employment schemes grant instalments.  Extra staff have been allocated recently to expedite the processing of outstanding claims and I am satisfied that significant inroads are being made into the arrears problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the success of the social employment scheme and, indeed, the Teamwork scheme depends on voluntary groups coming forward to offer themselves as sponsors and would he also agree that in the early days of these schemes the voluntary groups who came forward had particular objectives of their own in mind but that many of the groups who are now coming forward are motivated by a desire to do something about unemployment in their areas and in those circumstances it is particularly important that they do not find themselves having to carry the burden of funding programmes because of delays in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point and agree that these voluntary and community groups are not in a position to pay overdrafts on bank accounts.  Extra staff were allocated to the relevant section of the Department in order to clear the very large backlog.  Can I say that it is the success of the scheme which is creating the problem.  A lot of administrative work is involved but the officials involved are doing their utmost to clear the backlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of administration, is it not the case in relation to teamwork that a portion of the grant is paid to the voluntary group in advance and that in the case of the social employment scheme the money has to be expended first?  If that is the case, could the difficulties be resolved by moving over to a Teamwork type of approach whereby the voluntary group <Col N="678" /> would draw down a portion of their grant in advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm what the Deputy has just said.  In the social employment scheme the grant is paid on completion of the project when a final statement is issued.  From the questions which have been asked of me here in this House it is clear that it is the final account which quite often causes the delay but it is not always the fault of the Department as a number of other aspects have to be cleared up.  Recently, six extra staff members were allocated to the section and in view of the recent staffing difficulties that is a substantial number to be put into any one section.  Therefore, we are hopeful that this will lead to a resolving of the difficulties.  Another problem is that a number of schemes are coming to an end and this has led to an increase in paperwork over the past few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister has said that there may be additional administrative difficulties because of the phase which some of these schemes are now at, although I fail to see why they should be so acute.  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that the reasons for the delays are confined exclusively to administrative problems and are in no way related to internal cashflow difficulties within the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that some of the voluntary organisations have difficulties. To fund interest charges was not part of the original scheme and it would take an amendment to the scheme in order to do so.  What I would rather do is to try to clear the accounts so that this problem does not arise.  Further interest payments to the banking system is not the solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Three local authorities in County Louth had arrears of almost £250,000.  In view of that fact and the position which pertains in County Louth would the Minister agree that the level of administration in the scheme should be reduced?  For example, the local authorities are blaming Manpower who in turn are blaming the Department who in turn blame Manpower and it goes around in a vicious circle.  There are three statutory bodies handling the administration of what should be a very simple scheme. Something drastic needs to be done.  We in County Louth had to stop all future schemes until the moneys were paid up and this was damaging to a very successful scheme.</P>

      <P>The Jobsearch programme commenced operation, on a limited basis, on 6 April 1987 and became fully operational on 4 May 1987.  The elements in the Jobsearch programme for which the Manpower agencies are responsible are: (1) interviewing 150,000 people on the live register; (2) placing 40,000 in manpower opportunities; (3) providing places for 12,000 people on special Jobsearch courses.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the Jobsearch programme to 22 May, a total of 17,893 people have been interviewed by the National Manpower Service.  Of these, 5,822 have been referred to opportunities in either manpower programmes, job vacancies or AnCO-sponsored Jobsearch courses and 1,844 had been placed in such opportunities.  The numbers placed will increase as the AnCO-sponsored Jobsearch courses build up to their full capacity and as people from the live register replace current participants completing their allotted period on existing manpower programmes.</P>
      <P>The names of 1,736 people who have either failed to attend for an interview, refused a reasonable offer of an opportunity or were unreasonably unco-operative on manpower programmes or Jobsearch courses have been submitted to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Only three weeks have elapsed since the programme became fully operational. It is, however, the intention to do all possible to meet the targets of the programme.  Participation levels are being monitored by my Department on a weekly basis.  If there is any evidence of slippage from targets the question of remedial action will be considered.</P>

      <P>First, has any single job actually been created out of this scheme to date?  Secondly, in what areas does the Minister expect vacancies to arise, in view of the fact that the quota allocated under the social employment schemes has been taken up in most of the regions? Thirdly, is the scheme operational in all the Manpower office areas around the country and, fourthly and finally, what happens in the case of a notified person who does not turn up for interview on the first occasion?  Does that person get a second interview and if he does not turn up on that occasion is he then removed from the eligibility list for unemployment assistance or benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of people being submitted for interview is for the Department of Social Welfare.  Guidelines are issued to the NMS offices.  There is a very long list.  If the Deputy wishes to have this information, I can make it available to him.  I have been monitoring the Jobsearch scheme on a weekly basis and people initially are not over-happy about being called in, although a number are declaring an interest in this scheme. Depending on the success and on the instructors and people involved, there can be a great degree of encouragement. The whole scheme is operating on a positive basis.  It is to try to motivate people who are on long-term unemployment and who are not getting anywhere as far as obtaining a job is concerned and who feel the agencies are not giving them any opportunity.  The course is a motivation course to assist them.  I have seen in a number of other schemes how this would work.  The first four week course has just been completed in certain areas and people are coming back with other ideas, how to become involved in social employment schemes in other areas, in incentive schemes in their own areas, in Teamwork schemes and there are others moving into co-operatives.  In some rural areas, through local co-operation of the community, industries in the area are asked to take one or two people from the course and in some of the rural areas about 15 people have been on the first course and <Col N="682" /> five or six have got jobs straight from it. I cannot say that percentage rate would follow everywhere, but there are a number of positive elements.  As it goes on there will be an attempt to increase the number of areas of involvment.  Difficulties and initial problems are being ironed out.  I believe the scheme can be quite successful.  There is a very small section of people who are objecting fundamentally to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Payments to those on the live register are part of the subheads of social welfare and that is not the responsibility of the Minister.  Implicit in the Deputy's questions is that the Jobsearch scheme is a negative one.  I do not accept that.  I know there are great numbers of people on the long-term unemployment list for several years who have never been called to an NMS interview and have not had any opportunity to partake in a Manpower course or any other course under the aegis of my Department.  This allows them to do that. A number of Deputies from all sides of the House have brought groups to me in the past week or ten days with positive proposals arising out the Jobsearch scheme, so I see a number of positive aspects in the scheme.</P>

    <P>All told, therefore, between 1982 and 31 December 1986 over 17,500 jobs were grant aided under these schemes.  Most of these jobs are full time and permanent. Without detailed research it is impossible to say how many of these jobs survive. Temporary employment for young people is funded under the Teamwork scheme.</P>
    <P>The training schemes operated by AnCO and CERT are also funded by the levy and assist young persons to get jobs. For example, the AnCO &ldquo;Start Your Own Business Course&rdquo; has assisted approximately 700 young persons to set up in business.</P>
    <P>The legislation for the amalgamation of certain Manpower agencies which I will introduce very shortly will provide for the abolition of the age restriction on <Col N="686" /> the use of levy funds.  This will allow greater flexibility in financing programmes for different age groups.  Actual decisions on the allocation of the levy will be taken in the context of the annual Estimates.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a question I raised earlier when I asked the Minister about the success of the enterprise allowance scheme.  The Minister stated that 11,000 jobs were assisted under that scheme and that 17,000 jobs in total had been assisted from the funding of the Youth Employment Agency. He said that these jobs were permanent and full time but at the same time he said there is no indication as to how many of these jobs have survived.  There seems to be a contradiction there.  How soon does the Minister expect to be able to tell the House how many of the 17,000 jobs that have been grant aided are now in existence. Could he tell the House also what proportion of the £402 million collected under the Youth Employment Agency and the youth employment fund is being used for training as distinct from the grant aiding of jobs?</P>

The Deputy will accept that the implementation of the provisions of the draft directive are a long way off and that discussions have been postponed until 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether in the course of the discussions that are taking place with the social partners on the reform of industrial relations he will table for consideration whether different legislation and different industrial procedures should apply to semi-State companies engaged in the provision of essential services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the steps, if any, he intends taking to review the trade dispute and industrial relations legislation to take account of disputes in State or private concerns which have a monopoly on essential services being provided to the public, such as the ESB; whether he considers it necessary to curtail in any way the rights of workers in these companies in such <Col N="692" /> disputes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>It is my own view that arrangements of this nature appropriate to the individual enterprise should be negotiated between management and workers directly.  As part of the settlement of the recent ESB dispute, for example, a provision was included for a cooling-off period.</P>
      <P>Legislation requires very tight definitions and enforcement procedures. Action by Government agencies in this area might appropriately be by way of a code of practice which could be drawn up in consultation with both sides of industry. I would envisage a provision in any forthcoming amending legislation on industrial relations to cover this possibility. I might add that in so far as the industrial relations agencies of the State are concerned there can be no question raised as to their total availability if they can be of assistance.</P>
      <P>The discussions with the social partners on the reform of industrial relations will cover all aspects of this complex subject, including the particular problems caused by disputes in areas which can be regarded as essential services.</P>
      <P>It would be premature for me to comment at this stage on the possible proposals which might emerge from these discussions but Deputies will appreciate that there could be serious difficulties associated with attempting to apply particular arrangements to certain categories of workers, based on the area in which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that at present the law draws no distinction between the position of workers engaged in something like shoe repairs and those engaged in the provision of essential services and will he accept that it is not altogether clear that that should be the case?  Many of us would see a certain logic in distinguishing between the legal framework to apply depending on the nature of the enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been under examination for quite a long time.  As part of the talks with the social partners I intend to raise this issue again.  From an examination of disputes in areas normally regarded as essential services, especially where a monopoly exists, there is cause for concern.  During the sixties, the question of introducing special legislative provisions to deal with disputes in such areas was given much consideration.  There are various options still to be looked at, including a compulsory cooling-off period, compulsory conciliation, compulsory mediation, compulsory ballots and/or compulsory periods of notice.  No action was taken except for the ESB legislation which was the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, 1966, which fixed rates of pay and conditions of employment of ESB workers and prohibited strikes and picketing by ESB workers.  Infringement of this Act led to the imprisonment of workers and to a subsequent backdown by the Government.  The Act was repealed in 1969.  Experience over the last 25 years has highlighted the difficulties associated with the enforcement of selective measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister is saying about the difficulties associated with legislation for resolving trade union disputes, it would be fair to point out that the legislation introduced in the sixties was introduced in the middle of a dispute which was surely not the correct time to do so.  Will the Minister not agree that we are now in a time after a dispute, where we have the benefit of hindsight, and that we should now investigate the possibilities associated with such legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way forward is to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the proposals outlined in the trade disputes and industrial relations legislation published last year which refer specifically to the question of disputes in <Col N="694" /> essential services and talk about building in codes of practice.  Perhaps we could place a code of practice within a statutory framework that would not be backed by legal sanctions and we might have some grounds for progress.  I think that is what the previous Minister for Labour was trying to do in his proposals and I see a lot of wisdom in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are already some categories of workers from whom different regimes exist.  For example, the gardaí have restrictions on their rights to form unions and to take strike action. That might encourage the Minister to consider whether there are other categories of workers whose services are just as important to the State and for whom certain arrangements might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than considering legislation &mdash; as it has been proved in this country that legislation in this area is not successful &mdash; the promotion of good industrial relations to resolve disputes is a far better way.  We should attempt to strengthen management and trade unions so that they can work together and use the third party intervention mechanisms only when they have to be used to protect vital areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the US the cooling-off period required there for power workers is now known as a hotting-up period?  Although 90 days has been prescribed as the cooling-off period, nobody takes advantage of that time to do anything and they are not required to do anything except to serve notice and wait for 90 days.  That would be a recipe for disaster here.  In the light of the resolution of the ESB dispute, which required a cooling-off period, will the Minister agree that we should in future look at prescribed mechanisms which should take place during that period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with that but a code of practice agreed between the social partners for industrial disputes in areas of essential services is a far better way.  To build it into legislation would not get us very far.  If agreement can be reached between the social partners it would be better.  On a positive note, unofficial industrial action has dropped fairly dramatically over the past number of years.  The third party institutions are resolving far more disputes than ever.  It is in that area, between a code of practice on one side and using the Labour Court conciliation procedures and the Rights Commissioner, we will probably have far more success.  I take the Deputy's point which was raised following one very major strike which could have devastated the economy.  It will be necessary to look at that problem in the ongoing talks with the social partners over the next month or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as a result of that dispute that I ask the Minister, as did Deputy Birmingham, to consider that in such essential services the final responsibility for their provision rests with the Government and that responsibility cannot be fulfilled without legislative control. In that sort of dispute it may be that they will not reach agreement without legislative control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point that at the end of the day if one cannot make progress legislation may be necessary but I am less than convinced we are at that stage.  There could be a code of practice that would not have legal status but might have some statutory role negotiated with the social partners.  I see no success in this country for it if it is not a negotiated settlement.  I might be at variance with some Members of the House in that.  We have a history of emotion about industrial disputes.  They are resolved and solved around the negotiating table and there is no experience whatsoever in this country that the heavy <Col N="696" /> hand of law and legislation resolves disputes. In a number of major disputes over the years the Army have had to come in and take over, but the negotiating table building up the third party agencies who are there to resolve these things is a better way.  What I would prefer in the light of experience is a code of practice.</P>

Second, is the Minister aware of concerns around the city that there have been serious discrepancies in the work permit area not dissimilar to what happened in the passport area?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I held discussions recently with the Irish Medical Organisation and one of the items discussed was the proposed industrial action by non-consultant doctors.  As a result of that meeting I arranged for discussions to be held at local hospital level involving management and medical staff, particularly non-consultant hospital doctors, and I understand that as a result of these meetings a satisfactory conclusion had been reached in many hospitals.</P>
      <P>This afternoon officials from my Department met the Irish Medical Organisation to discuss the matter and I would hope there is still time for a reconsideration by the non-consultant hospital doctors, particularly as it seems that they are taking the unprecedented step of providing no emergency cover.</P>
      <P>I would like to state that as one of the &ldquo;caring&rdquo; professions I am disturbed that the non-consultant hospital doctors will not be providing emergency services should they proceed with their action.

Will the Minister agree with me that if junior doctors withdraw their services there will be an immediate and urgent crisis in the health services across the country because of the unique position the junior doctors are in, in that they are the doctors in the very front line dealing with emergency cases and continuing urgent cases at hospital level?  Would the Minister agree that the instruction that he has given to the health boards has resulted in the loss of 200 jobs for non-consultant hospital doctors, 100 of them on locum, and has affected intern posts, thus depriving medical students of <Col N="699" /> five-year training and decimating their career prospects?</P>

      <P>As I said, I met the Irish Medical Organisation, and the demand that was made by the non-consultant hospital doctors was that the savings to be effected would in no way effect the non-consultant hospital doctors.  Obviously, this was totally unacceptable.  The question of the emergency services is a matter for arrangement by the management of the health boards and the management of the voluntary hospitals. I am satisfied that emergency services will be provided and that lives will not be put at risk.  Certainly I accept that there will be a reduction in the level of service, and the blame for that must lie fairly and squarely on the non-consultant hospital doctors.  The savings to be effected will not affect the non-consultant hospital doctors any more than they will effect any other professional group working in the health services.</P>

This afternoon officials from my Department met the Irish Medical Organisation to discuss the matter.  I would hope there is still time for reconsideration by the non-consultant hospital doctors, particularly as they are proposing taking the unprecedented action of not providing emergency cover.  Deputy Allen must be aware &mdash; having regard to motions debated in this House two weeks ago when his party and the Progressive Democrats agreed that we should not exceed the allocation provided for the health services this year &mdash; that is not possible, and would not be in the public interest for us to allow financial chaos to return to the health services at this stage.</P>

Would he agree that it would be of advantage to the public to have some information in relation to any proposed arrangements in advance of any such strike taking place?</P>

      <P>It is my hope that good sense will prevail, that this action will not take place.  However, it is a matter for the non-consultant hospital doctors.  As I said earlier, as members of a caring profession I would hope they would reconsider the position.  I stated in my reply that arrangements are being made by the management of the health boards and the voluntary hospitals to ensure that emergency services will be provided.  I am satisfied that that will be the case.  As in previous disputes, at this stage in the House, and bearing in mind that my officials have met the IMO in the past few hours and that I am awaiting a response at local level, I do not believe it appropriate that we should go into too much detail.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being very provocative today, if negotiations are going on.  He should realise his comments here today are provocative to junior doctors now being forced to work 110 hours per week, who have been told to work for nothing except a free meal and a white coat?  I would ask the Minister to take on board the recommendations of <Col N="702" /> the report which will be published shortly, which will not involve extra moneys but rather rationalisation and a reform of work practices.  Surely the Minister should await publication of that report before any steps are taken to effect cutbacks.</P>

Is it true that these people are being asked if they will agree to work 100 hours or more, as has been said at interviews? Is it true that locums have been let go and will not be re-employed for the next six months?  Is it true that jobs are not being advertised or filled, that all of this will increase hours of work to unacceptable levels, placing patients' and doctors' health in danger?  Why is it that the 10 per cent cut in health personnel costs seems to be applied exclusively to junior hospital doctors and junior nurses, that group being asked to take the brunt of the cuts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill is imaginative, <Col N="740" /> innovative, constructive and will lead to a greater sharing of the tax burden and increased economic activity.  There are a number of imaginative features in it.  For example, emigrants' remittances are to be free of tax.  This is a very important development when there are so many emigrants, particularly in London and the South of England, who can benefit from this provision.  I am sure they welcome it and will find it will be of considerable help to them.</P>
      <P>Another imaginative scheme is the business expansion scheme being extended to encompass export tourism in addition to the general package on tourism contained in the budget.  Another innovative provision is the introduction of the 10 per cent corporation tax rate applicable to export trading houses.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the establishment of an international financial services centre at the Custom House Docks site which will create both short and long term employment in that sector and help the development of that whole area.  Deputy Yates was very critical of the Minister and his Bill.  He felt the Bill contained nothing new or innovative.  I endeavour merely to highlight the imaginative approach of the Minister in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the Minister for Finance had three short weeks only in which to prepare his budget, a budget following on from where the Coalition Government had failed, when the Labour Party had run away from the position facing them this year and when there was a very complex financial position, requiring decisive and urgent action.  In a short three weeks the Minister for Finance and the Government put the country back on the rails, restored confidence, stopped the outflow of money and brought about a new climate for investment. This Finance Bill and its provisions constitute a continuance of that aim, introducing some of the technical details involved in the budgetary strategy of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much more work has to be done but you cannot expect to change such a difficult and depressed situation overnight <Col N="741" /> Deputy Yates could only see widespread depression but I ask him and others on that side of the House to recognise the two-pronged strategy which is involved in the approach of the Minister for Finance. The first is to get our finances in order and, secondly, to get on with the job of new production, import substitution and increased exports.  These are the two prongs in the Minister's approach and in the approach of the Government.  The second element is the one that concerns me, that of new production, import substitution, increased exports and giving a boost to the tourist industry.  That is the aspect which the Government are concentrating on at present.  The Government and the Minister for Finance in particular have done a very worthwhile job in a very short time.</P>
    <P>This year's budget provided for improvements in social welfare payments which, when viewed against the current economic climate, indicate our commitment to improving the welfare of the poorer sections of the community.  An increasing amount of our resources is going to finance social welfare.  Total expenditure in my area is now running at £2.5 billion per annum, of which the Exchequer contribution is over £1.5 billion. The magnitude of this expenditure has to be borne in mind when proposals for further improvements are considered. Further improvements can only be provided through additional taxation, increased PRSI or economies, or reductions in existing services.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing proportion of our resources that is being allocated to social welfare one must address the question of what we can, or more appropriately what we cannot, afford.  The financing of social security schemes is under pressure in many countries because of the increasing demand on services and the fall in revenue income.  Ireland is no exception to this trend and for this reason we must ensure that all expenditure is used effectively. Programmes are being examined with the overall objective of providing the most efficient service possible at the lowest cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputies on both sides <Col N="742" /> of the House that I am noting their comments and their views in relation to our programmes for social welfare.  I will certainly do my utmost to make them more effective and efficient and better directed.  I hope in doing so that I will get the support in the House for the measures which are necessary.  All too often Deputies come in here and suggest how moneys should be better directed but when a Minister comes to the House and takes such action they change their tune and do not support it.</P>
    <P>In the present financial climate the scope for increases in expenditure was very limited.  In this context, the major provision in the budget was for a 3 per cent increase in all weekly payments brought forward to mid-July, at a cost of £30 million this year.  This increase will maintain the real level of payments of over 700,000 social welfare recipients and is in line with the expected rate of inflation in the year ahead.  It also maintains the significant increases in the level of payments which have been achieved over the last ten years.  Over that period there has been an increase of over 44 per cent in real terms in payments to the long term unemployed.  Other long term payments have increased by over 50 per cent and short term payments by about 34 per cent.  All these are real increases and I might add that it was the increases given by previous Fianna Fáil administrations which contributed most significantly to the general level of real increase which has been achieved over the last decade.</P>
    <P>The Family Income Supplement provides support for workers with families who have low incomes and who are only marginally better off working than if they were claiming social welfare benefits.  As stated in our Programme for National Recovery, we are committed to this scheme and are reviewing its operation. The budget provided for an increase in the rate of supplement from a third to 50 per cent from July, and also for an increase in the prescribed limits for qualifying for Family Income Supplement.</P>
    <P>It is expected that these improvements will achieve an increase in the take-up <Col N="743" /> on the scheme.  Some 5,000 families are currently participating in the scheme and it is hoped that this will increase significantly. This is a major improvement in this scheme and will come into effect on 1 July.  I hope the scheme will be well advertised and broadcast before that date so that the maximum number of those who are eligible will participate in it.  That has been a feature and a problem in recent years.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the Government have decided to extend from October 1987 the social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons. The scheme includes dental and optical benefits and the provision of hearing aids. This extension is primarily aimed at providing these benefits for wives working in the home.  About 300,000 spouses will be covered by the extension.</P>
    <P>The extension is estimated to cost £1.5 million in the current year.  These costs will be borne by the social insurance fund. Those who will benefit will include dependent spouses of PAYE workers and dependent spouses of insured unemployed persons and of invalidity and old age contributory pensioners.  I would like to emphasise that many people on low incomes will benefit from this measure through the extension of the eligibility to the spouse in the home.  As we all know, there is a very large number of unemployed persons at present and their spouses will benefit.  The spouses of those on invalidity pension and on old age contributory pension will also benefit.  There is an attempt at the moment to suggest that this is a benefit principally for people on larger incomes but that is a very false impression that is being conveyed.  The spouses of all insured unemployed people will benefit as also will the spouses of old age contributory pensioners.</P>
    <P>This is a very positive move by the Government and there is widespread support for it in the Oireachtas and in the community in general.  There have been consistent requests for this extension from many groups, particularly those representing women who are working in <Col N="744" /> the home.  Many thousands of these women have suffered too long because they have been deprived of access to State-funded services in the past, especially dental services.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the extension of benefit to spouses will involve the revision of the formal agreements under which dentists and opticians contract to provide these services to eligible persons. New agreements, providing for the extended eligibility, are being prepared at present and will be sent shortly for signature to the dentists and opticians on the Department's panels.  Other dentists and opticians who are not on the Department's present panels may, of course, also apply to enter these agreements and thereby become members of the relevant panels.</P>
    <P>When looking at the provisions in the budget and in this Finance Bill we must bear in mind that this is a specific benefit which will be paid to those who pay the full rate of PRSI.  These are also the people who pay PAYE.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme which was announced in the budget is fully underway. As Deputies will be aware from what I have said already in relation to this programme its purpose is to provide direct support to the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, in their search for work.</P>
    <P>Up to last weekend 22,300 unemployed people had been interviewed by the National Manpower Service under the programme.  Of these, over 5,000 have been referred to job vacancies and to various programmes and schemes. Already 280 have been placed in jobs with employers in the private sector, 1,200 have been placed in Manpower schemes and AnCO training courses and approximately 1,150 are attending four week Jobsearch courses operated by AnCO and specially designed to help participants in their search for work.</P>
    <P>Over 5,000 people have been referred to job vacancies and to various programmes and schemes.  It will be some time before the outcome of these placements is determined and that information will be coming in week by week. <Col N="745" /> In addition, 1,900 who were called for interview either failed to attend or refused to accept an offer of a course or job. In other word, some people opted out, failed to attend or failed to take up one of the options offered to them.  Some of them have stopped signing on and others are having their cases reviewed.  Information on these cases will become clearer as the programme progresses.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme is a new additional service to the unemployed, especially those who are out of work for some time.  It also represents a change in direction for the State agencies in that the resources dealing with the unemployed in these agencies are now being used to actively assist those out of work in their search for employment.  The benefits of the programme will increase and will spread more widely as it continues and as it extends to more people.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their patience when this programme was brought in on a national basis.  Naturally there were teething difficulties at the outset but I gave an undertaking that I would try to ensure that the programme would be as positive as possible, recognising that there were those who would be indirectly affected, that is, people working or people not interested in taking a job.  Various people have told me what is happening on the Jobsearch courses.  One person was very highly qualified and felt they should not be on such a course.  Later they came back and told me it had worked out well in the long run.  I would be interested to hear from that person's colleagues on the course. Two gentlemen said they were working and drawing unemployment benefit at the same time, but that they did not want anybody to be told.  They said they would do the course and whatever was necessary. Another gentleman said he had been drawing benefit for eight years and that the week he was doing this course was the first week he had been idle.  Obviously, as was anticipated, some people will find the Jobsearch programme inconvenient, particularly if they have a job and are drawing unemployment benefit at the same time.  This is happening in a <Col N="746" /> number of cases and Deputies are aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>The comments from the majority of people undergoing a Jobsearch course is that it is helpful, that it is giving them increased confidence and that while initially they were nervous about entering the programme, once they got involved they found that for the first time facilities, resources and advice were available to them.  A question which comes to mind is this: what follow up will there be for those who do not have jobs and want to maintain contacts?  That is one of the areas we will be looking at.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some comment on the health services.  I heard my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, being attacked here this afternoon. The essential underlying strategy in the budget is to get our escalating debt under control, to restore confidence in the economy, to reduce interest rates and to encourage investment.  In order to achieve this objective the Government had to take decisive action to improve the public finances.  This action has resulted in some economies in the provision of services, but it is essential that the public finances be brought under control if we are to make progress in promoting development and new opportunities for employment and in our programme for national recovery.  We have taken many hard and unpalatable decisions.  Now we must follow through and ensure that this new impetus and sense of reality is maintained. Once we achieve this control the way is open to achieve our main objective of job creation and national recovery. The Government are now turning all their co-ordinated efforts to this task.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the effects of the budget financial decisions on the health services.  We explained fully to the electorate that in Government we would take the difficult decisions necessary to bring the public finances under control. We were accused by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats of not having the will to implement these measures.  We were told that if we took corrective action we were assured of their support.</P>
    <P>Yet they now say that, on the one <Col N="747" /> hand, public expenditure in the health services must be contained and the Government must face up to and take tough decisions.  But when any of the necessary economies are proposed they immediately object.  Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats want to have the best of both worlds.  They claim that they are responsible in principle, but are obviously not prepared to face responsibility in practice.  Their stance in this regard is inconsistent and shameless.</P>
    <P>Having got the finances under control we are now planning and implementing our programme for national recovery. We cannot, as a nation, afford to lose control of our financial position again. As a Government we have increased the allocation to the health services by a further £16 million this year bringing total funding of the health services to its highest level ever to £1.314 billion.  When one speaks to people outside they are surprised to hear that the health services are getting an additional £16 million this year and that the problems in the health services arise from other causes, one being the additional money which the health services demand and which is regarded in that sphere as being desirable. This includes an increased allocation of £5 million for the health boards. The Government are committed to developing the health services along efficient lines and to ensuring that services are available to all, especially to the weaker sections of the community.  This tight budgetary position is the same for all Departments this year, but Health have an additional problem to which I will return later.  It is important to emphasise that all Departments were asked to carry their share of the economies this year. They were all subject to financial restrictions.</P>

      <P>The people I have referred to are the means tested and officially recognised poor.  However, they, the lowest income section of the community, were to bear the brunt of Fine Gael's proposal for containing expenditure.  The <Col N="749" /> Government have had to introduce economies in funding this year as a result of the grave financial problems facing the country.  The principal problem of the health services, as distinct from other areas of the public sector, arises from the accumulation of unapproved expenditures over the past two years.  The health services overspent £55 million in the past two years for which money was neither approved nor provided by the then Minister for Finance.  The previous Government allowed this crisis to develop.</P>
      <P>The overruns were £19 million in 1985 and £36 million in 1986.  Those were over and above normal overdraft facilities. Those facilities were running at about £20 million and, in addition, the former Minister allowed an additional overrun of £55 million.  That is how the problem arose for the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to tackle a problem like this in the past and I dealt with it when I was Minister for Health in 1982. In fairness, the Coalition did not allow overruns in 1983 or 1984 but in 1985 and 1986 matters got out of control and unapproved expenditures occurred.  I will not go into how that could happen but suffice to say there were two Ministers who had different approaches to this and no action was taken to remedy this serious matter.  The Minister for Health in the Coalition Government did not even meet the chief executive officers and the chairmen of the health boards collectively in his four years in office to seek their advice or to jointly tackle the deteriorating financial position.  This lack of consultation has contributed substantially to the problems we are now tackling in Government.  Health boards were left in isolation with important channels of communication closed off. The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has already begun to undo that damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the present problems in the health services lies in effective <Col N="750" /> management with consultation.  As a former Minister for Health I found this approach worked well and that health boards and hospitals were willing to co-operate in planned economies.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have one of the best and most professional health services in the world.  Our nurses, doctors and medical consultants are in great demand and are highly respected by the medical services in other countries.  We have a very high quality health service and the Government are committed to maintaining the quality of that service but there is a price to pay.  We cannot have those services for nothing.  There are three options open to us: improve efficiency, introduce reasonable charges or reduce the level of services. The Government are committed to maintaining and developing the essential services.  Consequently, we must improve efficiency and introduce reasonable charges. The approach being taken by the Government is to ask those who can afford to pay to do so, to make a small contribution towards the cost of the service provided to them.</P>
    <P>To cover the cost the Minister has arranged for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to introduce a special low cost scheme.  For the small sum of £27 per year a family with two children can have cover for those charges for a full year.  People who are already in the VHI are covered and those who are not can get insurance cover for £27 gross per annum or £17 per annum after tax, at the 35 per cent rate.  That amounts to the equivalent of 32p per week per family, an amount which would not even buy a Sunday newspaper which costs between 55p and 65p.  We must ask ourselves if we value our health more than one Daily Mirror &mdash; it costs 30p &mdash; or three cigarettes or a quarter pint of Guinness.  The gross cost for a single person is £9.66 per annum.</P>

If he does, he and the Progressive Democrats should go back to the drawing board.  The efficiency and cost effectiveness of our health services depend on the structure and organisation for the <Col N="752" /> delivery of the service.  Traditionally we have had a highly devolved and localised health service and a high content of voluntary hospitals.  We have a unique mix of public and private hospitals and voluntary services.  This has been one of the strengths of our health services.  I know that the Labour Party and others aspire to a national service on the lines of the British model but I am opposed to this. What we have is good and it is the people's wish that we should develop our health services on the basis of a mix of public and private medicine.</P>
      <P>This year the Minister for Health had to tackle the financial problems of the health services on the basis of the existing legislation and structures.  The Minister made the allocations to health boards on the grounds that such boards and voluntary hospitals would exercise their own powers and judgments in deciding how best to provide services within the allocation. He gave them the guidelines and depended on their management to make the decisions, which is the normal approach.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Health Act, 1970, provides for the administration of the health services in the State by the health boards established in accordance with regulations made under that section.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of that Act sets out the functions of these statutorily established boards.  There is no argument, nor can there be, that the boards have the function and responsibility of deciding how best they can look after the health of the people in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>Section 31 (1) of the Act provides that:</P>
      <P>a health board shall not, save with the Minister's consent, incur expenditure for any service or purpose within any period in excess of such sum as may be specified by the Minister in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>That, in essence, is the nature of the basic relationship between the Minister and the boards.  If we want to change that, we can only do so through amending legislation. It cannot be changed at will, on a whim, as circumstances seem to require.</P>

      <P>In so far as corporate bodies such as St. James's Hospital are concerned, their functions, powers and the nature of their relationship with the Minister are broadly the same as with the health boards.</P>
      <P>In so far as voluntary hospitals are concerned, each has power to reach decisions through their governing authority, within the directions and guidelines issued by the Minister as the resource provider.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now appointed a commission to examine and make recommendations on the structure, organisation and financing of our health services.  Their work will provide a sound basis for the future development and control of the health sector.  If we want a modern and efficient health service and if we provide new hospitals and facilities, we must also be prepared to review the position of the old and outdated facilities. Our resources are limited and we must use them to the best effect.  For example, we must ask ourselves if we can keep sanatoria and fever hospitals open when they have served their purpose and outlived their usefulness.  Can we continue to maintain small district hospitals when we have built new and improved facilities to supersede them unless, of course, they fill a specific need?  I look forward to the early opening of Beaumont Hospital and the consequential closure of Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not like that.  We got agreement by providing a small site at a cost to the consultants to have their private facilities there.  That is also the case on the south side of the city and it ensures that consultants are on the grounds.  It seemed reasonable to provide a small facility for which they pay so that <Col N="754" /> they are available to the public patients&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, if that facility had been granted to them earlier the hospital would have been opened several years ago.  Jervis Street and St. Laurence's would have been sold and the whole package completed.  As the former Minister for Health had an ideological hang-up the agreement was torn up and there was a scandalous waste of public finances for at least three, if not four and a half, years.</P>
      <P>The total numbers employed in the health services have increased by 15,000 since 1976.  This includes permanent, temporary and part time staff and brings the overall total to 62,500 in 1987.  Deputies will agree that we cannot continue to expand numbers at this rate.  There was an onus on the Government and on the Minister for Health to take control of the situation.</P>
      <P>The commission will have to identify priority areas in the health services.  For example, the provision of hip replacements for the elderly must clearly rank as a priority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A major new challenge to public health is the world wide AIDS epidemic and our health service will have to respond and have the flexibility to tackle problems of that kind.  The commission will have to ensure that our health services are capable and sufficiently flexible to meet the current and future needs of the community.  This will involve a realistic and objective assessment of our needs rather than the present struggle by various sectors to protect <Col N="755" /> their own interests.  The work of this commission will show the way for future development of our health services.  I hope that their work and recommendations will be supported on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The budget and the Finance Bill set out to tackle in a decisive way the country's financial ills.  One could not expect the Minister for Finance to deal with all the problems in three weeks.  It is very hard to bring in a budget when a former Government have failed to do so; it is an unenviable task and the Minister had an enormous amount of work to do.  He has done exceptionally well in the circumstances and will do better now that he has time to study the problems in greater depth.</P>
      <P>Since we were last in office in 1982 an extra 100,000 people became unemployed and thousands have emigrated. Our national debt has doubled from £12 billion to £25 billion.  Confidence and investment have reached an all time low. It was time for decisive action and the Government have taken the necessary action.  The Minister for Finance has got his strategy right.  I commend this Bill to the House and look forward to further positive responses from investors and the financial market.  The Government are committed to national recovery and will not be deflected from their objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to make one or two very brief preliminary remarks about this debate and other debates like it.  Secondly, against my better judgment, I would like to make one or two observations about the Minister for Social Welfare's speech which we have just listened to and, third, I would like to make some remarks on the budget which was the original intention of my intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should seriously consider the usefulness of debates such as this, not just from the point of view that they range over virtually every aspect of the work of the Government but also because it is very unclear whether any good comes from them.  I strongly suggest that it <Col N="756" /> might be in the interests of every Member of this House &mdash; and my colleagues and I will be pushing this view in a formal way &mdash; if we were to consider putting a time limit on all speeches.  Frankly, it is very hard to listen to people who have had recent experience of senior office lecturing for the best part of two hours and in the process being highly repetitive. As long as the rules remain the same, that is going to continue but we might be well advised to consider whether a time limit of between 20 minutes and 30 minutes would be adequate so that the vast number of Deputies who might be interested in getting involved in these debates, if they were in fact debates, would be afforded an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>In effect, there will be only five or six speakers today and as a result, a great number of our colleagues are not interested in getting involved in this kind of debate as they will have no opportunity of making a contribution.  That is wrong and, generally speaking, it should not take two hours to put across a point of view.  That is what has happened today and other days and it will continue to happen as long as we have this kind of debate.  I suggest that the Minister might take up that general point and he will receive agreement for a much more organised and disciplined approach to such a general discussion.  In that context, a much more pertinent type of debate might be more appropriate.  I listened to the Minister for Social Welfare's speech and it rambled, with respect, over the health services and I am not sure whether that kind of contribution is appropriate on a Finance Bill which is designed to implement the budget.  Getting involved in commercial advertising for the VHI seems to be a little wide of the mark.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was very vituperative and unduly aggressive and I do not understand the reasons why.  It required a degree of involuntary blindness on his part or an incredibly hard neck to say some of the things he said.  I am disappointed at the Minister, Deputy Woods, as there are other Ministers in the House who have shown a capacity to <Col N="757" /> assume high honours by hard neck stakes but to lecture the Opposition about vacillation and having it both ways goes way beyond what can be taken in silence.  The Minister in his speech said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We explained fully to the electorate that in Government we would take the difficult decisions necessary to bring the public finances under control.  We were accused by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats of not having the will to implement these measures.</P>
    <P>That is untrue.  The reason why it is so brazen for the Minister to say this is that the sharpest and most piquant evidence of the untruth of that assertion was offered prior to the General Election when the country was festooned with posters talking about the now infamous allegation that health cuts hurt the sick, the handicapped and the poor.  Yet, he has had the audacity to say that they explained fully to the electorate that in Government they would take the difficult decisions necessary.  On the contrary, if the Minister believes that that is the truth then I find it preposterous that he would suggest that and I will not go into name calling.</P>
    <P>The full thrust of his and his colleagues' approach prior to the election was that there was an easier option than what the then Government had belatedly advanced and than what our relatively new party were advancing, which was the option of cutting public expenditure drastically which would inevitably cause discomfort to various groups in our society.  That is what was propagated by the outgoing Government and by this party.  The option which the people bought was not the option of a better way but of a softer, easier way, the way of all miracles and that it could be done by a wave of the magic wand.</P>
    <P>It is breathtaking to find the Government turning everything they had said upside down, and in the interests of the country one might be inclined to keep the head down and stay relatively quiet but for the Minister to come along and poke his fingers in our eyes is too much to bear. The Minister is asking us to believe what <Col N="758" /> is just not true.  It is not right to say that at any stage the Government, then in Opposition, prior to the General Election said that they would take difficult decisions.  On the contrary, the pedigree of the Government, who were then in Opposition, was to duck every difficult decision.  Unfortunately, the major signs of relenting on this issue have come from within his own party and if there is to be any crumbling in our collective will to tackle the public debt, it will start on that side of the House.  All we are asking for is that there should be no crude attempts to put discipline into the public finances. Allowing for a certain degree of political shenanigans which will always go on in this House, most of us wish the Government success and want them to succeed. It would be wrong to say that we would not be supportive of that broad thrust.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said and I quote:</P>
    <P>...they now say on the one hand public expenditure in the health services must be contained and the Government must face up to and take tough decisions.  But when any of the necessary economies are proposed they immediately object.  Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats want to have the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>For the last number of weeks both inside and outside of this House all we have been saying is that if the Minister decides to lop some money off the health budget, then he should deal with those who are delivering the service on the ground in the health boards, but unfortunately the Minister for Health is one of the staunchest defenders of the health services because of his long experience in them. Instead of considering whether they have outlived their usefulness, he has refused point blank to even consider reducing the number of health boards.  In due course, he will rue that decision as that is where the problem lies, as well as in the overriding capacity of his Department to oversee expenditure on the ground.  That has beeen testified to year in and year out in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General which the Minister of <Col N="759" /> State, Deputy Treacy, is familiar with from his work on the Committee of Public Expenditure.  Year in, year out there is ample and repetitive evidence of systematic deficiencies, waste, abuse and downright fraud.</P>
    <P>I refer to the 1981 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he documented fiddling, and what I am talking about is the changing of dates on invoices and the contriving of accounts.  I am not blaming the Minister for that, all I am saying is that he should not lecture us about it.  We are not objecting to reductions in public expenditure. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, bleated about protecting the poor.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, introduced his budget in this House, there was not one word about protecting the poor and there was no mention of a £100 upper limit.  It was subsequently introduced after strong, deliberate and, in some cases, private exhortations from people on this side of the House.  When it was pointed out that under no circumstances would the open-ended assault on people who did not have it be supported by this side of the House, suddenly, lo and behold, out of the blue, a £100 upper limit was introduced.  This is another crude instrument but it is a token appreciation that there has to be some ceiling for those who may not have the money and for people just over the medical card limit who might perhaps have income of £100, £110 or £120 a week and be asked to pay, in accordance with the budget, an open ended bill for services which they needed. I had not intended going down this road but the Minister for Social Welfare started it.  I do not believe that we should take that kind of lecture from him because, (a), we do not deserve it and, (b), as far as I am concerned he has some brass neck to talk in those terms.  All we are asking for is a reasoned and carefully considered but determined reduction in public expenditure.  If he wants to start on the health services it is not in the area of people on the threshold of medical card eligibility that he should have <Col N="760" /> started, but in the waste and abuse in an unpartisan way which has been illustrated and documented by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is there and will be there again this year and next year because every Minister has refused to take it on.  This Minister, unfortunately, may very well be the same if his remarks to date are anything to go by.</P>

      <P>Excuse me, Deputy.  You have been given an opportunity of replying to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I should like to take you back now to your earlier utterances with which the Chair agrees entirely, in regard to the length of contributions and indeed the range.  In respect of the Finance Bill, while the Chair appreciates, and has said before, that there will be references to many matters, ideally &mdash; and this is what we must all strive for &mdash; contributions should refer to proposed Government taxation, or to taxation which is not there but could ideally be there.  The Chair is now asking Deputy Keating, especially in respect of his own earlier contribution, having given him the opportunity of making that reply, to proceed now and give to everybody else the good example of which he is capable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of what you are saying, if this had come at the outset of the debate this morning we might have all been more inclined to co-operate but as long as the rules are as they are I do not intend to tie my hands.  I am responding to the Minister's speech but I shall bear in mind what you say and shall move on.  I would welcome a much tighter limit on speakers and when that is introduced by those who have the weight of numbers in this House, be assured that our Party will be the first to comply with those strictures.  It would help all of us but in the interim if a Minister decides to introduce a long, rambling, provocative, abusive and vituperative speech, unfortunately we shall feel constrained to respond in like manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early on in the Minister's speech, he talked about a major provision of the budget being a 3 per cent increase in all weekly payments brought forward to mid <Col N="761" /> July at a cost of £30 million this year; that is true.  One of the things which interested me about that &mdash; and I should like the Minister's comments on it &mdash; is that those who would benefit in July are at present being taxed on that increase in benefit and pension which they have not yet received.  When a gentleman said this to me a couple of weeks ago I said I did not think that could be true.  How could it legally be acceptable that somebody would be taxed on moneys not yet received?  After investigation, I discovered that that is the case, that people this week are paying tax on an increase which they have not yet got.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind it apparently is that the burden could be spread more evenly across the year, despite the fact that the Finance Bill is not yet law and that the provisions involved, if they are at this stage demanding a tax take off for the Revenue Commissioners, are clearly being used in some very irregular fashion. That is an incredible anomaly from the point of view of taxation.  Perhaps the Minister or Minister of State would respond to that in due course.  It appears not just anomalous but downright inequitous that this should happen.  I cannot understand how old aged or retired persons trying to live on a tiny income can be expected to pay this week moneys they do not have.  That to some extent obviously impacts on the so-called 3 per cent increase which has yet to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has words of praise for the Jobsearch programme. I want to refer briefly to this. There are again reports and documents in his and other Departments concerning the need for co-ordination and integration in the various agencies already involved in trying to assist people in the area of finding jobs and of training.  The Minister deduces that there are 280 people placed in employment arising out of this initiative, 1,200 in Manpower schemes and another number in various AnCO courses.  The clear implication obviously if this Jobsearch scheme has worked to some extent, is that the existing agencies in the way that they were organised were not successful to the <Col N="762" /> extent that this Jobsearch scheme has been.</P>
    <P>All the Jobsearch scheme is is an interview and a referral.  It does not involve anything new or magic.  What it may involve is what should have happened long ago, that is, a co-ordination of the various data bases involved in the overlapping and duplicating processes at present used by AnCO, National Manpower, the Youth Employment Agency, CERT and anybody else with whom people looking for work come in contact. Each individual agency does the same assessment of the candidate and in some cases may ask a question or two slightly different but, basically, they re-invent the wheel in relation to each individual applicant. This is the concept of each agency basically acting as an independent republic.  If the scheme has worked I am pleased but I have some doubts about that.  The question then is, why did those agencies at present charged with doing that job not do so?  Obviously, some corrective action should be undertaken there.</P>
    <P>Later in the Minister's speech he said that the essential underlying strategy in the budget is to get our escalating debt under control, restore confidence in the economy, reduce interest rates and encourage investment.  Surprise, surprise. We would never have guessed at getting your escalating debt under control by borrowing £1,200 million for your budget.  Restoring confidence in the economy is a wish list approach to financial management with which we would all agree.  We are all against sin most of the time; we are all in favour or curbing spending, reducing expenditure and reducing taxation.  This sounds like a litany of clichés.  It is a little trite of the Minister to talk in that simplistic way to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister then talks about the difficult decisions to be taken.  Lectures in time will make up the Government's minds on that; they may have done so already.  The budget may now have brought full circle an overwhelming political consensus in this House that there are no more easy options but there were <Col N="763" /> up to the introduction of this budget.  If you doubt that, have a word with people in the construction industry or with people in the health services who believed that if they could get rid of the big nasty Coalition Government the days of wine and roses were just around the corner.  Suddenly lo and behold, it is not roses but thorns they are getting and the wine is not very good wine but rather low class plonk.  They now know that there is no refuge except perhaps by way of all of us collectively not abusing each other but working to see if we can in a concerted way give some leadership in this House and decide that there must be limits to expenditure.  The Minister said many people were surprised that there was an increase in expenditure in the health services this year.  If they are surprised it is because he has not done his job properly. It is no more complex than that.  The Minister and his colleagues and the Taoiseach, too, sit there silently, taciturn, refusing to answer questions, or to tell people the facts.  If people are surprised it is a measure, not of any problem created by the Opposition but of the failure of the Minister and his colleagues to communicate the facts.  It is no use slagging us on this side of the House when he would be better off addressing the public and dealing with those issues.  People are surprised because the facts of economic life have not been explained to them and because they do not believe that a party who promised everybody they would refrain from doing everything the outgoing Government were threatening to do, could suddenly realise there is no big crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government are committed to developing the health service along efficient lines and to ensure that services are available to all, especially the weaker sections of the community. The health boards and the Department, in some cases, are in violation of their statutory responsibilities to people who <Col N="764" /> do not get the services to which they are legally entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £181,971,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I am very privileged to have the opportunity as the first Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce my Estimate.  It will be very clear from what I have to say on this Estimate that I am speaking with that new and overall responsibility as Minister for Agriculture and Food because the linkage between the primary producer, the processor and the consumer is a matter of vital importance and will be a priority for me in my responsibilities in this Department.</P>
      <P>Because of the time constraint I will not be in a position to deal with all aspects of the Agriculture and Food Estimate in detail.  However, I will endeavour to concentrate on the main issues as I see them.</P>
      <P>In framing the budget earlier this year the Government took into account the difficulties which the agricultural sector have experienced as a result of restrictive CAP reform measures, the effect of two years' bad weather and the general economic situation in the agricultural sector. At the same time, it was necessary to balance the needs of the agricultural sector against the needs of other sectors in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems which have troubled the <Col N="765" /> agricultural sector over recent years have not gone away.  In particular, the level of price support which has been forthcoming from the European Community has been eroded by decisions taken in Brussels.  There is, however, a bright side.  The price-cost squeeze, which has strangled profitability in the recent past, no longer acts as a further disincentive to farm development.</P>
    <P>While it is too early to make any firm forecasts of farm output and incomes for the current year, all the indications are that there will be a reversal of the downward trend of the past two years when the volume of gross agricultural output fell by 1.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent in 1985 and 1986 respectively and total family farm income declined by 9.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent.  Reasonable weather during the coming months should lead to a recovery of crop output which was severely affected by the poor weather of the past two years.  While the output of livestock and livestock products may be somewhat below last year's level, we can expect to see a significant fall in the volume of farm inputs, particularly feed-ingstuffs, and this will help to boost the net output from agriculture.  The most recent Central Bank report confirms the trend showing an expected improvement of some 8 per cent in farm incomes in 1987.  This would represent a really worthwhile growth in real terms and will help towards offsetting some of the losses of the past few years.</P>
    <P>While much of my time since taking office has been devoted to the annual cycle of price-related negotiations at EC level, progress is also being made on the domestic front.  The functions of the old Department of Agriculture have been expanded to include the food industry and the Department has been re-named the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Certain functions in relation to food which were previously the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce have been transferred to my Department.  A new office of the food industry has been established to deal with all aspects of the food sector and a Minister of State has been given specific <Col N="766" /> responsibility for this.  Thus, the Government are giving practical recognition to the strategic importance of the industry, and the main emphasis in the future will be on encouraging a greater orientation on the part of those involved in the food industry towards the needs of the market place.  In effect, the Government will promote an integrated approach from the consumer right back to producer level so that the industry can provide high quality products at the right price as demanded by the market.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the full potential of the food industry will pose a demanding challenge and will entail a new dynamic approach towards product development, presentation and market exploitation.  Experience has shown that given the right commitment and product, our industry can meet this challenge. Indeed some notable successes on export markets have already been achieved in the face of strong international competition. The Government, through the State bodies, intend to provide every assistance through market research grants and other incentives so that companies with the right approach will be facilitated in developing long term market oriented strategies.  Through the IDA firms will be encouraged to invest more in R and D to promote product development.  In addition the AFT will be devoting more of their resources to food processing and will work more closely with the food industry in their research programme.  The establishment of a food research centre, amalgamating the food research facilities of AFT and IIRS, is being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Another area where the food industry is receiving encouragement is through participation in joint ventures and licensing arrangements.  Such arrangements provide significant opportunities for firms to avail themselves of advanced technology and market access without incurring the financial burden which otherwise might be required.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach is not based on exhortation alone.  As the House will know, this year's Finance Bill <Col N="767" /> proposes, for the food industry exclusively, a sharpening of the incentive package the IDA can offer.  My Department, in conjunction with IDA, will ensure that the leverage provided by these enhanced incentive terms will be maximised to the full.  When considering companies for grant aid, the IDA and other State agencies will be placing particular emphasis on the upgrading of quality and hygiene standards.  The IIRS are now engaged in the introduction of a quality control programme specifically designed for the food industry.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable criticism of the failure of the industry to meet requirements in relation to quality and hygiene in the past.  In view of this situation my Department have undertaken the preparation of up-to-date legislation on slaughtering and the dairy industry so that our food industry will be in a position to satisfy the demands of international export markets with quality products. This legislation will shortly be introduced to the House and is an indication of the Government's commitment to ensure that our food industry will continue to benefit the economy through increasing the output of high quality value-added products for the consumer market.</P>
    <P>The food processing industry needs to develop a new focus on opportunities. This calls for a marketing based approach.  The home market is small by international standards and does not provide sufficient scope for modern efficient production.  We must, therefore, place special emphasis on the requirements and demands of the international market place.  Marketing for Irish companies must be a matter of identifying customer needs, seeking out new trends, tastes and behaviour patterns, studying the competition more closely and finding potentially profitable gaps in the market.</P>
    <P>Through CTT the Government are encouraging companies to orientate themselves increasingly towards strategic marketing.  CTT are working with companies to identify the products required by the market and then helping them to develop products which satisfy it.  This <Col N="768" /> approach is of immediate and pressing importance for the industry in the light of the current changes in CAP market arrangements.  We must get away from our over-dependence on commodity exports in the past and concentrate on value-added products for the consumer market, exploiting to the full the opportunities for establishing Ireland as a source of high quality goods produced to the highest standards and under the best environmental conditions.</P>
    <P>The importance of the agriculture and food sector for the economy is best illustrated by a few key facts.  Exports of agriculture and food products in 1986 amounted to £2,200 million which is 23 per cent of total exports of all products. These figures, however, do not fully illustrate the importance of agriculture and the food processing sector because, unlike the bulk of our exports of industrial goods, our food exports are largely based on indigenous raw materials, which means that the real contribution to our balance of payments is correspondingly greater.  In addition, some £900 million was received by the Department of Agriculture from FEOGA in 1986.  When account is taken of all these factors the contribution by the food industry to our foreign currency earnings is very substantial. Gross output of the food industry in 1986 amounted to £5,000 million or 34 per cent of total manufacturing output in Ireland.  As a major employer the food processing sector employs approximately some 37,000 or 20 per cent of those engaged in manufacturing industry. All these factors highlight the particular role which the food industry plays in the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a working party on agriculture has been set up in the context of the Government's forthcoming programme for economic recovery. This consists of representatives of the main farming organisations and of Government Departments.  I am sure the working party will be putting forward valuable ideas on the way in which agriculture should develop in the years ahead, though the general macro-economic situation will have to play a major <Col N="769" /> role in the ultimate decisions by the Government in the final programme for growth and economic recovery.  This was the central part of the discussions which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself had with the farm organisations a few weeks ago.  The working group have already commenced their task and a follow-up meeting between the farm leaders and the Taoiseach and Ministers will take place in due course.</P>
    <P>A major problem facing producers is the current level of interest rates and the costs of servicing farm borrowings. Government policies have already had a major impact on interest rates and the further containment of Exchequer expenditure which we are seeking will result in a steady reduction in the level of interest rates.  However, even with the present fall in interest rates, they are still a deterrent to new investment, and are particularly discouraging the expansion of the national beef cow herd.  I am particularly concerned about this.  I have had discussions with one of the main banking groups in regard to a possible scheme of low fixed-interest loans to keep up cow numbers.  Some helpful and constructive ideas have emerged and I hope to broaden the discussions very shortly to embrace all the interests concerned.  In the overall situation the Government are, of course, working towards achieving more favourable interest rates, maintaining the low level of inflation and boosting confidence and hence investment in the economy, generally.  This will benefit the agricultural sector no less than other sectors of the economy and will serve to provide a stable and healthy environment in which all can prosper.</P>
    <P>The EC proposals on prices for agricultural products and on related measures for 1987-88 were presented in February and have already been discussed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on four occasions, the most recent in Brussels last week.  They will again be discussed at the Council's next meeting in Luxembourg from 15 June onwards.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, production <Col N="770" /> levels of many agricultural products substantially exceed consumption and export outlets.  The Council of Ministers took decisions in December and early March to modify support policies in the beef and dairy sectors to take account of the Community surpluses and budgetary problems in these sectors.  The prices and other proposals for 1987-88 represent a continuation of the changes in the CAP undertaken last year.  It is worth noting that since 1973 agricultural production in the Community has increased by 20 per cent while FEOGA guarantee expenditure has increased by almost 80 per cent in real terms.  However, not all of this increased support has reached producers in the form of improved incomes.  This is because an increasing proportion of FEOGA expenditure goes to facilitate the disposal of surpluses and in the management of intervention stocks.  This expenditure, of course, benefits producers but in an indirect manner.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals involve price reductions or the maintenance of existing prices for products of interest to Irish producers together with modifications in the other support arrangements which would also have a negative impact on prices.  These proposals were not acceptable to me and I rejected them. The compromise proposals put forward by the Belgian Presidency at last week's meeting contained some improvements for Irish producers and were a small step in the right direction.  However, they did not go far enough and in the forthcoming negotiations I will continue to seek additional improvements for Irish producers &mdash; in particular through maximum dismantlement of our existing negative MCAs, adjustments to the agrimonetary system to assist our food industry and more favourable treatment for our cereals' producers.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations to date.  I have emphasised the serious implications for Irish producers arising from the decisions already taken before I joined the Council. It is important that any further changes should be gradual and should avoid disproportionately penalising sections of <Col N="771" /> particular importance to our development. The Commission are determined to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; the CAP but my case is that a &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; CAP must take account of our particular needs, by continuing to play a vital role in maintaining farmers' income levels and helping to maintain a strong agricultural sector in our economy.</P>
    <P>The price negotiations this year have been especially difficult and it is by no means certain that solutions to all elements of the prices package will emerge during the next round of negotiations. I assure the House that I have made the Commission and my colleagues in the Council fully aware of my requirements. I would hope that agreement on most of the outstanding issues can be reached during the coming month.  An important milestone in international trading relations was achieved with the launching of a new trade round of negotiations by GATT Contracting Parties in September 1986 in Uruguay.  Ireland, along with other member states, welcomed this event as the aim is to encourage the expansion of world trade and thus help to promote world economic recovery and growth.  The objective is to have negotiations on all subjects completed in four years.</P>
    <P>While action is needed to rectify the international supply/demand imbalance in important commodities, we have to be careful about any proposals which emerge in relation to agricultural trade. Work to date in this area has been characterised by pressure on the Community from a group led by the US and Australia to eliminate export refunds and pressure to produce quick results.  This was very much in evidence at the recent OECD Ministerial meeting in Paris which I attended.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the main products, starting with milk.  Included under Subhead M4 is a sum of £20.9 million to cover intervention arrangements for butter and skim powder which indicates the high cost of providing this support.  In the public mind intervention is associated with the accumulation of <Col N="772" /> large stocks of unwanted agricultural produce.  That is an over-simplistic impression.  Intervention has been a vital support for our agricultural sector and its availability, especially during the serious imbalance in the milk sector in recent years, has prevented a serious drop in farmers' incomes and avoided severe loss for our economy.  Without it we would have been forced to sell off products on badly over-supplied export markets at very low prices.  However, it is really intended as a safety-net in times of genuine over-supply; it was never envisaged as a permanent market in itself. Indeed, because of the operation of the milk quota system, there are already some signs of a return to market buoyancy. We do not expect to have any intake of skim powder into intervention in Ireland this year.  Our existing stocks are quite low &mdash; only about 3,500 tonnes &mdash; and the market outlook for the remainder of the year is quite good.  Bord Bainne have been very successful in securing export contracts for skim powder for this year and I confidently hope for further success in this area.</P>
    <P>The situation as regards butter is somewhat less satisfactory because of the larger accumulated stocks and as many of the markets in oil producing countries which were significant during the 1970's and early 1980's have contracted.  At the same time there are some bright spots. Butter production throughout the Community generally will decline during 1987 by as much as 15 per cent.  It is expected that butter production in Ireland will also decline but this is not unwelcome.  In fact, we need to reduce our dependence on butter to a greater degree than most other member states and to diversify into a wider range of products which will not be so vulnerable to changes in EC regulations. It is clear that our milk sector is coming into a period of significant change.  It is also clear that difficult decisions and choices faced the industry in the immediate term.  Greater emphasis will have to be placed on the demands and requirements of the market and processors will have to be more firmly tuned into changing consumer tastes.  The <Col N="773" /> impact of the reduction in quotas generally throughout the Community will throw up new openings.  We must be able to react and capitalise on these opportunities.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front I would draw the attention of Deputies to the new regulations which I made recently to facilitate milk quota transfers.  There are a number of other issues which the milk industry will have to confront as a matter of urgency.  There will have to be greater co-operation and co-ordination between the various interests.  That is a more fundamental question and it cannot be done overnight.  These other issues are matters which can be tackled immediately and I do not consider that greater co-operation in any way diminishes the individuality or independence of individual co-operatives. The dilemma facing the industry is that the longer it waits the more intractable the problem will become.</P>
    <P>The cattle and beef sector fared reasonably well last year.  Cattle slaugh-terings at export plants reached almost 1.5 million head, an increase of some 1.4 per cent on 1985.  This spring cattle prices have been particularly good.</P>
    <P>The beef intervention support has been weakened following the Council decisins of last December and for the future there must be greater reliance on sales on the commercial market.  We will, of course, continue to have the benefit of the various EC supports but we must gear ourselves more and more to meeting the demands of the consumer.  We are, in fact, already seeing growth and changes in our beef industry.  The volume of beef exports was up significantly last year and the proportion of live cattle in total cattle and beef exports declined sharply.  Particularly welcome was an increase of 20 per cent in exports of processed beef products and 50 per cent in vac-pac beef.  These are remarkable increases by any standards and I look forward to further increases this year.</P>
    <P>A grant-in-aid amounting to £965,000 is provided for CBF.  While this figure shows a small reduction on the amount provided in 1986, it reflects, in the difficult budgetary situation in which we find <Col N="774" /> ourselves, a recognition by the Government of the importance of CBF's role. Developments at Community level over the past few years are tending to increase the importance of this role.  The reductions in milk quotas and the recent new arrangements for beef are expected to result in a decline in the Community beef surplus and this should, in time, create its own opportunities for us.  But the opportunities will have to be identified and grasped &mdash; hence the importance I attach to the CBF role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that shared by your colleagues?  That is the primary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the importance which I attached to the CBF role which the Minister will have noted and that is the primary consideration.  Of course, CBF's effectiveness is determined to a considerable extent by the quality of the product which they have to market.  Their publicity material emphasises the naturalness of Irish beef and sheepmeat production, but it is vital that the product matches the image which we are trying to create for it.  My Department provide a comprehensive service to the meat industry by means of a permanent veterinary and technical presence at all meat exporting plants and through the provision of the laboratory facilities which enable us to certify to the satisfaction of importing countries that our meat is produced under the most hygienic of practices and conditions and is free from harmful residues.  The cost of these services is recouped in part through the levying of veterinary inspection fees.  These fees are expected to yield over £7 million in 1987 and are brought to account under subhead N27.  This figure also includes about £1 million in respect of arrears of pig fees which we expect to recover this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards sheep, it is heartening to see the continuing expansion in the national flock.  This is also a major challenge.  All the extra lambs must be exported, and <Col N="775" /> export markets are increasingly discerning and insisting on lean, well-conformed lamb.  The message to farmers is clear: rely on good quality stock and sell lambs as they become ready for the market.  The benefits of secure access to continental markets must not be undermined by poor marketing.</P>
    <P>Persistence on quality is the sure way forward.  Under the auspices of my Department, all interests in the sheep sector are being asked to agree on a code of practice aimed at tightening quality standards at all stages from farmer to market.  The continuing expansion of lamb output lends added urgency to the need for such a code.  I am sure the co-operation of all interests will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming EEC review of the sheepmeat regime, I will be pressing for an overall reduction in import quantities while, at the same time, seeking harmonisation of Community support systems with the aim of creating a single market for lamb.  This would enhance the opportunities for increased returns for Irish exporters.  The outcome of this review is important for us since it will establish the framework for the future.</P>
    <P>Although slow in starting, there is now clear evidence that the much needed rationalisation of pig slaughterhouses is beginning to get under way.  It is vital for the sake of the pigmeat industry that there be no let-up in completing the programme, since this is one of the areas clearly identified as capable of conferring substantial cost economies to the pigmeat sector.  A number of sizeable investments have been announced over the past few months by me and there are some more in the pipeline.  All will benefit from the increase in the rate of FEOGA contribution which, coming on top of the IDA grant, can provide a grant-aid level of up to 75 per cent for approved investments in this sector.  While the FEOGA budget has been no more immune to cutbacks than the budgets in member States, it is heartening to be able to say that a specific sum has been provided for pigmeat investments and this will be ample <Col N="776" /> for the needs of the sector.  The Government in the coming months will be considering the best way to advance the promotion of pigmeat and I hope to be able to announce our plans on this fairly shortly.  Whatever about promotional arrangements for the industry, in the last analysis it will rest upon firms themselves to improve their market performance to maintain export markets, explore new opportunities and withstand growing import competition.  As one means of bringing about quality improvements, we will be introducing the new EEC lean meat grading arrangements at pig plants later this year.</P>
    <P>There is one note of concern.  That is the decline in pig numbers.  This, I suppose, was bound to happen with the uncertainty in the industry over the past two years.  We must now set about reversing the decline.  The best way of doing this is to be able to demonstrate to producers that all problems in this sector are being tackled with the aim of improving market returns and giving producers the degree of confidence they need, but producers themselves must also seek ways to improve their efficiency.  In short, there is no room for complacency in any section of the industry.</P>
    <P>The area under grain crops in 1986 was about 382,000 hectares which was less than in 1985.  The EC Commission's original farm price proposals for the 1987-88 marketing year included a price cut of 2.6 per cent for feed grains, the elimination of monthly increments and a severe limitation on access to intervention.  These proposals were not acceptable to Council which is now discussing a set of compromise proposals which do not include any reduction in the intervention price.  The centrepiece of the new proposals is an intervention system triggered if the average Community price falls below the intervention price, with monthly increments applicable from November and the buying-in price set at 93 per cent of the intervention price.  In the negotiations at Council I will be striving to ensure that intervention at a reasonable price level will be available in Ireland at harvest time when it is needed most.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> I might refer here to the slow rate of applications by small cereal producers for refund of the co-responsibility levy.  In their own interests producers should send in their applications without further delay.</P>
    <P>This year marks a change around in the fortunes of Siúicre Éireann.  The interim unaudited accounts for the six months ended 31 March 1987 show net profits of £5.4 million compared with £1.2 million in the corresponding period last year.  It is expected that the final accounts will show a significant return to profitability this year.  I am arranging to have discussions shortly with the board to review their entire range of activities.</P>
    <P>An amount of £8.05 million has been provided for the farm improvement programme and the farm modernisation scheme.  This also covers the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  Unfortunately, in view of the time constraint I have not time to go into these but the record which I will place before the House will be there for Deputies to consider.</P>
    <P>I am looking, too, at ways to make the programme more effective.  For instance, with the reduced opportunities in some of the more traditional farm enterprises, I am examining the whole range of what may loosely be termed alternative farming enterprises to see which of them could be expected to give a reasonable profit to the farmer and which could fit into the Irish farming scene.  The enterprises that seem most promising at this stage are farm guesthouse tourism, deer farming and sport horses.  As I have said, we are looking at each of these enterprises in detail with a view to bringing forward proposals at an appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The western drainage scheme, which provided for field drainage of 150,000 hectares in the west, terminated at the end of 1986 on expiry of the relevant EC regulation.  I am hopeful the Commission will agree to my request to extend this scheme in view of the unfavourable weather conditions last year and I am very confident they will.  Similarly, I hope we can extend the application of the western development programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> As Deputies will be aware, the EC Commission have recently made proposals to the Council of Ministers on the subject of direct income aids for farmers. Discussions on the matter are still at an early stage and it is too soon to forecast what the outcome will be.  However, the renationalisation of agricultural policies cannot be supported by us and we must, therefore, be vigilant in our approach to the income aids proposals to ensure that the FEOGA guarantee transfers are not replaced by part contributions from our Exchequer.  The sheep and cattle headage schemes are also being maintained and I hope these will be of immense benefit to the areas most directly concerned. What I want to say about the classification and reclassification of disadvantaged areas is all contained in the text of my speech and I have put it on public record in an address which I gave to the IFA recently.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the advisory services which have become much more effective now with the implementation of the client enterprise system based on the district unit.  The Government are convinced it is entirely reasonable that ACOT should secure an appropriate contribution from the industry towards the cost of their professional and advisory services which rebound to the financial benefit of so many farmers.  Legislation to do this has been passed by the Dáil and is now in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>ACOT continue to give priority to agricultural training and their target of bringing 80 per cent of all new entrants into the Certificate in Farming is well on the way to achieving it.  I was pleased to announce recently that the European Commission have approved ACOT's scheme of vocational training.  The scheme incorporates ACOT's courses including the Green Certificate, and FEOGA assistance will be of considerable help to enable ACOT to maintain a high level of service.</P>
    <P>On the question of getting the maximum benefit from agricultural advice, education and research, the Government are conscious of the need <Col N="779" /> for close co-ordination of and co-operation between ACOT and AFT to ensure a cost effective and efficient service to the industry.  The liaison between the bodies at board level has recently been strengthened by the appointment of a chairman common to both organisations. I will be considering further rationalisation measures.  A common board was appointed, and I think this course will have certain advantages in helping to achieve better use of the substantial resources provided by the two bodies.  I will be considering this carefully.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that family inheritance and tradition no longer are sufficient qualifications for managing profitable farm enterprises in this highly competitive era.  I am determined to ensure that all the resources available to me through An Foras Talúntais and ACOT advisory and educational services are brought to bear on this scene to ensure that our young farmers, who will be the guarantors of the future, will have available to them knowledge, advice and technical ability thereby guaranteeing the future of this very important sector.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of this huge sector I want to repeat that I regret it has not been possible for me to read into the record all that is contained in the text I have prepared, not within the space of half an hour.  Might I just ask the House to take it as if it were on the record of the House.  I would ask Deputies to feel free to comment on each aspect as though I had actually delivered the entire text.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I am somewhat concerned at the lack of time for a full debate on this most important subject.  Indeed, in relation to the <Col N="780" /> written word, I have been flicking through the balance of the Minister's speech and I find that page 24 is missing. It would be helpful if we could be furnished with a complete copy.  Apart from anything I have to say in this debate I want to study the matter in greater detail in time to come.</P>
      <P>I have to say that for Fianna Fáil in agriculture the honeymoon is over.  After three months in office it is clear that the utterly irresponsible promises given, when in opposition, involving expenditure of over £200 million have been forgotten.  It is clear that a cosmetic change in Agriculture House has been the substitute for real action in coping with the problems of our agricultural industry.  Already it is clear that a hunger for publicity and media hype was the main motivating force and hallmark of the administration rather than an ability to manage the problems of the industry or a real willingness to tackle those problems. Perhaps the less said about the irresponsible promises the better at this stage.  However, it is fair to raise the question as to whether the leopard can or will change its spots.  Opposition irresponsibility is not a good starting point from which to launch and establish an effective and responsible administration.</P>
      <P>Of cosmetic change we have had plenty.  First, the promised creation of a new Department of Agriculture and Food has been achieved by simply adding &ldquo;and Food&rdquo; to the existing notepaper. Then we had the Office of Food established but without any budget.  The next step was the establishment of An Bord Glas in as hasty and ill-conceived a manner as is imaginable.  While I do not want to be overly critical at this stage surely it is fair comment to suggest that this type of newspaper headline management is no substitute for the detailed preparation necessary to bring about substantive changes of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention of newspaper headlines serves to recall press conferences and announcements about some of the matters mentioned by the Minister.  For instance, there was the reference to the FEOGA package for pig processing; if I recollect <Col N="781" /> correctly the figure involved was £50 million. There was another one in relation to the development of support for processing in the dairy sector where the figure involved was £143 million.  It would have served to present a clearer, more honest picture had the Minister mentioned that these had been negotiated by the prevous administration.  Perhaps it was an oversight.  Presumably, when the Minister is making announcements about legislation providing for veterinary control and hygiene at animal slaughtering premises or national dairying legislation he will not be guilty of the same oversight. I note that he referred in the course of his remarks to proposals in that regard. I do not see that the Minister had anything to say by way of highlighting the fact that these matters were under discussion and in preparation for the last couple of years, that the heads of Bills in these areas had been prepared and circulated by the previous administration.  I would encourage the Minister to finish off the job.  At the same time it would hardly be honest or correct to suggest that the very detailed work involved in the preparation of these measures was the product of 10 weeks of ministerial office by the present incumbent.</P>
    <P>Essentially this administration will be judged on what they do rather than on what they say, on what they achieve rather than on any artificial headlines. The first major test in this regard will be the outcome of the EC price negotiations. In this regard the Minister has set his own targets.  I do not intend to comment on those negotiations in detail at this stage.  The Minister, while abroad, represents the country and I want to see him secure the best possible deal in these negotiations.  He will be judged on whether he achieves his own targets.  But we will want to see him secure and achieve the targets he has set out in the various areas &mdash; the full devaluation of the green £ and complete dismantlement of the existing negative MCAs.  We want to see the maintenance and protection of beef intervention.  We will want to see relief for the besieged cereals sector.  We will want to see encouragement, rather <Col N="782" /> than curtailment, of support for the sheepmen.  We want to see a ray of hope for all those in dairying in these days of production quotas.  These are some of the targets the Minister has mentioned.  I support him in his efforts to achieve them.  Perhaps I could add one other aspect which I raised in a Parliamentary Question to the Minister recently.  Unfortunately the Minister was in Brussels when the question was raised.  It is my opinion that the Minister should use the final negotiating procedure to secure the formal approval of the application for reclassification of disadvantaged areas submitted to the Commission by the Fine Gael Government.  I will not say any more on the issue of the price negotiations at this stage.  I will wait until they have been completed.  If at that stage, the Minister achieves his own targets &mdash; some of which I have highlighted &mdash; I will be the first to say: well done.  If, on the other hand, he is unable to emulate the negotiating successes of his predecessor I will have plenty to say.</P>
    <P>Now that the honeymoon is over, in the months ahead I will not be opposing merely for the sake of opposition.  That precedent established by Fianna Fáil in office has nothing to commend it.  I believe it would only be a millstone around our necks when we return to power, perhaps sooner rather than later, as I believe it to be a millstone around the necks of the present Government.  I will be quite prepared to come up with constructive proposals and policies when these are developed.  But I do reserve the right to critical comment when justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to focus on one area of major concern needing to be strongly highlighted.  That is the seemingly total disregard of the position of young farmers by the present Government.  We have had a combination of measures which would support that thesis.  We have had the refusal to extend the stamp duty exemption.  I am sure the Minister is aware of how effective that exemption was in the past in encouraging the earlier transfer of land.  There is no need for me to highlight the importance to this country of attempting to continue the <Col N="783" /> trend which was so much accelerated by the imaginative introduction of that proposal by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>However, that is not the only factor that concerns me in relation to the position of young farmers.  I am very concerned about the abolition of the installation aid.  This was introduced early in 1986 and was dropped by the present administration immediately they came to power.  The amount involved was not very substantial but was of major significance in the many transfers of land. A sum of £5,000 was available as the first installation to farmers under 35 who had the right educational qualifications.  It also has to be borne in mind that it attracted 50 per cent EC subvention.</P>
    <P>I am not one who suggests that huge sums of money should be spent without giving some indication as to where those moneys should be found but we are not talking about huge sums of money in this case; we are talking about £500,000.  In the context of the Government finances and of the Department of Agriculture Vote that sum is not a significant one.  If the Minister was committed to finding this money by way of reallocation or of savings in other areas, it could be done. I strongly urge the Minister to actively pursue the possibility of, at the very minimum, reintroducing the installation aid in relation to young farmers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of stamp duty and there was also the question of the installation aid.  Now we have a 40 per cent reduction in the budget of the farm apprenticeship board, a third prong, as it were, in the stick to beat the young farmer.  While I appreciate the overall problems in relation to the finances, a combination of these three measures focusing on the young farmer indicates there has not been any great degree of thinking as to their overall effect on young farmers.  Time does not permit me to deal with this matter in greater detail at this stage.  I will leave it with the exhortation to the Minister to do whatever is possible to have the scheme reintroduced at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> We talked about money and I understand the Minister's problems in this regard.  If you put it in the context of the decision to abolish the land tax &mdash; more can be said about that on the Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not quite sure what negotiations and discussions took place but we will get to the bottom of it in due course.  According to the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement this will cost the Exchequer £9 million and all for the sake of the small number of farmers who wanted to get rid of the land tax.  In the light of what happened in that case, I ask the Minister to reconsider the installation aid and other aspects.  I do not intend to voice my views on that issue in greater detail at this stage.  I will reserve them for the Finance Bill.  It is obvious the decision to abolish the land tax was a lunatic decision and will be totally unacceptable to most farmers.  It is not a question of the consideration of the tax itself. It cannot be considered on its own.  It has to be considered in the context of the alternative which is a full accounts system.  The full message will reach this Government when the forms are sent to the farmers and when they realise what the full alternative means.  It will mean that a path will be worn to the accountants' offices and the money which would have been paid to the Exchequer will be paid to the accountants instead, and more along with it.  That will be the result of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot have total sympathy for a Government which plead inability to pay in relation to any proposals I put forward. In the short time available to me it is not possible to respond in full to the Minister's speech.  I hope we will have an opportunity of debating this matter in the next session, which debate will perhaps be more open-ended.  It is not possible at this stage for me to put on record some <Col N="785" /> of the earlier ideas which I had in relation to the development of agricultural policy or to respond to the many points raised in the Minister's speech.  The various aspirations mentioned in his speech are ones that I can support.  I want to see the various developments to which he aspires achieved.</P>
    <P>One sentence in the Minister's speech stands out.  He said the Government's approach is not based on exhortation alone.  That sentence stands out in that it highlights what we have had from this Government to date, lots of exhortation but nothing else.  I encourage the Minister, in the months ahead, to give us less of the exhortation and more detailed planning and constructive input into the development of the agricultural and food industry.  He should give us the details of how this is being done.  We all know about the aspirations and the exhortation &mdash; now we want action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement but, like the previous speaker, I have not had time to examine it.  It describes generally the progress the Minister has made to date since he assumed office.  Having no previous experience of this House, I took it that we were here to debate the Estimate.  I examined it and I feel there are a number of points in relation to it, as it is laid out, that should be discussed and highlighted.  The net Estimate payable by the Exchequer to the Department of Agriculture is £181 million for this year.  The net contribution out of that £181 million in direct aid to agriculture is about £63 million which is £4 million less than the wages, salaries and travelling expenses of that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the Estimate I must agree that agriculture is a great industry for Ireland and for those who are employed in food processing.  It is a great employment creator everywhere except on the land.  There is £63 million directly payable to agriculture this year as against £67 million towards salaries and travelling expenses.  I cannot understand why we could not find the £14 million which was necessary to pay our contribution <Col N="786" /> this year for the reclassification of sheep areas that are less severely disadvantaged into more severely disadvantaged areas, a cost which would have been a once-off transaction because £7 million would be recoupable next year.  When we extract a net figure to be paid by the Exchequer this year for education, research and advisory services we find that the figure all the fighting was about, that all the soul searching was about, for agricultural scholarships is less than 1 per cent of the figure allocated &mdash; and much of it is recoupable under subhead B.12.  Are we serious when we consider agriculture and talk about investment and training?  I do not believe we are when we look at what is facing a farmer's son in terms of educational choice.  In any other field, be it AnCO, the regional technical colleges, the National Manpower schemes or even CERT courses, there is a net benefit of about £1,250 per annum to the student whereas with an agricultural course there is a minimum cost of £750 for the course alone.  The difference is £2,000 and I need not tell the House which courses these young people will be pushed into by their parents.  The statement that these scholarships will be given to people whose parents have an income under £10,000 this year will not create any budgetary problems for the people running these courses because nobody will be able to take them when they compare the agricultural courses with what is available in other areas.  This is the kind of service we are providing for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the levies.  The income from farmer contributions this year towards the cost of disease eradication is up by £5 million to £19.4 million.  There is an explicit and implicit guarantee that there will be a full round of testing this year for such a massive and ongoing contribution. However, I doubt if it will happen because the Minister for Finance intends to withhold 35 per cent of the £13.4 million fees to be paid to the veterinary surgeons who carry out the testing. This will represent, in any one year a £4.7 million withholding tax.  How can a service be provided if one-third of the fee is being held back?  There appears to <Col N="787" /> be a mix up between turnover and gross profit, and until this is clear in our minds, the full round of disease testing will not come to fruition.  This scheme is being financed at farmer level but it will not be financed at Department level.</P>
    <P>Speaking about levies in general, when we take the increase in the levies this year and look at the cutback on VAT refunds, we see that for milk alone it comes to about 4.6 pence per gallon.  If you add the levies and the .7 per cent loss in terms of VAT refunds, that is about a 5.5 per cent tax on turnover and a 20 per cent income tax on gross profits, and that is without taking any personal allowances into account.  It is about time farmers woke up to this direct tax because the general perception is that they are paying no tax.  Enough inroads are made into the price the farmer is receiving as against the EC guide price without killing the golden goose entirely.</P>
    <P>I turn again to our commitment to agriculture. The value of our agricultural exports is £2,500 million which contributes to one-third of Ireland's net exports, and we must take into account the low import content of the agricultural industry.  Compare what is available to young farmers with what is available to those starting their own business: the Minister for Industry and Commerce said every assistance is to be given to young entrepreneurs with no red tape to hold them back.  I ask the Minister if young farmers are to be excluded entirely from this elusive species of young entrepreneurs because even the few incentives which were available have been withdrawn. I refer to the farm installation scheme and the stamp duty exemptions.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent of the money for the farm installation scheme came from the EC and had a gross Exchequer cost of £2,800 per applicant.  I put it to the Minister that the installation grants which were productive, are peanuts in comparison with the number and value of the house improvement grants.  The linking of ACOT training courses to installation aid for young farmers and stamp duty <Col N="788" /> exemptions, and the subsequent withdrawal of these schemes, the only worthwhile and low cost incentives to young farmers, will certainly ensure that ACOT will not run out of money for training programmes this year because there will be very few people to train.</P>
    <P>I personally deplore these measures and propose that they be reconsidered where appropriate.  The scrapping of the stamp duty exemption makes it virtually impossible for farmers to transfer their farms to their sons.  If we are talking about farm restructuring, surely the removal of this concession is crazy; it will be a negative tax gain for the Minister for Finance because such transfers will not now take place.</P>
    <P>This year's proposal to recoup the estimated loss of revenue caused by the scrapping of the land tax and reducing the rate of refundable VAT to all farmers discriminates against those who have been in the tax net and settled their agreed assessment with the Revenue Commissioners.  These people are arbitrally been made to pay £500 to £1,000 each on average, notwithstanding the fact that they have discharged their agreed liability with the Revenue Commissioners. The general area of VAT refunds and levy increases has left the average small farmer with a 5 per cent turnover tax, irrespective of whether he has a taxable income.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the interest subsidy schemes.  Under subhead F.2, Payment Under Exchange Rate Guarantees on Agricultural Loans, there is a reduction of 32 per cent.  Under subhead F.3, Interest Subsidy Schemes for nonDevelopment Farmers, there is a cut of 98 per cent and under subhead F.4, Interest Subsidy for Farmers in Severe Financial Difficulties, there is a reduction of 77 per cent.  On the one hand we are throwing money and schemes at one section of the business spectrum and on the other withdrawing them from those needing help most.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction in the level of grants under the farm improvements scheme.  They are so low now that the Minister should scrap them altogether <Col N="789" /> and take the moneys allocated for them and their administration costs and put them into an exchange rate guarantee for agricultural loans and low interest loans for farm development and let farmers get on with their job instead of being bogged down with bureaucracy and red tape.  If agriculture is to be market driven, let there be the necessary incentives in cheap development money.  Why do we have to have all this hand holding, molly coddling and guiding?  There is precious little of it when a farmer gets into difficulties.  I contend that farmers know what they want, cheap development money.  They know how to carry out the development work and are willing to do it if they get the proper incentive.</P>
    <P>The reality is brought home when one considers the western package scheme. Of the 25,000 farmers earmarked for aid under that package since 1981 only 1,250, or 5 per cent, have succeeded in getting any aid.  The scheme is now half way through its course and of the £50 million budgeted for development work only £1.79 million has been paid out to date.  Farmers in the west have suffered as a result.  We cannot call that progress. The cost of administering the package must be colossal.</P>
    <P>Small farmers living in disadvantaged areas must produce three sets of accounts, for taxation, for farm improvement aid and for social welfare assistance. We are all aware that because the average income in the west is so low most farmers there are entitled to social welfare assistance.  There is room for rationalisation there.  Sanity should prevail and one set of accounts should be accepted for all purposes.  It should not be necessary to produce three sets of accounts for an enterprise that is finding it difficult to break even.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, on the progress made in regard to the food industry.  Many difficulties have to be surmounted and I do not think the general public appreciate what is involved.  We have heard a lot of talk about alternative farm enterprises <Col N="790" /> but if farmers embark on them they will have a lot of headaches and will be short of money.  I do not think they will come to anything.  All alternative farm enterprises should be carefully vetted.  Provision should be made in the Estimate to assist in the production and marketing of such alternative farm enterprises.  Any money invested at farm level should attract the same benefits as money invested by entrepreneurs engaged in further processing outside the farm gate.  I am referring in particular to capital relief.  In start-up years, and subsequent years, capital relief can be written off when the person who has invested in it sees fit to do so. Farmers are discriminated against in that they can only write off 30 per cent of their capital investment in any one year.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should run away with the idea that we will be able to solve the problem in regard to imports overnight. However, we should be doing a few simple things.  The glut of dairy products in the EC is brought about by the importation of dumped surplus by-products from America and the Middle East.  After producers go through the costly subvention system in the EC they have to fight for their place on the market against cheap yellow fat imports.  We could do a lot at home in regard to the regulating of the primary products before we get carried away about the secondary products for which we have a very limited market.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the position in regard to the grain industry.  Is the Minister aware that we import £150 million worth of feed stuffs annually?  It makes good sense to use the feed produced at home.  Ireland has a reputation in Europe of being ecologically pure and I wonder why we have to produce our feed on imported raw materials that do not enjoy that status.  Why must we put some of our produce into intervention and force our farmers to look elsewhere to earn a livelihood?  Farmers could be gainfully employed producing wholesome food on their land.  We are importing too many substitutes, particularly products that we are trying to sell in Europe as home grown.  If we are not <Col N="791" /> careful we will go down the same road as the factory farms on the Continent which are the root cause of all our troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Estimate for what I, and my party, consider to be the country's most important industry. In view of its importance it was with considerable disappointment, though not surprise, that I studied the Estimate figures in detail.  At a glance the figures show that the industry though sited in Ireland is controlled from Brussels where the strings are pulled.  The first subhead I should like to comment on is &ldquo;Salaries and Wages&rdquo; which shows a very moderate increase in wages for staff.  That reflects a reduction in staff numbers as well as a drop in real earnings for the remainder of the staff.  It is important not to underestimate that reduction both in terms of the implications for the export of young people who would otherwise flock to the industry and the added disincentive which low wages offer to talented individuals who must now find outlets for their talents in private enterprise.  That double loss to the industry is immeasurable.</P>
      <P>In referring to the more direct impact on the agricultural industry as a whole, I wish to comment on the Estimate as it affects education, research and advisory services.  In those areas the Government have dealt a body blow to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major tourist attraction, the Botanic Gardens, has been allocated an increase of 1 per cent which is not in line with inflation and hardly gives a vote of confidence to the staff and advisers of this beautiful scenic attraction.  The miserable increase says a lot about Fianna Fáil's real commitment to tourism for the capital city.  Similarly, An Foras Talúntais only get a 3 per cent increase for general purposes and no increase at all for capital purposes.  The irony of this cut to An Foras Taluntais can be measured by the words of the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture during the debate on the 1986 Estimates.  Deputy Noonan, who is <Col N="792" /> now the Minister for Defence, said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>In order for the milk industry to get away from intervention production we must broaden the product range.  I agree this is important.  Here again the Minister and the Government have cut back their contribution to An Foras Talúntais who should be the body to research and develop new products. The very base of this industry is being cut away.</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from column 731 of the Official Report of 19 June 1986. Will the Minister explain to the House the reversal in judgment?  I am sure there is general agreement that the Fianna Fáil statement of 1986 makes a laughing stock of the finance now being provided to An Foras Talúntais.  Is it fair to assume that if Deputy Noonan had been appointed to the Department of Agriculture, having been Opposition spokesman for that area, he would be presenting a different Estimate to the House?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Deputies will need no reminder that a Bill was passed which imposes charges for ACOT services which has put an intolerable burden on disadvantaged farmers and which will serve to ensure that agriculture here will develop even more rapidly along a two-tier system, one of the many two-tier areas in existence.  Poor farmers will be left with non-viable and badly serviced farms and the rich farmers who can afford to pay for the services will forge ahead. I have already publicly condemned these charges and it is relevant to reiterate it here in the context of the Estimate debate lest we forget there are already cuts which were well established within a week of the Government taking office.</P>
    <P>The spin-off of the cuts to ACOT will have far reaching effects on the industry as a whole.  ACOT now have a deficit of over £2 million and have had to impose a cut of £140,000 on the Farm Apprenticeship Board.  This means a reduction in the number of apprentices in the industry which is a disgrace.  This training scheme was the only one to offer youngsters from <Col N="793" /> non-farming backgrounds an opportunity to train for a career in agriculture. With the cutbacks a few hundred places will go every year, thus leaving a vacuum and cutting off a valuable opportunity for younger people to pick up some of the most gifted skills from the older and master farmers.  Cuts in education, training and advisory services cannot be made up next year or the following year and the repercussions of such cuts last for years and hold back vital research and development in the industry.  We cannot afford these cuts, it is false economy and a blow to an industry which is already decades behind European farmers.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to make some comments on the overall make-up of the Estimate for Agriculture.  There is not one indication that the Minister has defined a priority for the industry.  There are cuts in research and education, a run down of piecemeal disease eradication and farm modernisation schemes, schemes to increase the national herd and so on.  There is nothing to indicate a change in attitude to the industry or indeed a glimmer of hope that the Minister has a national plan for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the backbone of industry in Ireland, every Deputy in the House will remember that lesson learned from primary school teachers.  At this stage we should ask ourselves what is the industry, what is its produce, who benefits, where is the cheap, fresh food and the jobs?  It is time the Minister for Agriculture and Food came into the House and produced a plan for the industry, an industry which should be the backbone of this fledgling and struggling economy.</P>
    <P>A speech about EC subsidies, grants, aid and incentives is not an Irish plan for an Irish industry; it is an <i>ad hoc</i> response to the European economy.  Ireland will produce what it is told to produce by a group of Ministers in Brussels.  If they want beef we will produce beef; if they decide that there is an over-production of dairy goods they will introduce a quota; if there is a shortage of lamb, Ireland must go for sheep.  Likewise, if Europe is deficient in timber, Irish farmers will be <Col N="794" /> given incentives to grow trees.  This pattern of going for beef or lamb very clearly smacks of the agri-economy of the 1850s. There is no planning, just an <i>ad hoc</i> response to market forces.</P>
    <P>Tragically, this is the way agriculture has developed over the past ten years. We have had no increase in agricultural jobs.  Over the last four year period, in response to a question I asked, the Minister informed me that there was a reduction of 25,000 jobs in the agricultural area.  We have had no great increase in the production of cheap, fresh food for the home economy or for the industrial workforce around our cities. We have been limping along, propping up an industry which has become a burden on the economy rather than the backbone.  A quick profile of the agricultural industry shows that 12 million acres are utilised for agricultural purposes; 60 per cent of farms have disadvantaged area status; 11 million acres are used for pasture; one million acres are used for tillage of which 70 per cent is used for cereal growing.  There are 264,000 agricultural holdings and 67 per cent of these are less than 50 acres in size; 4.7 million acres are held by farmers over 55 years of age which represents approximately 35 per cent of agricultural area which can be utilised; 16 per cent of the workforce are employed directly in agriculture. This, in a nutshell, is Irish farming, an agricultural industry which is increasingly handicapped by the constitutional position on land ownership, an ageing farming community, a large designation under disadvantaged status and, to all intents and purposes, a closed industry.  This is why it is not producing the large quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables required and why there are so few jobs in and around the industry.  We need a radical transformation now.  With 16 per cent of the workforce in agriculture and 19 per cent on the dole, we are in the midst of a crisis and the Minister will have to address this now instead of engaging in a series of cuts to reduce the industry to a miserable appendage of the European fruit bowl.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have a clear and <Col N="795" /> concise policy on agriculture.  We view it as a viable industry.  We believe it should be developed to provide for as many families as possible on the land and to create downstream jobs in the horticultural and food processing industries.  This policy requires a courageous approach to the industry and we need to take a radical look at land ownership.  Over 90 per cent of agricultural land in Ireland is owner occupied with the remainder largely operated on the conacre system.  As I mentioned already, a substantial number of holdings are held by older farmers who, for a number of reasons, are unable to work the land or do not have access to new technologies or equipment to produce from the land.  There can be no doubt that these farms are not producing anything like their potential yields and will not do so until they are placed in the hands of younger and better qualified farmers who have the incentive to generate greater income for their families.</P>
    <P>Since land in Ireland passes to new management through transfer of ownership, the age at which management control passes is normally advanced. Thus the problem is continued and is unlikely to change over the next decade unless the Government tackle the whole thorny question of land ownership.  I am not suggesting the Government should forcibly take the land from families who have worked it solidly for years, but the question of rigid ownership needs to be addressed.  Large ranches should be taken over and redistributed in economic, family size units.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways of opening the land up to younger people.  One is by a levy or tax on non-productive land which would provide the incentive to lease land which is not being worked by the owner.  Another way would be to initiate a serious and generous retirement plan for ageing farmers.  This latter scheme has never been seriously adopted and the necessary assurances were never provided for farmers interested in it. Farming is a particularly difficult way of life and many elderly farmers would gladly lease the land to the State or to <Col N="796" /> younger farmers if they could be guaranteed a comfortable retirement and be assured of a reasonable income.  With this approach, the State would have to ensure that there is a body of skilled farmers to take up areas of the industry and to work the land in the interests of all the people. This Estimate shows no investment in education of young people to take over viable farms in future.  The reverse is the case, with serious and damaging no funding and cutbacks in the minimal existing agricultural educational programme.</P>
    <P>Part time farming is also a problem for agriculture.  With such a huge concentration of farms designated as disadvantaged, many farm families rely on an industrial wage alongside a small agricultural income.  This has led to a Catch-22 situation where the farm is not developed or extended and yet the small industrial income pushes the family out of any entitlement to major EC grants or schemes.  The net effect is that thousands of acres are producing at less than their potential yield while owners work in local factories or with Bord na Móna to subsidise the family income.  Part time farmers are also denied access to new information and skills because their workday is divided and they are unable to avail of valuable agricultural services. With over one-quarter of the country's agricultural land absorbed by part time farmers, the enormity of the problem cannot be under-estimated.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's position on charges or taxes on land is equally clear.  Ownership of land must impose obligations as well as conferring advantages and benefits to the owner.  Land is a scarce resource and its productive use for agriculture is central to our economy.  It is, therefore, incumbent on the Government to ensure that this source of wealth creation is used to yield the maximum benefit to society as a whole.  We simply cannot afford to see large tracts of land left to lie idle or under-used.</P>
    <P>The removal of charges on land makes it possible for large farmers to hold on to the land without feeling any obligation to use it productively or to pass it on to <Col N="797" /> somebody who will use it productively. The removal of the land tax and the abolition of the farm classification office were the most regressive moves of this Government.  It is the responsibility of the Minister in responding to this debate to indicate what he intends to do to ensure that the land, our basic natural resource, is not left in the preserve of the few and is not left idle.  Indeed, individual farmers and deputations from farm organisations have to come to see me as the Labour Party spokesman on agriculture and indicated to me that they were strongly in favour of a land tax. These deputations included not alone members of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association but also groups within the IFA who said they support a land tax system.  They represent farmers in what is accepted as the most productive area of farming &mdash; the 50 to 70 acre categories. The land tax was one of the more positive proposals which came from the previous Government.  The people who came to see me pointed out that the tax payable by farmers this year under the present systems will be exceeded by the amounts they will have to pay to accountants to prove their liability.</P>
    <P>In summing up on this point I would like to refer to a statement made by the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Noonan, while speaking on the 1986 Estimate.  He said that as part of a strategy Fianna Fáil would charge An Foras Talúntais and ACOT to provide as accurate an analysis as could be reasonably turned out with regard to the situation of farmers in different parts of the country.  He said that this analysis would take account of farm size, land quality, the main enterprise, the status of the owner, of the family and so forth and would include consideration of what way development aid could best be used to improve efficiency in output.  He went on to say that such information would be of great help in putting the national development plan into action.</P>
    <P>The farm classification office could have provided this information if it had not been abolished by the Government and Fianna Fáil in office could have <Col N="798" /> implemented at least that part of their policy.  I would like to remind the Minister that this work was done effectively and efficiently by the farm classification office.  Perhaps he would indicate whether the information is still available and when he proposes to move on the national development plan which was mentioned.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly but positively to the new and developing area of organic farming which was referred to by the previous speaker.  This is not only a method of producing wholesome and chemical and drug free food, it also enhances and protects our environment from the abuse of such substances and, most importantly, it has proved to be an economically viable form of farming. There is a growing market at home and abroad for such organically produced products.</P>
    <P>Standards are now being set for such products and I would stress the importance of setting standards at the highest possible level which our organic producers can reach thereby excluding those who simply wish to muscle in on the developing market I have referred to, in Europe in particular.  I would ask the Minister to respond as positively as possible to that point.</P>
    <P>In summing up what I have to say, the Minister's statement could easily have been delivered by his counterpart in Fine Gael.  If there had been no change of Government they could have switched scripts and delivered them in the House. They probably would have done so.  I believe the statement he has made will lead to no change in Irish agricultural practice.  Small farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Large farmers will continue to prosper in their near tax free havens. This will be the result of the Minister's policy which is unchanged from that of his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in their programme for national recovery identified the food industry as a key sector for growth.  It was recognised that there was a need to amalgamate and co-ordinate the activities of the various State agencies to achieve maximum potential and the best use of public moneys in providing for the needs of a modern developing food sector.  A criticism often made of the State's handling of the food industry is that it lacks a single focus as a result of the multiplicity of State agencies and Government Departments which are involved in servicing the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new departmental arrangements can now be looked on as a one-stop shop so far as the Government are concerned. This is an important development and will facilitate the adoption of a more integrated approach to the entire agricultural and food sector.  This sector has tremendous potential for development.  It has been evident for some time that there <Col N="800" /> is a need to get away from traditional commodity trading but, unfortunately, I have to report that progress has been slow.  It is, to say the least, unsatisfactory that the dairy industry still converts such a large volume of milk into bulk commodity products for which there is a difficulty in finding markets.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the beef sector there is still a large concentration on carcase beef, although I have to compliment those excellent people in the industry who have encouraged a shift away from live exports to the more developed products, such as vacuum packed beef.  Last year vacuum packed beef products accounted for over £100 million of the value of all beef products exported.  We have to get away from the traditional reliance on producing and manufacturing products just because we have the technology and know how to manufacture them.  Up to now we could sell into intervention but we will now have to look for new products to develop and in particular we will have to develop products which will have an increased shelf life and an enhanced value.  As we have a relatively small home market we need to develop products which have a longer shelf life and we must be able to get these products on the shelves of supermarkets on the Continent and around the world.  These products should be as fresh as possible and ready to eat.</P>
    <P>There is an additional difficulty in Ireland in that our production is seasonal. Increasingly in the future we will have to find ways of extending the shelf life, in fresh form, in particular, of both milk and beef.  The most efficient way to produce milk is from grass and farmers will need to be compensated very generously to produce milk during the winter months when they have to rely on concentrated feeding which is very expensive.  It would be cheaper to use modern technology and to store products in a fresh form than to force farmers to produce products during the more difficult months of the year.</P>
    <P>It is also clear from the changing CAP market arrangements that we will have to move in the direction of producing consumer products and that market research will have to be carried out.  The <Col N="801" /> first stage for companies involved in the food sector is for them to identify the needs of the consumer and then to supply those needs.  It is important that our food processors recognise that this is a highly competitive business.  Because of the nature of the international food business competition is intense.  In many foreign markets, the crowding of product areas necessitates a careful selection in target marketing.</P>
    <P>For this reason State aid will be directed towards companies with strategic marketing plans.  There are significant opportunities in these markets for quality products from our beef, lamb and pigmeat sectors, in particular.</P>
    <P>I would identify two main goals which should be aimed at by our food processors: (1) the creation of much more value added products in the beef, pigmeat and dairy sectors; (ii) the development of niches in both domestic and export markets.  I would not write off the domestic market as some people tend to.  The reality is that out of the total importation of agricultural products in the region of £1,000 million there should be a target area there for substitution of at least £175 million to £200 million and by any standards that is a considerable niche of the market and should not be under-estimated.</P>
    <P>For the development of the food industry we would have to establish a greater awareness of quality control so that produce being marketed is what the consumer wants and what the market place demands.  In this area of quality we will have to have excellence as the target and a change of attitude and culture inculcated in the industry where only pristine conditions at all levels of the industry will be adequate.  The presentday consumer is more conscious than ever before of the quality and naturalness of food and, in particular, in the area of residues of any kind, or preservatives.  The modernday consumer is particularly health conscious and in Ireland we have the advantage of an ideal geographical location.  We have an extremely good image in Continental Europe and around the world.  We should use that to the best advantage in having <Col N="802" /> Ireland as a good food producing island and the individual products enhanced all along the production and marketing chain.</P>
    <P>The home market is a relatively small market, although it should not be under-estimated, but for the high volume uptake of products we must look at the European Community with its 320 million people.  It is there that a tremendous opportunity exists for the development of the food industry.  That will not be done easily and it will require considerable commitment from the companies involved.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government will, through the aegis of various State agencies, be giving every encouragement to firms to improve their marketing performance and to increase their product development.</P>
    <P>Continuity of supply and the excellence of the service and continuity of service will be key elements in food marketing. We must be determined to ensure that everything will be done to have these elements form the basis of the marketing strategy of the food industry.  The various State agencies involved in the food industry have been directed to stress the necessity for quality in their dealings with companies seeking assistance.  In addition the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are currently examining the possibility of adapting an internationally recognised quality management system for the food industry.</P>
    <P>Management effort to achieve quality which show its result in the market place and failure to ensure quality will have disastrous effects on firms in particular and on the economy in general, because if there is one small problem with a particular food product in some supermarket in any part of the world, it reflects badly on the whole food industry and the whole economy.  It is incumbent on firms, companies and processors to be extremely vigilant in their adherence to quality and hygiene generally.</P>
    <P>In the area of marketing, firms in the food industry will be given every assistance by the Industry Development Authority. They will be encouraged to invest more in research and development to <Col N="803" /> promote product development.  I must say at this point that the uptake of grants in the research and development area is disappointing.  There are very attractive grants available to firms in the food industry for introducing research and development &mdash; grants of up to 50 per cent are available towards the cost of research and development of new products and manufacturing processes.  These grants cover development work carried out either in-house or by outside consultants.</P>
    <P>A specialist IDA service provides assistance in identifying new product opportunities arising from supplying other companies needs or from imports. In addition, grants of up to 50 per cent of direct in-company costs such as salaries, travel costs and expenses are available up to a maximum of £15,000, to assist companies to undertake studies necessary to identify new markets and products. For firms which wish to establish their own in-house research and development facility the IDA provide grants towards the capital costs involved, subject to a maximum of £150,000.</P>
    <P>The food industry has been reluctant to commit its resources to product development with the result that State research and development facilities are not fully utilised by the industry.  Some firms are unwilling, for one reason or other &mdash; I think confidentiality is probably one of them &mdash; but in 1986 only 46 research and development grants were awarded to firms in the food industry. This represents only 7 per cent of all research and development grants approved by the IDA.</P>
    <P>I should like to encourage the industry to take up more of that finance and use the very valuable assistance of the State agencies available in the area of product and process development.  We are not talking about totally new products.  We are talking about modifying existing products and bringing about small changes to tailor-make products suited to the modern day consumer.  Unless we do that and recognise that trends are changing, <Col N="804" /> then there is no real future for the processing and marketing end of the industry. It will be the job of the agriculture and food area to encourage and assist in every way the food industry to go along this road.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention in this regard the establishment of a national food research centre which will amalgamate the food research facilities of An Foras Talúntais and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards which are being actively pursued at present.  I would see that centre as providing the necessary dynamic for the food industry and having the commercial orientation and commercial activity very relevant and contemporary to the requirements of the industry.  State agencies must have regard to commercial life and in research and development in the food area personnel and agencies will have to take this particular orientation more and more in the future.</P>
    <P>Another area where product development could be promoted is in the area of joint ventures and licensing arrangements. Such arrangements provide significant opportunities for firms to avail themselves of advance technology and market access without incurring the financial burden which otherwise would be involved.  We have a number of examples of this type of arrangement in the Irish food industry which have worked out very well for co-ops and firms in the industry where, with joint ventures and licence arrangements, products which are new to Ireland but developed elsewhere around the world are introduced here, marketed and sold, not alone enhancing the industry but improving the balance sheet of various firms involved in that part of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see more activity involved in relation to this area of licensing arrangements because we have an industry, in particular, the dairy industry where even our largest co-ops <Col N="805" /> are relatively small compared with those of our competitors.  We do not have the capital resources required for entirely new product development.  The principal guiding State assistance to the industry in the future will be the encouragement of the production of quality products for which there is an identified consumer demand and to encourage the industry to become more involved in research and development facilities and to seek joint ventures with established overseas firms.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and An Foras Talúntais will play an important role in product development and technical expertise.  It will be necessary for companies to build up their marketing strengths and An Córas Tráchtála, CBF and other State agencies will provide valuable assistance in this area.</P>
      <P>State measures are now geared towards providing a suitable environment conducive to growth.  This policy takes cognisance of the fact that the marketplace must take priority at all times and determine the type of product which should be produced.  I am confident the measures now being put in place by the Government will bring about positive returns and lead to the full potential of the sector being realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Minister and the Minister of State.  I hope that they are not just expressions and platitudes and that there is a follow-up to them.  I know that the Minister and his Ministers of State are serious and conscientious about the need to do the things they have set out to do.  There is a certain platitudinal nature about many of the things they said because all of us have said many of those things in this House. Both the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy and Minister Walsh will remember saying much the same thing when they were sitting on this side of the House.  When I was sitting on the other side of the House I said the same things, as did other members of my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seriousness with which we set about doing the things that need to be <Col N="806" /> done in relation to agriculture and in particular the food processing industry will be determined by our ability to take the industry by the scruff of the neck, spend money where it needs to be spent and knock heads together where they need to be knocked together in order to spearhead a campaign that will set Ireland on a plateau hitherto unknown in the food processing area.  It might be better to rename the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Programme for National Discovery.  In that way it might be possible to discover how it is proposed to do the things we all agree need to be done.  Then we could get down to the brass tacks of deciding what is possible and what is merely a grand idea to debate at a particular time in front of a receptive audience.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the food processing industry and the obvious scope for development in that area.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, has a special responsibility in this area.  I wish him every success.  I agree with many of the points made by the Minister that there has been an over-reliance on intervention for dairy products.  I know the Minister's intention is to get away from that over-reliance.  I am quite sure we will all support him so that we can generate an enthusiasm for other downstream products and diversify into other areas where there are markets growing at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly said that markets should be consumer-driven.  Many markets have not yet appeared.  These markets can be created and cultivated by virtue of good marketing techniques. One has only to think back a few short years when items such as garlic cheeses and other relatively recent innovations in the dairy sector were unknown in this country.  These items were available on the European and world markets.  I remember being told by people in the business that there were no markets in Ireland for such products yet foreign producers were able to bring in those products and create markets where they had not existed.  This has to be taken very <Col N="807" /> seriously into account by the industry and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Diversification has gained some considerable scope and popularity in recent times.  This is natural since many areas are over-supplied and there are mountains of certain types of food.  There is a need for diversification in agricultural production generally.  Whenever a huge campaign for diversification into other areas was mounted in the past, somehow, somehwere, something went wrong.  A couple of years later gluts appeared in particular areas.  Farmers can tell of the different advice they were given over the years in relation to various products. Having gone into those areas lock, stock and barrel many farmers found themselves afloat with no way of being anchored. That is one of the problems that existed in the past.  I hope we can learn from those unfortunate experiences so that we can ensure that where diversification takes place it is not with such an abandonment as to create another problem.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the mistakes that were made in the past, mistakes created by previous Governments and perhaps all of us in this House.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the fact that this country is in a unique position from the point of view of food production in the sense that we have a relatively pollution-free environment.  We have the ability to produce products which are to a considerable extent devoid of the pollutants which affect the environments of many of our competitors.  We had to capitalise on our pollution-free environment and to market our products on that basis. However, there is no point marketing products on that basis if those products do not live up to those standards.  Ireland is an island.  We are relatively remote from Central Europe but we still have access to the European and world markets. We should capitalise to a far greater extent on our slight remoteness by producing the products the world and European markets go for.  If we can do this and nothing else we will have achieved something great.  It is up to us to capitalise <Col N="808" /> on our products, our pollution-free environment and the huge markets that are available.  It is up to us, the Minister and his Department to find the ways and means of developing those markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the slow uptake of R &amp; D grants through the IDA. I am aware of that slow uptake.  I ask the Minister to carry out a survey among the people who have made applications for feasibility grants to find out from them why they did not proceed with these grants.  I believe that some remarkable discoveries could be made in that area.  I respectfully suggest the Minister might do that.  I would be very interested in the results and I am sure the Minister would find the results equally interesting.  It is something that has been brought to my attention and to the Minister's attention on numerous occasions and something needs to be done about it along those lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the shelf life of food.  This is becoming increasingly important.  The shelf life of food is increasing and bringing benefits to the producers and to the food processing sector as a whole.  Today's consumer is looking for food products that are free of additives and preservatives.  Considerable concern has been expressed in the UK at the level of additives and preservatives in many foods, so much so that a brochure has been produced to educate the UK consumer to be able to readily identify the additives and preservatives which are common in food products at the moment.  As we know, most of those preservatives are indicated by way of a letter and we are aware of the reservations in medical quarters about E-type additives.  The food processing industry should gear itself to deal with a more educated consumer.  There will be increasing resistance to preservatives and additives of that nature in food.  The resistance will be far greater over the next few years than it is at present because it is only now that the consumer is becoming aware of their existence.</P>
    <P>The use of sprays and fungicides in the growing of vegetables is another area where the consumer is becoming more <Col N="809" /> aware.  Those who have a knowledge of sprays and fungicides will readily recognise that 25 or 30 years ago a minimum amount of sprays and fungicides were used in comparison to what is used today. The strength of the sprays and fungicides used today has been increased dramatically because through constant use they become ineffective.  Anybody with a knowledge of agriculture will recall that one famous weedkiller used in the early sixties had a dramatic effect on the control of weeds but after five or six years it was ineffective.  It has now been superseded by sprays many times more powerful and more expensive and still these sprays do not have the same dramatic effect on weeds and pests.  We must work in these two areas if we are to have a consumer driven, market led, food processing industry and if we are to capitalise on import substitution.  If we achieve success in those areas we will have done agriculture and the industry generally a great favour not only in this country but in Europe as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to marketing, presentation and labelling, we have all stated in this House on numerous occasions the importance of good, clean production, presentation and marketing.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Paddy Hegarty, made considerable progress in relation to the grading and labelling of potatoes in particular.  It has worked reasonably well but it is still not 100 per cent effective.  It is still possible to buy potatoes which are not labelled and which if they are graded are poorly graded and it is still possible to buy anywhere in the country, imported potatoes which are not labelled.  It is sad this state of affairs exists given the commitment to the industry and it is very damaging to the industry that it should continue.  I would ask the Minister to take it upon himself to bring about the elimination of unmarked products in this area.  Our own producers will readily state they want grading facilities and labelled products to protect the industry.</P>
    <P>In County Kildare, in co-operation with the IFA, local co-operatives have done tremendous work in producing potatoes and other vegetables which are <Col N="810" /> well packed, well presented and which are all labelled.  There cannot be a question of a difficulty arising afterwards as to the owner of the product and that has done tremendous good for the industry in relation to improving standards.  There will be an even greater improvement in standards if more emphasis is placed on that area.  I am not speaking off the top of my head but from the experience of constituents in my area.</P>
    <P>Another area to which the Minister should devote time is education and training for the food processing industry. Peculiarly with the exception of one or two colleges, RTCs and the NIHE in Limerick, there has been little emphasis on marketing in the food processing industry.  I mean no disrespect to the Ministers opposite, but until recently the position of the chief executive of large dairy co-ops was the preserve of a degree holder in dairy science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing, but it is amazing that such great emphasis was not placed on a marketing degree.  It is only recently that it is becoming popular to recognise the attributes of a holder of a marketing degree in these areas and since then there has been a considerable improvement.  It would be of tremendous benefit to the industry if regional colleges were to specialise in training, with emphasis on marketing, for the food processing industry and if those colleges located in predominantly agricultural areas so that the industry could benefit greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time left is not sufficient to deal with the subject, but I will say a brief word in relation to farm tax which has also been mentioned by other speakers.  I know that both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil campaigned vigorously against the farm tax and probably the Fianna Fáil Party, now in Government, felt a need to deliver on that promise. It is one of the very few promises they kept.  It would be very interesting if they were to consult directly with farm families right across the board and find <Col N="811" /> out exactly what they think.  Probably they would find the majority in the acreage range from 100 acres downward would be well and truly in favour of retention of the farm tax.  Those farmers &mdash; and all farmers &mdash; will pay at least as much, if not more, under the revised system.  Also, the State, through the Revenue Commissioners, is burdened further with having to go into the various liabilities most of which are minimal, and the cost there must be in the region of £15 milion or £20 million.  If the Minister has another look at that he might find that promise was not as important to keep as some of the others which, unfortunately, his colleagues have not kept.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make concerns a policy of irradiation for the killing off of bacteria in food processing.  It has become a very popular method of ensuring a longer shelf life.  This is causing some concern in medical circles in this country, in the UK and in Europe.  It could have a great impact on our food processing industry if we could say that we could produce food in a pollution-free environment, free of additives or preservatives and free of bacteria at the same time.  That would be the biggest boost our industry could get and I see no reason why we should not capitalise on that at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments about the horticultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we joined the European Community in 1973 growers here were encouraged to produce those crops which it was felt were best suited to conditions in Ireland.  At that time we could protect and help the industry by, for example, imposing quantitative restrictions at certain times of the year on imports of the more important products such as tomatoes and apples.  In the transition period from 1973 to 1977 the quantitative restrictions had to be removed and customs duties were phased out.  In the intervening period, therefore, we have been subject to the full rules and regulations of <Col N="812" /> the European Community.  In addition, many horticultural crops were and are in overproduction in the EC and we were subject to sophisticated competition which we were not fully equipped to face. One must also mention the energy crisis of the seventies which had a profound effect on all sectors of the economy including, of course, the horticultural industry.  Like others this sector also came under pressure due to the general recession.  As a result of all these things combined, our small developing industry was exposed to the massive onslaught of foreign imports and our fragmentation and lack of cohesiveness led to a shrinking industry with very serious problems in some sectors.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> highlighted the importance of horticulture in the economy and undertook to implement a plan for its recovery. The build up of imports is a matter of major national concern and decisive action is needed to arrest and reverse the decline in Irish horticulture.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's strategy was the establishment of an Bord Glas.  As Deputies know, the establishment of such a board requires legislation. Because of the need to examine existing structures, arrange consultation with interested parties, the various pressures on the Government's parliamentary programme and so on, the legislative process takes time.  The Government felt, however, that the matter was so urgent that a non-statutory board along the lines set out in the policy document should be established immediately on an interim basis so that no time would be lost in getting the necessary work under way.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that work on the preparation of the legislation will be given priority within the office of horticulture which has been established in the Department of Agriculture anf Food. The services of this office will, of course, be also available to the interim board to help in every posible way.  The terms of reference of the interim board are, broadly speaking, to promote the development of the horticultural industry <Col N="813" /> so as to increase output, replace imports, promote exports and help generate employment.  These terms are sufficiently broad to give them maximum flexibility in their work.  The board will, obviously, be free to determine their own procedures and will wish to consider the best transitional arrangements to facilitate the attainment of the objectives which have been set for the statutory Bord Glas.  I feel it is important that progress should be made quickly on the problems facing the industry.</P>
    <P>The quantity of fruit and vegetables being handled by the Irish supermarkets at present is very significant and makes up a very high proportion of Irish sales. Both the quantity and range of produce on offer have increased and quality has improved enormously in recent times. The consumer of today is discerning, alert and educated and no longer tolerates a badly presented or poor quality product. The consumer also wants access to the widest possible range of products.  It is, therefore, axiomatic that Irish produce, to earn its place on the shelf, must be of the highest quality and match the import lines in terms of price, presentation and continuity of supply.  These are the facts and we ignore them at our peril.  There are encouraging signs that some grower organisations are working satisfactorily with the multiples.  Their requirements can and are, being met.  However, few Irish growers on their own can guarantee continuity of supply and, consequently, producer groups are essential if the Irish grower is to compete effectively with imports.  There have been positive moves in this direction in recent years but progress has been too slow.  As a priority, I have suggested that An Bord Glas should examine ways and means of speeding up this process.</P>
    <P>The broad objectives for the board have been set out but the objectives for horticultural development will not be achieved without some imaginative thinking, hard work and a positive commitment on the part of all interests within the sector.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to refer to <Col N="814" /> what I feel is unfair and unfounded criticism about An Bord Glas.  I find it hard to understand why some commentators have decried the fact that the Government moved so quickly to set up the board.  It is very simple; the Government wanted to lose no time in getting the work of recovery under way and I cannot see, therefore, why speedy action in a vital area like this should be a cause for complaint. If the Government had dithered on this issue that also would, presumably, have been deplored.  It appears that you cannot win in this type of situation.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that those people invited to serve on the board were asked to do so because of their intrinsic merits and the wealth of knowledge and experience which they have in their particular spheres.  They were selected for their proven track record and I am confident we have the best team for the job.  At the same time, I am under no illusions about the magnitude of the task facing us in the horticulture sector.  The board have an important role to play at a critical stage in the history of the industry and I am confident they will do it effectively.  I do not pretend that there are any simple or instant solutions or that the board are the answer to all the problems and difficulties facing the industry, but I see them as the catalyst and the focal point for the future development of horticulture.</P>
    <P>We all have a common objective &mdash; the consolidation of the existing industry and its positive development ahead, despite the formidable odds.  We can, and will, move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Estimate and the budget, I believe this was the first time ever before a budget that a deal was done with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Finance and the main farming organisations.  I am sorry to say that that proposed deal, which has been implemented, is to the detriment of the young farming community. As a number of speakers have said, the Government of the day campaigned during the past two and a half years for the abolition of land tax.  On the basis of the land tax being abolished <Col N="815" /> the Minister for Finance had the main farming organisations agree to its replacement by a 0.7 per cent reduction on VAT refunds.  That was one method of taxation proposed.</P>
      <P>There was also the abolition of installation aid for young farmers and a reduction in grants available to young farmers wishing to develop their farms. There were hundreds of them who availed of the stamp duty exemption on the transfer of land over the past two or three years, which provision was introduced by the previous Government.  I believe its abolition has had a detrimental effect on the farming community.  There is now being imposed a direct tax of 0.7 per cent by way of VAT on progressive farmers most of whom are experiencing financial difficulty, the majority of whom are being asked to pay a substantial additional amount than would have been the case had the land tax not been abolished. Indeed to date no Bill has been circulated in order that land tax may be taken off the Statute Book.  I can foresee in the 1988 budget another U-turn by way of reintroduction of that land tax.  It is my belief that the majority of farmers would prefer that land tax rather than having to pay two accountants substantial amounts of money.  I am sure the Minister of State present, like all other rural Deputies, is inundated by small farmers experiencing financial difficulties, trying to produce books for accountants whom they have to pay perhaps £300 or £400 a year to certify that they never had a taxable income from the introduction of tax on farmers.  Had sense prevailed modifications could have been effected in respect of hardship cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that there was the abolition of installation aid.  Yet before its abolition &mdash; as was said in the Macra na Feirme Report &mdash; there had been 1,313 applicants. As a backbencher I spent some time trying to persuade our Government to introduce a scheme of young farmer establishment aid.  It was introduced last year.  I cannot understand why any Government would abolish such a scheme when it had been funded to the <Col N="816" /> extent of 50 per cent from Europe.  It is my opinion that, within a short time, we will see a decline in the numbers of farmers attending educational courses conducted by ACOT throughout the country over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>It is true that the total percentage of land in the possession of farmers under 35 years of age is 16 per cent only, 4,500 applicants qualifying for the stamp duty exemption.  Installation aid was meant to be a replacement of that stamp duty exemption.  Surely if the Minister and his Government are committed to agriculture they will find £0.5 million within the Department to ensure a continuance of that provision.  I have at present on my files the names of 26 people who will lose out on that provision, and a large number of other constituents who will not be eligible because of the time limit imposed. For the sake of the expenditure of something in the region of £0.5 million it is nothing short of penny pinching.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the application to the EC for the inclusion of the less severely handicapped areas and the wholly disadvantaged areas in the reclassification of such areas.  I am disappointed that this has not been put on the agenda for the price negotiations.  If one looks at the experiences of other countries in such negotiations, it will be seen that last year Germany had at least half of its total land classified as fully disadvantaged.  I accept that money was not provided in our Estimates for 1987 but a Supplementary Estimate should have been introduced to benefit those in the less-well-off regions of the country. There have been many small farmers in the northern part of my county who were affected enormously by the bad weather of the past two years, all of whom needed extra cash to help them repay the massive debts incurred in endeavouring to feed their stock.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister of State talk about the IIRS, An Foras Talúntais, CTT and the part they will play in the development of new products. It is my belief that all of these agencies should be amalgamated, with one officer dealing with applicants as they seek help. <Col N="817" /> In the past few days I have been in contact with a family who have produced a product called Organic Gold fertiliser. Although they have their product ready for sale it is only now they have been made aware of the feasibility study undertaken by the IDA which has taken 18 months to complete.  We must endeavour to cut out all of the red tape in these areas.  What happens at present is that an applicant approaches the IDA, is given approval, then goes to CTT who will not grant aid without prior IDA approval. The same applies in the case of the NDC; they will not help unless something has been approved by the IDA.  The red tape must be eliminated if people are prepared to put their money where their mouths are, and are prepared to produce something that can be sold on the market other than normal farm produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State dealt with criticism of the formation of an Bord Glas. There are people on the board who are doing excellent work and are very successful in their own businesses.  Will those people be prepared to introduce proposals to produce products in Ireland that will cost a little more and which will affect the overall profits in their own companies? I would like to see the board involved making the progress the Minister hopes it will make.  I do not think there are people in Ireland whom we can put on a board and who will sacrifice profits in their own companies in order to develop other areas and that is why I am concerned about the membership of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am questioning whether people will have a commitment to develop a product that will in effect subsidise something on which they are making a bigger profit.  For instance, potato importers continue to import potatoes at times of the year when there are adequate supplies available from our <Col N="818" /> own growers.  That is what I am concerned about.  We saw the consequences of what happened in Dundalk because of situations such as that.  I hope that will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Another matter that has been brought to my notice is in connection with the legislation we introduced in regard to the use of hormones.  In the past year we introduced legislation second to none in so far as the legal use of hormones is concerned.  I am told that there are partners of ours in Europe who are deliberately using hormones to the same extent as we used them before their use was made illegal.  I would like the Minister to take up that point with his counterparts in Brussels.  If hormones are being used in Europe our farmers should not be at a disadvantage nor under any pressure in that respect.  In other words, there should be a <i>status quo</i> so far as such matters are concerned.  The Minister should take steps to remedy the position.</P>
      <P>The Deasy beef deal on premiums has been a resounding success and will mean £30 million to the Irish economy.  I would like the Minister to tell us if that is the correct figure because it was thought when that deal was made last October that it would only mean £15 million to the Irish economy.  I would like the Minister to clarify that position because it is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuts have been made in the allocation to ACOT committees throughout the country.  I was chairman of an ACOT committee in Meath for a number of years.  When ACOT were established in 1979-80 the Government transferred buildings to them.  I did not agree with that move.  We were charged rent for the times we held our meetings in the ACOT offices and we were also charged for staff time.  I ask the Minister to investigate this matter.  The number of meetings of ACOT committees have been reduced to about six a year.  I do not disagree with that but I would like to ask the Minister if it is right that the ratepayers of the county I represent should have to pay rent for buildings for which they provided the money in the first place.  I ask the <Col N="819" /> Minister to consider repealing the legislation in this regard in the near future because it is very unfair.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer, too, to the reduction in grants for farm development.  There is no incentive for young farmers in particular to develop farming.  In so far as the development of farming in the future is concerned we should abolish the grants and perhaps transfer the people who deal with this area to other areas.  We should give loans to those young farmers at reduced interest rates, say 7 or 8 per cent, over a period of five or seven years.  That would cut out the enormous cost involved in the number of times premises have to be inspected.  The farmer could then develop his farm and survive without any serious problem unlike the position at present where grants, which are not very substantial anyway, are being reduced by 10 per cent.  We should take a radical approach in regard to the overall position of grants.  We should give a subsidy in the form of reduced interest rates to younger farmers because the majority of farmers today are young and have completed the ACOT courses.  This would be the constructive way forward in so far as young farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed with the numbers of young farmers who have been left out in the cold for the sake of penny-pinching on behalf of the Government to the extent of £500,000.  These farmers would have been, and were, eligible under the ACOT scheme for the installation aid.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter and to reintroduce that aid because the young farmers of Ireland are depending on it.  If the Minister and the Government have any commitment to agriculture they will do so immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate relates to one of our most important industries. Agriculture, as we all know, is our major industry.  It accounted for £2,500 million in export earnings in 1986.  This figure represents a quarter of the total national exports in that year.  As everybody knows, the climatic conditions in 1986 <Col N="820" /> were anything but encouraging for our Irish farmers.  Yet they had that wonderful export record.  We should be very thankful to them for putting us in that position.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and the food processing industry account for approximately 210,000 jobs.  This must make a great impact on the workforce.  If it was put on the pedestal it should have been put on the past two decades, agriculture would now be producing far in excess of what it has been producing.  Instead of employing 210,000 people in agriculture and in the food processing industry, there would be almost 500,000 people employed.  For decades this important industry was starved of funds and of its rightful share of the national cake which was needed to streamline it.  If our farmers had got this backing they could now compete and beat their Europern counterparts, but alas successive Governments have failed to give agriculture the recognition it deserves.  As I said, our major industry is being starved of the necessary finance to enable it to take its place in Europe.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a great image in the EC countries as a food producer.  It is seen as a clean, unpolluted, green island, sprinkled with Atlantic mists and kept safe from the recent radioactive fallout by the prevailing westerly winds which we enjoy, thank God.  Our climate makes us an ideal country for food production. We should capitalise on this God given gift and increase food production to the limit.  Our aim should be quality and competitiveness. It is shocking to realise that each year we import fruit and vegetables at a value of approximately £40 million, which we could produce ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has set up a new Department of Food and An Bord Glas. In his wisdom he picked two representatives to be Ministers of State with responsibilities for both Departments but it is amazing to realise that he did not provide one penny for these new Departments. How can these junior Ministers get the new Departments off the ground when they are muzzled for the want of finance?  This is a whitewashing exercise. It is a haphazard, half-hearted approach <Col N="821" /> to the real problems on the agricultural front.  Creating Departments and establishing boards is not the solution to the problem.  The solution lies in providing proper finance for these boards and Departments to make sure they play their part in developing this very valuable industry, that they will give the guidance and attention this industry deserves and ensure that added impetus is given to the agricultural industry to help it achieve its target and continue to expand and play a vital role as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>What encouragement can our farmers get from the type of policy which has been followed in the past few months with two Departments being set up but no money being provided?  Anybody who knows anything about agriculture would be critical of that.  Throughout the country this move is regarded as a practical joke.  It has been said that a Department with no money is like a pub with no beer.  If we are to tackle our agricultural problems we must have the tenacity and courage to face up to them, but the Minister for Agriculture does not have the tenacity and courage to ensure that proper funding is provided for those Departments which are muzzled for the lack of finance.</P>
    <P>Our farming industry has been starved for want of funds by the hairshirt policies of the present Fianna Fáil Administration. It is clear that ACOT offices throughout the country do not have sufficient funds to carry out their programme of education and assistance to the farming community.  What encouragement can our farmers get from a Government which axe young farmers' installation grants.  Will that negative policy create a spirit of expansion in our agricultural industry?  Far from it.  Our young farmers and the agricultural industry in general have been plunged into an air of gloom and doom.  It is of vital importance that we make sure agriculture gets its rightful share of finance.  As I said last year we imported more than £40 million worth of fruit and vegetables which could be grown here had our farmers been given proper advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> In south-west Cork, a major plant &mdash; the Fastnet Vegetable Co-Op &mdash; was closed down by a Fianna Fáil Government because of a lack of expertise and advice.  That factory would be in production today, not alone producing food for the home market but contributing to our valuable export trade as well, if it had been given proper advice and assistance. This business foundered because it was engaged in the dehydration of food and food products instead of getting involved in deep frozen products.  The demand by the Irish and continental housewives for dehydrated products was long gone before the departmental advisers had given the co-operative the advice to get involved in this area.  Why did the Department not take steps to ensure that the factory was put on a sound footing by switching to frozen food products?  It is amazing to think that none of the advisers in the Department could produce a plan that would save that factory.  Did they not consider redesigning the machinery? That would not have cost a large amount of money but it would have saved the factory and, consequently, would have given valuable employment in a depressed area of my constituency.  The factory has been closed and the briars and nettles are thriving in it.  That is unfortunate when one considers it was second to none as far as capacity and output were concerned.</P>
    <P>The climate in Ireland is ideal for the growing of vegetables.  Everybody is aware that this is the Emerald Isle, an ideal place for the growing of agricultural products.  It is surprising that we are only skimming the surface as far as producing vegetables is concerned.  There should have been a greater concentration on growing vegetables in west Cork and south Kerry to keep that factory going.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, as the person in charge of An Bord Glas to pursue this matter and to have the factory reopened as soon as possible. It is hard to visualise that happening because of the shortage of money in the Department.  I appeal to him to reopen the Fastnet food processing factory in Skibbereen without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> In the course of his contribution the Minister dealt with sheep production.  If he is genuine about expanding that valuable industry he should not be dragging his heels on getting approval for a suitable dye to identify sheep and lambs that are presented for sale at the spring and autumn fairs.  Is the Minister aware that hundreds of thousands of sheep presented at those fairs and at marts do not have any certificate to prove they have been dipped since they were born. That is not the proper approach in an industry that has tremendous potential. Why is it that the Minister has not given approval for a national double-dipping programme?  Is the Minister aware that double-dipping is compulsory in Northern Ireland and Great Britain?  I cannot understand why the Department have refused to listen to demands by sheep dipping committees to make the second dipping compulsory.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that any good farmer would have his sheep dipped twice each year but he must be aware that all farmers do not comply with the law. Undipped sheep and lambs are presented for sale and that is doing untold harm to the industry.  It is essential, if we are to preserve a valuable industry, that we insist on disease free mutton and lamb being offered for sale at home and abroad.  We cannot hope to do that until the Minister insists on a second compulsory dipping for at least three years. It is important that we do everything possible to get rid of sheep scab.  We eliminated warble fly in our cow herds by compulsory treatment of those animals. I should like to ask the Minister why he, and his Department, refused to send a representative to a meeting of the sheep dipping committees of Cork, Kerry, Waterford and south Tipperary.  It is unfortunate that I do not have the time to deal with such topics as mountain lambs and the division of commonages.</P>

      <P>The demand for pigmeat continues to grow in the EC, the USA and Japan but our industry is in decline and if the present trend continues we will be fighting for the survival of that sector. There is no doubt we will lose our export market.  Is the Minister aware that Irish bacon makes about £150 per tonne less on the UK market than bacon imported from Denmark?  That is equivalent to £9 per pig less for our Irish farmers.  Irish bacon exports to the UK amount to 11,000 tonnes annually but I reckon that because of bad marketing we lose in the region of £1.6 billion in export orders. that is a shocking indictment of the Department.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers receive the lowest prices in the EC for their products.  Bad marketing is mainly responsible for that.  It is estimated that the total cost to Irish agriculture of poor marketing of food products is in the region of £150 million per year.  That surely must be the last straw.  It is sad to note that ACOT committees throughout the country do not have any money to pay travelling and subsistence allowances to their members. It is now an honorary job for an elected public representative who has to use his own car, time and money to attend meetings without being recompensed in any way.  This is what happened under a Government from whom we heard so much before the election about getting agriculture off its knees but they have completely demoralised the farming industry.  I call on the Minister to use his influence in the Cabinet to extract every pound possible for the farming industry to ensure that farmers get a rightful share of the national cake because, if not, the industry will be even more deprived.</P>

      <P>I intervene to make a brief contribution on behalf of the farming community in Cavan-Monaghan.  I do not have to tell the Minister or his advisers that my constituency is heavily dependent on agriculture for a livelihood. Indeed, Cavan-Monaghan is unique in that it is one of the greatest food producing and food processing constituencies in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers in County Tipperary have a much easier time than those in Cavan and Monaghan who have to work very hard.  Many farmers in County Tipperary can sit back and watch their animals grow fat.  A big part of the economy of Cavan-Monaghan is built around milk production.  Some of the best co-operatives are there although they have had their difficulties.  However, those who have had such difficulties have weathered the storm and I am glad to say that the co-operatives in both counties seem to be doing well.</P>
      <P>Pigs are produced on a very large scale, particularly in County Cavan.  There must be more pigs produced there than in any other country.  Monaghan is unique in its own way because it specialises in poultry, chickens and ducks.  Monaghan ducks are exported all over the world. Mushrooms were also introduced to the county some years ago and are doing well.  It follows from what I said that these two counties depend on the production of food and its processing for a livelihood and to provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This constituency is under heavy attack from Northern Ireland as many goods are much cheaper there and over the years the media highlighted the fact that many people from the constituency went across the Border to shop.  I approve of the step taken by the Government to at least discourage people from this part of the island crossing the Border to shop on an intensive scale.  However, it has not solved the problem for Clones, Monaghan, Ballyconnell, Belturbet, Swan-linbar, Blacklion, Dowra, Castleblaney <Col N="826" /> and other towns along the Border in my constituency.  It has been a help and I hope it will stand up to any challenge it may have to meet from the European Community or the European Court.</P>
    <P>No hindrance should be placed on the food producing and processing operations in Cavan-Monaghan.  Certain monopolies are seeking to invade the milk industry in Monaghan and to prevent Monaghan Creamery from carrying on legitimate sales in other parts of the country.  At the same time, large co-operatives from outside the county seem to be free to sell milk all over County Monaghan while Monaghan Creamery, which have been disposing of about 12 per cent of their milk intake to other areas &mdash; I do not want to be too precise for certain reasons &mdash; have been prevented from selling about 12 per cent of their input to other parts of the country, which is unfair.  The feeling in the constituency is that the Minister and his Department seem to be on the side of agencies which are preventing the creamery in Monaghan from legitimate trading.  I have reason to believe the Minister knows what I am talking about and I want him to take certain steps quickly to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>This is a small country.  I heard the Minister for Health saying there were too many health boards and I could spend all night agreeing with that.  There are also probably too many milk boards and the Minister should get rid of some of them. I understand this is under consideration in Brussels at present and that certain inquiries will have to be made.  When big bodies start to make inquiries, things do not happen too quickly.  Those inquiries should be completed and on end put to this monopoly.  This is far too small a country to have a monopoly operating within it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about his native county of Tipperary.  If someone clamped down on the fattening of cattle there and told the farmers that they could only sell their cattle in certain areas or to certain co-ops there would be a rebellion, and rightly so.  Why should the people of <Col N="827" /> Cavan and Monaghan be told they can only sell their milk within a certain area? It is outrageous for counties that have a tradition in food production and processing to be told they can only sell their milk within a certain area.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in spending all night saying what could be said in a few minutes but I want to point out to the Minister that the Dublin District Milk Board is preventing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Town of Monaghan Creamery from supplying 1 per cent &mdash; and I had to get on the telephone about this &mdash; of the Dublin market. By doing so they have deprived them of the opportunity of disposing of 12 per cent of the milk intake of the creamery. I am told that two of the largest co-ops who are very closely connected to the Dublin District Milk Board are flooding Monaghan with milk.  That is not fair. Farmers in Monaghan have enough to contend with from the unfair competition from across the Border without being attacked from Dublin at the same time. I ask the Minister to look into this matter and to do what he can to put an end to this monopoly and to ensure that the Town of Monaghan Creamery is allowed to sell its milk in Dublin if it can find a market.  Perhaps the end result will be that the people of Dublin will get better value for their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot afford to lose much time as the Dublin District Milk Board are adopting what might be called bully boy tactics to prevent the Town of Monaghan Creamery from entering the Dublin market.  I know the Minister has got the message.  I was not long on my feet until he knew what I wanted to talk about.  I was approached very early this morning about this matter and I was asked to raise it in this House if I got an opportunity to do so.  I am now taking that opportunity. I hope the Minister who is well got in Brussels will ensure that this ring is broken and that this board which is now <Col N="828" /> employing full time professionals to beat down comparatively small undertakings, such as Monaghan, will be told that they cannot do so and that they will have to compete on the open market just like everybody else.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Now that I have a little more time than I anticipated at my disposal &mdash; I understand the order permits me to continue until 9 p.m. &mdash; I may have the opportunity of replying at reasonable length to the many points which have been made.  At the same time, Deputies should understand I will not be able to reply to all of the points which were made at this stage but I want to assure them that what they said will not only be noted but will be very carefully examined in the context of the developing policies in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Let me start on that point.  Out of habit almost every Deputy in the course of his contribution today referred to the Department of Agriculture.  One does not have to look further than the notice on the television monitor which refers to this debate as a debate on the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and which notes it is now An tAire Talmhaíochta, the Minister for Agriculture, who is replying to the debate.  I would like to point out that these are the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food and that it is the Minister for Agriculture and Food who is replying.  We all need to join in a common effort to constantly convey that the Department is now called the Department of Agriculture and Food and that it is the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stressed during the course of my opening address, but obviously not too many were present to listen to it and not too many got the message, agriculture and food are inter-linked and I said I was the first Minister for Agriculture and Food to address this House.  It would help, in the context of what we are trying to achieve, if we keep in mind that overall <Col N="829" /> role and responsibility.  Let me point out that there is no department of food and there is no department of horticulture but that there are Ministers of State who have special and very significant responsibility for those areas in my Department.  There is a good reason for that.  We want to demonstrate that this is part of an integrated approach in the new Ministry of Agriculture and Food and that one of the main priorities of the Government is to promote added value in the food sector based on that primary resource.  That is a matter of the most fundamental importance. I hope Deputies will not refer to a department of food or a department of horticulture when they speak about new Departments.

      <P>I would like to make one other general comment in regard to some of the other misapprehensions which have arisen which is best illustrated by reference to a comment made by Deputy Sheehan.  It is characteristic of much else that was said.  Deputy Sheehan criticised me very roundly and strongly, but not in any pernicious or bitter sense, for not providing enough money in a range of areas and accused me of depriving the county committees of agriculture of even the necessary resources to cover their expenses for travelling to the various committee meetings.  He dwelt at some length and with some degree of emotion on that.  This illustrates the confusion which exists.  The amounts allocated by me and this Government in the last budget are precisely the same as the amounts provided by his Government in the budget they had proposed to adopt had they remained in office.  If Deputy Sheehan has complaints to make, will he refer to my predecessor or to the previous Minister for Finance who were members of the Government who actually put out those allocations?</P>

      <P>He did not seem to be complaining about the previous Government on this occasion.  He has in his own constituency a spokesman for this area and I hope they can work it out between them.  Let them not refer the complaints to me when they know exactly who were responsible.  Within the short time available to us &mdash; and this is a very important point &mdash; we made it clear that we would not be in a position to do anything other than examine the Estimates of the outgoing administration with a view to ensuring that not one penny was wasted in that spending.  We never suggested in those weeks after we came into Government that we were going to add extra expenditure.  I want to make it quite clear that I indicated on behalf of the Government, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, that I would be reducing the Estimates already provided by the <Col N="831" /> Government where I thought that was feasible and appropriate in the interests of the overall economic targets of this Government.  That is a major priority for me in the interest of the farming community about whom we are talking here. I want to put that in the context of some of the criticisms made in relation to reducing grants by 5 per cent or 10 per cent under farm modernisation programmes or even the abolition, after a certain stage, of the farm installation aid programme.  I have met the young men of Macra na Feirme personally at their annual meeting and told them it was necessary for me to do this in the overall interests of reducing and controlling public expenditure but also in the particular interests of the primary producers of this country, the farming sector.  If there is one other sector in this community that stands to benefit more from the control of public expenditure I do not know what that sector is.  I am speaking now particularly of the senior farm organisations, the ICA and the ICMSA when I say that if there was one sector that constantly called on the Government to control current public expenditure it was those orgainsations.  In fairness to them, now that we have done that, and even in areas that affected agriculture and food to some extent, they have not done other than support us in that move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They recognise that this is inevitable and that we must be consistent.  Now that this programme is giving rise to reducing interest rates &mdash; understandably farmers always complained about high interst rates; they were the crucifixion of the farming sector &mdash; they know it is vitally important on every front but above all else in the interest of farming, that we hold to that programme.  For that reason if Deputies opposite are complaining that we have been very specifically targeting on priority areas where we can see even some scope for reductions, we are doing <Col N="832" /> it in the overall responsibility which I have as Minister in a Government determined to bring about a better economic climate, particularly for the farming sector.  It is vitally important that we recognise this, as the farm organisations do themselves, as a central element of Government policy.</P>
      <P>One or two interesting things were said in the course of this debate.  I think Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned, but certainly some of his colleagues did, that they even thought it worthwhile to terminate some grants and use the money saved either by way of administration or of spending on those grants or both, to subsidise guaranteed low level interest rates for the farming sector.  I am very much disposed to anything that can bring about low interest rates for the farming sector, particularly.  As a Tipperary man, the same as a Clare man or a Cork man, I know what the problem has been in the last couple of years.  I want to ensure that that will not continue one day longer for the farmers of Ireland.  That suggestion is interesting enough in its own way and may be worthy of some consideration. It is certainly not one I would dismiss without giving some thought to.  Though there were many important points in my rather rushed introductory statement, I put particular stress on discussions that I have already initiated with one major banking institution, in particular, with a view to bringing about, especially in the interests of building up the national herd, a scheme of low interest stable rates to maintain and develop that herd.  I went on to say that I hoped very shortly to broaden the scope of those discussions to extend to all financial institutions and other interested groups, such as meat factories, who would benefit greatly from this.  In the interests of a good agri-food sector everyone involved would be prepared to contribute to that success.  As I say, watch this space.</P>

      <P>There is a certain <Col N="833" /> amount of time and preparation before the tasty bit is eventually cooked.  There is no guarantee that this will lead to the conclusion we want but certainly we are having the discussions.  This demonstrates the importance I attach to low stable interest rates for the farming sector.  More than any other sector they stand to benefit from what this Government, and I in particular as Minister, are doing in this direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg criticised me almost all of the way but he seemed to be referring much more to what my colleague, the Minister for Defence, had said when spokesman for Agriculture in Opposition. He concentrated almost exclusively on that area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Stagg did not make any reference whatsoever to anything I said in the course of introducing this legislation.  He called on me &mdash; even though he had not listened to what I had said &mdash; to spend extra money in every direction.  One of the complaints he had ran contrary to the complaints other Deputies had.  He very strongly criticised me for reducing the amount of money available for administrative costs for pay and pensions.  He said this was a measure of the approach of the Government, to reduce the level of salary thus attacking the PAYE sector, while other Deputies asked why I was spending so much money on administration.  I deduce from those two complaints that somewhere in between I am steering a central course <Col N="834" /> which guarantees we are doing the right thing.  It guarantees also that this Government will be around for a long time.  The Deputies on the benches over there are very much divided as to how they would approach this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little consensus over there.  Some Deputies are saying we should spend less on administration and salaries and others are criticising us for not spending enough.</P>
      <P>I would be the last person in any way to take from the contribution made by my predecessor &mdash; in this instance, Deputy Deasy, the former Minister for Agriculture. I am not going to attempt to take from any contribution made by him.  He had a job to do and he set about doing it; I have a job to do and I have set about doing it.  It is not my role to commend Deputy Deasy and it will not be my role now to criticise him.  That is a chapter that is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a chapter that is over.  I want to say to Deputy O'Keeffe that of course there is no stage at which discussions on any issue, for example, beef premiums or anything else, are concluded to coincide with a new Government taking office or an old Government going out of office.  Deputy Deasy advanced the negotiations in relation to the beef premium to a very considerable extent.  I do not deny that.  I am saying that when I assumed responsibility I expedited the negotiations to a conclusion. That is all.  I cannot say what would have happened if Deputy Deasy had remained Minister for Agriculture; I can only guesstimate what might have happened.  I know what happened when I took office.  During my very early days as Minister I inquired from each section in my Department the topics that were under discussion particularly in the Commission of the European Communities <Col N="835" /> and I pursued every matter as vigorously and as constantly as I could.  These included restoring grants to the dairy sector which had been lifted and grants to the pigmeat sector which I announced soon after taking office.  I acknowledge that if I had started these negotiations they would not have been concluded for six months.  I did my job expeditiously and that is all I am saying.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take from what my predecessor did.  During the course of my discussions at Commission level and at the Council of Ministers I will do everything possible to expedite the application of all funds to the benefit of agriculture and the agri-food sector.  From now on the remnants of what my predecessor may have done will not be as visible or as traceable.  I do not say this as a criticism of what he did but obviously as time elapses the proposals we will be launching, as distinct from those put forward by my predecessor, will be under consideration.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some other matters that arose during the course of this debate.  I am glad they were mentioned because it enables me to deal with some points which, because of time constraints, I did not have the opportunity of covering in my speech.  Some of those points raised were of crucial importance. I made reference in my speech to ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  I want to refer to some of the points made by Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that our farming techniques and methods have to be drastically changed.  I want the young men of Ireland, the young farmers, male and female&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different.  I want young farmers to have the best training background in the exploitation of this natural resource.  The criteria for successful management in the farming sector are the same as in any other; education, training, planning and quality control are as essential to the farming entrepreneur as to any other.  The farming entrepreneur manages an enterprise the same as anybody else.  I am determined in these changing and dynamic conditions in Europe and worldwide to equip our farm managers with the same techniques and facilities as their Dutch or Danish counterparts.  During the course of his contribution Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the position of the Danish farmers in the agri-food sector.  I want farmers, whether they are in Cavan or Monaghan, to be as well and better equipped as farmers in other countries.  We have a lot of catching up to do, but that is one target.  We must instil confidence based on ability and launch Irish agriculture, horticulture and agri-food in a new drive for sustained and profitable export outlets.</P>
      <P>The disease eradication programme is of vital importance to a disease-free country such as Ireland.  A few Deputies referred to this programme.  The allocation of £30 million for the eradication of disease is an indication of the Government's intention to press ahead with the task of TB eradication in particular.  The contributions of farmers and taxpayers to the scheme are very substantial and they can be assured all items of expenditure are subjected to critical scrutiny.  I am glad to say we are now at the point where less than 50 herds are affected by brucellosis. I am confident that by this time next year we shall see a further significant reduction in disease levels in that area. However, there can be no complacency in dealing with brucellosis.  This is evidenced by the odd severe outbreak of disease that causes serious losses to farmers. My Department will continue to provide expert individual attention to the herd owners concerned and will pursue all breakdowns promptly and vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all very concerned that there <Col N="837" /> are over 3,000 herds locked up because of TB.  It is impossible at this stage to make firm predictions about how much progress can be made in the current round.  I hope that some of the suggestions or warnings &mdash; I will not call them threats because I do not see them in that light &mdash; that are coming from the veterinary profession will not be proceeded with.  Everyone will lose &mdash; not least the veterinary profession, the agricultural industry and the economy &mdash; if there is any degree of such action on the TB eradication scheme.  This is not an issue between my Department and the veterinary professions: it is directed elsewhere. I hope it is not going to be proceeded with as a consequence of their attitude to a certain tax proposed this year.</P>
    <P>This year's programme is a very carefully balanced one.  It needs to go ahead in the interests of everybody.  It is balanced so as to allow us to comprehensively monitor herds and to continue special programmes in high risk areas.  We are already getting very encouraging results in traditionally bad areas such as Longford and south west Cork.  I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe must be encouraged by this.  We are lookimg forward to a continued improvement in relation to TB in those locations.  There is too much at stake to set it back at this stage.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I indicated my openness to ways of improving the TB eradication scheme.  Preliminary discussions have already taken place on my direction, between my officials and farming organisations on their suggestion for establishing an executive agency to administer the scheme, with herd owners arranging the annual monitor testing of their herds in return for the withdrawal of disease levies.  These discussions have been useful not least in bringing about the realisation that the TB eradication scheme involves much more than an annual test by herd owners.  They have also been useful in showing that the financial arrangements for the change proposed would involve a net loss of at least £10 million annually to the Exchequer.  I am not saying that we <Col N="838" /> cannot put more effective arrangements in place but we should not under estimate the task of eradication or embark on arrangements the consequences of which have not been fully thought out.  In the present difficult budgetary situation there can be no question of an increased burden on the Exchequer.  Nobody will support that and I will not propose an increased burden on the taxpayer to fund a scheme that has already swallowed a lot of money without achieving the effect we want.</P>
    <P>Any reversal in the eradication process that could call into question our disease status would have very serious consequences because we have at least a status that is recognised and accepted abroad. While we are impatient to achieve complete eradication, what we have achieved is considerable and important for our exports.  I do not have an attachment to the <i>status quo</i> but I have a duty to insist on arrangements that will safeguard the essential interests of the farming community and the Exchequer.  Subject to this I am ready and anxious to give the most favourable consideration possible to any proposed changes that will bring about complete eradication.</P>
    <P>Before I came over to this debate I had a very successful meeting with all of the interest groups involved in the half breed horse industry in the context of the agreement between the previous Government and ourselves that we could not provide more money than what was provided in the Estimates for Bord na gCapall and effectively that meant winding down the operations of Bord na gCapall and trying to put a new structure in place.  I sent them away happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an issue that we will not solve immediately but for the time being the Deputy can be assured they are happy that the register is in safe keeping in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I do not suggest that that is anything more than an interim arrangement.  We have much work to do <Col N="839" /> and it will be done quickly.  Temporary arrangements have been made by my Department to ensure the continuing maintenance of the register and of the register of approved stallions.  These arrangements also include the provision of facilities for the issuing of passports and the registration of the 1987 crop of foals.</P>
      <P>ACOT, on my instruction, are taking over responsibility for the supervision and certification of examinations for the Irish diploma and certificate in equestrian science.  In addition steps have been taken to provide for the holding of examinations for the final year farrier apprentices and the lease stallion scheme operated by the board will also be taken over by the Department for the time being.  In that connection, on the thoroughbred side a report of the Commission of Inquiry was published last year.  Following the publication, the views of the bodies concerned with the breeding and racing industry was sought. Examination of these is now more or less finished and I will shortly submit to the Government proposals on the future arrangements for the industry.</P>
      <P>That reminds me to reply to a point touched upon by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I hope it will be clear that this is a Government of action and that we will take decisions quickly.  There is no evidence of any legislation of any consequence introduced by my predecessor in the course of four years.  I will introduce a lot of important and necessary legislation, for instance the Slaughterhouse Bill, legislation in the dairy sector and many other Bills.</P>

      <P>We will not go into that as I am not in the business of knocking my predecessor who may have had problems with the Government.  All I know is that I am introducing the legislation.</P>
      <P>An important element relates to land structures which was referred to by some Deputy.  I am examining that but I would ask Deputies not to forget that since I came into office I spent more than half the man days in the job in the European Community.  That takes a lot of commitment and it sometimes ends up with their being only one day a week at the desk, when one takes into account Government meetings as well.  We are committed to a land authority.  My examination in that area is far advanced but I cannot give details of the outcome as yet. We will not delay on that matter.</P>
      <P>A point was made about ACOT scholarships. I indicated to ACOT that although I had to further reduce the allocation to them, I am pleased that they could respond to my suggestion made through my officials, one of whom ably represents me on the board of ACOT, that the last area they should touch even in the face of severe cutbacks were the scholarship schemes that were operated. It demonstrates that priorities can be protected no matter how tight things are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is understandably concerned about issues in his own constituency, an area which has a great tradition in agri-food.  I hope I will be able to demonstrate my support for that area. I wondered whether Deputy Fitzpatrick or I had the gift of telepathy because I anticipated that this might arise and he seemed to anticipate that I would anticipate it.  He may have known that another Deputy in the constituency would make nothing of it.  My colleague, Deputy Jimmy Leonard, has been in contact with <Col N="841" /> me today, as has now Deputy Fitzpatrick in the House, on the question of liquid milk distribution.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has raised an important issue but he of all people as an established lawyer and a man who has graced the Chair of this House for a long time will know better than most about the <i>sub judice</i> rule and he will be aware that certain proceedings are under way in our courts at the moment between the parties concerned, that injunction proceedings are under way and a certain stay is involved.  He will understand that I can make no comment while that is so.</P>
    <P>That said, let me assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that it is a delicate matter of very significant importance.  I acknowledge the points he made in presenting it.  I assure him that I am free to say that I have been in contact with my Department who have been with the EC Commission about it and I hope that shortly a solution will emerge that will be acceptable to all parties involved.  Perhaps the conditions which brought about the regulations &mdash; I must be careful here &mdash; under which the dairy district boards operate are different from what they were when they were first introduced.  I assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that at Commission level we are in active contact, and whenever I am free to take up the matter here when the court proceedings are disposed of I will do so.</P>
    <P>I have acknowledged frankly the expenditure disciplines &mdash; because that is what they are &mdash; as a central element of this Government's policy.  No sector in the economy will benefit more from that, due to the falling interest rates, than agriculture. The agriculture and food sector are both crucial to the whole thrust of the whole economy as everyone agrees.  If we have a healthy agriculture and food sector in the economy &mdash; my obligation is to ensure that &mdash; then we will have a healthy economy.  As some Deputy said, we must get out there and compete with the best, and that is what I propose to do as far as I can.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that that is why the Government agree with me totally and that is why the reductions for my Department on the current expenditure <Col N="842" /> side are very much less <i>pro rata</i> than those which applied in any other Department. We all know and acknowledge the painful decisions which we had to take in Government.  In other Departments you can see them every day.  The decisions which I had to take as Minister for Agriculture and Food were probably less painful than some of those that my colleagues with whom I share collective responsibility had to take.  Therefore, if I had in that sense less skin off my knuckles than my colleagues I claim no special credit. Maybe I argued a good case at Cabinet, but it is more a reflection of the fact that the Government attach priority to this area and I am privileged to have responsibility as Minister for Agriculture and Food in that Government and I hope we will see toradh ár saorthair sár i bhfad. Táimid ag obair to han-dian ar fad agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh toradh ar saorthair againn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like again to put on the record of the House my appreciation of the courtesy which the Chair has extended to me twice in recent times, this being the second time, of allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I propose, in view of the long day we have <Col N="843" /> had, to be brief.  The Minister of State for whose presence I am grateful, is aware of the primary and fundamental concern that I have with regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>The building in question was used by Pádraig Pearse in 1908 to establish his first Irish language school.  Known as Cullenswood House, it was acquired in 1960 by the State on behalf of the nation. It was detenanted, so to speak, in recent years and has remained vacant and is considered to be in a state of disrepair. The State has effectively two options. The first is the option which the State proposes to exercise and that is to sell it and dispose of it.  I would put to the State and to the representative of the State, the Minister of State for the OPW, Deputy Treacy, that there is another and better option.  The purpose of sale is to derive some asset value from this building.  It is probably worth no more in the open market than approximately £50,000 and that is before the real hidden charges that Dublin Corporation now propose for connections to water and sewerage services. The site cost for flats and flat development for which this site would be a prime contender is of the order of £3,000 per unit and the total area of the site would not provide more than about 15 sites, hence my calculations and my evaluation.</P>
      <P>If for £50,000 plus another £25,000 the State is proposing to get rid of a building which has an extraordinary historic connection, a unique link with the history of the Irish language movement, for which I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a particular regard and affection, it will create a planning problem in an area of Ranelagh, Oakley Road, which is already overcrowded, has problems of congestion and has a passageway of below standard width with regard to the type of road there.  I can hear voices in the OPW in Stephen's Green asking if there is no alternative, whether this building is regarded as a liability.  It is in disrepair but I contest whether it is in the state of disrepair that Deputy Treacy's predecessor described to me in a letter of 21 August 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Having summarised the position, I hope reasonably accurately, I would like to put to the Minister of State formally the following alternative proposal: that the OPW on behalf of the nation, exercising their functions within the jurisdiction of this State would make this building available at a nominal rent on a long lease to a community-based group whose intention would be to establish a museum devoted to the history of the Irish language movement and its cultural revival; that that building would be opened to the public and as part of the cultural infrastructure of this city would enhance the tourist attractions that Dublin needs in the advent of its millenium and coming in to the last 13 years of this century; that in addition it would become an important educational tool for many children of this generation who fail to see with the same degree of clarity of former generations the relevance of learning and speaking their own national language.</P>
    <P>The cost of that undertaking would not fall on the shoulders of the State because I appreciate at this time that such additional cost cannot be borne.  Therefore, the second component of my proposal to the Minister of State acting on behalf of the Government is that in giving this building on a long lease for a nominal rent to a properly registered and established community-based group.  It is clear that the cost of refurbishment, redevelopment and opening as a museum would have to be borne elsewhere and not by way of direct State grant.</P>
    <P>How do I propose that would happen? There is within the experience of AnCO a successful series of renovation projects undertaken in this area, whereby under the community youth training programme the construction costs, as expressed in labour cost terms, have been undertaken by young apprentices who carry out the work.  Therefore it would be up to the community-based group, broadly representing cultural, historical and Irish language interests, to raise the cost of the materials alone.  There is a successful precedent for this with regard to the restoration of a major building in Henrietta Street, now occupied by na <Col N="845" /> Pióbairí Uileann of which you, Sir, may be aware.  That was done under exactly the same formula of AnCO, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the energy, and enthusiasm of people with a commitment to a particular part of our overall culture.</P>
    <P>I would foresee a situation in which the building would be restored to a state in which it could be opened to the public, with no liability falling on the shoulders of the State, where work in the process would have generated experience for young apprentices, where some community facilities, if appropriate, would be available to local people.</P>
    <P>As well as all of that &mdash; as an additional part of the tourist infrastructure of the capital city &mdash; there would be a museum devoted to the history of those people who had struggled to rescue from what seemed to be oblivion a language now vibrant and alive.  We are aware of the politics of that struggle, perhaps in a partisan way.  We are not aware, certainly our children are not aware, of the extraordinary steps and strides taken at different times over the long 100 years that elapsed since that movement got off the ground.  There is nowhere on this island one can take a visitor and say: within the four walls of this building you will see encapsulated the history of that struggle and the fruits of that success.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister of State is afforded an opportunity to try this proposal. I would respectfully suggest that all that is being forfeited is the possible realisation of a sum of the order of £50,000.  With the degree of professional experience I have I suggest to the Minister that he will not find a purchaser who will acquire it without outline or full planning permission being attached to the site.  Therefore, in immediate cash terms the Minister will not reap the benefit of money up front.  For that relatively small sum of money the Minister has the alternative proposal of trusting a local community, under the Irish language movement, with this different kind of proposition.  If my confidence or judgment is proven wrong, then the <Col N="846" /> matter simply reverts to the Minister and he proceeds with the sale.</P>
    <P>That is what I propose, that it be offered to a community-based body, allowing them to use the institutions already there in the manner I have described, in the hope that they can get a successful cultural museum launched and established.  If &mdash; and this is the safety net &mdash; they are not successful then the building would revert to the State and the Minister could proceed with its disposal in the manner currently contemplated.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil seans againn uilig cúpla focal a rá faoi Theach Cullenswood i Ranelagh.  Tháinig an t-ábhar seo faoi mo bhráid coicís taréis mé bheith tofa mar Aire Stáit le cúram oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputy Quinn has afforded me an opportunity to refer briefly to the situation pertaining to Cullenswood House in Ranelagh. Approximately two weeks after my appointment in the Office of Public Works the file on this matter was referred to me.  I studied it, feeling that this historic property should be scrutinised by me, an inspection and report having been furnished already by the expert staff in the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Cullenswood House is situated in Oakley Road, Ranelagh, and is at least 150 years old.  It was acquired by Pádraig Pearse in 1908 and housed the first Scoil Éanna, Pearse's bilingual school for boys, from its inauguration in 1908 until its transfer to Rathfarnham in 1910.  In that year Pearse founded Scoil Íde, a bilingual school for girls in Cullenswood House. In order to afford himself that opportunity he also rented property across the road from Cullenswood House popularly known as Sunnyside.  Cullenswood House, as a bilingual school for girls, closed down in 1912.  We are fortunate in the Office of Public Works to still have the lease Pearse signed in 1908, surely a very important artefact and museum piece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the autumn of 1916 Mrs. Pearse <Col N="847" /> reopened Scoil Éanna in Cullenswood House, as British soldiers had occupied The Heritage, Rathfarnham, in the wake of the Rising.  The school returned to Rathfarnham in 1919.  Cullenswood House was purchased with the grounds attached, by the State from its owner, Senator Doctor Margaret Mary Pearse in 1960.  The grounds were transferred for a nominal consideration to the trustees of Scoill Bhríde as a site for a new all-Irish national school which was completed and opened formally in 1965.</P>
    <P>Cullenswood House, which was occupied by five tenant families at the time of purchase, remained in the administration of the State.  The building itself may have been built prior to 1800 &mdash; it definitely existed in 1833 &mdash; could be even older but is considered of no real architectural merit at this time.  From the outside it may appear to be in relatively good condition. From professional advice and my personal inspection I know it is in an advanced state of disrepair, needing much renovation.  When purchased 18 years ago it was in a gradually deteriorating state of disrepair.  The Office of Public Works' architects made a professional report on it, leaving the commissioners with the option of disposing of the property at their discretion. Obtaining vacant possession from the tenants became a priority of the commissioners. This proved to be a protracted business, finding suitable acceptable alternative accommodation being a major problem.  This was finally achieved in 1986.  Here I should like to express our appreciation and gratitude to the housing department of Dublin Corporation for the excellent co-operation and assistance they gave officials of the Office of Public Works in providing the necessary alternative accommodation so that the tenant families could be relocated.</P>
    <P>Cullenswood House is now in an advanced state of disrepair.  There have been a number of representations by various organisations, by at least two Members of the Oireachtas, regarding its historic association and connection, <Col N="848" /> arguing that such justifies its preservation by the State.  I note in particular the personal interest expressed by Deputy Quinn in this matter over a long period of time and to me personally.  Of particular relevance in this regard is the fact that the commissioners have already restored Saint Enda's College, Rathfarnham, and maintain the premises as a memorial to the Pearse family.  Approximately £270,000 has been spent on the restoration of St. Enda's to date and most of this was spent between 1977 and 1979. It costs up to £200,000 per annum to maintain St. Enda's College in Rathfarnham, with a permanent staff etc. Full restoration of St Enda's is not yet complete.  The House should be aware that the Commissioners of Public Works acquired Pearse's holiday cottage at Rosmuc in the Connemara Gaeltacht in County Galway in 1943.  Approximately £35,000 has been spent on maintenance work at this location over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>When I received the file I obviously noted the very important historical and cultural connections with Cullenswood House.  I felt it incumbent on me, being a new person in this position, to visit the house and to see it at first hand.  The professional advice available to me was confirmed on my own inspection.  Despite that, I am very interested in preserving this building for the State but the funds to do that are not readily available to me from the State.  However, I will give every consideration to the proposals put forward by the Deputy.  The commissioners and the staff of the OPW and I have already discussed the options available whether of complete disposal of the house on the open market by public tender or otherwise.  We recognise the necessity to have proper planning permission. Any subsequent purchaser of the property would have to get planning permission if they were to change the use of the building.  However, I, along with the commissioners and the Minister for Finance, will consider any proposals from a responsible body wishing to acquire the building for the purpose of restoring it <Col N="849" /> and setting it up as a museum or cultural centre.  I would welcome any detailed proposals in this regard immediately in order to allow the commissioners and the Minister for Finance, as well as myself, to make a final decision on this very historic property.</P>

      <P>In general the Department and the various Manpower agencies conduct evaluations of the various programmes to determine whether their objectives are being met in the most effective and efficient way.  The methods used would include (1) in-house studies (2) reviews by external consultants such as ESRI and (3) analysis based on the data available from the administration of schemes.</P>
      <P>Review and evaluation of programmes is carried out on a continuing basis.  I believe that, in general, all current programmes are achieving their objectives. Evaluations often, however, can identify desirable shifts in emphasis and in conditions. For example, evaluation of the enterprise scheme led to modifications last December designed to improve the long term viability of projects and the reduction of the potential for displacement of non-subsidisied enterprises elsewhere in the locality.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Community Programme of the Manpower Services Commission of Great Britain provides up to 52 weeks part time or full time employment to the long term unemployed.

      <P>My approach to the various legislative enactments which come under the aegis of my Department is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that proposals for the reform of trade dispute and industrial relations legislation were published by my predecessor last year.  I have had preliminary exchanges of views with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and separately with the Federated Union of Employers on this complex subject.  I hope over the next few months to see what agreement I can get from the social partners on possible action in this area.</P>
      <P>In the area of worker participation I am examining how I should proceed in relation to the public sector.  It would be my intention to publish a Bill before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having proposals to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 assessed to ensure that they address the difficulties which the operation of the two Acts has brought to light.  I am also considering possible amendments to the <Col N="706" /> Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.  It is my intention to publish a discussion document shortly which will examine the options for amendments to these four Acts and to seek the views of interested parties on suggested amendments.</P>
    <P>With regard to occupational safety and health, a Bill is being drafted to give effect to the main recommendations of the commission of inquiry who reported in 1983 and I intend to introduce this measure in the Oireachtas this year.</P>
    <P>Regulations are currently being drafted to give effect to a number of EEC Directives relating to the protection of workers from exposure to chemical, physical and biological agent, lead and asbestos, as well as directives relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations. These regulations are in addition to those made in 1986 concerning dangerous substances and major industrial accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings have not been taken against any employer under the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. The clear intention behind the Act is to encourage employers and unions jointly to seek ways to minimise the impact of redundancies.  My main concern about the operation of the Act to date is that <Col N="708" /> while the requirements about notification seem to be generally well observed, it is not so clear that meaningful consultation has come about as a result of observance of these procedures.</P>
      <P>The role of the Minister for Labour under the Act in regard to collective redundancies is to ensure that: (1) the requisite notice is given to trade unions representing the workers involved; (2) the consultations with the trade unions are initiated at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place and cover:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the possibility of avoiding the proposed redundancies.</P>
      <P>&mdash;reducing the number of employees affected by the proposed redundancies.</P>
      <P>&mdash;mitigating the consequences of the proposed redundancies.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the basis on which it will be decided which particular employees will be made redundant.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister for Labour is notified in writing of the redundancy proposals at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place.</P>
      <P>The Act gives to trade unions the right to prior notice and to prior consultation with employers.  The Minister for Labour is not, however, empowered to intervene in such consultations to secure, for example, a deferral of the proposed redundancies until agreement is reached on either the number being dismissed or on the amount of severence pay.  In the consultation process the parties are then in a free collective bargaining situation and can avail, if they so desire, of existing dispute-settling machinery.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to introduce amendments to the Act, I intend to see that it is actively enforced and will be ready to use the investigative procedures avialable to me under Part III of the 1977 Act to ascertain whether the statutory provisions have been complied with should any legitimate doubt arise.</P>

      <P>The person indicated is a dual quota holder, i.e., he has been allocated a direct sales quota as well as a deliveries quota.  Under the Community regulations the direct sales quota cannot be transferred on a permanent basis to Kerry Co-operative.  However, the unused portion of the direct sales quota can be allocated to the co-operative on a year-to-year basis.  Under this provision an annual quantity of approximately 12,000 gallons in respect of the direct sales quota in this case has been allocated to Kerry Co-operative in the first three years of the operation of the super-levy system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House recently in response to a similar question, it is impossible to predict accurately the likelihood of a commercial oil find offshore Ireland until exploration wells which confirm the existence of significant hydrocarbon accumulations have been drilled. Such accumulations must then, in turn, be appraised and delineated to determine whether they are capable of sustaining commercial production.  If so, the companies involved will proceed to development of the find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of encouraging oil discoveries off the south-east coast, particularly the discoveries in blocks 49/9 and 50/6 but it is not yet possible to say if these discoveries will, ultimately, lead to a commercial development. While the most recent exploration well in block 49/9, the results of which were announced on 2 June by the operator, flowed oil, unfortunately the well did not fulfil the companies' expectations for it.  Data from this well is now being integrated into existing data-banks to assess further the potential of block 49/9. As regards block 50/6 a second exploration well in this block was spudded in the past few days and we await the outcome of that drilling.  In the meantime, I can assure the Deputy that if oil in commercial quantities is discovered off the south-east coast of Ireland, or in any <Col N="717" /> other sector of our offshore, its development will proceed as quickly as is humanly possible.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous question on this mattter: No. 229 of 7 April 1987.  I can confirm that the application by the management of Mount Sackville secondary school to join my Department's free education scheme has been withdrawn.  The implications of this decision are now under urgent examination in my Department and I will decide on the appropriate course of action in a very short time.</P>

      <P>My Department has under active investigation the long term accommodation needs of the special national school conducted by the St. Michael's House association in Skerries, County Dublin.  My Department has, however, no plans for grant-aiding the replacement in the immediate future of the school's existing accommodation.</P>
