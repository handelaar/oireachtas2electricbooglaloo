      <P>I would like to raise a matter on the Order of Business concerning a reply given by the Minister for Finance in the House on Thursday, 5 November to a series of questions during the course of which reply the Minister recalled that he had said that the Government were discussing arrangements with the Central Bank to fund voluntary redundancies in the public service and that when the total cost had been determined and the funding arrangements had been finalised, he would present full details to the House. It now appears that an arrangement has been cobbled together or arrived at in some way.</P>

      <P>In the last number of months I have attempted to get information from the Minister for Health in relation to waiting lists for people from Kerry who are attending hospitals in Cork but this information has been refused. Another Deputy from Kerry has been similarly refused by your good self in relation to the Minister for Health answering the question.  It appears from the newspapers today that the Minister for Health has no difficulty in answering identical questions in relation to the Eastern Health Board.  I ask you, sir, to look at this matter.  The Deputies from Kerry are entitled to get the information, as has always been the practice in this House. The Minister for Health should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to be disorderly. I request your guidance on this matter.  Perhaps we should change the rules in this House because it seems that on previous occasions questions of a noncontentious kind have been asked and have been answered.  In the first instance the Minister offered to indicate to the House that he would make the report available when he received it.  I have no way, other than going through a long process, of asking that question.  I would have thought that, to make our business more orderly and more efficient, this is not an unreasonable way to make that request.</P>

I do not think it should go without notice in this House that it is a tragic coincidence that ten days ago Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, held their Ard-Fheis in the Mansion House.  I would like to ask the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, if they would consider introducing legislation to prohibit the fellow-travellers of the IRA from using public buildings in this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Control of Clinical Trials Bill, 1986   [Seanad]:  Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8a:</P>
    <P>In page 9, subsection (4), between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Any consent will only be valid if the consent in section 1 and the explanation in section 4 are given in the presence of a disinterested but informed witness.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Flaherty.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to press this somewhat further.  I believe the whole purpose and strength of this Bill rests on two things.  The ethics committee is absolutely central to this Bill achieving one of its major objectives which is the <Col N="263" /> satisfactory control and protection of persons engaging in clinical trials.  The Minister has not included guidelines in the Bill although he has indicated that he will consider on Report Stage including a commitment to make statutory regulations which would include a lot of the things we are looking for.  However, as the Bill stands the role of the ethics committee is central.  If the Bill is to achieve its objective we must be absolutely satisfied as to the composition of the ethics committee and that the guidelines in relation to consent are adequate.  In the absence of a clear commitment from the Minister in relation to those it is important to press this somewhat further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the net effect of this legislation will be restrictive in the area of the practice of clinical trials without ensuring beyond reasonable doubt that it will give significant protection.  I ask the Minister to go into detail in regard to what he views to be the real application of the section which he asks ethics committees to have regard to and what is the legal interpretation of &ldquo;having regard to&rdquo;.  Does that mean that they can decide that medical examination is necessary or that a disinterested witness is necessary? If we are going to give them such loose powers of interpretation, the Bill hinges entirely on whether we have confidence in the ethics committee.  With the position in relation to their nomination and the fact that we are still not clear about the guidelines in relation to their appointment, earlier discussions here indicated that extra amendments such as this would be desirable to ensure that it achieves one of its two major objectives which is to ensure that there is adequate protection for those involved in clinical trials.  Therefore, I am anxious to press this amendment which ensures that consent would be given as is already recommended in the guidelines which the National Drugs Advisory Board themselves operate when persons seek advice on how to ensure that persons engaging in or volunteering for clinical trials are aware of all the implications of being involved and <Col N="264" /> giving informed consent.  What is the Minister's hesitation about specifying this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a key provision under section 9 (3) about the consent given by a participant to the person conducting a trial or to someone acting on behalf of that person.  That can only be given if a person is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent.  Section 9 (3) states clearly:</P>
      <P>Any consent given for the purposes of this section shall not be valid unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the person so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, and</P>
      <P>(b)  it is obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the clinical trial.</P>
      <P>There is provision for persons who are physically disabled and cannot sign their consent or for persons who are unable to comprehend the nature, significance and scope of the consent of necessity to have a witness.  It would not appear reasonable if, for example, a Member of this House wished to volunteer for such a clinical trial that it would be necessary for him or her to bring in somebody to sign on his or her behalf.  There is an obligation on those carrying out a trial and on the ethics committee to ensure that the trial is carried out in a proper fashion.  Indeed, I believe that it could be counterproductive to lay down by Statute the composition of that committee because it might mean that in certain cases where there would be a wish to have somebody with special knowledge included on the committee, it might not be possible to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (4) clearly lays down the matters which the ethics committee must have regard to.  These are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  the objectives of the proposed trial and its planning and organisational structure;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> (b)  the qualifications and competence of each person who would conduct the clinical trial and, where appropriate, the resources available to him;</P>
    <P>(c)  the criteria to be used for the recruitment and the selection of participants;</P>
    <P>(d)  the procedures proposed for compliance with section 9;</P>
    <P>(e)  the policy of insurance to which section 10 relates.</P>
    <P>(f)  the extent and nature of the medical examination that persons selected as participants are to undergo before participating in the clinical trial;</P>
    <P>(g)  the extent to which the health of participants is proposed to be monitored during and after the clinical trial;</P>
    <P>(h)  whether or not the persons selected as participants are to undergo independent medical examination before, during or after the clinical trial;</P>
    <P>(i)  details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or being a participant;</P>
    <P>(j)  any payments, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made to a person for conducting the clinical trial or any part of the trial;</P>
    <P>(k)  the criteria to be used to ensure that the identity of each participant remains confidential;</P>
    <P>(l)  any payments, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made to any person for facilities used for the purposes of the clinical trial;</P>
    <P>(m)  such other matters as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly comprehensive range of criteria to which the ethics committee must have regard before they approve of a trial.  That committee are a crucial element in controlling clinical trials. <Col N="266" /> Regarding the role of the ethics committee, under section 8 (4), this must be read with section 8 (2) which gives the ethics committee an effective veto over a particular trial if they are not satisfied that any of the requirements under section 8 (4) have been complied with.</P>

      <P>The legal phrase &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; gives leave to consider these issues or not to do so.  I am sure that if we had statistics we would find that Members of this House have not presented themselves for clinical trials except perhaps as impecunious students many years back.  The reality is that many people participating in trials are perhaps in need of funds and are attracted for that reason.  These people need to be given extra protection against themselves.  In the event of a conflict as to whether the consent was given by somebody capable of understanding or comprehending, without the presence of an independent person to adjudicate, the typical participant in a clinical trial might not be adequately protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is already the practice in major institutions to have their own independent medical examiner.  They see this as being in their own interests.  We must accept that the last thing any organisation or individual involved in research would wish for is an indication that they are careless or take risks.  Obviously, that would undermine the value of the product or process that they ultimately approve.  We have much goodwill among those involved to achieve proper regulations and it is my understanding that some of these bodies operate with an independent medical examiner.  That proposal has been defeated in the House but the idea of having such a person to supervise a trial would not be objected to because anything that ensures greater stringency and avoidance of possible future incidence of disaster would be quite welcome.  Freedom is given to the ethics committee to choose to implement any of these requirements.  I am concerned about that because of the way in which the committee are first nominated. Clearly, any make-up of a trial might be <Col N="267" /> different from any other, but there could be some tightening up.  If this cannot be done under this section, it should at least be done in the area of nomination.  That element should be taken out of the hands of the individual conductor of the trial and put into those of some publicly accountable body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 7, to delete &ldquo;in force a policy of insurance sufficient&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;adequate insurance cover&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have to solve some outstanding issues in this section.  The problems in connection with this section were debated during this Bill's passage through the Seanad and I regret that the Minister having introduced the Bill into this House has put forward no new proposals to resolve these problems.  While it is clearly desirable that insurance cover should be obtained before a clinical trial is conducted we are, as the Minister has confirmed, breaking new legislative ground on a world-wide basis in what we are seeking to do in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The twin objectives of this Bill are, first, to protect the volunteers and, secondly, to ensure that we do not interfere with desirable clinical research which may <Col N="268" /> improve medicine, lead to new ways of reducing pain and to lives being saved.  I am concerned that the only bodies who will be able to engage freely in clinical trials as a result of this Bill will be the independent institutes who engage in research on a profit making basis and the drugs companies.  I am also concerned that private research which is undertaken by both doctors and universities will cease as a result of the requirement that insurance must be obtained before clinical trials can take place.</P>
    <P>Insurance cover in this respect is provided only by two insurance companies in the world, Lloyds and an American insurance company, and it is very expensive. The problem may not be as large as we might fear initially because much of the research work takes place on original products which of themselves have insurance cover.  Experience in the UK has shown that the insurance cover on the original product quite often covers further research work and the varied uses of that product by doctors.  The only body who have not lobbied my party are the largest research institution in this country, the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology. This institute is making millions of pounds and without a blink of an eye will be able to comply with the regulations which will be imposed under this Bill.  I have received much representation from doctors engaged in research for the purposes of the betterment of medicine.  They are very concerned. Despite this Bill having been amended in the Seanad many of their concerns remain.  I want to make it clear that the contracts under which these consultants are employed by the Minister for Health put a time limit on their research work and they concerned that if this Bill is passed their research work will cease.</P>
    <P>As regards the treatment of terminally ill patients there are differences in how this Bill is interpreted.  The doctors do not know whether this Bill will affect them.  They believe it will, the Minister argues it will not.  They are concerned that certain sections of this Bill will hinder important clinical research.  I would like to refer to the views of Professor Feeley <Col N="269" /> of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University College Dublin.  The Minister is aware of these views.  He believes that research into terminal illness and cancer will have to cease due to the non-availability of insurance cover.  The Minister's view is that this will form normal clinical practice and that therefore such studies will be exempt. However, the doctors involved believe, and they have received legal advice on this, that a ministerial assurance in the Dáil does not form a legal exemption.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the section that deals with the treatment of individual patients will prove strong enough and will cover named patient clinical trials.  I have no doubt that that would stand up in any court.  However, a doctor may be anxious to engage in the trial of a new drug on a group of patients with a similar condition and this trial may be in the interests of those patients and if they are willing to participate the doctor should be allowed to undertake the trial but it may be impossible for him to obtain insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Apart from the treatment of terminally ill patients, clinical trials are needed in order to make advances in cancer therapy, particularly in the area of leukaemia. Doctors argue that this Bill as it stands will prevent the best available therapy from being provided to patients and that they will become isolated from international bodies who carry out, and in some cases, fund such research. During this Bill's passage through the Seanad reference was made to the fact that the World Health Organisation withdrew research which was offered to institutes in this country and gave it instead to institutes in Belgium when it became clear that the requirement of insurance cover would be uniquely implemented.</P>
    <P>I accept that this is a very difficult issue. It is obviously desirable that volunteers should be protected by insurance cover. The amendment I have tabled would help in a small way in that it would result in more applications being received for insurance cover than will result if this <Col N="270" /> Bill is implemented.  In the Seanad the Minister referred to the insurance he provides for consultants in certain areas and to the insurance which exists on the original product.  A later amendment of mine has been ruled out of order because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  I hope the Minister will take up the suggestion I made in that amendment which is to provide a voluntary fund similar to the one which exists in Britain which was established by the Department of Health and the drug companies and which provides indemnity cover for clinical trials.</P>
    <P>I hope that the situations we are talking about will never arise.  To date, with the operation of a voluntary system and with no requirement for insurance cover, no claims have been received in regard to trials which have been carried out within our hospitals through the Department of Health.  I hope that that record will continue and that the setting up of this fund will allow desirable research to continue. Under stringent supervision, there would be no ongoing charge on the Exchequer. Possibly, I am now beginning to discuss two amendments at the same time but the amendment which I have proposed would be helpful in ensuring that any insurances which might be relevant would be accepted once the NDAB and the ethics committees are happy that they are applicable in this case.  I ask the Minister to accept this wider definition as this whole section may have consequences contrary to our intent in the broad principles of the Bill.  This amendment would alleviate some of the worries in this regard and would maintain the commitment to the requirement to have insurance.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Flaherty has raised this matter in relation to the insurance provisions in the Bill.  I share some of her concern.  On a point of principle, I feel that participants in all clinical trials, academic or otherwise, have the same right to compensation and to similar compensation arrangements. For this reason I feel that the same <Col N="271" /> requirements should apply to each clinical trial whether it is carried out by one of the major multinational companies or by a consultant working in a hospital.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that under the current requirement in the Bill a policy of insurance does not extend to the types of financial arrangements which exist to compensate persons who might be injured during a clinical trial.  While I accept the point that the major multinational companies are well able to take care of their own insurance arrangements and it does not pose a problem for them, I am concerned for consultants carrying out trials, for example, with products that already have a product authorisation but may come within the scope of the Bill. The provisions in the Bill as it is now may be too rigid.  It is very difficult to cover every eventuality in a technical Bill of this nature.  I feel we have developed a balanced approach for trials of the type referred to by the Deputy.  At the same time, I am trying to develop a consistent approach to trials which have to comply with the Bill.  This has to cover insurance. Deputy Flaherty had an amendment down to section 2 and we said that on Report Stage we would bring forward our own amendment to deal with that issue. This section must be looked at along with section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to clinical trials carried out on terminally ill patients, I have obtained legal advice and I am happy that trials of this nature are exempt from the provisions of the Bill under section 2 (2) (a) (i) and (ii).  These paragraphs were inserted in the Bill to cover such trials.  I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with the insurance cover, particularly in relation to consultants carrying out trials in hospitals, say, where the insurance may be too rigid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all times, we must protect the interests of the volunteer, or the patient as it would be in that case, the person who is the subject of the trial.  At the same time, we do not want to make the Bill so rigid that the normal clinical practice that is carried on every day in <Col N="272" /> hospitals would be impinged on to the detriment of the patients generally.  On Report Stage I will bring forward an amendment and will be considering it in the context of section 2 where we have already promised Deputy Flaherty we will bring forward an amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the acknowledgement of the Minister's concern in this area and his willingness to do something about it.  Does he, therefore, envisage that section 10 will remain in the terms that it is or might that be more loosely defined?  I share his concern to ensure that there is adequate cover and protection.  Section 2 perhaps still leaves restrictions that might be dealt with but because they are related maybe we could deal with the two together.  I gather amendment No. 10 is out of order?</P>

      <P>A problem remains in relation to amendment No. 9 if there is no move such as amendment No. 10 would provide.  In regard to amendment No. 10, the problem as outlined by those who engage the doctors and have taken legal advice is that they could be open to cases being taken for compensation.  We hope this will not occur but in the normal course in the light of the long history of accidents we have had in hospitals to date we may have to face this and the Minister's conviction, assurance or interpretation does not provide for them a legal exemption.  Will the Minister undertake to have further discussions in relation to this and so satisfy himself that there is no further way of resolving it? Will he be good enough to refer to amendment No. 10?  What it proposes can be done only on his initiative because it involves a charge on the Exchequer. The former Minister said in the Seanad that he felt it would be an open cheque which he did not wish to sign, but I do not accept that given the way it could be <Col N="273" /> defined.  Perhaps even the total cost could be met under the Minister's initiative by the drug companies?  Will the Minister at least indicate his willingness to look at it? Will he have the powers to do it if we do not refer to it specifically in this Bill? When this Bill has been enacted and has been a year to two in operation, will it have the effect of reducing the level of research?  Will the Minister consider a fund such as exists in the British system to ensure that our doctors are not cut off from the full practice of research?</P>
      <P>There are three issues there: first, will the Minister look at the question that the doctors concerned have been advised that the Minister's interpretation does not give them an exemption in law from liability; secondly, does the Minister intend to leave section 10 as it stands; and, thirdly, with regard to a fund such as the British one, is it necessary to have reference to such in the Bill?  I imagine it is not and that this could be dealt with outside the context of the Bill.  Will the Minister put on record his views as to whether this is desirable or possible?</P>

      <P>Participants in all clinical trials, academic or otherwise, have the same right to compensation and to similar compensation arrangements.  For this reason the same requirements should apply to each clinical trial.  As regards the compensation fund, I see certain difficulties. For instance, would the Bill be adequate to compensate in individual cases?  We will have to take account of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards whether section 10 would stand in the event of bringing forward an amendment, I would bring forward an amendment if that would take account of the <i>de facto</i> position which should go some way towards meeting the points raised by the Deputy.  The amendments for change in the whole section would have to be taken in conjunction with section 2.  While I agree with the principles Deputy Flaherty enunciated, we do not want in any way to impinge on the ordinary legitimate practice in hospitals <Col N="274" /> where consultants use legitimate products in varying doses which may bring them within the terms of this legislation. At the same time we must ensure that we protect the interests of the person on whom such trials are being carried out. We will be bringing forward an amendment which I hope will reflect the views and the principles enunciated by Deputy Flaherty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) (a), line 15, after &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the National Drugs Advisory Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment goes back to the original issue raised during the debate on section 1, that is, the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board and the role of the Department.  The National Drugs Advisory Board have a staff of 43 people engaged in work which has been voluntary to date but which will become statutory in relation to clinical trials. They have many other functions relating to other areas.  I should like the Minister to clarify the extent to which the Department <Col N="275" /> will be involved in the day-to-day management of the functions covered by this Bill.  Is it the case that the executive functions will be handled substantially by the National Drugs Advisory Board, as in the past?  If the latter is the case, it is desirable to include these amendments so that it will not be necessary to refer to the Minister at all stages.  To require immediate notification to the NDAB would speed up the process.  Given that the original draft of this Bill was not the responsibility of this Minister, there appears to have been a lack of clear thinking in relation to the integration of the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board in the operation of this legislation. Is the Minister willing to accept these amendments with a view to reducing undue delays or bureaucratic roundabouts? How many people in his Department are skilled in these areas?  What is the nature of their skills?  Does he see his Department having a greatly expanded role in the day-to-day work arising from this legislation?  Alternatively, will the National Drugs Advisory Board be responsible for most of the executive and detailed work, with the Department having only a monitoring role in the assessment of what is being done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the personnel in my Department, of course we have medical advisers and pharmacists who will advise on the implementation of this legislation.  Section 11 already obliges a person conducting a clinical trial to permit the inspection by an authorised person of a premises which the Minister believes is being used in connection with a trial.  Section 11 also obliges a person conducting a clinical trial to comply with a request for information regarding the progress of the trial which the Minister or any person duly authorised may request. The person conducting the trial must also report to the Minister on becoming aware of or suspecting any adverse reaction affecting a participant in a trial.  The Bill already provides that ministerial permission to proceed with a trial is on the basis of consultation with the National <Col N="276" /> Drugs Advisory Board.  That is provided for in section 4.  As the Minister is to be designated as the competent authority to grant permission to proceed with clinical trials, it is consistent that he should be the person whose permission is requested and who is notified about a trial.</P>
      <P>The Bill envisages a major advisory role for the National Drugs Advisory Board and a consequent close liaison between the Minister and the board in all areas relating to clinical trials.  The amendments are unnecessary.  The matters raised by Deputy Flaherty are well catered for in section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the National Drugs Advisory Board will be an advisory one but the advice will involve ascertaining whether the trial is properly conducted in accordance with the regulations.  This will involve looking at the documentation.  Does the Minister intend that the National Drugs Advisory Board and the Department will both carry out these functions?  Is it not the case that the National Drugs Advisory Board will be the executive arm of the Department in the implementation of this legislation?  The fact that the Bill contains but a single reference to the National Drugs Advisory Board is an inadequate reflection of the role they will have to play.  It sets a false responsibility upon the Minister.  I do not believe two bodies should be carrying out these functions. Will the National Drugs Advisory Board be continuing the functions they had in this area, or will the Department of Health be designing 12 or 14 people on their staff to deal with this work?  If it is the intention that the National Drugs Advisory Board should do this work &mdash; this is an indirect way of raising what is a fundamental issue on how this provision will be implemented and the role of that board &mdash; should that not be recognised in the legislation?  If we want to give them authority to require information we are going a roundabout way of doing so.  In my view it is against the Minister's policy of not having duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if the National Drugs Advisory Board will continue to <Col N="277" /> function as before bearing in mind that they will have added responsibility following the passing of this legislation and that the regulations will be statutory rather than voluntary?  Will the work that has been done by that body be carried out by Department officials in the future? If I was satisfied that there was a clear policy in regard to this matter I would withdraw my amendment but in my view the role of the board is not clearly defined in the legislation.  Legislation which provides that a Department will handle such matters while in effect another statutory body will do so will not in the long term be good legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy has said about duplication but I must point out to her that I do not envisage any duplication in regard to inspections. The Minister, speaking for myself, will designate the National Drugs Advisory Board to carry out a lot of this work, as they are doing at present, but it is important that the Minister, where he is the competent authority to grant permission for the carrying out of trials, should be in a position to designate the person or persons to carry out inspections on his behalf.  In practical terms that will involve the National Drugs Advisory Board but from time to time the Minister may wish to have somebody else, perhaps an official from his Department, carry out such an inspection.  In view of the Minister's responsibility under the Bill it should be for him to decide who carries out those inspections.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister accepts that the National Drugs Advisory Board will carry out investigations under these sections more often than not I should like to know why there is an objection to including them in the provision so as to allow a certain flexibility and administrative clarity.  If they wish to make inspections should they not have the freedom to do so?  Would it not be a simple matter to add the National Drugs Advisory Board to the provisions?</P>

Deputy Flaherty, in proposing her amendment, suggested that it might facilitate clarity but in my view it would cause confusion if there was to be a shared responsibility in regard to this. The Minister, as the person appointed by the House to carry responsibility for these matters, is the appropriate person to have the authority.  It is worth noting that the Minister has the authority to refer matters reported to him to the National Drugs Advisory Board for advice.  The Minister has taken the proper stand; he is the person who should carry full responsibility and should be reported to. I do not support the amendment.</P>

I do not have a fixed view on the provision because it is a specialised area that involves a certain legislative approach. However, I consider it important to discuss the section because concern has been expressed to me that this is an exception to all legal practice in that the onus of proof is on the person charged to prove that he or she is innocent rather than the person being presumed innocent until found guilty.

      <P>This section is linked to section 6 in which the definition of &ldquo;conduct a clinical trial&rdquo; appears.  The term is defined as meaning the conducting of a systematic investigation or a series of investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the effects of the administration of one or more substances or preparations on persons where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect.  Section 14 provides that where a person has been prosecuted for an offence under section 13 and that it is alleged in respect of a substance that it was intended to be administered for the purpose of a clinical trial, the onus is on that person to prove that the substance may not have a pharmacological or harmful effect if so administered.  This provision in the Bill would discourage an attempt, for example, to test a cosmetic for toxic effect under the guise of market research ostensibly to ascertain the attraction to consumers.  In my view it is necessary to have the section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister develop the example he has quoted? Applied generally, is the provision fair? Is the Minister saying that if the product has a negative effect the onus of proof will act as an added disincentive?  Is that not true in all cases?  However, in this instance it is not like a legal case in that the connection between the effect and the person who uses the product is undeniable. Will the Minister develop that point in relation to how he sees it as being <Col N="280" /> of value in increasing the protection in the Bill?  I hope it is not a vendetta against clinical trials which would undermine one of the fundamental objectives of the Bill which is to ensure that clinical research, which will benefit medicine, will go ahead.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, in the Table, line 19, after &ldquo;£180,000,000&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or the amount actually owed by the Company on 2nd November, 1987 whichever is the lesser&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>NET do not owe £180 million but a lesser sum.  Originally NET owed £180 million but that debt has been divided.  The debt in respect of the capital works is being transferred to the new NET holding company &mdash; if you like, it is staying with NET &mdash; but the debt in respect of working capital is being transferred to IFI, the subsidiary, which is the operating company jointly owned by NET with 51 per cent and ICI with 49 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly the amount of the working capital debt but, obviously, in a company of this size it is fairly substantial. My understanding is that NET have not borrowed £180 million.  If they need a State guarantee for their borrowings <Col N="282" /> they certainly do not need it in respect of money which they have not borrowed.  I propose that the figure of £180 million be put in as an alternative to the amount that they had actually borrowed up to 2 November and that whichever is the lesser of the two should be the one which is the limit.  That is a sensible way of doing things.  There is no need for this House to give NET permission to borrow money over and above what they have already borrowed.</P>
    <P>It is a wider question as to whether they need to be given a State guarantee in respect of this borrowing.  That point is being raised in some of the other amendments.  The Minister in replying to the debate indicated that NET and the Government had been offered the money they needed to borrow without the requirement of a State guarantee but the conditions were considered to be unacceptable. The first thing was that it would cost about £120,000 a year more which on a borrowing of £30 million is not a very high premium to pay when one does not have to give a guarantee that the State will repay.  It would have been reasonable for the company to pay £120,000 a year extra so that there would not have to be a State guarantee.  The other condition which the banks apparently imposed was that they should have a mortgage on the gas contract.  The gas contract is worth an enormous amount of money because under it gas must be sold to NET at a price far below the market price.  The banks, in looking for a mortgage on the gas contract were looking for what was tantamount to a State guarantee.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us details of that, or at all on this subject, until he was pressed here on Second Stage.  I would like some information from the Minister now as to the details and the conditions under which money would have been available without a State guarantee.  It is quite a serious matter for the State to give a guarantee to a commercial State company on their borrowings.  Once the bank have a guarantee it means that the bank do not have to look in a critical fashion at whether or not they should lend money to a project.  They do not <Col N="283" /> have to appraise the project to see whether it is good or bad because they know they will be repaid with interest by the State whether or not the project is a success.  The bank is not at risk.</P>
    <P>In a sense, it is a gesture of little confidence in the project if a State guarantee has to be given or if the banks had to look for a mortgage on the gas contract. Looking for reassurances of that kind indicates that the banks do not feel very secure about the project.  When a State and a company almost as large as a State are involved in a joint venture, that is a pretty good indication that it is a sound project.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the political pressures involving our State in this, there is no doubt that ICI would not get involved unless they believed this was a reasonable project.  They are putting some of their assets at risk in this joint venture and if it comes apart they will lose them.  They are taking a risk and the State is taking a risk.  Why are the banks not taking a risk too?  We have got into very bad habits of giving State guarantees almost without thinking about it.  It is now a normal process.  People who have already got a State guarantee now look for more because the company are expanding etc., and nobody dwells on the fact that it is essentially an aberration that a State guarantee should have to be given at all in respect of a commercial project.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board of NET were not told that a State guarantee was being sought.  Why were they not told? Surely if a State guarantee was being sought to back the borrowings of a company the board of that company would be apprised of that fact.  If the board did not know they needed a State guarantee and there was no need to tell them, why is the State guarantee being sought?  That is a reasonable question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to derail this project or to unilaterally and retroactively change the terms upon which finance is being made available to the project whether or not I believe it to be right.  One must recognise that if people have entered into certain arrangements on the basis of a <Col N="284" /> State guarantee if we come along and say: &ldquo;Sorry, you have not got that guarantee&rdquo;, it would cause commercial problems. With this in mind my amendment simply says that they can have a guarantee on any money lent to the company up to the date before this Bill was introduced into this House but that additional money advanced to the company from that day on would have no guarantee.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable amendment.  It strikes a reasonable balance between the rather more extreme position taken by Deputy Keating on his amendments where he would simply roll back the effect of this Bill altogether and give no guarantee, which is fine in theory but in practice, given that arrangements have been made in good faith, would create problems.  There should not be any problem in giving a guarantee in respect of money in place now, but not in respect of money in place from 2 November on. That is the purport of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my amendments the first thing to be said is that it is not right for this House to be bound by private arrangements entered into by the Minister in relation to guarantees.  This is the sovereign Parliament of this country and this Bill is before us for consideration. We should not be circumscribed or inhibited from reacting to it in the way we see fit, based on our honest perceptions of what is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this problem is that the unilateral goodwill extended to this company over decades has simply been used up.  The indebtedness of the company now is at the very least, of the order of £180 million.  If one honestly believed that the money being sought would help to turn this arrangement around, it might be different, but nobody honestly accepts that.  Nobody in his heart believes that in five years' time this company will be in a fundamentally different position from that in which it is now, that is, seeking to continue to exist on the basis of substantial handouts from the Exchequer. We would not be in favour of spending <Col N="285" /> an extra £30 million even if it was available, in the light of other priorities now pressing on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking that money and I certainly do not intend to be bound by some sort of convention that it is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  If I was that way inclined I would not bother coming in at all.  The Minister should clarify that first.  This should be a meaningful discussion.  There might be a vote at the end of it and whatever happens on that occasion will then be the basis of the law as it will then become.</P>
    <P>This is not a side show or a game of shadow boxing in which there is silent agreement that nevertheless the old way will go on.  One of the comments Deputy Bruton made and with which I agree is that over the last number of years there has been brought about a feeling that there were large areas of commercial activity which could forever milk the State for funds.  My view and the views of my colleagues is that that should not be the case, that such money is not available. By any reasonable commercial criteria this company have got a fair degree of largesse from the Exchequer and they have not performed.  I know that is fairly brutal and hard but I am afraid that is the way the world is.  I know many people who are suffering great hardship this morning because they have no jobs.  They do not have jobs because the State is continuing to featherbed companies like this.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not the normal talk of politicians.  The normal convention would be for one to come in here and pay tributes right, left and centre to workers and management.  I am sure that individual workers did their best but the ever decreasing number of taxpayers are being asked to foot the bill for another £30 million.  The Minister did not in any part of his speech on Second Stage adduce any reason which would give any of us hope to believe that this is the last such request or that this money would be a catalyst for progress in the future.  The first thing I want to establish is that we are in the <Col N="286" /> business of making decisions and not simply in the business of a dumb side show that plays the game in respect of private arrangements already entered into.  Certainly that is not the game I am in.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to clarify is whether the Minister can tell us what the prospects are and to show us, not simply by rhetoric, on the basis of financial projections, market research and perhaps some form of business plan, presumably got together in the context of the joint venture, that there is a way out of this mess which would not involve the State in further requests for money in a few years time.  We can see the pattern of indebtedness involved and it is very sad. I have no doubt that the management and the workers have done their very best in terms of trying to meet the requests that were put to them.  Perhaps the problem is not so much the supply of this commodity but the actual demand, the changes taking place in the market and the capacity of other economies and areas of industrial activity to satisfy the demand that is there on a more cost effective and cost efficient basis.</P>
    <P>There is one other question to which I want an answer and it is fundamental to this discussion.  There is no point in us engaging in a debate here based on what I would call creative accountancy which is dependent on a phoney price structure for gas supplied to ICI via NET.  I want to know publicly the precise cost of gas to the joint venture company, the precise dimension of subsidy applying to NET at this time and the full cost implications of that for the economy.  There is no point in anyone pretending that ICI are going to pay a commercial price for gas and that, therefore, they are going to gild the NET lily if the price of the gas supplied to NET in the first instance incorporates a hidden subsidy from the taxpayer.  I want to put that on the record and to get an answer to it because if that is the kind of creative financing that is involved, presenting sets of figures which essentially mask underlying patterns of hidden subsidy, it would be a disservice.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the sum <Col N="287" /> of £180 million be reduced to £160 million. The reason I want this to happen is that I have not seen anywhere evidence to indicate that an additional £30 million is warranted.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech said that when approving of the joint venture in January 1987 the Government decided that, if possible the additional medium-long term funding should be obtained from the banks on an unguaranteed basis, but that if the funding were not available on terms acceptable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance the Government would introduce legislation to guarantee the required borrowings. I mentioned in passing during Second Stage whether that kind of indication was clear at the time when the unguaranteed funding was being sought and whether those who were being asked to provide unguaranteed funding knew that the State would come up with the guarantee if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister want on to say that following this decision, discussions had taken place with a number of banks and while offers to provide the funding on an unguaranteed basis were received, the terms attaching thereto were not acceptable. I want to know why.  I have no doubt that there were good reasons but I do not know what they are and I want to know what they are before being asked to commit the State to taking up and filling the vacuum which the banks apparently offered to do.  Perhaps the terms they asked for were unacceptable.  I want to know why and how.  Is it because of the way government operates that we are too ready to run in with State guarantees and that perhaps we should have been tougher with ourselves.  Of course, if that was the norm we would not be in the mess we are in the first place.  I want to know what the criteria were and what terms the banks demanded.  I am asking this in the public interest.  The public have a right to know because they are being asked to pay the bill instead.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Government <Col N="288" /> decided to introduce legislation to guarantee the initial borrowings required i.e. £30m.  The banks were notified of the decision and, in anticipation of the introduction of this legislation, they provided the funding on terms acceptable to myself and the Minister for Finance.  Medium and long term facilities of £30 million have been arranged on acceptable terms, replacing NET's existing short term borrowings and providing the company with a contingency margin during the initial, transitional period of the joint venture in what remain unpredictable market conditions.</P>
    <P>That is to say that that money is to be used apparently for the contingency fund. Earlier in his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Successive legislative Acts had increased the Minister's power to guarantee NET's borrowings up to a limit of £150 million and this facility is currently fully utilised.</P>
    <P>That £30 million differential, some of which I understand has already been committed, is to be the basis for a contingency margin during the initial transitional period of the joint venture.  I would like to know precisely why the figure of £30 million was suggested.  What are the economic forecasts on which that demand was based?  Why was it £30 million as opposed to £20 million or £10 million, as I proposed in my amendment? Is this intended to fund a contingency fund for the transitional period and will it then either expire in some way, be refundable, if it is used up, or otherwise? Thirty million pounds is a great deal of money.  I remember Governments getting into extremely serious hot water over being obliged, they felt, to reduce various social welfare entitlements by sums of £2 million and £3 million.  I am not at all clear how it can be that a private company in the wake of already obtaining £150 million of direct funds plus various other forms of subsidies can convince the Government they need an extra £30 million. I want to know precisely why it is £30 million.</P>
    <P>Is it in order for me to move my other <Col N="289" /> amendments now or should the Minister come in and answer my questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If £180 million is the amount, which is essential, perhaps the Minister would tell us the underlying details and whether that figure will be the last such request and what guarantees in relation to performance are expected from the company in that respect or are there any such guarantees.  The more one stands back from this the more audacious it is for any Minister to come in here and simply extend the hand for approval of this House for a sum of £30 million without putting before us one shred of evidence as to why the figure should be £30 million or indeed what precisely the money is to be used for other than saying that arrangements have been entered into.  This House is not bound by any such arrangements in the context of considering this Bill and it would be a dereliction of duty for any one of us to feel circumscribed by arrangements entered into particularly when they are unexplained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the £180 million is essential, incorporating the contingency fund of £30 million, and if the joint venture is successful and there is a <i>de facto</i> reduction in their indebtedness, I would like to see that reflected in the debt to the Exchequer. That is what we are trying to achieve in amendment No. 2.  The figure of £180 million is the maximum that is outstanding at any stage but if things improve &mdash; and I have my own views as to whether they will &mdash; the taxpayer will also benefit in view of the extraordinary patience which that species has extended to this company.  If, during the next two or three years the sum reduces to £170 million or £160 million, I want a sliding downward scale of maxima to be applied to the indebtedness.  Otherwise I suspect that any company which would have an open cheque to the value of £180 million would probably feel inclined to utilise that maximum potential of £180 million rather <Col N="290" /> than be concerned about reducing it.  All I am asking is not that they should be circumscribed in terms of their capacity to operate commercially but simply that if things improve that improvement be reflected in the indebtedness which that company has to the State.  That is the reason I am suggesting amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 in my name seeks to give further effect to that.  It relates to the Table in the Bill.  The desire is to ensure that the sliding scale, which we hope is downwards, will reflect itself in the company's indebtedness to the State. It does not seem to be unreasonable.  We must bear in mind that this company has made a contribution to the economy as a very substantial employer and we do not want to be arbitrary in any way about the future of the company.  Nobody wants to do that.</P>
    <P>I wonder when, if ever, there comes a time when one has got to say: &ldquo;I am sorry, enough is enough&rdquo;; I am inclined to think it is now.  In essence, for the purpose of opening up this discussion I would like to know what precise guarantees are in place in relation to the proposed expenditure of that extra money? What criteria is this sum based on?  Is it based on a standard performance, a business plan, some market research or projections that are amenable to economic or political evaluation or is it simply some figure plucked out of the sky?  I want precise details about the arrangements entered in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the offer from the banks to take up this.  I want precise figures about the price of gas to NET and from NET to the joint venture company. I want reflected in the maximum indebtedness to the State an uppermost figure which reflects precisely the operational status of the company at any given time so that there may be some hope of reducing the indebtedness of NET in terms of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We must always bear in mind that every time we give £1 of taxpayers' money to any company or enterprise we have by definition decided to give that to company A as opposed to company B.  It is not a question of giving it or not giving <Col N="291" /> but rather it is a question of how we use State resources.  If this House has that kind of money available this morning there are many other areas where it could be used.  The Minister must convince us that what he is proposing is essential, that this is the necessary figure and that it is based on a clear set of parameters relating to guarantees for performance in the future.  I heard nothing of that in the Minister's Second Stage speech and I hope to hear it today.  If not, we will be opposing the Bill outright as we have opposed it in principle up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with all four amendments together.  It should be pointed out that this legislation deals with the level of guarantees for bank borrowings as the Deputies have said.  I thank them for their constructive approach to the debate.  The debt of £160 million which is referred to in the Second Stage speech was the amount of bank borrowings remaining with NET on the setting up of the joint venture at the beginning of October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debt of £160 million referred to in the Second Stage speech was the amount of bank borrowings remaining with NET on the setting up of the joint venture at the beginning of October.  NET had, of course, other liabilities, the most obvious being its liability for interest payments.  It also had a liability to pay for gas delivered before the joint venture actually took place.  Consequently, I should like to tell the House that by 2 November NET's combined bank borrowings and other liabilities were of the order of £168 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional hazard has now emerged for NET.  Because of commercial confidentiality &mdash; which I know Deputies opposite will appreciate given the nature of business today &mdash; I cannot disclose the full details of the gas price.  However, I should like to point out that NET will sell gas to IFI through a price formula which <Col N="292" /> includes a component related to heavy fuel oil prices.  Unfortunately, as Deputies are aware, this product is priced in United States' dollars and as the value of this currency falls it will reduce NET's income from gas sales.  On the other hand, lower interest rates would reduce its financial charges in turn.  In time such components of NET's business should balance themselves out.</P>
    <P>The hazardous nature of its trade, as Deputies will appreciate, requires that NET be given financial leeway to give the joint venture time to achieve maximum efficiency.  I must, therefore, reject amendments Nos. 1 and 3 seeking to limit the borrowing to £160 million or to the amount owed by NET on 2 November 1987.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 2 which states:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 9, after &ldquo;£180,000,000&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or such lesser amounts as may at any time be owing by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>and amendment No. 4, both from Deputy Keating, I support the sentiment behind the amendments.  However, the Attorney General's Office pointed out to the Department of Industry and Commerce that the proposed amendments are impractical and quite unprecedented.  To take away the flexibility which the upper limit setting of £180 million gives the company and to set lower limits, which then become maximum limits would mean that I would have to come back before the House at regular intervals to increase the level of State guarantee.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage it was pointed out that NET had lost £34 million over the past 21 months.  I hope that figure sinks in.  It could not be expected that the joint venture would immediately turn that around.  Consequently, it is quite obvious that NET will require additional facilities to take them through the next 12 to 18 months by which time it is hoped &mdash; and I know Deputies share this hope &mdash; NET's returns from gas sales and dividends will be sufficient to service the debts.  I must point out that the joint venture is now up and running.  The additional facilities <Col N="293" /> being sought are in respect of guarantees from the holding company, which is charged with servicing NET's debts.</P>
    <P>Unless we allow them scope for additional guaranteed borrowings, the bank's might immediately call in NET's unguaranteed borrowings and refuse to provide the additional facilities needed over the next year or so.  In the real world that is a very real danger and in such a situation the company would have to seek alternative unguaranteed borrowings which most likely could only be obtained by means of a mortgage on their gas contract resulting in increased costs through higher interest charges.  If such borrowings could not be organised, the Exchequer would have to provide facilities immediately to NET so as to allow them to service the debts which are there.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked for specific information on the rates being charged by the banks.  The Deputies asking those questions obviously know that such information is normally a confidential matter between the company and the particular bank.  However, I take this opportunity to assure Deputies that the rates obtained are as good as those for comparable State companies and better than the rates for comparable private companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamental issue and there is no way around it from my point of view.  There is no point in telling us that the bank rates are better than or comparable to those in the commercial sector, or that normally this is a matter of commercial confidentiality. This is not normal.  We are not dealing with a private company which is dealing with its own affairs with the bank.  We are dealing with public money.  I have to press the Minister to try to obtain factual information on the essential issue of the price of gas.  The Minister has hedged today.  His Second Stage speech was more general.  There are, apparently, elements in the pricing structure for gas which relate to the ongoing market price available, or perhaps prices in the world market &mdash; I do not know what the criteria are.  It need not necessarily be a commercial price as there are hedges and safeguards built in which effectively mean that the price will escalate upwards, or downwards if the price generally does <Col N="295" /> not suit the joint venture company or specifically ICI.  The Minister has decided to give £30 million of taxpayers' money to this company.  It is a guarantee which will be called in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be needed.  I asked the Minister to demonstrate that £30 million was needed.  The Minister has not done so.  I asked specific questions which the Minister did not answer.  He told us that the indebtedness of the company is £168 million, which is £18 million &mdash; unless I am misreading the speech &mdash; more than the facility which was extended on the last occasion this Bill came before the Dáil.  Have NET the capacity to run up debts over and above the indebtedness facilitated by the arrangements entered into legally in this House?  Have they to get agreement from the Department to do that?  If so, where and when does the Minister interpose himself in this regard?  All I am asking for is information which I believe Irish citizens are entitled to when the Minister decides to spend their money.  I want to know the precise degree of public subsidy incorporated into the price of gas which is being sold on to ICI.  If we do not have that information, we cannot make choices.  It is not a matter of private commercial interest, but of public right to know.  I hold this view very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the amendments would be impracticable and unprecedented.  The fact that they are unprecedented does not cause me any problem.  There are many things in this House which are unprecedented which I would not mind happening for the good of the House.  I am disappointed by the Minister's reaction.  He said the lowering of the limits could not be accepted because it would mean the Minister would have come back to the House at regular intervals.  This seems to indicate that forever and a day this company will be obliged to live off the Exchequer in this way.  If things improve is it not reasonable for us to try to pull back a <Col N="296" /> little on our exposure?  The best way to do that is to introduce an amendment.  I do not care whether or not this amendment is technically correct.  I am quite happy to discuss the technical details with the Minister.  I do not claim to be a draftsman. I have no staff to do that work; nor do I see it as my job.  The Minister concurs with the spirit of my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the banks would call in their guarantees and would charge additional interest rates, and so on.  The banks do many things for good commercial reasons.  It worries me slightly that there is a soft under-belly about public expenditure and public guarantees.  Perhaps the banks do this because they know there is a great deal of commercial risk out there.  Perhaps their suggestions about what they would have to do should alert us to the type of guarantees we are giving without having the capacity to impact on the company in this way.  Perhaps we should not be entering into those guarantees and the banks' attitude should warn us off.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all the amendments although he said graciously that he was sympathetic to the spirit of two of my amendments.  I want to know the gas price.  I am not concerned about the detail of the amendment and I am quite happy to have it redrafted but it is reasonable that we should insist that there be a reduction of exposure as the years go by.</P>
    <P>The question of commercial confidentiality does not arise in this case because we are not dealing with private commercial practice, we are dealing with extremely large sums of public money pursuant to having already spent large sums during the years.  I have read carefully every debate on the matter in this House since the company was set up and the one thing that every Minister who introduced such Bills said is that there is going to be a better tomorrow, that there is light at the end of the tunnel but then they will later say that something went wrong.  It would not be in order to talk about the Marino Point plant except to say that that was not just a red light but a whole battery of red lights.  We are now <Col N="297" /> talking about another large hand out of a general rounded nature without reference to any guarantees or details of the way the company should perform and without any reference to whether we will ever get a bob back.  That is not good enough and I want some answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put some points to the Minister.  First, did the NET board approve the seeking of a State guarantee?  Secondly, did all of the banks, or just some of them, who offered unguaranteed funds seek a mortgage on the gas contract?  In relation to that question, how many offers of unguaranteed funds were made available to the Minister as an alternative to giving a State guarantee in this case?  Thirdly, the Minister makes the excuse that NET face some hazards in respect of which they need this guarantee.  They owe only £168 million at present but the Minister feels they may owe some more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the fall in the dollar which would in turn lead to a fall in the price received by NET for the gas under the formula.  Is it not the case that if NET holdings are receiving less because of a fall in the price of gas, conversely Irish Fertiliser Industries, in which NET have a shareholding, are paying less for their gas under the same formula and that therefore the money is simply being transferred from one pocket to another.  As NET have a 51 per cent shareholding in Irish Fertiliser Industries they will make up, in the form of dividends, any losses they suffer as a result of the fall in the price they charge to Irish Fertiliser Industries for gas.  Fourthly, is it not vital that this House knows the pricing formula for the gas?  Otherwise we do not know what we are putting at risk.  We are not talking about a guarantee to a fertiliser producing company, we are talking about giving a State guarantee to a company whose sole business will be buying and selling gas.  They will have one business and one business only, the <Col N="298" /> management of a single contract, buying and selling gas.</P>

It seems that their ability to manage the debt depends on the basis on which they manage the gas contract.  Unless we know the nature of the gas contract we have not got the faintest idea about their ability to manage their debt and therefore we do not know what we are giving in terms of a guarantee.  This has nothing to do with NET, Arklow or Marino Point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we all know that. The Minister is being a little disingenuous in describing why he could not give this information by saying it is because of the hazardous nature of the trade and the commercial confidentiality.  I cannot remember his exact words.  The dogs in the street know pretty well what it is about in general terms and I cannot see why the House should not be told in precise terms as it is the House that is being asked to give the guarantee.</P>
      <P>I suggest an alternative.  If the Minister is unhappy with the idea proposed in my amendment, that the guarantee to NET holdings, which is not the fertiliser company; it is simply the holder of the debt which is now separated from the fertiliser company, should be limited to £168 million which is the amount outstanding at the moment, would he be prepared to accept an amendment on the terms that we could give 100 per cent guarantee in relation to £168 million but that in respect of any money lent by the banks over and above £168 million the guarantee shall be, let us say, 80 per cent so that for every £ they lend they will have a guarantee that they will be paid back 80p.  In that way, only 20p in the £ would be at risk. It is quite normal when a company go into liquidation that creditors are paid 80p in the £, 20p in the £ or 15p in the £. In this case would it not be reasonable to say that there should be a State guarantee in respect of 80p in the £ on all borrowings between £168 million, which is the present level of borrowing, and £180 million which is the amount being provided for in the Bill?  In that way, we would still be giving a State guarantee but on 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put another possibility to the Minister and I may wish to raise this by <Col N="300" /> way of a formal amendment on Report Stage.  It is everybody's wish that this arrangement should succeed.  One must accept that IFI and NET are, to use the Minister's words, in a hazardous trade. Would it not be sensible to say that there should be a State guarantee up to 1992 of £180 million but that after that the extent of the State guarantee to NET holdings shall revert back to the limit of £150 million?  In other words, give the company five years or four and a half years with £180 million of a limit, but at the end of that period the matter must be reviewed with a view to seeing whether they can revert back to £150 million or the House should be asked again to extend the higher £180 million limit.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make.  It is very important that NET holdings have reasonable information on the operation of Irish Fertiliser Industries which, after all, will be the source of their income, either in the form of the contract money for the gas or, in the long run, dividends.  If NET is to operate effectively as a holding company in respect of IFI it needs such reasonable information. The employees of IFI are not represented on the board of IFI; they are represented only on the board of NET holdings, the holding company but if employee shareholding and employee representation is to have any value there must be some information.  It would appear that there is a need to ensure that information is provided on a bi-monthly basis to NET holdings by Irish Fertiliser Industries on the operations of the company in regard to its plans or what percentage of capacity they are operating at over the period; in regard to finance or its budgets in line with forecasts; if there are forecasts in regard to finance, are they adhering to them and what marketing strategy is being followed.</P>
    <P>I objected on Second Stage to the idea of worker directors being involved in day-to-day type board operations where there could be difficult decisions to be taken, decisions of an immediate character affecting management strategy and industrial relations, for example.  That is not going to happen now because that <Col N="301" /> will be a matter for IFI and not NET. It would not be unreasonable that the Minister should look to ensure that Irish Fertiliser Industries supplies its directors on the NET holding company plus the employee representatives with regular information.  Both would benefit, as would the public, from regular bi-monthly information being made available to that board on the operations of the company from a physical point of view &mdash; capacity, usage and so forth; the operations of the company from a finance point of view &mdash; ability to keep its financing within limits and the marketing strategy being pursued by the company.  After all, the extent of the guarantee and its safety depends in good measure on the success of the operations of Irish Fertiliser Industries.  Therefore, information needs to be given to the holding company which is responsible for the debt which it needs Irish Fertiliser Industries to help it get rid of in the way Irish Fertiliser Industries is performing, and that would have the additional benefit of making information available to the worker directors on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>I have said I believe that worker directors should be represented in the form as operated in Germany where there is a supervisory board on which they are represented and an operating board on which they are not represented.  Operating decisions are not interfered with, do not become political in the sense of being political in industrial relations terms, but that broad oversight is something in which worker directors do participate. I would argue that the provision of this type of information to the holding company would strike the right balance between the conflicting demands in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief comment on the gas contract.  This contract was arrived at in the same manner as any commercial deal.  Instead of questioning the ability of NET to manage its affairs, the company should be congratulated on negotiating the deal which it did in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> A major problem, and a major contributing factor to the overall difficulties experienced by Nítrigin Éireann over the years, has been that this company has always and at all stages of its existence been under-capitalised.  Therefore it had no option but to repeatedly come forward, cap in hand, for financial assistance. Invariably the level of assistance that was forthcoming was of bare baleout proportions.  Any reduction in the amount of the guarantee proposed by the Minister would be a continuation of this undesirable and commercially obnoxious pattern which prevailed in the past.  I commend the Minister for having rejected out of hand any such suggestion. Guarantees sought by the Opposition benches are quite ludicrous to anyone with the slightest knowledge of commercial activity particularly in the general commercial situation in the fertiliser industry.  There is now a new found confidence in this revamped company, in the management, in its production ability, in its marketing ability and in its skilled workforce.  It ill becomes anyone to knock or in any way abuse or inhibit the future of this Irish company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are faced with in this Bill is the problem faced by the Government some time ago as to whether to continue this company as a company or to close it down.  At that stage the previous Government had decided on the course the present Government are taking; in other words, to discuss with another company a joint venture in order to maximise the outlets for its produce, diversifying the type and range of goods it was to sell on the international market, <Col N="303" /> because the company it was joining up with had outlets throughout the world, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the EC.  That decision was made and accepted by the previous Government and apparently by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we have, as I see it in this Bill, a company who had in the meantime debts of £180 million which was £30 million above that which the State had guaranteed.  This Bill today brings up the guarantee to the level of the debts of that company.  We have it in the Minister's speech when he says that these debts now stand at £160 million following the transfer to IFI of about £20 million in debts in respect of working capital.  That is £180 million of debts and, therefore, in the new situation the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be part of the deal but I am sure they want some guarantees to be made.  We want to see <Col N="304" /> these new arrangements being made but information has been sought on both sides of the House, which is reasonable. We should get down to the point where we say if we are for what is being attempted in this Bill, in other words, the continuation in existence of a company which have seen difficulties, certainly not of the making of the workforce.  They have been the greatest sufferers in all this, having being decreased from almost 1,600 to less than 700 at present.  The effort has been made on that side.</P>
      <P>These new arrangements are being made to help the company to exist and, it is hoped, prosper, which is why my party are giving support to the Bill.  They gave support in the past to arrangements which would have been very similar.  The only quibble from other Members is how the arrangements have been arrived at.  I see very little difference in the present arrangements from those that would have prevailed if my party had been in government.</P>
      <P>I stressed on Second Stage that the new arrangements have reduced the influence of worker directors in the new set-up and have hived them off on to the holding company so that they will not know what is going on in the IFI company.  I made then what I would regard as a serious charge, backed by a letter from one of the directors, but a reply was not given because there was not time.  I should have liked to have received a reply which was guaranteed by the Minister at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate.  The charge is that the facilities, etc. of the worker directors have been reduced and that they have been excluded from some of the meetings which discussed very important matters of finance with the board of NET.</P>
      <P>We were in support of this legislation in the past.  The company have debts of £180 million and the Minister is coming in to cover that situation.  In the end, the position has not changed over the past year or year and a half.</P>

      <P>I find myself in sympathy with the amendments put forward <Col N="305" /> by Deputies Bruton and Keating and with the arguments they have made in this case, but possibly for different reasons.  Here we have a deal involving ICI, one of the largest multinationals in the world, certainly in the chemical business. They are involved to the extent of 49 per cent in the IFI operation.  At this stage we are asking the Government, who have far higher debts and far less creditability with banks than ICI, to give a 100 per cent guarantee for another £30 million borrowing, but ICI are getting a 49 per cent share of a trading company with no debts.  IFI are starting up in business with no debts hanging over them.  If NET had initially been in that position they would now be very profitable, having had somebody else responsible for their debts.  ICI make no contribution whatsoever; they do not have to invest a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the whole idea of privatisation or semi-privatisation &mdash; and this is the beginning of other processes which the Government have in mind &mdash; was to save the Government or the State from having to put money into a venture. Here private enterprise are being brought in on a joint venture but they do not have to put in any money.  Now we are giving a guarantee for £30 million borrowing and we do not ask ICI even to go in on a joint venture on that borrowing.  As Deputy Bruton has said, if the Minister believes that the £30 million is essential and that we must have £180 million of borrowing, it should not be guaranteed just to 80p in the pound.  Following that line, I ask the Minister if he would consider guaranteeing it up to 50p in the pound and ask the ICI in a joint venture to guarantee the other 50p.  That would be most acceptable to the banks and it should be acceptable to ICI.  After all, they have not been asked to do anything else.  They are simply asked to go in on a joint venture with a guarantee for the extra £30 million, if it is essential.  We were told that a great deal was done in getting ICI involved here because presumably the advantage from them is their sales expertise and their marketing in Europe and probably other parts of the <Col N="306" /> world, of which the Minister is well aware.</P>
    <P>Richardson's are quite happy with the arrangements made so far because under them they cannot lose.  The worst that could happen would be that they might not gain very much.  They might gain a lot if things go well, ensuring an enormous profit, but if things go badly they might just not make a profit.  In that situation the Government are in a very strong position to tell them that NET, the holding company at the top, need further borrowings of £30 million, that the Government are prepared to back that 50 per cent but would ask ICI to back the other 50 per cent.  I cannot see anything wrong with that arrangment.  It is an excellent suggestion to put to ICI.  Deputy Bruton might have had that in mind although he did not say so, but an arrangement of that nature would be the best commercial arrangement.  It would be a proper bargaining position to take up.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the need for a joint venture at all.  If one is going to throw another £30 million in, one might as well have thrown the money into NET in the first place and made a separate arrangement for another holding company to be involved and to take over the debt.  Once the debt has been taken away, NET could manage fine.  It is reasonable that ICI should be involved in a simple guarantee to the bank of £30 million.  Deputy Bruton's excellent suggestion could help enormously with regard to industrial relations.  This was to ensure that IFI make bi-monthly returns of information to NET, the holding company, on the whole operation, marketing and so forth. He made the point that the holding company would need this information if they were going to manage the debt and gas prices.  It would also help the new company in the industrial area.  I am very well aware that the worker directors who were elected were very upset, fearing that having been moved upstairs they would have no idea of what was going on down below.  The information we are talking of would help NET in managing its affairs. It would help, too, in providing a role <Col N="307" /> for the worker directors that would help employees in IFI.  I support that idea.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite raised a large number of issues and I will try to deal with them as systematically as I can in the time available to me.  Questions were asked about whether the sum of £180 million is needed.  To take up the point which was made by Deputy Keating, there is no question of hand-outs under any circumstances.  Most people would freely admit that the tenure of the Government's economic policy has been to be extremely economical with State funds.  That can be seen clearly from the debate on the Estimates and from other financial debates.  The Deputy can take it that our approach to this matter is solely on the basis that we are not interested in giving one penny of State money to anybody beyond what has to be given.  This is consistent with State policy.</P>
      <P>The reason we have to make this extra £30 million available is that the State was faced by a company which had debts of £150 million.  I have great respect for the Deputies opposite and particularly for those who have contributed to this debate but in listening to their contributions it was as if we were starting afresh and were asked to enter into a joint venture with a multinational company, they getting x and we getting y.  That was not the option as the Deputies must be aware.  The reality is that we were faced by a company in serious financial difficulty, which had a workforce of between 700 and 800 employees depending on the day one took.  It was building up substantial losses on a daily basis and had lost £34 million over a 21 month period.</P>
      <P>We could not and did not start from scratch.  If we had been able to do so, we would have done a different deal but the most important point to grasp from this debate is that we could not start from scratch.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty about what the Minister of State calls <Col N="308" /> debts and what he calls borrowings.  We were told by the Minister last week that the borrowings amounted to £150 million and that the debts stood at £180 million.</P>

      <P>That was for the borrowings fully guaranteed by the State. That figure has now risen to £168 million and it is increasing at the rate of £1.5 million a month.  What I want the Deputies to realise is that the amount above £150 million was not formally guaranteed by the State.  This State company was running up debts of £1.5 million per month.  Following the advice we received from our corporate advisers we decided that the correct course of action was to impose a limit of £180 million.  I can tell the House that that figure of £180 million will be reached in a few short months.  Of course, the question arises as to how we handle that extra sum of £30 million.</P>

I am quite happy to engage in crossfire but if we do so I do not know how far we will get.  I am trying to explain to the House that we received advice from our corporate advisers.  The alternative to putting together a deal like the one which was put together was probably the end of NET and the loss of hundreds of jobs.

      <P>I have been advised that it will take about 12 months.  At present the figure stands at £168 million. Unless Deputy Bruton knows something about oil prices and interest rates that I do not know, the figure is likely to keep going up.  That is why we picked a figure of £180 million and not £160 million.  In fairness, most of the amendments which have been tabled do not deal with bank guarantees but seek to reduce the figure to £160 million.  I am saying that if we set the figure at £160 million we will be back <Col N="310" /> in here like a shot because the present borrowings of NET have gone up to £168 million.</P>

      <P>The position is that NET has been in difficulties for some time.  It has lost £34 million in 21 months. It does not help to label that money as a State hand-out or as a soft touch.  The company employs 700 people and we have been trying to come to grips with the problems it is facing.  An opportunity arose for us to do a deal and we grabbed <Col N="311" /> it.  It would be pointless of us to pin the figure at £160 million.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that we received advice from our professional advisers on this complex deal.  All the banks wanted a mortgage on the gas contract but we were not favourably disposed to giving such a guarantee.  They also wanted to impose additional interest charges and quite frankly we were not interested in that either.  Therefore, the Deputies opposite will have to consider whether they are in fact saying to the Government that we should have paid the extra interest from taxpayers' funds instead of giving a guarantee?  The same could apply to most State companies at present.  We could now take the view that we pay much higher interest charges and release them as a State debt and State borrowing. It is a much broader question than the one which applies to NET.  I have a lot of sympathy with what the Deputies have said on the question of State guarantees. When I sat on the Opposition benches I was very vocal about the need for reducing the amount of State funds involved and exposed.</P>

      <P>I can recall a famous Irish Shipping incident &mdash; probably Deputy Bruton and Deputy Mitchell were Ministers at the time &mdash; when I was trying to convince them to reduce State exposure in certain areas.  If I were starting with a clean sheet I would probably construct the company along the lines Deputy Bruton and Deputy Keating want.  Certainly that would be my personal view, but we did not start with a clean sheet and the essence of commerce and business is that you have to play the ball the way it lies and the way the ball lay in this case was that we were faced with dire alternatives for NET&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Excellent questions were asked and I am trying to deal with them as quickly as I can.  First, the extra money was needed because we were heading for that limit anyway.  That is the bottom line.  One could argue that we could have got it from the banks, or supported by the State.  We took the view that what the banks were seeking did not make sense.  Therefore, we went the other road.  That is a matter of judgment and we made that judgment with commercial advice.  Deputies opposite are entitled to take an alternative view.  Perhaps no two people in the same deal would come up with the same conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked about an employee share scheme.  The shareholders' agreement provides that NET and ICI will meet to discuss the possibility of introducing an employee share scheme if this is thought beneficial. <Col N="313" /> That is part of the shareholders' agreement; so we will ensure that that happens.</P>
    <P>A point was raised about the role of NET once their manufacturing role has shifted to IFI and so on.  The holding company will get information from IFI on a regular basis.  Deputy Bruton talked of the role of NET as being just that of dealing with the gas and managing the debt and that is true, but the third role is to monitor IFI.  In doing that, obviously all the directors of NET will have a full role.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the point about all the major commercial banks being approached in regard to the guarantee and all of them giving the same answer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was interested in the question of the board knowing about the medium term facilities put in place for NET, that is, the extra £30 million referred to, were approved by the NET board.  The terms are that the facilities will be guaranteed as soon as is practicable, but they were approved by the NET board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton talked about the lower gas prices, the interaction of that and the additional dividend from the fertiliser company, IFI, through NET and whether they will get a dividend in that regard.  If there were lower gas prices that would almost certainly mean lower fertiliser prices because gas is one of the raw materials involved.  Therefore, the fertiliser prices would be reduced and that would reduce the dividend coming from IFI to NET.  In any event, the dividends come much later than the monthly gas payments and for that reason would cause a considerable cash flow.  To an extent it is a seesaw in that it is linked up with the price of both the gas and the fertiliser.</P>
    <P>We got advice on the £180 million figure from professional corporate advisers who are very highly respected in the financial area.  We have taken that advice as well as our own view of the matter.  The formal permission and agreement of the Minister for Finance has to be sought for increased borrowings <Col N="314" /> in this company or in any semi-State company. If the situation improves suddenly, let me say without really diverting, we hope that IFI, who are now a NET and ICI joint venture, will succeed quickly, but it is unrealistic to expect them to make a return in the first few months sufficient to head off this £180 million which is needed.  However, we hope, as I know Deputies present do, that after 12 months if not sooner they will start to generate dividends of such a nature to NET that the borrowing situation in NET will improve considerably.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Keating is concerned that somehow they have now a blank cheque to run up debts back to the £180 million figure when they might not need to.  That cannot happen because the Minister for Finance has to give approval for that, and I doubt whether any Minister for Finance, even if he wanted to, would be able to authorise that type of increased borrowing.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that if a company have a choice of borrowing on the back of a guarantee, or borrowing without a guarantee, they would always opt to use the guarantee and continue to use it because the rate of interest at which they would borrow with a guarantee would be much lower than if they were to borrow otherwise.  Therefore, the company will have a continuing interest to use their guarantee to the full because if once they let their usage of the guarantee come back down and the Minister for Finance gets to know about it, they will not be able to put it back up again.  There is always a tendency for companies to want to use the guarantee to the full.</P>

That is exactly what we want to bring about.  There are many State companies with State guarantees.  When their debts come down and they do not require all the funds, they are not allowed to increase them.  The company would have to give a reason for wanting the additional funds.  The Minister for Finance would have to give his approval.</P>

      <P>NET is not on the list of such companies at present, but it could be included.  It is certainly something worth pursuing.  Regarding Deputy Mac Giolla's point about ICI and the level of State investment, it is not true to say that ICI have no involvement.  The factories from the Richardson's group have been included.  Secondly, ICI will have to carry a share of the borrowings undertaken by IFI.  Thirdly, 75 per cent of the profits will accrue to the State.  ICI have given a bit.  ICI were simply not interested in taking over £180 million worth of borrowings to bail out a company.  They were interested in a joint venture where the company would start comparatively fresh.  In theory one could say that ICI as a major multinational should carry the can but that does not make sense in the commercial world.  ICI were not interested in that kind of proposition and would not have become involved in the joint venture on that basis.  The alternative was probably the escalation of the £34 million loss incurred in the past 21 months, leading to movement by the <Col N="318" /> banks and the end of NET as we know it.</P>
      <P>We are quite fortunate to have been able to team up with one of the largest companies in the world with markets far beyond what we could ever dream of approaching.  It is an exciting, fresh beginning for Irish Fertiliser Industries and its employees.  ICI were not prepared to buy the old problems of the outgoing company.  Why should any commercial undertaking do that?  The old problem had to be put in a box called NET and kept there.  The interest on the debt will be serviced by the gas price and by the dividends, which are considerable, from IFI to NET.</P>
      <P>There is an excitement about getting a fresh beginning for all those workers in what can be a very fine company.  It is unfair to suggest that as well as this fresh beginning we could also have hived off £160 million on the party who wanted to get in on the new business with us.  The reality is that ICI were not interested in that proposition.</P>
      <P>The previous Government were asked many times about the price of gas, but I do not recall any Minister giving that information.  BGE have a number of customers and they do not reveal the price at which they deal.  They negotiate contracts with various companies.  BGE and the Government have taken the view that this is commercial information which should not be given out for public consumption. The price is commercial and there is no loss to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has instituted an inquiry into the reported near miss involving a plane and helicopter at Dublin Airport on 26 July last; if he has satisfied himself that the number of air traffic controllers is sufficient and their equipment adequate to ensure the highest possible safety standards, especially in view of the much increased air traffic along the east coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy, which occurred on 27 July 1987 and which involved a jet aircraft and a privately owned helicopter has been investigated by my Department.  The investigation revealed that the incident was a minor one; neither aircraft had to take avoiding action.  Nevertheless, in the interests of safety and to ensure that such <Col N="322" /> incidents will be avoided in future, procedures for air traffic control of helicopters coming in to land at Dublin Airport have been amended.</P>
      <P>The staffing situation in the air traffic services at Dublin Airport is kept under continuous review, particularly in the light of the increased air traffic at the airport, and, despite a reduction in the number of staff at the present time due to the Government embargo on the filling of vacancies, it has been possible, with staff co-operation, to maintain normal services at the airport.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have, however, been made to restrict traffic flows at Dublin Airport when the number of air traffic control staff is not sufficient to cater for the level of traffic offering.  Such arrangements can be introduced as necessary in the interests of maintaining a safe and orderly flow of traffic.</P>
      <P>Equipment and its maintenance at Dublin Airport are in keeping with international standards for the traffic environment and the level of traffic catered for.  The updating and re-equipment of facilities at State airports is an ongoing process.  At Dublin Airport two new instrument landing systems have been in operation since 1986 and it is proposed to spend about £12 million on new and replacement equipment at the airport over the next five to six years.</P>

Will the Minister tell us, in the context of that evaluation, if it has been established how close the two aircraft came to each other because there seemed to be a suggestion in one report in the national media that they were within 100 feet?  That was the reported view of the airline pilot who angrily reported the incident.  In view of the statement on what constitutes a minor incident, will the Minister explain the current definition of a near miss in terms of distance and other regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to dissolve the Dublin Transport Authority was taken as part of the Government's overall strategy to reduce public expenditure.  I will be <Col N="325" /> bringing legislative proposals in relation to the dissolution before the House very shortly.  Under this legislation, most of the functions of the DTA will be reassigned to authorities with responsibilities in the relevant areas such as the Garda and the local authorities, which in many cases had responsibility for the functions originally.  The Dublin Transportation Task Force are being reconstituted to assume some of the Authority's functions in relation to traffic management and the introduction of bus priority measures.</P>
    <P>As regards overall transport planning for Dublin, the Government have decided, in view of the present serious state of the public finances, that future transport investment plans should be based on bus options or diesel services on existing rail lines.  The agencies involved are expected to proceed on the basis of this policy approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the only saving the Government made by this decision is the salary of the chief executive as all the other staff were seconded from other Departments? The whole purpose of the Dublin Transport Authority was to co-ordinate the input from the various Departments, bodies and local authorities so that there will not be a fragmented approach to the development of transport strategy for Dublin.  Despite his own convictions, as stated in the House, that this was the required approach, we are now reverting to the position that obtained seven years ago when there was no co-ordinated approach to transport and its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that was the purpose of the Dublin Transport Authority. The saving to the Exchequer of a fully staffed DTA would be £500,000 per annum.  That looks small in the context of our discussions in Government but in the exercises we are undertaking it is quite a substantial sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for a roll-on/roll-off ferry service to serve the Aran Islands are <Col N="327" /> being looked at closely, having regard to the transport needs of the islands and the current difficult Exchequer position.  I hope to submit proposals to the Government fairly soon.</P>
    <P>During the summer season CIE provided an additional service with the <i>Dún Aengus,</i> which linked up with the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> at Kilronan to service the two smaller islands.  The board have told me that they are endeavouring to resume the <i>Dún Aengus</i> service for the winter schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his answer is the standard reply given about this matter for the past two years, for the period in which he has been in office and for a long time during the period of his predecessor?  Is he also aware that this matter has now become critical, that the <i>Naomh Éanna,</i> the vessel in use by CIE may not be certified by Lloyds marine insurance assessors as they have made it known they may not certify the vessel for open sea passenger operations next year as the thickness of the underwater plating is now a critical factor which may not be able to withstand passage in rough seas.  This is a passenger-carrying vessel as well as a goods-carrying vessel.  In view of this, will the Minister recognise that it is now critical for an early decision to be made by the Government on the replacement service to the islands?  Will the Minister also indicate his own position in regard to the proposal to operate two ferries, one from Rossaveal to Kilronan and a smaller vessel from Kilronan to Inishmaan and Inishere?</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;being looked at closely&rdquo; was used two years ago, eighteen months ago and six months ago in reply to questions.  My question to the Minister is very explicit.  When did the Minister last write to the group who have been meeting him in connection with the roll-on/roll-off ferry?  Did the Minister not promise them at a meeting that he would be making a specific reference to Cabinet some time ago, and what recommendation of a policy kind is he now making?  Did the Minister not also tell the group, as did his predecessor, that on completion of a survey in his Department an explicit recommendation would be made to Cabinet?  What is the present position?  That is what both Deputy Molloy's question and mine asks.</P>

      <P>As a first step in the replacement of its European fleet, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two Boeing 737-300 aircraft for the Ireland-London routes on 30 October last.  The second is due for delivery later this month.  The cost of the two aircraft &mdash; $72 million &mdash; is being met from the company's own resources and no Exchequer equity or State guarantee of borrowing by the airline is involved.</P>
      <P>The Government have also approved a proposal by Aer Lingus to acquire, again without recourse to the Exchequer, four new Boeing 737-500 aircraft, for delivery in late 1990, for their Continental European routes.</P>
      <P>The question of fleet replacement generally by Aer Lingus in the period up to the mid-nineties is currently under review by an interdepartmental review group who will be assessing the company's overall investment strategy and financing. The group are expected to complete their work within the next few months.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the first two aircraft, the one that has arrived and the one that is due to arrive at the end of next month, cost $72 million and that the four bigger planes due to arrive will cost $105 million.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The general thrust of the analysis and policy recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report in the three critical areas of product development, competitiveness and marketing are totally <Col N="337" /> consistent with Government policy for the tourism sector as already outlined by me in this House on many occasions.  The specific policy recommendations in the report are at present being examined in my Department.  These recommendations and the views of all sectors of the industry in both written and oral submissions to my Department will be taken into account in the development programme for the Irish tourist industry which I intend to publish shortly.  This programme will specify appropriate roles and structures for public sector agencies involved in Irish tourism including those for Bord Fáilte and my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us how soon he will be in a position to present a long range plan with clear objectives, supported by this programme, that include identifying the markets and determining whether the concentration will be on a vertical market or a horizontal market.  In other words, will the concentration be on the specialised type of holiday or the general holiday? Can the Minister let us know how it is proposed to maximise the return on the scarce resources in these areas of investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I already have a draft of my five year plan and I am seeking the consideration of Price Waterhouse of that draft.  As I said in the substance of my answer, the product that we have, its competitiveness and the way we market it require special attention.</P>
      <P>It is under those headings that the Deputy's second question falls, namely, what type of product are we going to emphasise.  We are going to emphasise very strongly the special interest holidays because this area has been neglected. There is a general belief that an attempt has been made to sell Ireland in too general a way and for that reason there will be strong concentration on specifics in our new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his global reply indicated that he is about to produce a five year plan.  The thrust of some of these questions is very specific and I would like the Minister to answer them. Does he agree in broad terms with the findings of the Price Waterhouse report? That is asked in Question No. 27.  This report is very explicit in its criticism of the tourist industry and more specifically of the operations of Bord Fáilte.  What are the Minister's views on that aspect of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply was more than full with regard to that.  The Price Waterhouse report deals with product development, competitiveness and marketing.  I indicated to the House on broad lines, quoting the Deputy in his supplementary, that I am in agreement with what is contained in the report.  The five year programme will concentrate on those areas.</P>
      <P>So far as product development is concerned, not only will we improve the product as we have it now but we will also expand it horizontally so that we will have more products to sell.  Access transport is one of the big factors in competitiveness. We have been hammering away at that since early in the year and with some considerable success.  I hope that as a result of the Council of Ministers for Transport we will have even more competitive access transport in the coming year.  The third area deals with marketing.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn touched on the type of marketing.  While serving a purpose the green isle marketing and the generalised marketing are no longer adequate to sell the product as we have it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Price Waterhouse specifically stated that their findings showed that 56 per cent of the people who holidayed in Ireland were dissatisfied. Does the Minister propose to take on board the recommendation that the regional tourism organisations should be restructured and integrated into Bord Fáilte?  Does he think there ought to be local authority involvement where there is no structure such as a regional tourism organisation?  Does he see a direct involvement role by local authorities in the promotion of tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is an important one.  If we want to sell a &ldquo;green&rdquo; holiday, a holiday of pure air, clean streams and rivers, the local authorities have the paramount role in that regard.  I know the Department of the Marine also have legal responsibility in this area, but local authorities have a serious obligation, in view of things that have happened in the very recent past, to facilitate us in selling our tourism product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at something the Minister has said.  He said that he now has a draft plan ready and somehow or other he is going to fit the Price Waterhouse findings into his draft plan.  That does not tie in with what the Minister has been saying.  The Price Waterhouse report is a fundamental and significant document which highlights in a constructively critical way an enormous amount of areas that need to be taken on board.  Is the Minister now saying that the Price Waterhouse report is to be downgraded and will not form the basis of the proposed tourism development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying no such thing. My Department have already highlighted the three major areas highlighted by the Price Waterhouse report.  Indeed the Department's thinking and study are just as deep as the Price Waterhouse report. However, the Price Waterhouse report is <Col N="340" /> a very useful aid in putting together our five year plan.  The draft plan which has been prepared already has taken cognisance of the Price Waterhouse report.  I would not like the Deputy to get a false impression from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Price Waterhouse report is a result of the White Paper on Tourism published in 1985.  The Minister has informed us that he is due to publish a five year plan on tourism.  Surely, there should be a full debate in this House on the findings of the Price Waterhouse report, which I believe, cost well in excess of £1 million?  In essence, the report is a summary, and a criticism, for that matter, of the second largest industry in the country. There should be no question of the Minister publishing a plan until this House has had the opportunity to discuss this report in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the report has been published already.  In addition, submissions had been invited from all concerned.  In all my time in public life I do not suppose that I have ever met an industry which is more cooperative and anxious to make a contribution to tourism policy.  The industry are very anxious that we should have an efficient tourism policy to deal with the areas of product development competitiveness and marketing.  I must correct the former Minister, Deputy Deasy. He was correct when he said that the Price Waterhouse report was commissioned by the previous Government. However, its cost was about £250,000, not £1 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's statement that he accepts the Price Waterhouse report, how does he envisage funding the marketing functions in future?  In the context of a significant cut in the State's budget for marketing, is it envisaged that the funding for marketing will come from private sources? With regard to product development, does the Minister not agree that the abolition of An Foras Forbartha is widely perceived as diminishing our capacity to sell the clean product type of tourism?  I ask, who will fund the marketing function given the cuts and whether the abolition of An Foras Forbartha will damage the concept of clean tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is another question down about funding which we may reach later.  My Department have indicated to Bord Fáilte that it must make adjustments because of the reduction in its budget, but that the promotion and marketing area should be kept intact.  We are also expecting an increase in funding from private interests.  Finally, while my Department do not have responsibility for An Foras Forbartha I have been assured by the Minister concerned that the functions performed by An Foras Forbartha will be performed by certain sectors in other Departments.  I assure Deputies that they will be kept on their toes as far as tourism is concerned as long as I am Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>

We are hopeful, and judging by the bona fides we have met already, that the industry will invest more in tourism development in the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recollect that I explained to the House on 29 October that the previous Government had decided in 1986 to make available to the promoters of the Cork-Swansea service a grant of £500,000 to assist in the start-up of the service.  Payment of the grant had commenced before the present Government took office but I honoured the commitment already given and the balance of the grant was disbursed by my Department to the promoters.  The £500,000 represented a once-off grant which was given in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the role his Department are playing in the proposed transfer of tourism responsibilities from Bord Fáilte to SFADCo; if he has satisfied himself that there will be no job losses within the Shannonside staff; his views on whether the mid-west region's tourism interests will be best served by such a move in view of the fact that no additional funding is being provided to SFADCo for this additional responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and SFADCo, in consultation with the Board of Shannonside, are currently in the process of preparing for the formal transfer of tourism functions in the mid-west.  The future of Shannonside staff is being dealt with in the context of these consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's objective is to ensure that the transfer is carried out with <Col N="346" /> maximum efficiency and that there is a significant improvement in tourism promotion and development in the region. I am satisfied that the development of tourism in the mid-west region will be significantly enhanced by the proposed changes.  Contrary to what the Deputy has stated, funds have been made available within SFADCo's allocation for 1988 to carry out their extended tourism remit.</P>
    <P>SFADCo are at present also in consultation with the industry and local authorities in the region to ensure that present contributions towards the operative budget of Shannonside will be at least maintained, if not increased, under the new regime.  In addition, SFADCo will have access to the considerable revenue generated from Shannonside's former commercial activities which are to be taken over by SFADCo as part of the transfer.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the question I have tabled. I have specifically asked him what is going on in the various organisations that are in negotiation at the moment.  Is he satisfied that no jobs will be lost so far as the Shannonside staff are concerned?  Will he also explain to the House why it was not he but the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, on August weekend last, made an announcement about this proposed transfer and why there was such haste and such behind-the-scenes activity without any prior consultations with the bodies involved?  So far as the people in the area are concerned the position is quite unsatisfactory.  Since August weekend no information has been given on the matter and nobody is any the wiser as to what is happening.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister why this change was made since apparently no one wanted or suggested it and no one knows how it is going to work. Is the Minister aware that Bord Fáilte and the IDA think the whole idea is crazy? SFADCo cannot very well say it is crazy but they do not know what they are supposed to do because they were not consulted about the matter in advance.  How does the Minister think that tourism promotion which, by definition, must be carried out abroad is going to be carried out throughout the world by SFADCo?  Will <Col N="348" /> they open offices in all countries in which Bord Fáilte and the IDA have offices?</P>

      <P>The ones I have spoken to have no such views whatsoever and I am confident that SFADCo will enhance tourism activity in that area.  The basic question the Deputy asked was why it was done.  It was done to streamline operations so as not to have cross functions in that area and to give one organisation the power to develop the area of small industry, large industry and tourism.</P>

      <P>The Deputy correctly states that part of Lakelands is involved, namely, south and west Offaly.  I had a consultation with the man on the tourist board who represents that area.  I gathered from people I consulted that south and west Offaly were delighted to be in the development area.  I can assure the Deputy that there are many other areas in the country that would like to have a special position with regard to development, for instance, the people who have been enjoying SFADCo and its advantages over the years.</P>

I would ask the Minister if he will be taking on board that recommendation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>The Government considered the position of SFADCo and Shannonside tourism and made a decision.

      <P>The Book of Estimates this year does not show that any additional funding is being provided to SFADCo for tourism promotion.  Can the Minister, therefore, tell us how SFADCo will be in a position to be on the same level as Bord Fáilte throughout the world and give the same type of profile of the mid-west on the world market as the rest of the country will get?  There is no evidence that that will be possible because resources are necessary to do that and these are not available in the Book of Estimates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The only outstanding Exchequer grant commitments in respect of regional and local airport development relate to the Letterkenny Airport project, County Donegal, Carnmore Airport, Galway and Farranfore Airport, County Kerry.  It is expected that the bulk <Col N="351" /> of these commitments will be discharged in 1987 and provision has been included in my Department's Vote for 1987 for this purpose.  The 1988 proposed allocation of £10,000 for regional-local airport development is a token provision to cover some small items, including payment of retentions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general question of grant assistance for the development of regional-local airports, I would point out that Exchequer funds of over £13 million have been provided for this purpose since 1980.  Given the extremely difficult budgetary position faced by the Exchequer I am sure Deputies will agree that this level of financial assistance has been generous.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the establishment of additional regional airports or the financing of improvement works at existing ones is essentially a matter in the first instance for local initiative subject to compliance with the technical aviation requirement of my Department and planning legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the representations, if any, he has made to the United Kingdom authorities regarding (a) the change of rules by them concerning flights into or out of the United Kingdom from Ireland (b) the fact that the system of liberalisation of new routes has been abandoned by the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="352" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Numerous official, diplomatic and political representations have been made to the British authorities since last June protesting at their failure to authorise the inauguration of new services on routes between Ireland and the UK.  It has been repeatedly pointed out that their attitude contradicts the liberal posture of the UK in bilateral and multilateral air transport negotiations and that it is inconsistent with the practice of the Irish and British authorities over many years in respect of the authorisation of new services.  These representations have not brought any positive results to date.</P>
      <P>As I informed this House on 23 June 1987, the British authorities, who had previously indicated their willingness to accept freely the opening of new routes, are now prepared to do so only in the context of an overall package with particular emphasis on the number of carriers that should be allowed on any route and particularly on the London-Dublin route.  I have made it clear at the EC Council of Ministers that any expanded opportunities that are granted to external carriers to serve the Irish market must be balanced by meaningful fifth freedom rights for Irish carriers who are handicapped by our peripheral location and a small home market.  This is the line which has been adopted also in the course of bilateral negotiations with the British authorities who have not, however, been prepared to date to concede any fifth freedom rights to Irish airlines except as part of a multilateral agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter context, I should point out that the EC air transport package which was finalised by the Council of Ministers last June, provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for liberal market access for airlines of member states, including the possibility of inaugurating services on new routes, a multiple designation facility and fifth freedom rights.  The EC package was not adopted because of difficulties which arose concerning Gibraltar Airport.  If it had been adopted, it would effectively have solved the bilateral problems between Ireland and the UK.  While I am hopeful that the EC package will be formally adopted at the next EC Transport Council on 7 <Col N="353" /> December next, I cannot at this stage be certain about the outcome.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we are continuing on a bilateral basis to seek a solution to our problems with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his very lengthy reply.  I am glad to hear him concur with what I have said in the question, that the United Kingdom authorities are not being fair or playing ball in this matter.  It is an incredible turnaround for the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in terms of her attitude towards liberalisation, privatisation and everything in the UK that suddenly when an Irish airline, in the guise of Ryanair, comes along and proves that the routes that we have decided upon can be opened up and can increase tourism and traffic flow in both directions that suddenly the rule book has been thrown out.  This cannot be accepted by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to meet in the immediate term with the British authorities again in regard to this matter?  With regard to the meeting on 7 December at the Council of Ministers, has the Minister mustered any support from any of the other countries to come to our assistance, particularly in regard to the bilateral situation with the UK? In terms of the broader freedom rights situation, has the Minister again got the support of other countries?  Do they recognise that we are an island off Europe, that these transport deregulations are of extreme importance to us, that we are not a major threat in real terms to these countries and they should facilitate us in the true spirit of the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am in full agreement with what the Deputy has said about the treatment of Ryanair with regard to the Shannon-Luton and Cork-Luton services which they had already prepared and advertised because we were <Col N="354" /> so sure permission would be forthcoming. The second part of the Deputy's question was with regard to the kind of support we can get.  I am happy to be able to tell the House that I was more than pleased with the support that Ireland, specifically, got from various Ministers on 22 and 23 June and on 30 June, the deadline, when we were working on this air package which, as I said, would solve all these difficulties.  If the package had got through, Ryanair would have had no trouble whatsoever on the Shannon-Luton and Cork-Luton routes.  Not merely that, but so supportive were Mr. Warnke of the FDR, M. Douffiagues of France, Mrs. Kroes-Smit of the Netherlands and others that Ireland and Portugal got special concessions on hub-to-hub traffic out of that meeting.  Unfortunately, we collided with the Treaty of Utrecht of 1714 before midnight on 30 June.</P>
      <P>The position at the moment is that we started working on Mr. Channon, the British Minister, since then on a bilateral basis.  He and Senor Caballero, the Spanish Minister, either at ministerial level or at official level, have been trying to resolve the problem in regard to the airport at Gibraltar which the Spaniards claim is outside the territory conceded by the Treaty of Utrecht.  There is a sovereignty battle going on there.  I regret to tell the House that I saw last night on a BBC news programme a demonstration by Gibraltarians against making any kind of arrangements with the Spaniards with regard to that airport, which gave me a little heart flutter in that I was developing optimism with regard to the meeting on 7 December.  There is a meeting at top level organised for 30 November which would be roughly one week before the council meet.  We were hopeful that at that meeting the Spaniards and the British would resolve the difficulties in such a way that they could present something that would let our package through on 7 December.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the overall context of the agreement which failed to emerge at the last meeting it is apparent that the British authorities are at the centre of this crux and that they are using the situation in Gibraltar to prevent this agreement from coming into being?  This is to protect their own airlines into and out of the United Kingdom.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say about that is that there are those who have such a suspicion.  I know that the British Minister on 30 June rowed in behind the package, even though he had been holding out for more advantage in the UK-Ireland situation.  In the end he agreed, claiming that his Irish ancestry helped him to make up his mind to favour us.  I am leaving it to the wisdom of the House to assess that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with a number of amendments that were taken together.  The Minister of State was in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making it clear that in pulling this deal together to get NET off to a fresh start we were not starting from scratch as we might have liked.  NET were in some financial difficulties and the suggestion of a joint venture between ICI and NET offered the opportunity of a completely new start.  We grabbed that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members opposite raised a number of points about the level of the guarantee, the involvement of the banks and other such matters.  I believe we have dealt substantially with them.  I have not had an opportunity to cover completely the position regarding gas.  Natural gas is one of the largest and most fundamental costs in fertiliser manufacture.  I have been pressed by Deputies to disclose the cost of the gas and the arrangements.  Disclosure of the arrangements which IFI, the fertiliser company, have with regard to gas supplies would be extremely detrimental to IFI in the fiercely competitive market in which they are now operating <Col N="381" /> as, quite bluntly, it would reveal vital commercial information about IFI's cost structure to their competitors.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to reassure the House that there is no element of subsidy being passed on to IFI and I want to make that as clear as I possibly can.  The price which BGE charge NET for gas must remain confidential as it is a contractual arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The key question which I want to follow up is why we need to have a State guarantee that in the event of this holding company failing to pay back their loans the taxpayer must find the money.  We have been told by the Minister of State that he was offered the money by the banks as a loan without a State guarantee.  He said that he found the terms unacceptable for two reasons; one of which was that a higher rate of interest would have been charged.  I do not find that an unacceptable reason. Obviously, a loan without a guarantee is going to carry a higher rate of interest than a loan which does have a guarantee. The difference is not particularly high, £120,000 per annum on a loan of £30 million.  It is well worth paying that price not to have to give a State guarantee.</P>
      <P>However, there may be some substance in the Minister of State's second objection which was that the banks who were offering the money to the company said that if they did not receive the State guarantee that, in addition to charging a higher rate of interest, they would want a mortgage on the gas contract.  What does this mean?  Is it tantamount to a State guarantee or not?  What is the gas contract worth?  If the gas contract is worth a lot less than the State guarantee, I do not understand why the Government did not take the loan without the guarantee. If, on the other hand, the mortgage on the gas contract is as good as a State guarantee I can well understand why the Minister of State might decide to go for the cheaper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said he did not want to give any information about the mortgage and the gas contract.  Let me <Col N="382" /> say as unprovocatively as I can that this is central information which the House must have and it is not commercially sensitive. It is a unique transaction in that there is only one natural gas contract in the hands of NET.  This is not information which would be of any use to a competitor because the holding company are not in competition with anybody else.  We are not talking about a guarantee to Irish Fertiliser Industries.  Whether NET Holdings have a State guarantee or not is irrelevant to the workers in Arklow or to the workers in Marino Point as they are not affected by the debts of the holding company.  Their jobs will stand or fall on the commercial viability of Irish Fertiliser Industries which are unaffected by the finances of NET Holdings.  This amendment relates only to NET Holdings. There is a corporate veil drawn between NET Holdings and Irish Fertiliser Industries and what happens to NET Holdings will not affect Irish Fertiliser Industries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is harder to penetrate.  It is impossible for us on this side of the House to judge whether the Minister of State should have given this guarantee without knowing what the alternative was in some greater detail. The Minister of State should tell us what demands the banks made and what they amounted to.  What did the mortgage on the gas contract amount to in commercial terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State received the advice of corporate advisers on the deal and they may well have advised him to go for a 100 per cent State guarantee on the loan but I am not so sure that they were too pushed about whether the State gives the guarantee or not.  Their focus is on the narrow short-term financing of NET Holdings and the IFI.  They are not particularly concerned with or qualified to advise on the finances of the State.  In this House we are supposed to be concerned with that aspect. Therefore, I am not over-convinced by the argument of the Minister of State if that is, in fact, his argument.  The only <Col N="383" /> corporate advisers who matter in this case are those in the Department of Finance and those of the Minister of State's own Department as they are concerned with the finances of the State and not with the finances of commercial entities.</P>
    <P>I would like to pursue further with the Minister of State the meaning of this mortgage on the gas contract and what it amounted to in commercial terms.  What was the balance of advantage in rejecting it and going for a full 100 per cent State guarantee on the loan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Bruton's request.  The Minister of State in replying to questions about this fundamental issue said that the arrangements for the supply of gas from BGE to NET are confidential and that the arrangements for the trade-on from NET to ICI are a matter of commercial activity.  It would seem that the Minister of State does not want us to know about the details of the arrangements which the banks asked for in regard to the mortgage. It is like being asked to approve of something when you are blindfolded and have your hands tied behind your back in a dark room.</P>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that I will not be supporting this Bill unless I am given reasonable information on which to make a judgment.  I am not in the business of selling a pup on behalf of the taxpayer.  I am not impressed by the reference to corporate advisers.  This company have been cluttered with advisers since 1961 and between them they have made some cock-up of the company. As an elected representative I am entitled to have this information just as much as any anonymous corporate adviser.  I demand to be given this information and I will be opposing this Bill unless I receive it.  We are asked to be comforted by the fact that NET will monitor the performance of IFI.  I do not wish to be disparaging about the performance of NET but I do not believe anyone could be consoled by that on the basis of past performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> It is not a question of going over past cases of moneys which have been spent and utilised in some way or other.  We would like to know whether there is a bottom to this well?  Will this be the last time the State will be asked to pick up the tab or can we expect to see the Minister of State in here again in six months time saying that IFI or NET, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, have spent another £10 million to £15 million and asking for retrospective permission to increase the guarantee?  Will the Minister of State give us an unequivocal guarantee that that will not happen?  I see from a glance at the record of the discussion the last time this Bill was debated that the then Deputy asked whether in making these moneys available we had any insurance or what action was being taken to stop the further erosion and the haemorrhage from NET, and so on.  It is all <i>déja vu,</i> and it goes on all the time.  If the Minister, as he is today, is asking us to support this Bill and we insist on getting information on which to make rational judgments, we have at least the same right as corporate advisers whose interests, good and all as they may be, are not necessarily similar to those of us in this House who have a broad interest in public welfare, public expenditure and the taxpayers.  What price do BGE charge NET for their gas and at what price do NET sell it?  I have an absolute right on behalf of the people to know what those arrangements are because we are not dealing with someone's private money here, we are dealing with hardearned cash which the taxpayer has to part with and about which he is given no choice.</P>
    <P>Just before lunch the Minister talked about this money being essential, and I have no doubt that he is convinced that it is.  In agreeing, as I assume the Minister for Finance did, to the over-expenditure, that is over and above the £150 million guarantees that were the basis of the last Bill and the current indebtedness which we are told is £168 million, depending on which script one reads &mdash; according to the Minister on Second Stage it could be <Col N="385" /> argued to be £180 million already if you throw in the £20 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the agreement which the Government and the Minister for Finance have given to the expenditure which has been incurred over and above the guarantees to date and in terms of the arrangements that are now in place <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £30 million in broad terms of extra guarantees that are being sought, what sort of examination was made of the expected performance of the new arrangement?  For example, was there any evaluation of how well the company would do in the next two or three years?  Was a business plan of any kind looked at?  Is there some performance ratio?  On what does one make these judgments?  To what extent did NET say that if they got this money they could perform and therefore in two or three or ten years' time they would be <Col N="387" /> relatively self-sufficient?  I want to know that because if I were to go into the IDA today on behalf of a constituent or of myself I would not get inside the front door unless I had a very persuasive argument. That persuasive argument is at least as important when somebody comes in here looking for money.  I have not heard that reference to what I might call the convincing elements of the arguments for NET getting more money on top of what they are getting already.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to be awkward about this, but it is essential that the Minister tells us that these are the internal arrangements <i>vis-à-vis</i> the price of gas, so that we can make judgments on the commercial viability and, therefore, the political wisdom of agreeing to this Bill. Nobody wants to cause problems unnecessarily for the hard-pressed workforce or for management who undoubtedly want to do their best, but we cannot be expected to buy a pig in a poke either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Deputy Keating raised is worrying most Deputies.  With a £150 million limit the company were unable to continue without borrowing further funds.  The Minister said they were borrowing something of the nature of £1.5 million a month in order to keep going and it has gone up to a £168 million debt from £150 million guaranteed borrowing from the State. When it reaches the £180 million which the Minister estimates it will be in about 12 months, what precisely is this guarantee cut-off that the Minister has that they will not continue to require borrowing? Suddenly when they reach the £180 million they will need to borrow no more for some reason, the Minister seems to be guaranteeing us.  Why?  What will happen?  What miraculous event will occur which will prevent NET from requiring to borrow any more funds once they reach the £180 million limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. <Col N="388" /> It should be very easy for the Minister to tell us first what NET have been paying in the past for their gas.  Presumably it was a percentage of the current price of heavy fuel oil and the new arrangement is that it be related again to the price of heavy fuel oil, whether 100 per cent or not.  The Minister will be able to see what the difference in income will be to the company by this increase in the price of gas which they will be able to charge IFI. He will also be able to see what the servicing of the debt is costing.  Apparently in a good year NET would pay off large amounts.  They made a £42 million trading profit in 1984 and must have paid off a huge amount of the debt because they finished up with £2.5 million profit. The Minister should be able to say how much annual repayment and how much servicing of debt is required.  Would the total be in the order of £20 million a year or what would be required to be paid off to manage this debt?  The Minister should be able to say how the company will be operating on an annual basis with regard to both its income and the repayments it has to make.  None of the Deputies has raised any doubts about the viability of IFI.  There is no doubt about it because the debt burden has been taken off them and they will be in an excellent trading position.</P>
      <P>Here we are presented with a problem that the holding company is in the greatest danger.  If the holding company reaches a stage of collapse, what happens to the trading company, IFI?  If the borrowing limit of the holding company is fixed at £180 million, is it the case that the Government will not bail them out again and will let them go to the wall?  In that case, what would happen to the joint venture company, IFI?  Is the Minister satisfied that the holding company has the potential to continue servicing the debt and holding its own and that £180 million will be the maximum amount required since it will be getting income from the dividends and from the sale of gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the questions we have in mind.  When the Minister says that £180 million will be the limit, he must know <Col N="389" /> something that will after events in 12 months' time when they have reached the borrowing limit.  We would like some share in that information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to the extent I can on each of these matters already, but I will touch on them briefly now.  I have made the Government's position clear on the key matters and I have no scope to budge on that.</P>
      <P>I find some contradiction in the points made by Deputy Bruton.  He asks about the nature of the mortgage on the gas contract and then says that a mortgage could be tantamount to a guarantee.  Any mortgage I know of on a fixed or contractual asset is tantamount to a guarantee. A person who takes out a mortgage is guaranteeing to hand up an asset in return for the debt.  Perhaps I am innocent but I have not come across a mortgage that did not have a guarantee attached to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being provocative but it is important to clear the air.  On the one hand, there seems to be an objection to State guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, some Members opposite seem to be suggesting that a mortgage might not be out of the question.  The mortgage in question here would certainly be tantamount to a guarantee.  Either we want to give a guarantee or we do not.  We cannot be against a guarantee in the traditional sense and then suddenly be in favour of it by giving a mortgage.  There is a certain contradiction there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the reasons the bank's position was unacceptable.  Certain papers were available to the Government and the decision taken was that because of the extra interest charges and the mortgage that was being talked about, a better <Col N="390" /> option would be a State guarantee for an additional £30 million.  I would stress that the State was already locked in for £150 million.  I do not think the State envisages walking away from that.  The best way out of the situation was to put an upper limit on the amount and to stick at it.</P>
    <P>The previous Government were pushed many times to divulge the price of gas but they decided not to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We were promised a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Ministers in the previous Government quite rightly explained that the gas price is such an important element in the structure of this and other companies that it is not divulged.  My memory is quite clear that this was the policy of the previous Government and it is being continued by this Government.  These negotiations have been going on for over two years and the Government, having taken all the advice available, decided that this was the best way to tackle it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was concerned about what would happen to IFI if NET went to the wall.  If NET got into difficulties and had to take certain steps, IFI would remain as a separate company which would be 51 per cent State-owned, IFI holding the other 49 per cent.  The £180 million would certainly be a liability of the State.  That is why this deal is so good in the medium and long term for both the workers in NET and the people as a whole.  If we were starting from the bottom up to design a whole structure, we might not have done it this way but the reality is that ICI came on the scene, offering us international marketing capabilities and a partnership in a joint venture in an area which they know a lot about.  They were prepared to go ahead only if some of the built-up losses were kept separate.  The previous Government also felt that the joint venture was the best way out of the overall bind in which NET found itself.  What Deputy Bruton and I are discussing is the various angles.</P>

    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Keating were interested in projections and forward plans.  We can make all the forward <Col N="391" /> plans we like.  Many plans have come before this House in recent years but most of the targets have not come within a mile of being achieved.  We are all finding out the hard way and particularly in these circumstances.  The future of NET Holdings where the State debt will be locked in depends on the performance of IFI and that depends on the ability of the management of both ICI and the new NET to make IFI a strong company internationally.  If IFI succeed, as I know it will, with this joint venture it will be able to pay dividends to NET Holdings.  Those dividends will be used to pay off the debt to the State.  That is the plan but what could upset that plan, something over which I have little control, are interest rates and the price of oil.  There is interest payable by NET Holdings on the bulk of the debt and the gas price we are discussing is a crude oil related price.  Interest charges and oil prices could have a major effect on the future of that type of a debt company that NET Holdings now is.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out that company now manages the debt, oversees IFI and receives the gas.</P>
    <P>The future of NET Holdings depends on the commercial success of IFI in selling fertilisers internationally.  Secondly, it depends on interest rates and oil prices. I hope those three factors will work and that IFI will be a major international success.  I hope that in turn that success will help NET Holdings pay off their debt over a period.  It would be a foolish Minister who would try to predict how interest rates, oil charges and the success of IFI will go.  However, it is worth pointing out that ICI own 49 per cent of IFI.  I can say confidently that ICI with their international muscle will make a success of IFI with the new NET involvement in it. I do not know of any failures that ICI have presided over.  They have a good record in running successful companies and have convinced NET, and the Government, that as one of the major companies in the world they can run, in conjunction with NET, a successful fertiliser company.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister of State seen some kind of blueprint or plan for that company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We must remember that the negotiations went on for two years and that this represents a solution to a difficult problem.  Plans or no plans a company with the type of strength ICI have behind them feel, and have convinced the Government's negotiators, that there is a future in the fertiliser business. They have got their markets and we have the production capability.  It seems to me to be a sensible joint venture and it looks like it can work.  However, it would be a foolish person who would try to predict fertiliser prices into the years ahead.  I would not attempt to do it.  I could bluff it but that would not make any sense at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made it clear, in response to Deputy Mac Giolla, that the guarantee to the NET holding company has nothing to do with the future of Irish Fertiliser Industries. Whether we give this State guarantee or not is not going to affect one way or another jobs in Arklow or at Marino Point.  We can talk about the fertiliser industry, joint ventures, synergy and so on and while it will all be very interesting it is not what we have to decide.  Given that the NET holding company, a debt-management gas contract management company with nothing directly to do with the fertiliser industry, needs £30 million, what we must decide is whether it should borrow that amount on the back of a guarantee in the form of a mortgage on the gas contract &mdash; I accept that it is a guarantee &mdash; or on a 100 per cent State guarantee of the entire sum of money.  It seems to me that the bank can only collect as much as it is owed and even if a mortgage on the gas contract is theoretically worth £60 million and they are owed £30 million they can only collect £30 million with the rest going back to NET.  No matter what way we look at it the likelihood is that a mortgage on the gas contract is worth either less than but certainly <Col N="393" /> no more than a 100 per cent State guarantee.</P>
      <P>What I cannot understand &mdash; I am trying to understand it and I am not trying to be difficult &mdash; is why the Government when they were offered the money without a 100 per cent State guarantee but instead a guarantee in the form of a mortgage on the gas contract which could not be more and could only be worth less than a 100 per cent guarantee did not go for that given that the only difference between one offer and the other was £120,000 per year in interest which is peanuts on a loan of £30 million.  I should like to know the net present value of the gas contract <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 100 per cent security?  If the NPV is less than the £30 million State guarantee we are giving, that was what the Minister should have gone for because it was a lesser exposure of the State.  I accept that the gas contract is the State's property.  If, on the other hand, the NPV of the gas contract is more than £30 million, there is really not any difference in giving a State guarantee or going for a mortgage on the gas contract. It would not have been any worse to have given the mortgage on the gas contract because the banks could only collect £30 million anyway.  As long as they were not allowed to lend any more money they were not going to be able to get back any more than the £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting the question I am aware that some Deputies will say that Deputies Keating, Mac Giolla and I in asking questions about this guarantee are somehow or other &ldquo;endangering&rdquo; the jobs in Arklow and Marino Point.  I am grateful to the Minister for having made it abundantly clear that that is not the case, that the fate of the NET holding company does not affect Irish Fertiliser Industries and the jobs in those industries.  The simple question we have to decide is, what is the best way of getting the money from the banks?  Should we get it on the basis of a 100 per cent State guarantee at a slightly lower rate of interest or give what is either the same or probably a lesser security in the form of a mortgage on the gas contract and pay a slightly <Col N="394" /> higher rate of interest?  It is a matter of commercial judgement between these two.</P>
    <P>Given what I know and having listened to the debate, I have to say that my judgement would be that the Government should have gone for the unguaranteed loan on commercial grounds and from the point of view of setting a precedent of not giving the normal 100 per cent guarantee.  However, the Minister may have evidence which can show why the Government took their decision.  I have no doubt that the Government are not in the business of deliberately making stupid decisions.  I am sure there is a good reason for their going for a 100 per cent guarantee rather than for a superficially more attractive mortgage on the gas contract with a slightly higher interest rate. So far in this long debate the Minister has not given the commercial information in terms of net present value or whatever other commercial measure he wants to use to show to the House that it is the better deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating has been relentlessly &mdash; and I less relentlessly &mdash; pursuing the question of the price of the gas.  If I was asked to give such information when I was Minister I would have refused to do so.  However, I could make a case that the Minister should give the information now because the situation is slightly different as we have decoupled the two companies.  I do not see any point in making a meal of it and I will not pursue it much further.  I am determined to pursue the net present value of the mortgage of the gas contract <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 100 per cent guarantee.</P>

      <P>I learned a lot from the discussion in regard to the relationship of the companies, etc.  I do not want <Col N="395" /> to know the price of the gas but it is a very important issue.  Will the Minister say if there is any danger that NET will be selling gas to IFI at less than the price they are paying for it?  In other words, is there a guarantee that they will always at least cover themselves or indeed make a profit from the sale of gas?  It is possible that, with the drop in oil prices, the deal with Marathon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy in regard to the amount of dividends.  The Minister thinks there will be a huge dividend coming to NET from IFI but I do not think that will be the case.  ICI, like any other multinational, will have plenty of other places into which to push profits rather than into IFI.  Profits will show in other areas, whether in Richardsons or other places in Europe.  I do not expect the dividend will be a major factor as they will be depending on the prices they will get for gas.</P>
      <P>In view of the cost of the debt, will NET be able to hold their own?  I hope that in bad years they will be able to do so and in good years they will make repayments.  Is it possible they could go down so much that they could not cover the debt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the projections are that the sale of gas from NET to IFI will be at a profit.  That is as far as I can go at present in that regard.  Obviously there are variables outside the control of a lot of people.  Deputy Mac Giolla should not forget that 75 per cent of the profits of IFI accrue to the State which is a pretty good deal from the point of view of the State considering the ownership ratio.  Deputy Bruton put it rather well <Col N="396" /> when he said that the intention is to leave IFI as loose as possible to let them get on with being commercial and to work with ICI to create a sound, bigger company for ICI and the State.  It is important to remember that this is a very exciting deal.</P>
      <P>I do not want the impression to go out that just because NET Holdings do not affect the situation in IFI directly in some way we do not have to handle the old problem in NET.  This is a sovereign State and we cannot walk away from the old situation in which a block of debt built up.  However, we have isolated that debt and kept it in a separate legal entity.  We provided the means to service the debt by the dividends from the success of IFI and the gas price paid to NET.  NET have two sources from which to fund the debt. Deputy Bruton asked if they will fund the debt and I answered that it depended on the success of IFI commercially, on oil prices and on interest rates.  There is no point in pushing me on that one because that is all I can say.  In regard to this block of debt, we are talking about whether it was better to keep running with £150 million which the State guaranteed and to organise £30 million with the banks or to put the whole £180 million into the State at a lower rate of interest with no mortgage on our gas.  The papers and documentation available to the State indicated that no one envisaged running away from our responsibilities in that context.  It made a lot more sense not to pay the extra interest, not to mortgage the gas contract and to run in that direction instead of the other which was unacceptable to Government negotiators. Negotiations went on over a long period and the choice was clear, £150 million plus £30 million from the banks or £180 guaranteed from the State.  We opted for the latter which was a decision taken by the Government after very careful consideration.  Deputy Bruton said I was not giving him commercial information on which to base a commercial view but I will not give such information because it is not the policy of the Government to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear I did not want to know the details.  I wanted to know the net present value of a mortgage on the gas company.  A mortgage essentially means that one is entitled to get the entire value of one's loan repaid from that source of income.  Obviously, as money will only accrue over a period, one judges it in terms of present value.  I find it hard to believe the mortgage.  In any event the company will not have to repay more than they owe.  The choice is between a 100 per cent guarantee of that by the taxpayer or giving the bank an interest in getting their money back in the form of a mortgage on the gas contract. They cannot pay back more than they owe and if the mortgage on the gas contract is worth anything less than £30 million, it is a bad deal to go for the 100 per cent guarantee, that is unless the calculation is so fine that the £120,000 extra interest makes all the difference between the two alternatives.  We are entitled to the answer to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the question.  It would be as well to clear up the value of the mortgage.  We are not talking about divulging the valuation of the actual gas field, or commercial details.  The basis of this question arises from the offer by the banks to extend money on a no guarantee basis.  They wanted a mortgage on the gas.  We want to know what the balance was and that is not unreasonable.  If we have a mortgage on our properties we know the size of it although it may not relate directly to the value of the property. That is a question that Deputy Bruton is pressing.  Only with this information can we make a judgment.

      <P>There are a number of other serious questions about the basis of that contract which Deputy McCoy will be asking in a moment.  In the face of international competition, whether or not there is a glut on the market place of the output from this extraordinarily convoluted process, is it not tying people's hands and feet to essentially get involved in a contractual arrangement which by definition cannot be competitive relative to others who are entitled to play the market, just for the purposes of shoring up an arrangement we inherited?  I am not saying that we should renege on guarantees but the Minister has introduced a Bill for which he asks our support and the key information we need to make a judgment on it is not available.  The price of the subsidy is relevant and if we do not get that how can we make judgments about these things?  Deputy Bruton's point about the mortgage value and the reason we are going down the route to a 100 per cent State guarantee as opposed to unguaranteed moneys from the bank is essential.  The Minister has not clarified that.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Deputy will appreciate that it is not really given to commercial people to isolate a charge on running a business and interest is a major charge on running a business so a profit before interest is an interesting accountancy concept, but the real profit is after one pays interest which is a legitimate cost of running a business.</P>

      <P>The amount of money which the State is being asked to guarantee really restructures the loan, or guarantees the loan but there is the other point that going into a joint venture with a company like Richardsons appears to be probably a guarantee in the near future of a full manufacturing throughput in ICI's plants by Richardson's taking from them ammonia in particular.  I am sure that Richardsons, looking at the costs of their own products, will be looking at world markets in terms of what price ammonia they can get.  They are not bound in this joint venture to take <Col N="401" /> any raw materials from ICI and whatever one they take will depend on price.  This is not a panacea for IFI or for NET in that we are in a falling market, the demand for the product is falling.  There are other companies around the world that have cheaper gas in so far as there is a utilisation of flare offs from oil wells to make cheap fertilisers.  It is in this market that NET have had to trade over the past number of years, against falling demand. Europe is the greatest user of fertiliser in the world.  The quota cutbacks in the CAP this year alone will reduce the use of fertilisers by at least 20 per cent in gross terms.  Against this background I ask the Minister how safe is the guarantee and what chance has the State got of recouping the money for which it is now guarantor?</P>

      <P>With regard to Richardsons, they will now get ammonia ex-Cork at commercial rates.  It is important that both IFI and Richardsons get a good deal out of it.  It is important that both companies prosper and create employment. I am happy that the arrangements arrived at with Richardsons are commercially sensible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's point about the world market for fertilisers, that is a point that was made on Committee Stage.  It is all the more reason for NET to get into bed, as it were commercially with a company like ICI. NET and ICI together have the strength to take on rising or falling markets. Ireland is now truly in the fertiliser game in a real way.</P>

The winds are cold out there and the commercial landscape is difficult.  Whatever chance ICI and ourselves have of tackling world markets, we had no chance of really making a breakthrough internationally because of the way NET were building up losses. That is the simple reality of it.  I am very excited about the fresh start NET, its management and workers are now getting from this arrangement with ICI.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he has been able to reflect in any way on giving me an indication as to the value of the mortgage on the gas contract and why that route has been rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful with regard to that but unfortunately I cannot be.  This is linked with the gas price and discussing the NET present value of the gas mortgage invariably leads one down a road of discussing the gas price and into a stream where one can start to calculate things. For that reason I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how the assessment was done of the relative value of a full State guarantee as against accepting the mortgage contract? Were the board of NET involved in any way in advising on whether one should go for a 100 per cent State guarantee or accept an unguaranteed loan, with the exception that there was a guarantee in the form of a mortgage on gas contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter matter was not one for the board; that was totally a State matter and the State decided that separately.  The Deputy asked about the process we went through in arriving at the decision.  The Government considered both options and because of what they regarded as the onerous nature of the bank route &mdash; that is, the additional charges for the interest and the request for the mortgage on the gas contract &mdash; they rejected that route and instead went for the direct State guarantee route which we are happy will be cheaper for the taxpayer in the long run.  Considering that it is not our intention to run away from those responsibilities we decided we might as well face them and we reckoned that having to face them in any case we should face them in the cheapest possible way and the cheapest possible way is <Col N="404" /> cheaper interest.  That is the decision the Government took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume that the House decides not to accept the Minister's recommendation and to opt instead for an unguaranteed loan, would the bank finance still be available on the other basis as indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the company need this money and, secondly, if the House in its wisdom decided not to go this route then obviously one would have to go back and talk to the banks.  This would create massive difficulties for NET who now have a situation in place which is reasonably satisfactory to all the parties. Even though I know the difference between NET and IFI and that NET is involved in the State area, I have to stress that we have been negotiating this on and off for two years and this seems the most practical route, even if it is not the most ideal one.</P>
      <P>I want to put strongly on the record that if the House was to take a different decision it would create massive difficulties for NET, the holding company. It would put us in a position where we would have to go to banks and we would be totally at the mercy of the commercial world.  If we say &ldquo;no&rdquo; here we would have no bargaining power if we walked into a bank.  We would be left in a position where we would either have to close the company or do any deal that the bank wanted to do.  That would be a lunatic road to go.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be right; certainly he is paid to be right. Would the Minister be prepared to disclose to the Opposition spokesmen, not publicly, information on the calculations that were done in deciding whether it was <Col N="405" /> better to go for a full guarantee or a mortgage on the gas contract?  I do not believe it is commercially sensitive information and we should stop arguing about that.  Assuming that it is commercially sensitive information and, therefore, assuming the Minister is asking the House to agree with him without knowing this information, is the Minister prepared to make that information available to us on a confidential basis so that we can at least satisfy ourselves after the event that we did not agree to something foolish?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the superficial attractiveness for any Minister to relieve the pressure by agreeing to that but that would not make sense from a Government's point of view.  Obviously one would have to consider which parties one would discuss it with and there is a question of Cabinet confidentiality and Government confidentiality.  As I said, it has a superficial attractiveness and it seems almost unreasonable to reject it but reject it I must because it is a piece of string that once you start on it is hard to know where it stops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pushed about precedent.  Because 30 or 40 years ago some Minister decided, or more likely was instructed, to tell this House as little as possible, perhaps he may not have known the answers at the time &mdash; does not mean we should be bound forever by that decision.  We are dealing with a unique transaction in a commodity for which there is no great competition in this country, in an international market place which is over supplied.  A very convoluted process of supply and management has been set up to try to assist NET to cope in some way with its inherited indebtedness and so on.  If the Government want to aid NET by making money available, then let them do so. That is what governments are for. However, there is no point in introducing a Bill in this House without giving basic information to which we can answer sensibly, yes or no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not raise the question of guarantees initially.  The Minister introduced the issue on Second Stage and left it hanging. The Minister said there were banks who would provide funding on an unguaranteed basis, but that the terms were unacceptable.  While teasing the matter today we discovered that the unacceptable element was that the banks were looking for a mortgage.  I presume the mortgage would have been related to the additional guarantees that were required.  It may have been a sum in <Col N="407" /> excess of that, because of the lack of guarantee, etc. but that would have been the linchpin.  It is not unreasonable for us to expect some kind of feeling on that.</P>
    <P>I do not suffer either from the advantage or the disadvantage of having been a Minister in this Department at any stage and therefore do not feel inhibited about it anyway.  In the public interest it must be said that if public money is to be used it is not unreasonable to ask in broad terms what element of hidden subsidy from the taxpayer goes into artifically depressing the price at which NET receives the gas.  There may be details of commercial confidentiality which should not be disclosed publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no hidden subsidy here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say for IFI.  I am talking about the subsidy which up to now has underpinned the capacity of NET to sell on to IFI.  The chain of supply has an inbuilt subsidy prior to it being sold on from NET.  There has to be and I want to know about it because otherwise I cannot make a judgment.  It may be a commercial activity but they are using our money.  I do not mind a person who is spending his own cash being unprepared to give details though such details are given all the time because the tax laws and every other law demand them but I would not be doing my job if, without setting parameters, I said, &ldquo;here is £30 million, spend it how you like&rdquo;.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with this question because if all the cards are put on the table the competition will know what is being done but there is a <i>via media</i>.  Deputy Bruton has suggested one way.  We must bear in mind that this issue has been discussed with dozens of people over the past two years and that it involves at least four entities in the chain of supply &mdash; banks and so on.  These facts and figures are available.  If I wanted to have details of them I could make a telephone call, but I do not want to find them out in that manner.  The Minister has to <Col N="408" /> come a little bit cleaner, otherwise he cannot expect our co-operation.</P>
      <P>If I were to be asked tomorrow, if the history of this whole operation is anything to go by, or more likely in two years time when there is another debacle to defend my judgment, the only answer I could give for having agreed would be that the Minister is a very nice fellow who appeared to be telling the truth.  By and large we thought the Minister was on the ball.  The reality is that with the bland assurances given I have not a pup's chance of making a judgment.  The Minister would not make a judgment on that basis; neither would I.  No sensible person making a commercial or political decision would make a judgment on that basis.  The Minister is on his own and I cannot stand by him as he has not given me a chance to do so.  We have repeatedly prompted the Minister to give a little more information than he has given.  He has said that he stopped short of giving full information but he gave us no information today.</P>

      <P>When I get an opportunity I will have to study the record of what the Minister has just said.  But as I understood it the Minister said something along the following lines: &ldquo;the Government considered this matter.  We reckoned we were not going to walk away from our obligations anyway and we came to the conclusion that the cheapest way of getting the money was to give a State guarantee.&rdquo;  That seems to infer that the intention of the Government is to pay the banks back their money regardless of whether there is a State guarantee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider only paying the banks in respect of what is guaranteed.  If a State company borrows money from the banks which is not guaranteed then the banks are at risk in lending the money and the State is under no obligation to pay that.</P>

      <P>What then is the point <Col N="411" /> of having all this legislation about guarantees if all the money is going to be repaid anyway?  There was quite a sensation created about two years ago when the then Minister for Finance, now leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, made a speech to The Irish Bankers Federation dinner in which he made it quite clear that from his point of view and from the point of view of the then Government, the Government guaranteed the repayment of guaranteed loans only and that other money that was lent to State companies without guarantee was not guaranteed. The only guarantee was the viability of the company.  The Minister is now saying that it really makes no difference, that all the money will be repaid anyway, regardless of whether there is a guarantee. If that is the case we might as well give guarantees for everything.</P>

      <P>As the Chair knows, one can combine both.  My concern in this debate has been heightened by what the Minister has said about the nature of guarantees.  It seems he believes that even if we give a guarantee of £180 million under this section and NET then proceed to borrow £200 million, the State will be liable for the additional £20 million also.  In my view, and I speak as a former Minister for Finance, that is not the case.  The State is liable only for such debts as it has explicitly guaranteed.  Certainly the company are liable for the full amount of the borrowing.  The State, just as any other owner of a company, is entitled to the protection of limited liability which means that when a company is incorporated that company are responsible for their debts and the shareholders are responsible only for those debts to the value of their holdings in the company, unless somebody gives a personal guarantee or, as in this case, a State guarantee. This State guarantee is exactly the same as a personal guarantee given by the chairman of a company to get money for the company.  It means that he has dispensed with limited liability.  In the case of a State guarantee such as this we have set a limit on the extent of the guarantee that the State is giving to NET and that is £180 million.  I hope the Minister will admit that he has not been correct in what he said earlier in this regard. So far as I am concerned, the taxpayers' liability will stop at £180 million regardless of whether NET borrow £200 million or £400 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not just legally correct, I am correct in policy and this was made clear by Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance and speaking <Col N="414" /> at the Irish bankers' dinner.  This caused quite a ripple because many bankers had been previously working on the assumption put forward by Deputy Brennan that it did not matter whether there was a State guarantee, Uncle Alan or Uncle Ray was going to pay.  I do not believe that is so.  The State, in the person of the Minister for Finance, will only pay to the extent that he has given a guarantee and not a penny more.  He is not legally obliged to pay, and should not pay, any more.  Otherwise what is the point of having guarantees?  Why would banks seek guarantees if the State is obliged to pay anyway?  Bankers should take note that the Government are not obliged to pay, and should not pay, in excess of explicit guarantees.  If the banks are worried about lending money they can come and look for a guarantee and the Minister can then come into the House and look for a further extension.  If we are provided with the information we can then come to a judgment as to whether he should give that guarantee, something we are secretly being prevented from doing on this occasion.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity of clarifying the Government's position on this matter.  It is putting him in a difficult position because he is not the Minister of State at the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, this part of the debate will be of enormous interest to the banking community and to semi-State companies in general, even though in the case it applies to NET.  The Deputy is legally correct.  I do not think the banks or the financial institutions should easily risk their money above the State guarantee. They should know that the legal requirement of the State is up to the limit of the State guarantee and after that if the State wishes, in the case of a company it owns, it can walk away.  That is the legal <Col N="415" /> position.  I do not think any company that is fully owned by the State should set out to create the impression that they will not stand fully behind their debts, whether guaranteed or unguaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard the State, in the first instance, should not encourage unguaranteed borrowings. The banks should beware of giving any borrowings and &mdash; I agree with Deputy Bruton here &mdash; they should be aware that they are exposed above the legal limit. But having said all that, I do think that when any State-owned company borrows money the State has a moral responsibility, a commercial responsibility, to ensure that its State companies do not get into debt beyond a limit that the State feels it can support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard the Deputy will be aware of an example he gave in regard to going from £180 million to £200 million.  The Minister for Finance has to give approval for that kind of borrowing above the legal limit if it is cashflow borrowing or working capital borrowing.  I do not intend to create the impression that banks can have a free ride and the State will stand behind freelance borrowing by semi-State companies, quite the contrary.  Neither do I go as far as Deputy Bruton in suggesting that one should not automatically repay loans of a company that the State itself owns.  The correct solution is to warn the banks to be careful, that they are exposed, that the State retains the option to use the Companies Act if it so decides but does not in advance say that it will not stand behind any particular debt.  That would be the wrong commercial way to approach it.  I hope that clarifies it because I certainly do not intend to write a blank cheque for financial institutions who lend to semi-State companies.  But remembering that, apart from the legal obligations, if the Minister for Finance is allowing certain borrowing &mdash; and presumably the Government are supporting that decision &mdash; the State itself can easily walk away from such accumulated debts. It is a commercial matter and the State <Col N="416" /> should behave commercially but should not, in advance, say it will not pay a certain debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a most unfortunate note into the discussion.  I have listened very carefully to what he has just said and I still do not quite grasp it.  For example, his response was &ldquo;you are legally correct&rdquo;.  Is that to say that somehow &ldquo;yes but&rdquo; there is something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the whole area of guarantees and company borrowings and so on are governed by the Acts relating to companies and it seems to me that it is either one or the other.  If the State has a guarantee in place in respect of a company or institution or agency it has an absolute obligation to pay those debts in accordance with the terms of the guarantee.  If the State does not have such a guarantee in place then the State has no obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not assume that is the corollary.  The State has no obligation to pay debts incurred otherwise.  The company involved has an obligation so to pay but let me say this much.  Those companies involved should also have the same benefits and flexibility within the Companies Acts as other companies would have.  I do not think there should be some kind of a soft underbelly in our approach to guarantees and borrowings by State or semi-State companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are teaching our grandmothers to suck eggs in this case.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting <Col N="418" /> that a company like NET is going to easily attract substantial moneys from the banking institutions on the basis of some kind of nudge-nudge, wink-wink approach?  Clearly there should be contractual documents in place in respect of which the conditions are explicit.  I raise it because what it boils down to is a feeling that the Minister is reflecting a soft approach in this area.  There is a lack of reference to the limited liability for limited companies.  That is in place at present and there is a Companies Bill coming in here shortly but that extends also to some of the companies we will be talking about here.  I take the view that to say something is legally correct with the begrudging emphasis which the Minister of State seems to be putting on it is implying more than it is actually stating.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that treatment of the consideration and principles which obtain in respect of the State getting money is quite interesting and should be regarded as peripheral to section 1 of this legislation, but the Deputy accepts that it is not one that is due for resolution on the section, nor is it likely to be resolved on the section, and because of that he will accept that we do not seem to be spending our time gainfully in pursuing it <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>

      <P>In fairness, it was introduced by this House.  I was asked a question. I do not think it is necessarily my <Col N="419" /> place to have to answer it but, in broad terms, anybody who gives a semi-State body money does so on a clear understanding, usually on a contractual document; the terms of that document are the terms for repayment.  If they incorporate a State guarantee then there is a State guarantee in place and if they do not then there is not.  It would be far more helpful in getting the support of this side of the House in terms of extending more largesse in respect of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You would not say to a private company that they must set out from day one to guarantee a certain bulk of their debt.  Whatever they can wheedle out of the bank by, say, unauthorised overdraft, we would not say to private shareholders of the company that if that company failed, morally they are bound only to pay the legally guaranteed amount and that morally bound in respect of the large overdraft the bank manager did not notice and which was run out.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 9, to delete &ldquo;£180,000,000&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;£160,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to what the Minister has said today.  In the circumstances, there is not much point in proceeding with the amendment.  It is perfectly obvious that the scale of events has gone beyond us.  The figure of indebtedness has already gone up by £1 million or £2 million over the last three or four hours. The Minister feels strongly that £180 million is the figure.  It is clear from what he has said to us today that the indebtedness of the company is £168 million and is rising.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 9, after &ldquo;£180,000,000&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or such lesser amounts as may at any time be owing by Nítrigin Eíreann Teoranta&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 2, there is a principle which is embodied in it which I would like to commend to the House.  The essence of it is that I do not believe the cushion the Exchequer is affording to the new arrangement &mdash; and we all hope that it will work and work satisfactorily &mdash; should be there forever and that the guarantees should remain in place forever at the same level as it has been proposed to fix them in today's Bill. If &mdash; and this is the underlying assumption <Col N="424" />&mdash; the new joint venture company succeeds and assists in making NET that much more self-sufficient and self-financing than they have been, then it is not unreasonable that there should be some degree of escalator built in which would not be unduly restrictive in terms of their capacity to operate but which would, nevertheless, reflect our collective desire to ensure that this £180 million is not seen as an infinite capacity to work up to that limit, but rather one that was the maximum and that it was expected that, as reasonably and as quickly as possible, that sum would be reduced in practice.</P>
    <P>A certain degree of piquancy has been added to this amendment by virtue of our discussion a few moments ago.  There is need for a philosophy of approach to be addressed hereto if it is the broad view of the House that we can turn away from the sum of £180 million and leave it in place forever.  Inevitably a company will operate within that framework and will not gird their loins as well as they would if there was an awareness of an expectation in this House that the figure is a temporary facility to be reduced systematically without endangering the company or the joint venture company but as quickly and as reasonably as possible, so that the taxpayer will be as little exposed as is reasonable to expect.  This amendment, which is not necessarily framed or drafted in an ideal fashion and in respect of which I have no hard and fast views as regards its drafting, seeks to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>It seeks to say that if at some point the £180 million is not necessary and the company have managed to turn themselves around and roll back their losing guarantees to a limit of £160 million, £165 million or £140 million, in effect those guarantees would be self-financing, which is not unreasonable.  I should be very pleased to be given the option of getting guaranteed money on those terms.  I know many companies that would be pleased to be told that essentially without a deadline they can have that sum of money but that at a certain point, on presentation of their set of <Col N="425" /> accounts after two or three years, if they find they are in business, we expect them to reduce that indebtedness.</P>
    <P>On a broader point I take the view that the giving of grants, used to promote industrial strategy should be reviewed in order to see whether they should become repayable loans.  We are sometimes a little flaithiúlach with Exchequer moneys and we have been throwing figures around today such as £180 million as if, to use an expression which my father used to use, it was snuff at a wake.  I do not know how much money that is but it sounds like a lot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At a wake it would appear to be quite an amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be negative about this arrangement but if we go ahead with it what I want is for the joint venture company to respond in kind and to say that that is a fair condition, that we are not being unreasonable and that as soon as they turn the corner in profitability terms they will discard a certain percentage of the guarantee which would have been put in place.  The spirit of that should be distilled in some shape or from and incorporated into this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether it will be possible to do that within a specific time span but I would prefer from the company's point of view to be a little more elastic about it and to give them the option, bearing in mind that we are talking about a timescale which will undoubtedly be predicated by their assessment of how well they are doing.  As I said on Second Stage, if my party were in power at this time it is unlikely that this Bill would have been introduced but if we are going to go down the road of extending this guarantee all I am asking is that that guarantee should be automatically reduced in line with a return to reasonable profitability on the part of NET &mdash; the joint venture company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister of State has some sympathy for that view.  I am not pushed about whether this amendment is well drafted or not.  The Minister of State has <Col N="426" /> better resources at his disposal to deal with that aspect.  I do not think it is unjust or unfair to expect that and if it is not unjust or unfair we should put it in place. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider it and try to embody it in the Bill.  I accept that it would be unprecedented in terms of the NET saga but perhaps it is now time to change the atmosphere.  This debate is almost a repetition of debates which have taken place in the past.  There should be a circumscription on the giving of these guarantees.  The old order has changed, the money is just not out there.  There is a constant battle for scarce resources and that has to be brought home to people. All we are saying is that we will underpin the company once more but in three to five years time when things begin to go smoothly, as we hope they will, we will expect the company to stand down between £20 million or £40 million of that guarantee.  Therefore, I commend this amendment to the House and hope that the Minister of State will be able to take it on board.</P>

      <P>The difficulty I have with Deputy Keating's amendment is that it envisages that the amount due will free fall in a straight line.  The reality is that the figure may zigzag.  It could fall and then go back up again by either £100,000 or £500,000 before falling back down again.  As happened in the recent Stock Exchange falls, the figure may zigzag like a stairs.</P>

      <P>The advice which we have received from the Attorney General's office is that this amendment is not practical and even to reword it in order to get to the spirit of it would also have practical difficulties.  If a limit is built into the legislation as has been suggested in this amendment and if the figure falls by £10 million and suddenly goes up by £250,000 one could not go back up by <Col N="427" /> that £250,000 even though they might need to.  From a legal point of view it could not be implemented in that way because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment states &ldquo;or such lesser amounts as may at any time be owing by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.&rdquo;  This would mean that if the figure came down and suddenly edged back up, the edging back up would be totally forbidden by law.  It may not go back up without the permission of the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, if it does fall and has to edge back up by a couple of hundred thousand pounds in a short period for time the Minister for Finance has to give permission.  That appears to be the best control mechanism contained in it.  I am aware of what the Deputy is seeking to achieve.  The Deputy wants to prevent, if the figures come down, the company from going wild and building up debts again.  We are approaching this matter on the basis that this is the figure which is needed and if the figure comes down the Minister for Finance will not allow it to go back up again.  That is the spirit in which any Minister for Finance should approach it.  The advice which we have received from the Attorney General's office is that the wording of this amendment would make the management of it absolutely impossible.</P>

What I want is a formal statutory control.  I do not want the wording to be strictly interpreted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 19, after &ldquo;£180,000,000.&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may give a guarantee either in respect of the entirety of the principal or of a proportion thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to add to the power which the Minister has to give a guarantee.  At present, he has the power to give a guarantee for the entirety for each pound, of the £180 million.  What I am proposing in this amendment is that it should be possible for the Minister to give a guarantee in respect of either the entirety of the principal, as at present, or a proportion thereof at his discretion, so that the Minister could say: &ldquo;I am giving a guarantee but the guarantee is that for every pound you lend to the company I will ensure that you are repaid 90p in the pound and not 100p in the pound.&rdquo;  This would be a good and reasonable commerical approach in the future in respect of State guarantees where they are being given that the Government should as a matter of practice not necessarily offer 100p in the pound repayment, guaranteed, but a fraction of that amount, either 80p or 90p in the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should get away from the idea that <Col N="430" /> bankers once they lend to a State company are going to get all their money back because unless the bankers have some money at risk they are not going to scrutinise the loan adequately.  The very act of bankers scrutinising a loan before it is given to a company can often do the company the best favour they have ever had in their commercial existence, in that having to satisfy the banker that it is a good risk for the banker the company learn more about their own operations in answering the banker's questions than they might learn from simply looking into their own heart, so to speak.  At the moment as long as a State company are borrowing from a bank on the basis that the bank are going to be repaid their entire money by the taxpayer even if the company make a total hames of their operations, the bank do not apply a deep scrutiny to the propositions put to them by the company for the use they are going to make of the money being offered on loan by the bank to the company.</P>
    <P>My proposal that the Minister should be empowered &mdash; it is not a requirement, it is simply empowering him &mdash; to offer a guarantee in respect of a fraction of the sum, not the entirety, would mean that if the Minister was guaranteeing 90p the bank would be at least ar risk to the extent of 10p in every £ lent and in order to secure that 10p the banks would try to scrutinise the project more closely than they would otherwise.  The bank, the company and the State would benefit in that there would be a much more commercial and tightly focused examination of each proposition put forward.  That is the case for the first amendment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second amendment, I propose that this State guarantee we are giving, this new, much more generous limit of £180 million that the taxpayer will find in respect of the borrowings of NET holding company as against the £150 million which is all we are obliged to find from the taxpayer's pocket at the moment should obtain only up to 1 January 1992.  We should try to reduce progressively the extent of the State exposure to the debts of this company.  If by 1 January 1992 the debts of NET have <Col N="431" /> been reduced to, say, £140 million, £100 million or zero, then there would be no need for anything to be done because the £150 million limit which would exist after 1 January 1992 would at that stage be quite sufficient to accommodate the borrowings of the company as to 100 per cent.  However, if the company still at that stage, on 1 January 1992, owe, say, £180 million or £170 million, then it is only right that this House should have another look at this matter.  If that is the case something will have gone very radically wrong with the arrangements which have been put in place as a result of this deal.  If by 1 January 1992 NET holding company owe in excess of £150 million, then it is fair to say that this deal probably will not have succeeded as the Minister and all of us in this House would wish it to do.</P>
    <P>Some time during 1991 &mdash; not tomorrow but a prudent distance away &mdash; this House should have the opportunity to review the entire operation to see if it is going well if, as probably will not be the case, the borrowings are still in excess of £150 million.  Therefore, I believe this is a most reasonable and prudent amendment. This amendment, bringing the guaranteed borrowings of NET holding company down to £150 million from 1 January 1992 from the rather larger £180 million which they would obtain up to that date in no sense affects the jobs in IFI in Arklow or Marino Point.  As the Minister said during the Committee Stage debate, the financing of this new NET holding company who are concerned with managing the gas contract and the debt is not connected downstream with IFI.  They are a separate company and will continue in their own way. Any difficulties encountered by NET holding company in managing the inherited debt are no longer the problem of IFI.  Therefore, there is no problem at all as far as NET are concerned.  The workers in Arklow and in Marino Point in IFI, formerly known as NET, are not affected by this.</P>
    <P>All we are saying in this proposal <Col N="432" /> regarding the guarantee of £180 million is that the banks, the only people concerned in this, should be guaranteed no more than £150 million after 1 January 1992 unless this matter comes back to this House and the House decides it should continue with the new limit of £180 million rather than the lower limit of £150 million which is amply generous for the exigencies of the situation that should obtain at that time if this deal is going even half right.</P>

      <P>I am impressed with Deputy Bruton's argument.  I want to be constructive and helpful.  I have difficulty with amendment No. 4 because of the 1992 date and the circumstances that might or might not pertain at that time. Regarding amendment No. 3, do I understand the Deputy to want to insert that into the Bill at this stage and further that it will mean the legal position would be that the £180 million would still be the maximum figure but that as and when the exposure reduced the Minister could use his powers to fix the limit at a level lower than £180 million if he found that necessary?</P>
      <P>We are attracted to this.  Let me share my concern with the Deputy.  We are nervous about it because, while I like the sentiments in it and it makes sense, once I get the upper limit of £180 million then I am not all that worried about whether the Minister feels that he can reduce it within that limit.  The Deputy is perhaps even more experienced than I am in this.  I am nervous about doing that without having the Attorney General look at the wording involved in it.  I do not know whether any other option is open to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not think so.  I am not a legal draftsman either but I see it working in that the Minister will now be extending, immediately I presume, guarantees to the banks as to 100p in the £ in respect of moneys up to £180 million.  As those moneys are repaid new loans will be negotiated, still within the overall limit of £180 million.  The Minister might decide to use power under this <Col N="433" /> legislation to say that in respect of any additional loans the guarantee he will give will not be for 100 per cent repayment but for 90p in the pound or a certain proportion of the amount.  I stress that the amendment does not oblige the Minister to enter into that arrangement.  If he wants to give a 100 per cent guarantee, he is empowered to do so by the first part of the section.  Amendment No. 3 simply enables him to take a different approach if he wishes to do so by offering a 90 per cent guarantee in the case of, say a company who are doing very well. According to the wording of the amendment, the Minister may give a guarantee in respect of the entirety or in respect of a proportion thereof.  There is no obligation on the Minister to avail of this amendment and he can leave it as a dead letter.  On the other hand, he may use it if he wishes.  No bank could say that he has not got the authority of the Oireachtas to give a partial rather than an entire guarantee.  It would give the Minister flexibility which he perhaps does not have to give a reduced rate of guarantee.</P>

      <P>Let us assume that the £180 million is in place.  In response to a request for a guarantee up to £5 million in respect of a particular project, could the Minister say that he would guarantee nine-tenths of it?</P>

      <P>I have difficulty with anything below £180 million.  It is a technical matter which I would want to discuss with the Attorney General.  I cannot accept anything that dilutes the maximum figure.  It is no good to us if the Minister could say on day one that £180 million is the figure but that he will guarantee only 90 per cent of it.  I need the full guarantee for the full £180 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, the Minister under amendment No. 3 still has full power to give a guarantee up to £180 million.  That power is in no way diluted. All the amendment provides is the power to offer a 90 per cent guarantee if he wishes to do so.  He still has the power not to avail of that option and to continue to give the full 100 per cent guarantee up to £180 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated a willingness to look at the ideas in this amendment. Perhaps he would agree to look at this matter between now and the debate in the Seanad.  If he can bring himself to make an amendment in the Seanad limiting this, I imagine Deputy Keating and I could agree to pass that amendment within five or ten minutes on its coming to the Dáil.  In the light of the goodwill expressed by the Minister &mdash; perhaps I am grasping at straws &mdash; I am not proposing to press amendment No. 3 in case <Col N="435" /> it might spoil this incipient willingness to look at a well-intentioned amendment.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the response to amendment No. 4.  The House has a right to have another look at this very large guarantee some time in 1991.  If they still need over £150 million of State guarantee in 1991 there is something astray in this company.  The rate at which profits should be made on the gas contract should be such that their borrowings should be below £150 million by 1991.  If that is not so, there is definitely a case for the Dáil to have another look at the matter.  The Minister may say there would be great problems in this.  If there are problems, he has already expressed the solution.  He said that in his view the Government are obliged to pay all this money back anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I apologise.  The Minister did not say that.  He said the Government should aim to do so.  It would be possible to say that the Government would not allow anybody to be at a loss pending review by the Dáil.  It is essential that we have a review clause in the Bill. The amendment would not take away the Minister's £180 million guarantee, extravagant and all as I may think it is. It simply says that it shall only apply until 1 January 1992 at which date it will come <Col N="436" /> down to £150 million unless the Dáil has otherwise decided in the meantime.  That is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will be able to accept it.</P>

      <P>On this Stage I simply want to avail of the opportunity to raise one relatively minor matter which did not arise during the Committee or the Report Stages.  This relates to the position of the worker directors of whom there are four <Col N="439" /> on the board of the holding company.  It is my understanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point concerns the position of worker directors on the board of the company which is now a holding company.  I understand that when the worker directors were represented on the board of the operating company, then NET, now Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited, they had considerable facilities for attending the board meetings and consulting with employees whom they represented in regard to their work and in regard to developments on the board. Since Irish Fertiliser Industries has been created as a substitute for NET, some of the worker directors have been even refused incoming and outgoing telephone calls in regard to company business as distinct from the business in which they were directly concerned in their place of work and they were only allowed days off from the company for actual meetings of the board and for discussions ancillary to those board meetings, that is with any interests with whom they needed to consult to obtain information, time was not allowed.  I realise that this is primarily a matter for Irish Fertiliser Industries but on the other hand if the system agreed by the Government is to work, that is, the system of affording worker directors on the NET holding company a right to be on that company in order to represent the interests of their fellow employees, people must have a reasonable opportunity for time off &mdash; perhaps two or three days a month but not just one day a month.  There should be a reasonable, but not to be abused, facility for receiving incoming calls and for making outgoing telephone calls in respect of broad company business as distinct from business related to the work the individual engages in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already made the case to the Minister that there should be bi-monthly <Col N="440" /> reports to the holding company on the operations of Irish Fertiliser Industries, on its financing, and on the extent to which its financial targets are being achieved.</P>

      <P>My general desire is to be as helpful as I can in circumstances such as this but I and my colleagues have difficulty in that we have not been able to obtain from the Minister the kind of details, evidence and answers to questions relating to profitability and viability and to the internal structuring of certain key costs which would enable us to come to a conclusion that we should support this measure.  It is not our desire to inhibit the hopes for success of the joint venture. We hope it works but some of the things that were asked today were eminently reasonable.  The things asked referred to some form of review mechanism, some degree of downscaling of the guarantees, depending on how well the company did and so on.  Broadly speaking, the basic information necessary to make a judgment in favour of the Bill was not provided.  If I was to support this Bill I would have to do so on the goodwill and on the general suggestion of the Minister, without getting the necessary evidence. <Col N="441" /> Without disrespect to anybody, the record in that regard, particularly in this case, is not good.  Accordingly, we have no option but to oppose that Bill.  I regret that in some ways but if one reads the record of this debate, the reasons are clear.  The basic questions which a public representative has an obligation to ask have not been answered.  The basic data on which the key commercial decisions were made within the confines of the Minister's Department, which involved various advisers, but did not involve this House and did not extend to the spokespersons in this House in any way was not supplied.  In those circumstances, I regret that I cannot support this measure.  I hope the Minister is right and that my fears and intuitions are wrong.  We have done our best during the day to amend this Bill and improve it.  We hope the results the Minister speaks of will come about but unfortunately we are not in a position to support the measure.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton's point the board of NET at their meeting which, I understand, is next Friday, will be reviewing the arrangements for reasonable facilities for worker directors.  They will also look closely at their arrangements for monitoring IFI because that is clearly one of their roles.  I will certainly encourage the board of NET to take account of Deputy Bruton's points, many of which are eminently sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Keating putting his view again at this stage of the Bill.  I am disappointed that the Deputy is unable to support this Bill because while it may not be perfect the alternative would have been dire for the workers of NET and for the company itself.  It is not a choice between ideal situations.  It is a choice between going along with this commercially put together deal which gives NET a whole new start and which gives an opportunity to them to work with one of the world's biggest companys, an opportunity to take on the world markets in a much more aggressive way, <Col N="442" /> knowing that they have a very sound partner and a sound company, IFI, behind them.  That means that the sky is the limit in the sense of commercial advancement and achievement.  I am disappointed that the detailed aspects of that main thrust are somehow getting in the way of getting full support for this Bill.  However, that is the right of Deputies.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government and on behalf of the House I wish IFI, the NET holding company and the workers and staff every success in the direction in which they are now going.  We were fortunate to have put this joint venture deal together with such a reputable company as ICI.  It offers a fresh start to NET and it has allowed us to put into a box in the shape of the old NET as it were, the old problems &mdash; the borrowings.  In that box we can make some attempt to deal with them, which is what we are now doing.</P>
    <P>This is a new departure for NET.  It gives us the opportunity to expand our role in the fertiliser business throughout the world.  It gives us an opportunity to make a new start with the NET operation. I know that other Deputies join with me in wishing the company every success.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;(7A) The act of reproducing an object of any description which is in three dimensions shall not be taken to constitute an infringement of the copyright in an artistic work in two dimensions (other than such a work relating to a work of architecture) if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In the fifth line, after &ldquo;artistic&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;,cultural or educational&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a slightly unusual situation because we are dealing with amendments to a Bill which has come back from the Seanad.  This Bill commenced its life in 1984, has been the subject of discussion in the Seanad and has now come back to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no fundamental problem with <Col N="444" /> the Minister's amendment.  We understand the reasons for it and we know there is a serious issue involved in relation to industrial copyright.  We know it is the perception of those engaged in industrial promotion in this country that the amendment that is before the House in the Minister's name is in broad terms desirable, if not essential.  However, there are one or two elements of it that we, hopefully, seek to improve.</P>
    <P>To be frank I am not convinced about my first amendment because it depends essentially on the definition of &ldquo;artistic&rdquo;. That is broadly defined in the Act but nevertheless I feel it might be strengthened by the addition of a couple of words and that is what this amendment is designed to achieve.  I do not intend to go to the wall on this amendment.  There are one or two aspects on which I would like clarification.  Section 9 of the Copyright Act 1963 defines the word &ldquo;artistic&rdquo;. Three categories of descriptions are given: (a) paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings and photographs, irrespective of their artistic quality; (b) works of architecture being either buildings or models for buildings; and (c) works of artistic craftsmanship not falling within the descriptions contained in either of those two.</P>
    <P>These days many drawings, designs, and so on which would be the subject of a Bill like this are either computer-based, based on some form of computer graphics or are technologically-based.  I wonder whether the Minister's amendment lacks a little in terms of embracing that concept. I am not going into any quasi-legal wrangle over these words.  I am not sure that the three categories referred to &mdash; paintings, sculptures, etc., works of architecture, etc. and works of artistic craftsmanship not contained in those two &mdash; would embody or embrace something that is computer-based or computer-developed. That would be a very logical area to act as a repository for the items under consideration here.</P>
    <P>Basically the purpose of my amendment is to strengthen the word &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment.  I am not sure my proposal strengthens it in the <Col N="445" /> way it should be strengthened.  However, I submit that it does not do it any injury. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to clarify whether he is certain that computer-based designs, drawings or graphics of one kind or another are adequately embodied in the definition to cope with any challenge that might be made to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My second amendment seeks to replace the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;. The Minister's amendment defines copyright in an artistic work and uses the following words: &ldquo;any of the features following, that is to say, shape, configuration and pattern, that appear in the work and are applied to the object are wholly or substantially functional...&rdquo;. I wonder whether the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should be there instead of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  As it is presented the onus is on those who would pursue an action under the Bill to prove that the act involved would need to have any of those three features &mdash; shape, configuration and pattern &mdash; and would also need to be applied to the object.  The sense of this is &ldquo;or&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  In other words, it should have any of those three things and they should be applied to the object.  The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; seems to place a lot of emphasis on the need to demonstrate both categories as being in place.  More flexibility might be given to the Bill if the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was used instead of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My third amendment relates to section (7A) (b) of the Minister's amendment which states: &ldquo;the object is one of a number, in excess of fifty, of identical objects which have been manufactured and made commercially...&rdquo;.  I have studied this Bill carefully.  It started off with one purpose in mind and it seems to have developed a life of its own somewhere along the way.  The word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; probably means objects that are identical.  However, there could very well be categories of objects, say, on video tape or otherwise, that would be similar, that would have features and content which would be 99 per cent the same but which would not be identical.  I wonder if what the Minister is trying to achieve <Col N="446" /> could be better obtained by replacing the word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo;. That is what I am trying to achieve.  I want to strengthen the section rather than anything else.</P>
    <P>I know we are confined in this debate to debating the amendments which have come back from the Seanad.  I did not have the pleasure of being involved in the Second Stage debate in 1984 which was interesting and allowed speakers to paint a broader picture.  I know we are confined in this respect but the amendment is desirable and we support it.  We simply raise those points to see to what extent we can add to its strength.  In amendment No. 1 I raised a slight query over the word &ldquo;artistic&rdquo;, in amendment No. 2 I suggested the substitution of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo; and in amendment No. 3 I suggested an alternative to loosen up a little the narrow definition of the word &ldquo;identical&rdquo;.  The above points were raised in an effort to try to aid the Minister in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the amendment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Seanad No. 1 amendment.  Deputy Keating's three amendments also relate to section 1.  The amendment which the Minister has put down changes the copyright position which has been established by case law on drawings of purely functional objects.  Under this amendment it will no longer be an infringement of copyright of the original drawing of a functional article if somebody other than the copyright owner reproduces the article, provided that the copyright owner is also making such articles in commercial quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the basic Copyright Act, 1963, the owner of the copyright of an original drawing of a functional object is entitled to prohibit others from reproducing the same object without permission.  The terms of copyright protection attached to such original drawings last for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years thereafter.  It is considered that this degree of protection is far too extensive and in so far <Col N="447" /> as our research shows is not available in other countries.  The effect of this copyright protection, because of the monopolies to which it can give rise, is considered to be undesirable in itself.  It tends to foster anti-competitive situations particularly in the supply of such objects such as spare parts and components. Accordingly, during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the opportunity was taken to introduce an amendment which would curtail the degree of copyright protection available in the circumstances to which I referred.  The Seanad passed the amendment which is set out in No. 1 in the list of Seanad amendments.

      <P>We have no disagreement with that point.  Deputy Lynch fought a vigorous battle on a number of points, when he was in the Seanad, some of which I will refer to later.  The Seanad amendment said &ldquo;&lsquo;(7A) The making of an object of any description which is in three dimensions...&rdquo; which is the amendment which the Senators in their wisdom passed.  The Minister's amendment which is before us says &ldquo;The act of reproducing an object&rdquo; I ask why this change has been made.

      <P>I will attempt to clarify the wording for Deputy Keating.  We sought advice on the wording of the amendment which as the Deputy knows is done frequently enough.  We were advised by the Attorney General that making could apply to direct copying, whereas reproducing related to indirect copying.  We wanted to ensure that the positions would be clarified and that there would not be any ambiguity in the type of wording used.  That was the best legal <Col N="449" /> advice which the Government could get and I believe it is correct.</P>

      <P>The perks are not so good.  As I recollect, this amendment was introduced to facilitate a particular project which Hyster were promoting for Limerick.  They wanted this change in the law.  It was not that the Government of the day felt that a change was inherently desirable but it was felt that in respect of a change of this kind if it did not have any major downside risks and if it did help to get this project, so long as the project itself was reasonable, they would go ahead with it.  As we all know, at the end, the project was not attractive to the Cabinet from a financial point of view and did not go ahead.  I know a good deal of water has flowed under the bridge since the Hyster project stopped in its tracks so to speak.  Are the Government satisfied that, independently of that particular industrial project, this diminution of copyright protection is inherently justifiable on its own merits?  The British have recently published a huge paper proposing a revision of copyright law and I would imagine that the Irish Government have not yet had an opportunity to digest its implications.  For us to proceed on one small area of copyright law while such a major review is being carried out in another jurisdiction which is also a member of the European Community is something that needs to be justified.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last evening I spoke on this Bill I suggested that my party would be supporting the Bill but would be reserving their position in relation to amendments, particularly on definitions, representatives and a number of other matters mostly in relation to section 3.  I had said that what was represented in the Minister's hostility to the Bill was a concentration on returning matters of curriculum innovation to the Department of Education officials and specifically to its inspectors.  I gave a history of their performance, their ethos and their thinking in education from the sixties to the present.  I would not be hopeful of any curriculum reform in the near future given the destruction that is taking place in education which is being presided over by the present Minister. When we spoke the last day, one trade union had pulled out of curriculum consultation and since then another major trade union has pulled out of consultation with the Minister.  She will shortly be left talking to herself and to her inspectors. Would that that was the end of the damage.  However, it is not the end of the damage and it is almost meaningless for me to put questions to the Minister now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago I would have asked what would happen to the proposals for implementation in the report on the arts or what would happen to the report on languages?  I might have asked what would happen with the new syllabus, what is the position on civics and political studies, what about the whole question of the new additional low cost items that have been suggested by the independent and progressive curriculum board.  In the absence of the Minister I will answer the questions myself.  Those matters are back <Col N="451" /> with the inspectors again and those proposals are dead.  The teachers have withdrawn from curriculum consultation and of course there is a reason for that which is the destruction of the entire character of the educational system.  Figures are available in relation to the primary level. The Minister stated that an average class would consist of 30.5 pupils.  If that is the case 21,350 pupils will have to be redistributed in classes in the greater Dublin area.  These are the figures from the preliminary result of the INTO survey.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that in the whole Dublin area there could be 700 fewer teachers teaching in primary schools. There is no point in saying that lower enrolment figures are responsible for the loss of these teachers.  The teachers are being driven from the classroom.  It is dishonest to say that the disadvantaged will not suffer.  Of all the schools in the north Dublin inner city area only three schools will be exempted from losing teachers.  It might be part of the Minister's new prim philosophy of education to say that you can take teachers out of the classroom, increase the number of pupils that teachers have to look after and that the disadvantaged will not suffer.  The soft target in the over-nine teacher schools, the administrative principals, will now have to cut back on any liaison with parents and with other groups who might want to consult them.  That destruction continues.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Kitt who has so much experience of vocational committees is in the House.  He will be interested to know that there will be 30 job losses in the VEC sector in Galway, 27 in Donegal, ten in Leitrim, 12 in Sligo, six in Sligo town, 21 in North Tipperary, the list goes on mounting up to 896 jobs altogether, 191 of them in the community and comprehensive sector and 705 in the vocational education sector.</P>

      <P>In the provincial <Col N="452" /> paper in Galway there was a report of principals lighting the furnaces to provide heat in the schools.  In regard to the third level sector, the reports show that the son or daughter of a professional person has a 24 times greater chance of attending a third level school than an unskilled labourer's son or daughter.  In the Minister's speech she demolished proposals for five RTCs, an extension to the College of Art and Design and the NIHE in Tallaght.  I am not moved by those who say that we can stop all this erosion at the primary sector by blaming the teachers.  The cost of the teachers' pay rise is £7 million and with the clawback on tax at the standard rate it is £4 million.  The cuts in education amount to £44 million.  This is little less than presiding over the destruction of education and the end of egalitarianism. I support Deputy Hussey's Bill and I have no confidence in the appalling objections to the Bill that have been put forward by the Minister for destruction in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  When Deputy Michael D. Higgins speaks of the rigid nature of the Department of Education in the sixties I can only agree with him.  He has been very selective in the points he has picked out for criticism and I could be equally selective in welcoming the many changes that have taken place in the Department of Education in the curriculum.  The revision of the primary education curriculum in 1970 was a great advance.  As a person who was in a teacher training college at that time I saw both sides of the Department in my two years in that college.  When I and a number of other students complained about the rigid nature of the programme in my first year I was told there was very little that could be done about it. However, there was a complete rethink when I was in my second year in the training college.  A more flexible approach was taken when the new school curriculum was introduced at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Members who have congratulated the Minister for Education at the time, Pádraig Faulkner.  That was <Col N="453" /> one of the great steps forward.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins did not refer to that when he was going through the history of education from the sixties up to the present time.  He knows that prior to that the whole concept of free school transport was introduced by the late Donough O'Malley and that helped the people whom he spoke about, the people whom the Department said would be entitled to a limited education only.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Higgins in paying tribute to previous Ministers who have tried to do something about removing sexism from the text books and from the curriculum.  I agree with everything he said in that report but he has not addressed himself to some of the leaps forward in education down through the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's final remark that we should have a statutory council just because it is going to be hard to abolish it is a bit tongue in cheek and does not deserve much comment from me.  Previous Ministers have abolished councils and boards and let us not be holier than thou when talking about that matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduced by Deputy Hussey is identical with the Bill presented by the previous Minister, Deputy Paddy Cooney, in November 1986.  That Bill was published in May 1986.  There seems to have been no rush by the last Government to introduce the Bill.  The present Minister has stated very clearly that by having a non-statutory body there will be more accountability and a more flexible approach to the curriculum.  I can only agree 100 per cent with that.  We all know that one does not have to enshrine these advisory functions in legislation; one can have an advisory body advising the Minister and accountable to the Minister on a non-statutory basis.  The Minister should be complimented on introducing her plans for this type of advice.  There are certain areas we would agree on.  The primary functions, I suppose, would be the same in both proposals but one of the proposals would cost a lot of money and we are living in difficult times.  Councils and bodies may produce very fine documents, but if there is no money to <Col N="454" /> implement their recommendations, there is no point in having them.  I would like to see a council that is flexible, with comprehensive terms of reference, with realistic proposals that could be implemented and that would report directly to the Minister because, at the end of the day, it is the Minister who takes the final responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And it costs nothing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the costs in a moment if the Deputy will give me an opportunity.  The council the Minister has spoken of has talked about the priority of advising the Minister on areas of curriculum reform.  This is certainly important.  One of the areas that has concerned a lot of Deputies in regard to curriculum reform is the question of the Irish language.  The Minister recently announced a review of the primary school curriculum.  That is one of the area where there has been concern that the teaching of Irish through the look-and-see method has not been very successful in some cases.  The course committees assisting the board will be very important in that regard.  I was very glad to hear the Taoiseach announce in Galway at the weekend a project which will receive assistance from the national lottery and which will be of major significance in the teaching of Irish, that is, a major language centre on the campus of UCG which will provide a focal point where students and the public can meet in a Gaeltacht environment.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach made that announcement and that funds will be provided from the national lottery for this because we must look at the whole question of how Irish is taught in our schools.  The Minister is right in having this review of the primary school curriculum at this time.  The review committee will report over an 18 month period and this and the Taoiseach's recent announcement will be very significant in regard to the teaching and learning of Irish.</P>

      <P>The numbers have increased by 700 per cent over a 15 year period and that means that no matter what is introduced in the way of councils, statutory and non-statutory bodies, there is a problem.  As Deputy Hussey said it <Col N="456" /> is a question of computerisation, which is important but it is not fair to drag into this debate the question of whether we have a statutory or non-statutory council.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has also talked about course committees which are the way forward as regards advice on education.  The interim board certainly produced a number of very interesting documents and their work is to be commended. But the committee structure was very elaborate and what we had was the perception that spending more money was the solution to the whole problem. If we were to talk of spending £2 million on examinations alone we would be asked where that money is to come from.  As I understand it, the additional costs will be £5 million in addition to the £230,000 which was allocated in the present year and it would be difficult for the Minister to find £2 million.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the interim board were general in nature.  It is important now to get more specific information and simplify the advice and recommendations coming forward.  In times of financial stringency it is important to look for ways of implementing the recommendations in a simple and straightforward way.  Many Deputies have said that the way forward is to maintain the salaries of teachers and of all public servants. That was the subject of a motion distributed in the name of the Progressive Democrats but I do not see that as the solution to the problem.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out, if we were to maintain the salaries of primary teachers alone it would cost £7 million gross, and after taking into account deductions for tax, PRSI and so forth the net savings would be £4 million.  That is certainly a very small amount.  It also raises the question of whether one is going to ask the people in the health services to agree to a wage freeze or people working in some other Departments to do likewise.</P>

      <P>Mr. Gerry Quigley, the General Secretary, negotiated it on behalf of the teachers.  It is only fair to say that if the particular document leads to industrial peace it should be welcomed by all sides of the House.  To come along with a penny pinching statement that the teachers and those in the public service should have their salaries pegged is the wrong attitude.  I would prefer to see somebody addressing the question of why it takes something like 26 years for primary teachers to reach their maximum salary.  That is something about which I am sure the primary teachers in this House know a great deal.  No-one has ever adverted to that fact.  It is not true of all people in the public service, but it is certainly true of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The matters which are important to us here are the question of accountability to the Minister and the need for flexibility in this non-statutory body.  We have, through the Minister, got the terms of reference that are comprehensive and will be workable and practicable.  That is certainly very important.  I hope that the Minister's advice will be acted upon and that the terms of reference will be adhered to by that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to establish on a statutory and, indeed, a permanent basis the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment. <Col N="458" /> This Bill was first introduced in 1986 by Deputy Cooney, the then Minister for Education.  I remember very well the general welcome from all sides of the House, particularly from the Opposition side at the time and from the Minister herself who was then spokesperson on Education in Opposition.  She looked forward to the time when this board would be established on a permanent and statutory basis.  They were so enthusiastic about carrying this out that it was incorporated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of the February election.  Here we are now having our spokesman introducing the Bill again as a Private Members' Bill and having the Minister, who was at that time so enthusiastic about its statutory establishment, speaking very vigorously against that idea.  It is just another U-turn, or a head-over-heels somersault.  It is not the first and I am sure will not be the last of such from this Government.</P>
      <P>In advocating the setting up of the board on a statutory basis, it is useful to have a look at the excellent work done by its predecessor, the interim board that was established by Deputy Hussey in 1984 when she was Minister for Education. I should like to pay tribute to her for setting up the interim board at that time.  They have proved themselves during their three years of existence. They have brought out many reports, have done excellent work and started a very important process in education. That tribute goes to the Minister who set it up at that time as a response to the need, perceived in educational circles, that major changes were necessary, both in curricular and assessment procedures in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although many changes had occurred in the educational system since the sixties in terms of new subjects, materials, modes of pupil assessment, school organisation and structures, they were not sufficient to meet the demands made on the educational system by developments such as an increasing number of young people within the system, the new technologies, Ireland's active membership of the European Community, increased urbanisation, basic changes in industry, <Col N="459" /> agriculture, business and the professions, changes in patterns of employment and the use of leisure time.</P>
    <P>From the time of their establishment the Curriculum and Examinations Board set about examining how the education system should respond to the changing demands on Irish society.  I should also like to pay tribute to the chairman and members of the board for the vigour with which they tackled the job in hand and also the members of the various subcommittees who participated and were involved in preparing and publishing so many reports.</P>
    <P>The following are just some of the general achievements for the board over the past three years.  They have gone a long way towards initiating and sustaining informal discussion on educational issues; they have promoted co-operation between educational institutions, educators and others concerned with the welfare of young people; they have supported the professionalism of teachers by recognising their role in the formulation of new curricular and assessment procedures for primary and second level schools; they have recognised the need to make fuller provision in the educational system for the diversity of needs in students; they have also analysed the examination system and have outlined a new framework for assessment and certification which incorporates the best elements of the existing system while extending the range and methodology of assessment so that more skills can be measured.</P>
    <P>A number of major educational principles were recognised by Deputy Hussey when the terms of reference of the board were being drawn up.  Among these were that the essence of curriculum development is teacher development.  A new, unified assesment for the junior cycle of second level education was needed to replace the present intermediate and group certificate examinations.  The aim of this was to ensure that all pupils would have available to them some certification of their achievements on reaching the end of the period of compulsory school <Col N="460" /> attendance.  It was stated that such a system should take account of the range of pupil abilities, should aim to involve all teachers as part of their professional work and should be flexible enough to allow schools, if they so wished, to devise alternative programmes that would be recognised by the national assessment system.</P>
    <P>The Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board have over the last few years successfully initiated and promoted discussion and research on many educational principles by encouraging fundamental scrutiny and evaluation of the curriculum.  Now that the preliminary stage of the board's work is over, it is absolutely inconceivable that the second stage of their work, namely detailed planning on the part of the various course committees of what is to be taught in our schools over the next decade and what assessment procedures are to be introduced, will now be limited because it is the intention of the present Minister for Education only to reconstitute the curriculum board as a non-statutory advisory council for curriculum and assessment. Over the past three years the Curriculum and Examinations Board have published a number of discussion papers and it is to these that I wish for a few minutes to direct my remarks and to the extensive work which has already been carried out by the board.</P>
    <P>In their first document issued, <i>Instructors in Education,</i> the Curriculum and Examinations Board put forward a general statement of the aims of education as the basis for policy and action in the short term.  They also provided a forum at which the Department of Education, teachers and professional educators could meet with representatives of these social agencies with an interest in education, so that together priorities could be identified and contributions made to the formulation of policy in education. The board also suggested a possible framework for the junior cycle in post primary schools.  Recognising the need for a broad junior curriculum they presented the curriculum under eight categories and divided the categories <Col N="461" /> between subjects or courses which would constitute a core curriculum and those which might be offered as additional contributions.</P>
    <P>In the board's document, <i>In Our Schools,</i> the notion of a common core curriculum was approached from two essential and complimentary perspectives. The board recommended that the junior cycle curriculum of all schools should involve pupils in each of the following areas of experience: arts and education, guidance and counselling, language and literature, Irish, English and other languages, mathematical studies, physical education, religious education and science and technology while at the same time including the following four key elements of learning: knowledge, concepts, skills and attitudes.</P>
    <P>The document recognises that many of the traditional subjects can and do contribute to more than one area of experience and that schools which may not have the resources to offer a large number of subjects or courses may nevertheless provide a wide range of experiences for their pupils by fully exploiting the potential of the subjects they are in a position to offer.  This provides a challenge for those involved in syllabus construction. It also provides an administrative basis for co-ordination between different subjects of the curriculum at junior cycle and for continuity between the primary and post primary curriculum.</P>
    <P>At senior post primary cycle the Curriculum and Examinations Board, recognising the need for a fundamental assessment of educational policy and provision because of changing social needs and employment trends, highlighted the need for a re-examination of the traditional definitions of and distinctions between general, technical and vocational education.  The board have put forward the recommendation that senior cycle policies should be developed so as to promote consistency of approach across the range of courses both within schools and between the formal school system and the various training agencies. The board believe that the senior cycle <Col N="462" /> should build on the achievements of the junior cycle and that the leaving certificate programme should continue to cater for the majority of senior cycle students in schools.</P>
    <P>The programme however should be adopted to cater for the increasingly diverse needs of students and should include such areas as new technologies and elements such as social education, work experience and community experience. The transition year from vocational preparation and training courses and other such programmes already relate directly to the perceived needs of students. There is a need therefore to develop a relationship between these programmes and the leaving certificate.  New modes of assessment should be examined in order to support and recognise such a relationship, to encourage the further exploitation of the potential of the existing subjects and to give credit for a wider range of student performance and achievements.</P>
    <P>The board have not been idle in the very important field, indeed the most important field, of primary education.  In November 1984 a primary review committee were established and their aims were to review the existing research on the primary school curriculum, to identify areas for further research and to propose initiatives, to identify problems and propose appropriate strategies for solving them.  The review committee included teachers from primary and post primary schools in order to have continuity between the two sectors.  The committee put forward many recommendations, the major one being a recognition that there is a need for an overall review of the primary curriculum.  This should include a review of curriculum practice and a study of the background and principles underlying the entire primary school curriculum. The committee also recognised the need to eliminate sex stereotyping in schools and to make available adequate resources, including remedial facilities and educational psychological services so that children with learning difficulties could be adequately supported within the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Another important area that was examined and investigated by the interim board was the area of examinations and assessments.  Educators have believed for many years that the disadvantages of the public examinations system greatly outweigh the advantages.  Among the disadvantges generally quoted is that it is not suitable for all students because of its heavy reliance on memorisation.  Many also believe that it exerts undue influence on schools, narrowing the scope for curricula and teaching methods.  It does not recognise the role teachers should have in an examinations system and that it is usually carried out under artificial conditions in a very limited time frame. Therefore, it is not suitable for all students and can be extremely stressful for some.  Any of us who have been associated with pupils undergoing or preparing for examinations or waiting for results are very much aware of the stress, trials and tribulations involved.</P>
    <P>The board invited recommendations from all interested parties on what they thought were the necessary components of a relevant examinations system for students.  In arriving at their recommendations the board have attempted to lay the foundation of a system of assessment which would overcome the defects of the present system without abandoning its beneficial aspects.  It is the board's view that the assessment procedures should be derived from and be complementary to the curriculum.  Assessment is thus inextricably bound up with the curriculum.  Amongst the detailed recommendations which were made to the Minister on assessment and certification were: that, where feasible and desirable, assessment should be carried out over a period of time rather than be confined to a terminal examination &mdash; in other words, something like a continuous assessment, a system similar to those operating in other countries; that where appropriate, part of the assessment for public examinations should be school based; that provision should be made for in-service courses for teachers in assessment techniques; that courses for the award of certificates <Col N="464" /> of general education should be offered up to three levels to be designated as follows: foundation, general and advanced and at each level four attainment grades should be awarded, the lowest being granted for a mere completion of the course.</P>
    <P>The present Bill before the House which was introduced by our spokesperson on education, Deputy Hussey, proposes the establishment of the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment on a statutory basis.  It is extremely important to have the newly constituted board on a statutory basis as it would give it a permanency and an independence to continue the excellent work which was initiated by its predecessor, as I have outlined.  The Minister has already established her own board on a non-statutory basis contary to everything she has said while in Opposition and indeed what was in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
    <P>A special relationship has been established between the Department of Education and the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board.  This Bill would formulise the relationship through the requirement that the proposed board would be staffed by personnel from the Department of Education.  The composition of the board as laid down in this Bill recognises the important part that teachers, school management and parents have to play in the education system.  The knowledge and experience of other agencies will also be utilised through representation from social, economic, cultural and, I am glad to say, Irish language interests.  Indeed I am delighted that this is incorporated in both Bills, mar sílim go bhfuil deacrachtaí speisialta i láthair na huaire chomh fada agus a théann múineadh na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios againn go léir na deacrachtaí móra atá sa Ghaeltacht le téacsleabhair agus mar sin de.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil role le himirt ag an mbord chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le téacsleabhair, agus tá súil agam nuair a bheidh siad i gceann oibre go ndearcóidh siad isteach sa cheist seo, go ndéanfaidh <Col N="465" /> siad é a scrúdú agus go mbeidh siad ábalta glacadh le moltaí ó mhúinteoirí agus ó dhaoine eile a bhfuil plé acu le oideachas trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the Curriculum and Examinations Board proposed that their policy on curriculum and assessment should be introduced in a phased programme over a five-year period.  The introduction of the certificate of general education for all junior cycle pupils would be central to this programme.  The five-year plan would also involve an examination of primary education.  It is our duty as legislators to provide a curriculum that meets the needs of all our young people.  The educational system should be responsive to the economic, cultural, social and technological needs of society.  In this context a statutory national board for curriculum assessment has an essential role to play.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe for curriculum change. The need is there, the ideas are there. Schools and teachers are in general receptive to and willing to implement curriculum innovation.  It is no longer sufficient simply to identify and consider at a distance the various points that need to be gone into in considering curriculum reform.  The necessary support both in terms of structure and resources must now be made available to enable the willingness which is there to be put to use. The proposed statutory national board for curriculum and assessment can provide a more representative and responsive structure for administering the national educational system while facilitating and promoting innovation within the system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe this Bill gives the Minister an ideal opportunity of leaving a lasting impression on the educational process.  She can do that by supporting the concept of this Bill, giving the board independence and a permanent status and allowing them to continue the excellent work that was carried out by the interim board.  At present I am afraid the Minister is seen as one who has inflicted a number of severe body blows to the educational system, particularly in primary education and in the vocational <Col N="466" /> and comprehensive sector of post-primary education.  She is seen as the Minister who has reversed the process of lowering over the years the pupil-teacher ratio and now we are back to where we were in the early seventies in that regard. Does the Minister want to be remembered as the person who carried out these drastic decisions or will she not grasp the opportunity for establishing the board on a permanent statutory basis and thus be remembered by future generations as the person who accomplished and achieved this?  If she does, then future generations of Irish people will be forever greatful to her.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as matters stand at the moment we seem to be heading for the position where we will have neither a statutory nor a non-statutory curriculum and examinations board.  There are new developments every day with teachers' unions and others withdrawing their consent and willingness, as Deputy Higgins said, to serve on the new board.  It looks as if the Minister's actions and policies will leave us with no board whatsoever in spite of all the promises made in Opposition and all the undertakings given regarding education.  They have all been forgotten and ignored and at present the whole teaching profession, the entire educational establishment, is in a deep state of severe shock.  It seems to be the order of the day to disestablish and abolish every statutory independent board as, for example, An Foras Forbartha, the National Social Service Board and others.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to have the National Curriculum and Examinations Board on a statutory basis so that the Government cannot abolish them at will at any time in the future if they do not agree with that board's recommendations.  If the board come out with some report that is not entirely to the Government's liking the Government can abolish them if they are not on a statutory basis.  That is the chief reason I believe this Private Members' Bill that has been introduced by our spokesperson deserves the support of the entire House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, for her wise and well-reasoned decision to reconstitute the <i>ad hoc</i> Curriculum and Examinations Board as a curriculum council.  I congratulate also the honorary and executive personnel of the <i>ad hoc</i> board and I acknowledge the value of the work they have done since they were set up.  They have produced very fine studies and excellent publications and made noteworthy recommendations.  It is to be regretted that all of their work, all of the distilled wisdom of so many education experts, and all of the fine recommendations have not been acted upon either by Deputy Hussey in her time as Minister or by her successor in that office during the lifetime of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>Let me give one example of how the Coalition partners treated the findings of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  The <i>ad hoc</i> board in their first published document set out an eight-fold framework for the establishment of a sound curriculum in the post-primary sector.  One of the eight basic essential components of that framework was guidance counselling.  This was to have been the first casualty in the Coalition plan to prune the education system.  It fell on Deputy O'Rourke on coming into office as Minister for Education to reverse that decision.  Her action in ensuring the continuance of the guidance council's service was welcomed by parent representational bodies, teachers' unions and industrial interests.  It was proof positive that the Curriculum and Examinations Board had got it right and that the Coalition Government by turning away from the basic elements in education had shown that as far as they were concerned the Curriculum and Examinations Board were little more than political window-dressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excellent persons who comprised this board and have acted on their subcommittees, their chairperson and chief executive worked with the utmost dedication and enthusiasm.  They did not derive their dynamism from the status of the board.  In my view they would have worked with the same zeal and to the <Col N="468" /> same good effect whether they were designated statutory or non-statutory.  The Bill, because of the similarity between what is proposed and the Minister's proposed council, is in effect a major exercise in labelling.  With apologies to William Shakespeare, let me quote from &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; to put the issue in its true perspective: &ldquo;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet&rdquo;.  Let us be clear about this and what the Minister's proposal entials.</P>
    <P>The reconstituted council will be free from the shackles and inherent inflexibility of statutory status and will have the same chairperson, vice-chairperson and chief executive.  The council will have the same primary functions as those laid before the House in this Private Members' Bill.  They will have the same functions and the same untrammelled flexibility that will enable them to revise their operations and their <i>modus operandi,</i> thus being enabled to pursue specific goals in an organisational framework that they can at all times accommodate to their circumstances.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill sets up a most complicated committee structure with lines of command and communication going hither and thither in intricate confusion. The experts assure me it is a system that finds no favour in communication or management theory or practice.  To perpetrate such confusion in a statutory instrument would be a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>Instead of this convoluted spider's web the Minister opts for good old plain simplicity, fewer and shorter lines of communication and a built-in capacity for fast responses.  For the very weakness of section 9 alone this Bill must be rejected. Perhaps the architects of this Bill, conscious of its serious limitations, had a death wish for it even as it was being drafted.  It contains a very definite sudden death mechanism.  I refer the House to section 4 of the First Schedule which provides that the chairperson and every ordinary member of the board may be removed from office by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. <Col N="469" /> It could be that in framing this Bill its mentors had the less than worthy intention that a sudden death clause such as this would act as a virtual sword of Damocles and, because of its statutory status, be a perpetual threat to the members of the board if they failed to toe the line. There is a deep insidious contradiction between this clause and the expectation of independence and permanence which the notion of a statutory board is meant to convey to the public at large and which is being dishonestly touted as the difference between this Bill and the Minister's more practical, more flexible and eminently more straightforward council for curriculum.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill makes reference to designated bodies but does not name them.  The Bill makes no reference to other bodies which were formerly listed as ones with which the board should work in close association.  In omitting reference to them in the Bill the error of demoting them to minor importance made by the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, is compounded.</P>
    <P>This Bill is insensitive and lacks the fine tuning which a good Bill should have. These organisations which were originally relegated to a minor role are now totally ignored.  They contain within their ranks many of the foremost experts in particular areas of education and their ability to contribute to the general aim of curriculum reform is beyond question. The Minister's council for curriculum do not fall into this trap.  The flexibility which the council allow should enable all bodies and experts nominated by them to play an equal role with the council.</P>
    <P>With further reference to the designated bodies, I was glad to note that the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency were nominated.  I am disappointed to find that in the text of this Bill only the masculine gender is used.  Does the Bill assume that the chairperson and the ordinary members of the board will be men?</P>
    <P>I have noted with regret in recent days that some important representative bodies have withdrawn their support for the council.  However, I am confident that <Col N="470" /> when wiser counsels prevail and the heat of the moment is dissipated we will see these people return to the council.  It is as members of this flexible, task-orientated council that they will be best able to serve the interests of the entire teaching profession and guide and initiate the sort of changes which will be to the benefit of teachers and students alike.  Leaving the council would be a very high price to pay as a gesture of dissatisfaction and I would urge them to reconsider.</P>
    <P>In the current climate of financial constraints it is essential that all proposals should be costed in full.  A board which feel obliged to tackle a mountain of tasks simultaneously, as did the Curriculum and Examinations Board, would need an army of specialists to keep track of costs. The expectations raised by the public relations exercise has been noted very sharply in the educational field.  Everyone is touched by education, either personally or through family.  All want the very best and want it at once.  This is, of course, unreal and causes discontentment and disappointment.  The council as proposed by the Minister would work to specific goals and thus enable costing to be an integral part of the process.  The final result would be based on reality and attainability.  In these circumstances we would get a series of practical projects for evolution and change rather than pipe dreams which are light years away from fruition.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the new examination to replace the intermediate certificate is to be an immediate task of the council.  It will get a result in a short time which will be implemented without delay.  That is the beauty of the council.  It is task-orientated with a short timescale.</P>
    <P>I would argue that even if the Minister's infinitely better proposal to establish a council was not available at this time, the Bill should be set aside.  In early 1988 an OECD survey team, in collaboration with an Irish team at present at work, will carry out a review of the Irish education system.  When such a team came here in 1965 and the report <i>Investment in Education</i> was published it had a profound and far-reaching effect <Col N="471" /> on education thinking and planning.  It is likely that the forthcoming review will give a new thrust and a new impetus to curriculum planning and areas of education directly related to it.  The council for curriculum will have the necessary attributes to meet this challenge, unshackled by formal statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of preliminary points have to be made in relation to education before dealing with the Bill before us.  The present Fianna Fáil Government and the occupant of the position of Minister for Education have betrayed not only the State's commitment to developing and expanding educational opportunites for young people but have betrayed commitments made prior to the election, during the election campaign and since then.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto stated they would seek to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, initially at primary level and then progressing to the post-primary system.  I do not think anyone could argue that the programme of cutbacks being implemented can lead to a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The reverse is the case.  There will be a massive increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>The Minister is on record at Question Time as making it clear that despite the massive increase in class sizes there will be no provision for the appointment of additional remedial teachers who will obviously be needed.  All we will get, we are told, is a redeployment of remedial teachers from some classes into other classes or even from some schools to other schools.  On 8 April 1987 the Minister stated in the Dáil that she had no doubt Members of the House would agree that the primary focus of any Education Department must be on the first level.  There is no doubt this is what we have got &mdash; the cuts in education have been carried out much more deeply at primary than at other levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told by the Minister on 16 June this year that this Government would continue to regard primary education as an area of special priority.  We <Col N="472" /> all know at this point what was meant by those words.  The priority is a priority for cuts, priority for increasing class sizes and disimproving the opportunities which our children will have in the educational system.  The effects will be quite startling, particularly at primary level.  Almost evey school will lose a teacher.  Schools with 11 teachers or more will lose two teachers.  Schools with more than 20 teachers may lose as many as four.  School classes will rise to over 40 and over 50 in some cases.  Children may be switched into large multiple classes and pupils with reading or mathematics problems will get less attention in these very large classes. It is expected that more than 800 teachers will lose their jobs at primary level.</P>
    <P>When we were told that priority would be given to primary education we expected it would be priority in terms of improving the situation, improving the pupil-teacher ratio and the buildings in which our children are taught.  The reverse is to be the case.  In saying that, and in being critical of the Government, we must also point out that the priorities of the Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats are extremely weird.  From those parties we have had calls for a wage freeze in the public sector in order to pay for the maintenance of our education system.  Deputies have already given an indication of the type of relationship there is between the money which teachers will get as a result of the 2½ per cent increase and the cuts proposed by the Minister.  The figure for teachers, net of deductions such as income tax and so on, will amount to about £4 million but the education cuts run to a figure in the region of 44 million.  There is no relationship between what might be saved by applying a wage freeze to the salaries of teachers and the maintenance of our education system.</P>
    <P>It is nonsensical to argue that if the public sector workers as a body had agreed to a wage freeze that therefore the Government would be able to maintain our education system.  In the first place I regard it as a disagrace that such a <Col N="473" /> bargaining proposition should be suggested, that our education system should be subject to that type of bargaining.  It is improper to argue with the PAYE sector who carry more than 90 per cent of the burden for our education, social welfare and health systems that if they do not agree to a wage freeze they, and their children, will be deprived of proper education health care and social welfare systems. It is an immoral approach to politics and to the running of the economy of the State.</P>
    <P>I support in principle the idea of a statutory curriculum board.  It is far more important to have a legislative basis for such a board so as to ensure that to some extent it cannot be dissolved at the stroke of a pen by a Minister.  We have had examples recently of boards established by the House being done away with.  We discussed one of them, the Dublin Transportation Authority, at Question Time today.  That body was abolished by the Minister who intends to introduce legislation to give legislative effect to his decision.  The fact that a Minister would have to come to the House to disestablish a board would be an important restraint on him or her, whether it is the present Minister or some future holder of that office.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill in principle I must point out that there are serious deficiencies in it.  It is not my intention to support it unless I get certain commitments from the proposers of the Bill that my amendments will be accepted on Committee Stage, if the House agrees to Second Stage.  In my view the proposed board should have a majority of educationalists involved.  The teachers' organisations should have the right to nominate their representatives to the board and we should not have a Minister plucking out at will the names of people whom he or she may believe to be the person best qualified.  It is essential that the parents' organisations have a right to nominate people to represent them on the board.  Such amendments are important and should be made to the Bill.  The power given to the Minister in the Fine Gael Bill is too sweeping and is not much <Col N="474" /> better than the proposals put by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a need for curriculum reform in Irish schools. The type of curriculum reform I envisage is unlikely to take place under a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Minister for Education although there may be a marginally more progressive approach from the Fine Gael side.  I have a very strong feeling against the notion that our schools should be simply for the maintenance of what are called traditional values.  Unfortunately, we saw the effects of the traditional values on our society in Enniskillen on Sunday.  I am not saying that our teachers or our education system creates people who will go out and deliberately engage in acts such as that which took place in Enniskillen on Sunday but the underlying concepts, the whole framework under which our children are taught at school is what I am concerned about.  I have children attending school and I am aware of what they are being taught.  The underlying philosophy is one which does not necessarily give the children a broader view of life.  It does not necessarily give the view that those other sections of the community on the island have a right to their point of view or to give their allegiance to another State if that is their wish and tradition.</P>
    <P>The idea of maintaining traditional values, as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats spokespersons have expressed, is not right.  Perhaps they do not recognise the implications of what they are saying but the events of the last two weeks on this island should give us cause to pause and think of the type of curriculum our schools have, what is being taught in our schools and the concepts and philosophy which underly what is being taught in our schools.</P>
    <P>The education system in Ireland, North and South, is dominated by the churches. There is almost total control of primary education by the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the Jewish congregation.  They have the right to hire and fire teachers at will.  The second level school system is dominated to a similar extent except in the VECs <Col N="475" /> which are more democratically controlled and more answerable to the public.  Unfortunately, in giving the churches the right to run these schools, in giving them the right to hire and fire our teachers, in giving them the right to virtually decided the shape and content of our curriculum, we are as democratically elected Members of this House giving up our democratic right to do that job whether it is through a curriculum board or otherwise.  Of course, there is no guarantee that even if we had democratic structures, democratic control or if we had the independence that VECs and comperhensive schools enjoy, the philosophy and concepts I have spoken of would change.  Clearly we have the same kind of education in those schools also.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a fundamental review of what we are teaching in our schools.  For that reason there should be a statutory board which is not liable to the dictates of the Minister at any given time.  The teachers and parents should have the right to nominate their representatives to that board because whatever chance there is of such a board being independent of the Government there is very little chance that a board appointed solely by the Minister would necessarily have the clout or the courage to go against the Minister of the day and to make tough decisions in relation to what has to be done in education.</P>
    <P>I am withholding support until I hear the response of the Fine Gael Party in relation to the shape of the Bill.  If there are commitments that the type of amendments I am talking about will be accepted and implemented on Committee Stage, we will support the Bill.  If not, we will not support it.  I urge the Fine Gael spokespersons to apply themselves to the points I have made.  It is difficult to deal with education in a broad way in a short speech.  It must also be said that the previous Coalition Government introduced fairly severe cutbacks in education and it is difficult, therefore, to think of education in a progressive way and about having progressive improvements in the system of education when parents and <Col N="476" /> teachers are thinking mainly about simply preserving or trying to hold on to what they have.</P>
    <P>In the middle sixties there was a great expansion in education, not because there was a sudden awakening to the value of education for children but because the economic demands of the time called for a more able, technically-trained and articulate workforce than had been available up to that time.  I clearly recollect that when I was leaving the primary school in the early fifties, the vast majority of my school mates finished education at that time.  When I went on the the VEC &mdash; the tech as it was called then &mdash; I was one among very few who went on.  That changed in the middle sixties and there was a massive increase in the numbers attending second level education, the VECs and secondary schools. Indeed, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education at that time is to be congratulated for his policies.</P>
    <P>It is not because children need less academic or technical qualifications that the cutbacks are being implemented. They need them even more given that 30,000 to 40,000 of them have had to leave the State every year for the past four or five years to try to find work abroad.  There is not the same demand here any more for this well-educated workforce.  There has been a decline in our manufacturing industry and in the numbers at work and what worries me about education and the way it is developing is the growing influence of industry and business in the shaping of our curriculum. I am not for a minute arguing that there should not be an influence in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is pointless producing young people who are not able to work in the commercial arena in which they find themselves when they leave school.  However, there is a worrying trend that we will return to a simple three Rs approach to education &mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic &mdash; and that we will not try to develop the wider capacities of our children to be aware of the world around them, of how they can change it and to be aware that the world is not either work <Col N="477" /> or unemployment, that there are other aspects to life.  For that reason, it is important to have a review of our curriculum and of how we assess the achievement of our students.  It is important that any such curriculum review should be done in the context not only of the needs of industry or business but also the needs of the children to live full and fulfilling lives.  There is a need to ensure that the ideas we are imparting in their minds in schools do not lead them to the kind of atrocities that occurred on this island over the past two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa touched in a very sincere way on something we need on this island, the linkage between education &mdash; particularly in children's formative years &mdash; and reality.  As he said, if we really wanted to illustrate to ourselves and to those who listen to us in this House the need for a curriculum review on a continuous basis you really need not look any further than the barbarism of this weekend.  To the extent that education contributed to that barbarism, the curriculum which had been allowed to get out of touch with reality contributed to it.  The point is well made that a curriculum board is needed.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa took a sideward swipe at church-based institutions in education which has become a fashionable thing to do.  It is not relevant to the Bill or indeed to reality to throw to one side all that has been done by church-based institutions over all the years.</P>

      <P>That may be so but I do not pay as much heed to Provisional IRA spokesmen as the Deputy evidently does. The need for a curriculum board and for changes in this area in education are fairly self-evident and have been made by previous speakers but they bear reiteration here.  We have seen in education, particularly in the post-primary sector, a veritable explosion of knowledge in recent years.  We have also seen an explosion of people moving into second level schools. For example, in 25 years there has been an expansion of people taking the leaving certificate, from something considerably under 10,000 to in excess of 55,000. Changes of that order place an obvious strain on an examination and curriculum system.</P>
      <P>It is obvious, in view of the explosion of knowledge, that a change is necessary in this area.  When we are talking about the explosion of knowledge I should make the point that nowhere is the need for continuous curriculum reform and development more obvious than in the area of new information technology which puts a strain on anyone in the educational system.  Knowledge has been developing there at a great pace in the last five or ten years to the extent that people in the education system for only a few short years find that their knowledge has rapidly become defunct that therefore there is a continuous challenge in education to keep the young people abreast of developments.  I welcome changes in this direction.  They are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remind ourselves of the history of this legislation.  In 1984 Deputy Hussey as Minister for Education introduced the interim board and I congratulated her at that time as I felt that it was a very worth-while change of direction, a very worth-while innovation.  The legislation we have before us was prepared by Deputy Hussey when she was in the Department during the 1985-86 period.  This legislation was left on the stocks, on the files in the Department of Education for another Fine Gael Minister. It is not just differences from this side of the House that should be reflected <Col N="479" /> here.  There were clearly differences of opinion between the regime under Deputy Hussey in the Department of Education and the new regime under Deputy Cooney.  Deputy Cooney, as Minister for Education had some profound difficulties with this legislation as it was drafted in the Department, and as a consequence of that it was put on the back boiler.  Obviously Deputy Hussey believed in the Bill when she left it in the Department, even though the Minister for Education who followed her did not and she is now trying in this motion to reintroduce what she had proposed at that time.</P>
    <P>There are problems with this proposal at this time.  The Minister had already given a clear indication that she was reconstituting the interim board as a curriculum council.  The Minister had already abolished the interim board and had established a new council.  The Minister's actions in this regard were not precipitated simply by the arrival of this Bill on the Order Paper.  They were signalled well in advance.  I suggest that the debate here has a certain artificiality about it because the Minister had already indicated the directions she was taking in this regard.  It strikes me that this is opportunistic at this time.  However, my personal views on it are not as relevant as the clearly objective problems in the proposal before us.</P>
    <P>The first major problem is that there is no built in accountability in these proposals. There is no direct control by the Minister in these proposals.  This is a fundemental flaw.  We have created problems with statutory bodies which have been elevated to the point where they are not controllable.  The removal of certain areas of public administration from the direct ambit of the Minister is a positive thing but it is a problem when one takes that positive move and removes the body one creates from direct controllability. That is carrying a good thing a little too far.  Here we are creating a body which effectively is removed from direct control <Col N="480" /> and from direct democratic answerability. That is a major problem.</P>

      <P>A further point about the statutory nature of this Bill is that the Minister's proposals can achieve what is intended by this Bill without creating this artificial dichotomy, this removal of the statutory body from the area of control by this House.  The Minister's proposals have made this clear.  The Minister has made it clear in what she has said in this House and in public that her desire is to create a situation where we have the positive benefits of an independent board and at the same time we have public answerability.  Public answerability is important.</P>
      <P>There is a further problem with this proposal and that is financial.  These proposals mean that the board will inevitably be involved in finance.  It would be wrong that a non-democratically answerable body would be in a position to commit funds or resources without being answerable to this House.</P>

      <P>Another weakness in Deputy Hussey's proposals is the problem with the structure of the board proposed here.  It strikes me that it is not at all representative.  That is a weakness. I am surprised at that, because when Deputy Hussey was in office she made quite a few speeches about the importance of representation.  I do not want to boil cabbage that has been well boiled before, but if we go back to the interim board one sees the weakness in that the proposals would allow the Minister of the day to absolutely dominate the board with ministerial appointees.  That is a wrong move.  If one compares the Minister's proposals which are before this House with the proposals in this Bill one will see that the Minister is allowing for one nominee in her proposals whereas the proposals before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we had a debate on the carnage in Enniskillen and we expressed our outrage and our feelings against those who perpetrated that massacre.  During the course of that debate I emphasised that what occurred was entirely consistent with the strategy that the Provisional IRA have been pursuing for the past 18 years &mdash; sectarian warfare.  The objective of this is to provoke an all-out civil war between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.  Evidence <Col N="483" /> of that has been clear for many years and it is amazing that that fact has still not been grasped by serious media people in this country.  In the Le Mon massacre 15 or 17 years ago, 17 Protestant kids who were at a disco were killed by bombs and burned to death.  In the Kingsmill massacre people were taken from a bus on their way home from work.  The Catholics were told to go home and 11 Protestants were murdered in cold blood. That also happened many years ago.</P>
    <P>Last night I was amazed to hear Pat Kenny, when he was introducing the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, describe what occurred in Enniskillen as a major error of strategy for the Provisionals.  During the course of the programme the massacre was apparently excused on the grounds that it was not sanctioned by GHQ &mdash; it was carried out by a maverick group &mdash; it was unfortunate that it happened and it is not part of the Provisional IRA strategy.  For many years it has been the clear, deliberate strategy of the Provisional IRA to kill Protestants.  We hear about sectarian murders on the radio and television.  The sectarian murders are always when a Protestant murders a Catholic.  When the Provisionals murder Protestants all sorts of excuses are given, for example, the person was formally connected with the UDR or the RUC he was a brother of a prison officer, he was a judge or because he worked in a particular company.  All of this is trotted out on television and radio programmes.  A Protestant killing is never regarded as a sectarian killing by the media.  That was the point I wanted to get across last night. It is important that we understand that this is part of the strategy of the Provisionals.</P>
    <P>It was sickening to hear the sanctimonious statements made by Gerry Adams which attempted to disguise the essentially sectarian nature of the attack. He is the man who called the Brighton bombing as a blow for democracy.  He called the attempted killing of a British Tory Prime Minister as a blow for democracy. It was a blow against democracy, as was the assasination of Aldo Moro by <Col N="484" /> terrorists in Italy.  Unfortunately Gerry Adams was given widespread friendly coverage in some of our newspapers.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> regard him as a charismatic figure.  Peculiarly enough the same <i>Sunday Tribune</i> editor regards Dominic McGlinchey as a charismatic figure.  I suppose the more people you kill the more charismatic you become.  Hitler was a charismatic figure, as was Rasputin, the Mad Monk, and in our own day Charles Manson is a charismatic figure as well. Charismatic does not mean good; it can mean evil as well as good.</P>
    <P>We have to be clear about what occurred in Enniskillen and what we want to do about it.  It is most important that we now attempt to do something positive and constructive against terrorism and for reconciliation.  We were all impressed and affected very much by the attitudes of the relatives of the victims in Enniskillen and the people of Fermanagh generally. The Protestant people of Fermanagh have not shown sectarianism and have not answered back killing with killing. What has been made clear over the past number of days is that their attitude is totally without bitterness and is one of reconciliation and openness.  Nobody has called for revenge and we should now support them.  We should try to channel the anger and outrage that we expressed here yesterday, and which is widespread among people in the South, in a positive direction to ensure the total rejection and isolation of this type of sectarian terrorism and outrage from our society.</P>
    <P>I asked for this debate because I believe the Government should consider in what way the public might be allowed to demonstrate their sympathy for the victims of this attack, the revulsion which they feel, their opposition to those who engaged in that attack and their determination to ensure that attacks of that sort should not happen again in the future.  As I mentioned last night, earlier this year a Basque terrorist group set off a bomb in a supermarket in Barcelona in a similar type of attack to the one in Enniskillen.  It had devastating results. The Spanish Government organised a silent demonstration in which over <Col N="485" /> 100,000 people took part.  This was very effective.  Our Government should give the people of this country a similar opportunity to publicly demonstrate their abhorrence at Sunday's events.  I am sure that such an event would demonstrate to the people of Northern Ireland that the vast majority of people in the South have nothing but contempt for those who carried out the Enniskillen attack.</P>
    <P>For such a demonstration to have the necessary impact it would have to be organised nationally, involve as many people as possible and be done as soon as possible.  I do not think it should be an occasion for speeches.  Something in the nature of a silent march or vigil through the streets of Dublin is what would be required.  I do not think it should be organised by a particular group or political party; it should be done at a national level.  The Government represent the people and they and the Members of the Oireachtas should, on behalf of the people, take an initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a commemorative service arranged for the victims in Saint Patrick's Cathedral next Sunday.  I hope that as many people in this House as possible will attend that service.  I hope also that the Government will be represented at the highest level possible, at that service.  I believe, from today's papers, that the remembrance service which should have taken place in Enniskillen last Sunday, and which was so cruelly interrupted, is to be held on Sunday, 22 November.  Again, I hope that the Government would be represented at a high level at this ceremony in Enniskillen.  In addition I hope that as many people as possible from here will attend this event.  This is not a time to become tangled in diplomatic niceties or protocol but it is time for all our people to make a statement on their opposition to terrorism, and their determination to isolate those engaged in terrorist activities. I think people are looking for leadership in this direction.  Very often when something dreadful occurs we say that perhaps some good will come out of this. There have been attempts in the past to develop something of this nature: for <Col N="486" /> example, the Peace People movement arose out of such an outrage.  I think on this occasion the feeling is so high, so widespread and so positive that if the Government were to give the proper leadership we could bring something good out of this terrible massacre at Enniskillen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for raising this matter and record my appreciation of his motivation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the horror that has arisen in Enniskillen, I am quite certain there is no Member of this House who does not share a profound sense of horror at this atrocity by the men of violence in Enniskillen last Sunday &mdash; a sense of outrage and horror which is shared by all decent Irish men and women throughout the island and throughout the world.  There can be no question but that those who planned and perpetrated this act did so in the clear knowledge that many civilians would be attending the ceremony and would be killed or maimed.  We all recognise something obscene in the fact that this attack was planned and carried out on a day which many ordinary Irish men and women had gathered to commemorate those of their families and friends who had died in two World Wars. There is a long Irish tradition of respect for those paying tribute to our dead.</P>
      <P>This outrage is the latest and most horrific example of the pattern of violence of the IRA &mdash; a pattern which shows clearly their contempt for the sanctity of human life and for a sense of human decency.  I can only hope that this barbaric act &mdash; and this is what it was &mdash; will once and for all show the suffering, tragedy and utter futility of the campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have these last few days witnessed not alone a shared sense of outrage but also a great wave of sympathy and rightly so, for the victims of Enniskillen and their families.  We could not but be moved by the dignity and Christian compassion of Mr. Gordon Wilson on the death of his young daughter, Marie &mdash; as it came over on the media to large numbers of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> What possible justification can there be for this act of barbarism?  The utter cynicism displayed by the godfathers of violence in their subsequent excuses clearly demonstrates, if such still needed to be demonstrated, the immorality of this futile campaign of violence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement last Sunday made clear the feeling of anger and revulsion which all decent Irish men and women feel towards those who planned and executed this criminal act.  He also made clear that those responsible must be repudiated utterly and without equivocation and that no effort would be spared to ensure that they are brought to justice.  I want to take this opportunity to repeat that message to this House.  We will not allow these people to tear apart the fabric of our society with their campaign of violence which has heaped one heinous crime on top of another.  Every effort will be made to ensure that these people are brought to justice and there will be the fullest co-operation between the security forces north and south of the Border to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>We have all seen in recent days the dignified grief shown by the people of Enniskillen as they bury the victims of this atrocity.  It is indeed fitting that the people of this part of the island should, at this time, show their sympathy in a suitably dignified manner.  This morning both the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to join with many others in signing the Book of Condolences opened by Dublin Corporation.  I know that a number of other local authorities have expressed their sympathy in a similar dignified and fitting manner.</P>
    <P>It is in the Irish tradition to pay respect at times like this in our churches, and Deputy Mac Giolla has also made this point.  The Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, has arranged a memorial service for the Enniskillen victims. My Department have been in contact with the Dean and the memorial service will be held on Sunday next at 3.30 p.m. in St.  Patrick's.  The preacher <Col N="488" /> at this service will be the Right Reverend Dr. Brian Hannon, Bishop of Clogher, in whose diocese is Enniskillen.  I would like to take this opportunity to announce that the Government will be represented at the very highest level.  I would suggest that as many Members of the Oireachtas as possible who may wish to attend, should be in attendance on that occasion. I believe that many members of the public will also wish to show their abomination of violence and their respect for the victims of the bombing of Enniskillen and their sympathy and sense of solidarity with the families by attending the service at St. Patrick's Cathedral and other services which are being arranged at present by all Christian denominations.  In Enniskillen itself the Most Reverend Dr. Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher, will address the congregation at St. Michael's Church, at Mass tomorrow evening.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, these lines from the celebrated Northern poet, John Hewitt, are appropriate:</P>
    <P>This land we stand on holds a history</P>
    <P>so complicated, gashed with violence,</P>
    <P>split by belief, by blatant pageantry</P>
    <P>that none can safely stir and still feel free</P>
    <P>to voice his hope with any confidence.</P>
    <P>A tragedy so awful as that of Enniskillen may hold one ray of light &mdash; that the people North and South, those with religion and those with none, even the bombers themselves, and everybody with differing views, traditions and attitudes, will join together to banish bigotry and violence from our hearts and allow us all to voice our hope with confidence.  We want a better island for the people who will follow us.</P>

First, it was a review of Government policies on transport and the issues for future policy consideration. Second, it extended an invitation to all interested parties to help mould transport policy for the future.  In response to that invitation 81 submissions were received. In the light of this I am now putting in place sectoral policies for the transport sector.  I have already outlined the key aspects of these policies to this House on a number of occasions, and I do not envisage publishing a composite formal policy document at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 24 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approved the grant for an occasional road passenger licence to O'Neill's Transport, Maynooth, for the provision of a feeder bus service from Captain's Hill to Leixlip and return, to connect with existing bus and train services to and from <Col N="360" /> Dublin, in order to meet a long standing demand for public transport services in the Captain's Hill area which was not being met by any other operator.  I understand that the new feeder bus service commenced on Monday, 9 November.  A single fare of 30p is charged to adults, while school children, up to second level, pay 15p.  The operation provides 14 services each way, Monday to Friday inclusive, between 6.55 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. On Saturdays, seven services each way operate between 7.45 a.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>The proposal of Bus Atha Cliath to introduce a bus service in this area was communicated to me by letter dated 20 August 1987.  The O'Neill application had been made at an earlier date and in accordance with existing statute and policy, which obliges me to take account of passenger services available to the public in the area, there were no grounds for refusing the licence.</P>
    <P>Under Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958, Bus Átha Cliath may not initiate any passenger road service so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service, without my consent.  Bus Átha Cliath have applied for my consent to initiate a bus service to Captain's Hill and that application is under consideration.</P>
    <P>The specific schedules for any Bus Átha Cliath service are matters for which the company have statutory responsibility. Maximum fare limits, approved by the Government from time to time, apply to all Bus Átha Cliath services.</P>

      <P>The total paid by my Department up to 31 October 1987 in respect of the services provided by Zeus Management Limited to the B &amp; I, is £208,340 excluding VAT.  Of the total, £92,686 is recoupable from the B &amp; I in respect of the aggregate cost to the B&amp;I of the employment of a chief executive and the fee normally payable to the Chairman of B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken on the question of the renewal of the arrangements with Zeus and with the B &amp; I Chairman and Managing Director.</P>
      <P>As to the future of the B &amp; I, I cannot say when a final decision will be taken by the Government.  The House will recall that in May, 1987 I directed the B &amp; I Board to submit to me as soon as possible a plan of action for implementation in the Autumn aimed at restoring the company to viability.  A plan was submitted to me two days ago by the Board of the B &amp; I.  I am aware of the concessions made by sections of the company's workforce during the recent negotiations.  I have, however, to tell the House that the board have informed me that they are unable to recommend implementation of the plan in the absence of agreement with the union representing marine officers and that they have instructed management to seek such agreement as a matter of urgency.  I understand that further negotiations last evening between the B &amp; I management and the union concerned failed to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that it would be premature for me to make any further statement about the future of the B &amp; I at this stage.</P>

Arrangements have now been made to pay all arrears due for the period from October 1981 to May 1986 and a payable order will be issued shortly to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise the importance of the private rented housing sector and seeks to encourage the creation of conditions favourable to the provision of such accommodation.  Stringent regulatory measures and controls are liable to discourage investment in private rented housing and ultimately lead to a reduction in the supply of such accommodation. Increasing the supply of private rented accommodation is the most effective way of ensuring an orderly rents regime.  Conversely, any measures that discourage the provision of accommodation are likely to lead to an imbalance between supply and demand and are not in the best interests of tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory regulations were made in December, 1984, prescribing minimum standards in private rented housing formerly controlled under the rent restrictions Acts.  These minimum standards applied from 1 April 1985, except where a tenancy agreement had been fixed by the District Court, the Rent Tribunal or by agreement before that date in which case the standards have to be met from 1 January, 1988, or from the date of application for a review of rent by the tribunal, whichever comes sooner.  From 1 January next, the regulations which are enforced by housing authorities will apply to all formerly controlled dwellings.  In addition, many housing authorities have adopted by-laws for private rented accommodation under section 70 of the <Col N="373" /> Housing Act, 1966, governing registration and physical standards for multiunit rented dwellings; the authorities also have wide powers under sections 66 to 69 of the Housing Act, 1966, to deal with unfit houses.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals at present to extend the role of the Rent Tribunal.</P>
