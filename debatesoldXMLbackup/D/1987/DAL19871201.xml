      <P>Would the Taoiseach inform the House when the Minister for Justice will give a report to the House about the results from his massive search operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as it is possible to do so.  The search operation is still <Col N="2" /> under way and our advice is that the security authorites would prefer not to make a statement at this stage.  I assure the House that as soon as possible full information will be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the information is to the effect that the search is being wound down.  I also understand from reports, which may or may not be accurate or complete, that almost nothing has been found in the way of firearms.  If that is the case, would the Minister indicate during the course of that report what has happened to the firearms that he believes the search was launched to find in the first place and, if <Col N="3" /> he believes that they are still there, what further actions will he be taking and if the searching of further houses will continue in the context of a search of that kind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying before the adjournment last Friday that Deputies across the House should be careful and wary in relation to the extent they oppose the safeguards which are built into the Bill before the House on extradition.  I do not think that I was too unfair to Deputies opposite when I suggested that perhaps the only interest which they might be pursuing in relation to casting aspersions on these protections and safeguards would be an interest which was basically contrary to the interests of Irish citizens or, indeed, foreigners who might be resident in this country and who might be affected by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occasion should not pass without my saying that in the debate on this measure a certain amount of double think is arising, both inside and outside of this House.  It is with some pride and sense of achievement that I can stand here as a Deputy supporting the Government on this measure to say that the Government are proposing measures which all of the citizens of this country would be able to avail of and which would ensure that they <Col N="7" /> would have basic safeguards against the arbitrary use of a very severe instrument in the form of extradition.  As I have said earlier, extradition constitutes a very fundamental change in the basic rights of a citizen and we must think very carefully before using it.  The proposals in this Bill would ensure that these rights would not be interfered with without the adequate and thorough scrutiny of a law officer of the highest standing.</P>
    <P>When Deputies supporting the Government on this measure are queried in relation to the views they may have and in respect of any debates in which they may have taken part so as to ensure that the safeguards would be built into the legislation, there are cries of ambivalence, of people being sneaking regarders, of people not being committed to the fight against terrorism and of people not having a true commitment to security. Yet, when we read in the British press about the debate on a similar measure in Britain we find that the House of Lords are putting forward the same views and pushing for the same protections which our Government and those Deputies supporting them are pushing for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>An entirely different attitude is taken when describing the approach of the House of Lords.  The newspapers also take an entirely different attitude in that the House of Lords are lauded for their concern for human rights and for their concern for their citizens.</P>
    <P>Everything is placed in an entirely different perspective.  I would like to think that this measure would be considered by this House independent of any partisan approach because the difference in the treatment of the debate in this House and the debate in the House of Lords is very stark indeed and there are lessons to be learned from it.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that in regard to any misgivings which any Member of this House may have in relation to this proposed legislation, these misgivings will be catered for.  They appear to be catered for by the willingness of the Taoiseach and the Government to have the matter reviewed at an early date and to keep an <Col N="8" /> eye on how the measure will operate. It is envisaged also that the Attorney General will formally report back to this House.  It is not possible for Members of this House to see each possible contingency which may arise in the future but if this House were to approach the proposals contained in the Bill in a spirit of generosity and allow for the fact that the thrust and intention of the Bill is to provide basic protections and safeguards for our citizens, the Bill will be put through.  The beneficiaries will be the citizens of this country and legislation in relation to extradition will be enhanced rather than destroyed or made inferior in any way.</P>
    <P>On those grounds I commend the Bill to the House and I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice for their dedication to drafting a Bill which reflects the feelings and the philosophy of the country and the basic concerns of Deputies and citizens in regard to protections for our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach in his speech on Friday at the commencement of Second Stage recognised finally the need for a common European approach in combating terrorism and subversion.  The European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism transcends Anglo-Irish relations and provides a comprehensive and coherent approach by European democratic nations to protect and defend democracy against those who through murder, mayhem and violence seek to impose their own political will on others.  The European dimension to this issue was lost sight of by Fianna Fáil in the debate on extradition which took place in this House last year.  In losing sight of that dimension the Fianna Fáil Party on Second Stage failed to vote in favour of the 1987 Extradition Act relating to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, the Act which the Taoiseach now recognises as being a necessity to combat terrorism as we find it in the latter half of the twentieth century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it took the disastrous events of recent weeks &mdash; the <Col N="9" /> tragedy and horror of Enniskillen, the finding of arms on the <i>Eksund</i> and the atrocious kidnapping of Dr. O'Grady and the barbaric acts of his kidnappers &mdash; to bring the Fianna Fáil Party to a state of recognition of the need to confront and face up to the very difficult problems we face on this island in the context of terrorism and of the behaviour of the IRA, the INLA and other subversive and illegal organisations and to recognise the need for a common European front or common approach to this problem. Indeed, it is only appropriate at this stage in this debate to recognise that since this debate commenced last Friday there have been two important events.</P>
    <P>At midnight last night the State formally brought into force the Extradition Act of 1987 which makes part of our domestic law our commitment to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  That Act which Fianna Fáil in Opposition sought to oppose, which they had little enthusiasm for and which they regarded as being unworthy of passage through this House, has now been recognised by them in Government and by the Taoiseach as an essential statutory measure to assist this State in combating terrorism and as something we are obliged to implement in the broader European context of our mutual obligations and commitments to maintain democracy not just on this island but in Europe.  The Taoiseach now recognises the implementation of this Act as being a tangible indicator to the other members of the European Community and democratic States outside the EC of this State's commitment to this area. Therefore, I welcome the fact that at midnight last night this Act became law and gave a domestic expression to our international treaty obligations in respect of the European Convention to which we became a party in March 1987.</P>
    <P>In detailing the need for legislation of this nature with regard to terrorism the Taoiseach referred to the recent events I have just described and said that his approach was not simply a reaction to three events.  He pointed out that the problems we have on this island have <Col N="10" /> been with us for many years and that these were just a series of horrific events in what has been a history of subversion and terrorism on the part of groups who have sought freely to murder people of different traditions.</P>
    <P>On Friday last the security forces finally succeeded in arresting the person who is the alleged leader of the people responsible for kidnapping Dr. O'Grady. As this is the first occasion since that event that I have spoken as Fine Gael spokesman on law reform, it is appropriate to say that we congratulate the security forces, the Garda and the Army, on their bravery last Friday and on the success of the actions they took.  In doing so, let me say that the success of those actions and of the road blocks placed on that occasion leaves many questions which the Government will have to answer as to why similar back-up was not provided on previous occasions when individuals involved in the kidnapping were traced and tracked down and managed to get through road blocks that were undermanned through lack of resources provided for the Garda and Army.  That is not to be debated on this Bill, but the Garda and the Army should be congratulated on their bravery and the effectiveness of the actions which they took on Friday last which are applauded by everyone in this State.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the 1987 Extradition Act relating to the suppression of terrorism has now become law.  This Extradition (Amendment) Bill before us has only a very limited relationship to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which is now part of our law. I intend to point out that limited relationship and the inherent problems the Bill can create in the entire extradition process not just with regard to those who are alleged to have committed terrorist offences but with regard to the entirety of the extradition process as it applies between Britain and Ireland.  The Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism has a European dimension, but the emphasis in the debate in this House this time last year was on the Anglo-Irish <Col N="11" /> dimension, and the Anglo-Irish dimension of the extradition process is specifically affected by the Bill which is before this House today.  It is curious that a Bill of this nature should be introduced by this Government given the historic contribution made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, to the enactment of our current extradition legislation.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that our relationship with Britain demands that in the area of extradition there should be special relationships between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The reason for those special relationships was well articulated by the then Minister for Justice in 1963 when he introduced the Extradition Bill, 1963, and were repeated by Deputy Lenihan in 1965 when he was Minister for Justice.  The need to provide special arrangements of a less complex nature between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was described in the following terms by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, when Minister for Justice in 1963.  Having referred to the provisions in the extradition legislation which related to our relationships by way of extradition with other states, he returned in the debate, as reported in the Official Report, 29 January 1964, columns 137-8, volume 207, to the special arrangements that the Extradition Bill of 1963 laid down for the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the case of Britain and Northern Ireland, we have to keep in mind that we have complete freedom of movement and travel inside these islands and we should therefore in framing our arrangements keep that freedom of travel in mind.  If justice is to be effectively administered inside these islands and at the same time we are to preserve this freedom of movement, then we must have some system in operation between us which is more immediate and effective than the <Col N="12" /> rather cumbersome semi-diplomatic process of extradition itself.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we are establishing this arrangement with Britain and Northern Ireland &mdash; it can be regarded as a concomitant of freedom of travel in the three areas.  It is a satisfactory arrangement, particularly since we have spelled out in the Bill all the offences which are excluded and the safeguards which are built in to protect the rights of individuals who may be concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach as Minister for Justice in 1963 when he introduced what became the Extradition Act, 1965, recognised that due to the freedom of movement between this country and the UK and Northern Ireland because of the fact that passports did not have to be produced when borders were crossed, there was a need for an efficient, expeditious system of extradition which facilitated law enforcement in the Republic and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>This Bill before the House is introducing additional bureaucratic layers to the extradition procedure.  If the Bill is serious in its intent &mdash; it is possible it may not be &mdash; it is introducing and constructing barriers to extradition which Deputy Haughey when Minister for Justice refused to provide, and Deputy Lenihan when Minister for Justice refused to provide them also.  Both of them in their contributions to the debate on that Extradition Bill regarded such barriers as undesirable in the context of the fight against crime in the totality of these islands.  In this Bill a new procedure is introduced which may or may not be seriously intended.</P>
    <P>The procedure to date has been referred to by the Taoiseach as one whereby the Attorney General will check all warrants received by way of extradition to establish whether there is a clear intent to prosecute on foot of those warrants and whether the intention to prosecute is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  It appears that members of the Fianna Fáil Party think that under this Bill the Attorney General <Col N="13" /> will examine every warrant.  Perhaps he will, but equally it is worth stating that he does not have to examine any warrants at all.  Maybe this Bill is merely a political facade, a sort of three card trick in the political domain whereby you pretend that the Attorney General is going to exercise powers which in reality the Government intend will not be exercised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unworthy comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill is currently framed, if the Attorney General shows no interest in any warrant, if a warrant is referred to the District Court following the Garda Commissioner endorsing it, if there is no communication from the Attorney General at all, the Bill provides that it will be accepted and assumed by the District Court that no direction has been given at all by the Attorney General, the direction, of course, being not to extradite.  The Attorney General has a negative role.  He can veto an extradition if he examines the warrant and issues a direction, but he has a discretion. He does not have to examine every warrant.</P>
      <P>As this Bill is currently framed he may take it into his head to examine one or two warrants.  He may as a matter of practice examine all warrants.  He may, though, examine no warrants at all and, as the Bill is framed, if he examines no warrants at all a district justice must accept that there is no direction to be issued by the Attorney General to prevent extradition and it appears that the Attorney General's entire role as the Bill is framed becomes irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the possibility that this Bill has no serious intent at all.  On the other hand it may have a serious intent. It may be the intention that the Attorney General will interfere with the extradition process.  It may be the intention that the Attorney General will examine every single extradition warrant that comes to this country from Great Britain or Northern Ireland but the Bill does not explain when he will <Col N="14" /> do so.  The Garda Commissioner currently would get a warrant from the British authorities and if the warrant is in order it is endorsed by the Garda Commissioner. It is then relied on by the Garda for the purpose of arresting someone alleged to have committed an offence in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to clarify when the Attorney General will be exercising these powers?  In what circumstances will they be exercised?  Will there be an internal Government memo specifying the types of offences that the Attorney General should watch out for in the context of warrants?  Will there be an internal Government memo which says if it is an ordinary crime &mdash; if somebody is being sought for a burglary or an embezzlement or a simple unpolitical murder &mdash; the Attorney General need not bother himself about it at all?  If it is something involving &ldquo;the lads&rdquo;&mdash; the IRA, the INLA &mdash; will the Government memo say that the Attorney General should examine it?  The Bill gives no guidelines as to what intervention, if any, the Attorney General will take or as to when he will take it.</P>
    <P>When the Garda Commissioner receives a warrant should he, before he endorses it to enable the arrest of a person sought in the warrant, phone up the Attorney General's office and find out in the context of each warrant if the Attorney General has an interest in the particular alleged offender referred to in the warrant?  I do not now the answers to these questions.  If this Bill is seriously intended to provide so-called protections it fails to spell out the procedure to be applied by the Attorney General in deciding whether he should intervene to examine warrants.  It fails to spell out what the duties of the Garda Commissioner are. The Garda Commissioner can telephone the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach or the Attorney General to find out if he can enforce a particular warrant.</P>
    <P>This Bill not only fails to provide protection but fails to spell out how it will be operated in practice.  No contribution made yet in this House by any member of the Government party has indicated <Col N="15" /> how it will operate in practice.  If the intention is that the Attorney General should vet every extradition warrant let us hear someone from the Government side say that.  I want someone to explain how the Garda Commissioner will operate under the Extradition Act of 1965 when he receives a warrant.  Will he send it by courier to the Attorney General's office?  Will he speak personally with the Attorney General?  How long will he have to wait to see if the Attorney General will issue a direction?  Can the Attorney General sit on a warrant for a week, a month, six months, a year or three years?  There is no obligation in the Bill prescribing how long the Attorney General needs to consider the position before he decides whether to issue a direction.</P>
    <P>If the Garda know the whereabouts of someone charged with a horrific murder in Northern Ireland or Great Britain and know that if they move swiftly they can arrest that person on foot of a warrant obtained, must they sit back and wait to see whether the Attorney General issues a direction?  How long must they wait? Will they wait until the person alleged to have committed the offence has gone underground and disappeared or will they be put into the appalling position which we saw on television screens last week when Mr. Kane was followed by groups of gardaí waiting for warrants to come into their hands?</P>
    <P>There is no clarification in this Bill as to how this new procedure will operate, what effect it will have on Garda powers how it will affect the efficiency of the extradition system, how the Attorney General will exercise his functions or when he will do so.  If this measure is seriously intended, if it is not merely intended to be a statutory measure that will never be acted upon, it could hold up endlessly the extradition process.  It could throw the whole efficiency of the extradition process into complete disarray. The Government should come clean and tell us what instructions will be given to the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General with regard to the <Col N="16" /> operations of this measure if it is enacted into law.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that the Attorney General will operate the powers the Bill gives him.  There are other problems.  What does the Bill mean when it refers to the Attorney General having to be assured that an intention to prosecute is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence? What will be regarded as sufficient evidence?Will this constitute a pre-trial finding by the Attorney General that someone whose extradition is sought is to be presumed guilty of the crime alleged instead of presumed innocent until proven guilty?  Could it be that this provision, instead of providing a protection for an accused person, would cause pre-trial prejudice?</P>
    <P>If someone who is extradited is found innocent of an offence in circumstances where the Attorney General thought there was sufficient evidence to convict him, what will be the position of the Attorney General?  Will he have to resign because he mistakenly extradited someone whom the courts subsequently found to be innocent of the offence alleged because the courts in England or Northern Ireland found there was an insufficiency of evidence?  To protect his own position will the Attorney General, before agreeing to the extradition of anyone, have to ensure that guilt can be proved against that person beyond reasonable doubt?</P>
    <P>I do not know what is meant by sufficiency of evidence and the Government have not spelt out yet what is meant by that phrase.  How is the Attorney General to determine whether there is a sufficiency of evidence?  Will he have to seek witness statements from those who will be called at a trial of an alleged offender and will he have to examine them?  What will happen if the accused provides him with statements from his witnesses to establish that there is not a sufficiency of evidence?  Will he have to engage in a judicial determination, hearing both sides?  If he makes a decision without hearing what the person whose extradition is sought has to say, will it be that the exercise of his functions will be <Col N="17" /> unconstitutional, not because he is exercising a judicial function, but because he is failing to give someone at risk of extradition a right to be heard in the determination of his fate regarding sufficiency of evidence?  This whole concept brings total confusion into the extradition process.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to spell out in what circumstances it is expected that the Attorney General will be regarded as having a sufficiency of evidence.  If he receives an affidavit from the British authorities confirming that there is sufficient evidence to establish a case against someone will he accept the affidavit, as such affidavit would be accepted in the context of the extradition arrangements between this State and the United States of America?  Is this whole requirement as provided in the Bill no more than a badly drafted inept piece of legislation throwing our extradition laws into confusion?  Is it something more dangerous?  Is it something more insidious?  Is this requirement a subtle way of ensuring that, in respect of those who are no longer exempt from extradition &mdash; due to the political offence protection being removed by the Supreme Court and the situation &mdash; now being copperfastened by the coming into force of the Extradition Act, 1987, this political exemption will be revived by the Attorney General under the legal camouflage of insufficiency of evidence? If this provision is not to be used as a legalistic back door to surreptitiously reintroduce the political offence exemption, why is the Taoiseach so definite that it must be the Attorney General who performs this function?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that it is a matter of principle to him and it is a matter worth calling an election about for the Attorney General to exercise this function.  Yet we were told at the commencement of the Taoiseach's speech with regard to this measure that there were two essential tags to this Bill.  He said that the purpose of the Bill was to provide safeguards; to ensure that someone whose extradition was sought would <Col N="18" /> be prosecuted in a neighbouring jurisdiction, not merely held for questioning; and to ensure that there was a sufficiency of evidence against him.  The matter of principle should be the principle that there should be safeguards provided for Irish citizens if that is the concern of the Government.  That is where the principle lies.  Why is it a matter of principle that it is the Attorney General who determines that issue?  I do not understand how that is a matter of principle.  Why is it not the Director of Public Prosecutions or the District Court?  In the context of current extradition law, it is the District Court to which every person whose extradition is sought must go before they can be extradited following a warrant being received and an alleged offender being arrested by the Garda.  Why is it not the DPP or the District Court who have this function?  Is it because the DPP, as an individual, and the courts, in their constitutional function, are independent of the Government?</P>

      <P>Is it because the Attorney General has a constitutional role that he is appointed by the Taoiseach of the day. The Attorney General is, in effect, the Government's legal adviser.  He is the creature of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach can control what the Attorney General does.  The Attorney General is a political appointee who has certain independent constitutional functions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is the Taoiseach who has the right to hire and fire the Attorney General of the day.  The Taoiseach cannot fire the Director of Public Prosecutions and he cannot fire district justices.  Why is it that apparently there is this desire, as a matter of principle, to ensure that this ill-defined and unexplained power that is being conferred is a power exercised by the Attorney General rather than a power <Col N="19" /> exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions or a power exercised by the District Court?  It is very curious because in the context of a related provision in the Extradition Act the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Justice, made a very interesting comment.  What has been lost sight of in the debate to date is that the Minister for Justice, under Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965 &mdash; that Part of the Act which relates to extradition between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and this State &mdash; also exercises powers which are conferred on him by the Act but which so far as I now have never been exercised in practical terms.  Under the 1965 Extradition Act, the Minister for Justice can issue a direction to prohibit the extradition from this State of any person who he believes is being extradited for a political offence.  The Minister for Justice has an overriding power to do that under the 1965 Act and he can do it without reference to the courts.  Curiously it appears that even if the Supreme Court rules that someone can be extradited for an offence that the Supreme Court regards as not political the Minister, under the 1965 Act, can still stop that extradition because he regards an offence as political.  That is a power conferred on the Minister for Justice by the 1965 Act, just as this Bill confers a power on the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>In 1963 when the Extradition Bill was being debated, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, now the Taoiseach, referred to this power conferred on the Minister for Justice during the course of the Second Stage debate.  In the Offical Report of 29 January 1964 he said: &ldquo;The Bill speaks exclusively of the Minister for Justice&rdquo;, just as this Bill speaks exclusively of the Attorney General.He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...but in this regard the Minister for Justice would act only on the advice and instructions of the Government. When the Minister for Justice would decide that it either was or was not a political offence, that decision by the Minister for Justice would be taken on <Col N="20" /> the facts of any particular case coming before him.  In the case of any warrant coming for decision as to whether or not it should be endorsed for execution it would be taken on the facts of the case and in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be equally clear in this Bill that the Attorney General would be acting on the advice of the Government. Is that why this is a matter of principle and that it is the Attorney General who exercises these powers as opposed to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the courts?</P>
    <P>It is no secret that members of Fianna Fáil do not like the idea of extradition.  It is a curiosity that out of the 57 members who reportedly contributed to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting, a large proportion of them seemed to be talking about preventing any extradition at all. They appeared to be blissfully unaware and ignorant of the fact that, in effect, extradition has operated between this State, Great Britain and Northern Ireland since the foundation of the State and formally under legislation established since 1965 by this House.  Extradition to Britain or Northern Ireland of ordinary criminals is apparently of no concern to Fianna Fáil.  The ordinary criminal is not someone who excites the passions of the Fianna Fáil Party in the context of extradition.  It is the extradition of the super Republican heroes of the IRA, the Provos and the INLA that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and indeed Deputy Blaney and apparently others, do not like.  It is the extradition of the green men of violence to Great Britain or Northern Ireland that excites the political erogenous zones of members of Fianna Fáil to a climactic degree.  When this Bill is passed what will happen when those on the Fianna Fáil benches who find this area of extradition law unacceptable, who do not want to see the likes of members of the IRA extradited to Northern Ireland, raise that at a parliamentary party meeting and tell the Taoiseach he will lose their support unless the Attorney General is directed <Col N="21" /> not to allow the extradition of particular individuals?  I do not understand why the Taoiseach should leave himself a hostage to fortune in that way by conferring this power, if it is seriously meant, on the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>We are told that this Bill is being adopted to ensure, in the context of people extradited, that there is a clear intention to prosecute and to ensure that there is a sufficency of evidence.  The Taoiseach in his speech stated that since 1965, 733 people have been extradited from this State to Great Britain and 156 to Northern Ireland.  I challenge the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach to name those people extradited since 1965 who have not been prosecuted.  If the suggestion is that people are being extradited for purposes other than prosecutions, can they name how many of those numbers of people who have been extradited to Great Britain and Northern Ireland have not been prosecuted for the offences for which they have been extradited?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should also name those he believes have been extradited from this State where there has been an insufficiency of evidence for the purpose of processing a prosecution, because we are talking about bringing in safeguards which we are told are so urgent that this Bill has to be rushed through this House by Thursday evening.  These safeguards, if they are real, are apparently to ensure that the British authorities do not extradite people in circumstances where they do not intend to prosecute or to provide protection for Irish people against extradition where there is an insufficiency of evidence.  How many of the hundreds and hundreds of people who have been extradited pursuant to these arrangements since 1965, 900 approximately, have been extradited and not been prosecuted and which of these in recent years does the Taoiseach believe has been extradited due to an insufficiency of evidence?</P>
    <P>In the context of extradition, we have seen a number of cases in the past four years in which the courts have dealt with the issue of political offences. The McGlinchey and Shannon cases <Col N="22" /> have been referred to already in this debate.  In both of those instances people were extradited from this State for allegedly committing horrific crimes of murder.  Ultimately both people extradited were found not guilty by the Northern Ireland courts.  Is the Taoiseach saying that neither of those extraditions should have taken place because there was not a sufficiency of evidence?  Under this particular power how would the Attorney General have dealt with the extradition of Mr. McGlinchey and Mr. Shannon?  Would he have refused to extradite them or would he have extradited them?</P>
    <P>I ask the Government and in particular the Minister for Justice, if he intervenes in this debate before it closes, to state how he would specifically envisage the Attorney General exercising the powers conferred on him by this Bill in the McGlinchey case and the Shannon case, in which ultimately both people extradited were found not guilty.  If the Attorney General had extradited Mr. McGlinchey or Mr. Shannon and they had been found not guilty, in the context of his exercising the powers which this Bill confers, would he have had to resign? What would have been his position as the independent law officer of the State?</P>
    <P>This Bill introduces a dangerous and unnecessary procedure in the extradition process.  It is taking extradition out of the judicial and into the political domain. It has been argued by some that it is conferring a judicial power on the Attorney General and that may be the case.  The exercise of that power may ultimately be held to be unconstitutional and, indeed, that particular aspect of the Bill should be considered by the Supreme Court by way of a reference under Article 26 of the Constitution.  Not only is it conferring on the Attorney General a judicial function, or an apparent judicial function, but it is bringing extradition into a political domain in a way I believe will ultimately damage Anglo-Irish relations and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.It is providing a smoking gun or a political Exocet that will either deliberately or unintentionally torpedo the <Col N="23" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement, so successfully concluded at Hillsborough.  It will result, if the Attorney General exercises his powers in ongoing rows between the two jurisdictions over sufficiency of evidence.</P>
    <P>If the procedure is operated bona fide and someone accused of a terrorist offence is not extradited, a refusal to extradite would be regarded as this State harbouring terrorists.  A refusal by the Attorney General, who is seen to be a political appointee, will be used to justify the allegation by enemies of the State that we on this side of this island are harbouring terrorists.  It will provide the Unionists with a new stick to beat us and with the first coherent example of an unwillingness on this side of this island to co-operate in the extradition of those alleged to have committed horrific acts in Northern Ireland.  I am not saying that such a power could not also be misused or that such allegations could not also be made falsely if the DPP or the District Courts exercised the powers the Bill confers, but such charges would have no credibility where an independent public prosecutor or constitutionally independent courts exercise them.</P>
    <P>There are other curious elements in the Bill.  It provides that the Attorney General will report to the Government on the exercise of his powers.  Why should the Attorney General not report to the Dáil with provision in the Bill to enable a debate to take place on the contents of the report when the Attorney General's report is laid before the Dáil so that if the Attorney General ultimately operates these powers there is an accountability to the Dáil as to how these powers are operated.  It is unacceptable that they should be secret powers exercised behind closed doors in relation to which the Attorney General makes an annual secret report to the Government.  It is undesirable that the Attorney General should exercise these powers but if he exercises them it should be done only in the context of reporting to both Houses of the Oireachtas and not simply to the Government.  As the Bill is framed at present, the Attorney General's report <Col N="24" /> will be a secret report which, I assume, the Government will refuse to make publicly available or refer to the House on some spurious security grounds.</P>
    <P>Another curious provision in the Bill is the lapse of time provision.  There is a provision in the Bill which seeks to amend the Act that came into force at midnight whereby if, due to a lapse of time since an offence was committed as specified in the warrant the view is taken that it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to deliver someone up pursuant to a warrant, they will not be delivered up.  Curiously, in 1965 Deputy Lenihan the then Minister for Justice, refused to insert such a provision in the 1965 Extradition Act.  What happens if in five years time those who are the perpetrators of the horrific bombing in Enniskillen are tracked down in this State and warrant is issued?  Will this power be used whereby someone will say five years later that it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite them?</P>
    <P>It is alleged that the Birmingham Six are not guilty of the offences for which they have been convicted.  That matter is currently before the Court of Appeal in England and I am not going to comment on it beyond asking: what happens if after this Bill is passed other people emerge in this State who are the perpetrators of the horrors of the bombing in Birmingham for whom the British seek an extradition warrant?  Will this provision be used to say that it was unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite them at that stage? This provision, about which there has been little comment, introduces another unnecessary element into the legislation, something which was rejected years ago in the context of the Extradition Bill, 1965.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude, a Cheann Comhairle, by listing what I see as all of the objections to this Bill.  First, it may be unconstitutional.  Second, it would provide, if operated in the way the Government intend, a new barrier to extradition. It will undermine the original purpose of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It could undermine the credibility of our judicial <Col N="25" /> process in that there is an implicit suggestion in the Bill that the judges cannot be trusted to exercise the powers conferred on the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it undermines the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions because, apparently, he cannot be trusted to exercise these power either.  It introduces unnecessary uncertainty and ambiguity into an area in which we should be seeking greater certainty and efficiency.  It poses a threat to the constitutional role of the Attorney General in that he could be subject to political direction on a legal matter and find himself in an untenable position.  It introduces a differentiation in the extradition process between this State and the United Kingdom with regard to terrorist activities which does not exist and will not exist under the Suppression of Terrorism Act in the context of the extradition of those to mainland Europe pursuant to the Act which came into force on midnight last night.  It is a wholly undesirable, ill-conceived and badly drafted measure to release the Taoiseach from a political hook upon which he impaled himself 12 months ago.  It is a measure which should be reconsidered, and not rushed through this House to be completed this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The events of recent weeks have created a deep anxiety in the public mind about the whole question of the security of the State, the safety of the lives of the people who live on this island and the general attitude to those who engage in acts of violence and subversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any one of these events &mdash; the appalling bombing of the Remembrance Day ceremony at Enniskillen, the desperate acts of the kidnappers of Dr. O'Grady, the seizure of the <i>Eksund</i> and the information that a substantial quantity of deadly weaponry may already have reached our shores &mdash; would have raised the most serious questions in people's minds.  When considered together, there is clearly a need for a response.  We owe a debt of thanks to our security forces for their successes in this period.  Tackling gunmen who are well-equipped and do <Col N="26" /> not hesitate in the slightest to use their weapons is no easy task in any jurisdiction.The achievements of our security forces are all the more remarkable and courageous because the great majority of our gardaí remain unarmed.</P>
    <P>These events have seized not only our consciousness, they have attracted attention throughout the world.  It is vitally important that we should leave absolutely no room for doubt that we are determined in our opposition to terrorist violence and that we will take every lawful step within our power to end it.</P>
    <P>Since independence, Ireland has been proud to participate in the community of nations.  The impact of our contribution to the development of international relations is out of all proportion to our size and importance.  In the particular area of European affairs, Ireland has been a founder member of the Council of Europe under whose auspices the Convention on Extradition of 1957 and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism of 1977 were drawn up and agreed for signature.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is also the sponsor of the Convention on Human Rights which may be regarded as the strongest international instrument yet devised for the protection of human rights.  What these separate Conventions show is that our security and our rights are closely bound together.  In a democracy we must be as mindful of one as of the other.</P>
    <P>The process of democracy will not stand of its own accord.  By its nature it needs support and needs to be defended from attack.  We support democracy when we vote.  We also support democracy when we endorse the efforts of the lawfully elected Government of the day to deal resolutely with the threat which violence poses to us all, and in particular to democratic Government.  I believe the Government deserve the support of the Dáil for our decision that the Extradition (Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 should commence today as envisaged in the Act itself, but that it should be amended to provide safeguards for our citizens in this new situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Extradition has long been a method which the European states have used to fight serious crime and we ourselves have been a party to the European Convention on Extradition for over 20 years.  We implemented the Convention by means of the Extradition Act, 1965 which as Minister for Justice I introduced in this House.  Section 11 of the Act states that extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  It has been for the courts to interpret that clause and it has always been within the right of the courts to place such restrictions as they thought fit on the meaning of political offence or an offence connected with a political offence, with one exception, which is the taking or attempted taking of the life of the Head of State or a member of his or her family.  This offence was explicitly excluded from the meaning of political offence in the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the courts have taken the view that certain violent offences should not come within the exception of a political offence and have proceeded to order extradition in a number of cases. The views of other countries towards the political offence exception have been changing likewise.  This change is reflected in the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism 1977, which has now been ratified by all states of the Council of Europe except Greece, Malta and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The political exception provided for in the Extradition Act of 1965 reflected the norms of international law at that time. These norms are not static.  They change and have been changing progressively in this particular matter of the political exception in regard to extradition.  I would not, however, wish to give the impression that our reaction to recent events would have been different in 1965. Far from it.  Twenty years ago we lived in simpler and much less violent times.  If anything, our sense of shock would have been far greater.  I think we can be certain that, in providing for an almost unlimited political exception in 1965, the Houses of <Col N="28" /> the Oireachtas did not envisage that the violence we have witnessed subsequently on this island, and particularly in recent weeks, should come under the cloak of justifiable political action.</P>
    <P>In the past two decades, violent political movements have emerged using methods in furtherance of their objectives which would have been just as appalling to the honourable men and women who fought for Irish freedom in the past as they are to us.  There are people in our midst who have shown that no act is too brutal or consequence too awful if they think that it will serve to advance or make propaganda for their campaign.  Neither age, nor sex, nor occupation is a concern to these people.</P>
    <P>Our security forces are co-operating fully with the security forces in the North to try to ensure that those responsible for murder and other violent crimes in Northern Ireland are brought to justice. Equally, I know that the security forces north of the Border are assisting us in every way possible to ensure that those who commit similar actions here are brought to justice.  The capture of the <i>Eksund</i> and its cargo shows the extent of the danger and the conspiracy we are all faced with.</P>
    <P>The recent appalling events occurred as a decision faced us in regard to the commencement of the Extradition (Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act 1987.  I must tell the Dáil that the Government are satisfied that if the Houses of the Oireachtas had proceeded, following the extraordinary events or recent weeks, to prevent the ratification of a Convention which nearly all of our neighbours in Europe have ratified, our action would not be understood.  It would not be understood by our European friends and partners whose co-operation in the capture of the <i>Eksund</i> we gratefully acknowledge.  It would not be understood by other friendly governments.  It would not be understood in Britain.  It would not be understood by very many on both sides in Northern Ireland.  Most important of all, it would not be understood by the people we represent in this House.  I am satisfied that there would be outrage <Col N="29" /> in both parts of this island if we did not proceed.</P>
    <P>What is the background to the European Convention on Terrorism which the present Act has incorporated into our domestic law?  The Convention represents an attempt by the member states of the Council of Europe to join together in combating the new forms of terrorist violence which have arisen throughout Europe.  It is not intended just to deal with violence which is committed in opposition to a European Government in power: it is also intended to come to grips with acts whose roots lie outside Europe &mdash; in for example, the Middle East.  That is why Article I of the Convention provides that certain offences shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives, and shall, therefore be extraditable.These offences include specifically the hijacking of an aircraft, an attack on the life or the liberty of an internationally protected person, kidnapping or the taking of a hostage, the commission of an offence involving the use of a terrorist-type weapon such as a bomb, a letter or parcel bomb, a grenade, a rocket, or an automatic firearm, or the commission of any such offence or participation in it as an accomplice. Article 2 of the Convention enables state parties to consider other violent offences to be also outside the political exception in certain defined circumstances.</P>
    <P>The members of the Council of Europe have agreed in principle therefore, that the Article I offences at least shall not be regarded as in any way justifiable and that other violent offences may also be considered unjustifiable.  That is essentially what the Act which commenced today provides.</P>
    <P>It was recognised when this Act was being considered in the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 1986 and January 1987 that its unusual commencement provision had to do with a recognition at that time that sufficient progress had not been made on the issue of public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland to warrant <Col N="30" /> commencement of the Act immediately. It is clear from the text of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and from the text of the accompanying communiqué that it was recognised by both Governments in 1985 that there was a problem of public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and in the related area of the operations of the security forces.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that progress has been made.  We welcome, for example, the ending of the supergrass trials which were such a controversial feature of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland in recent years.  That certainly represents progress over the situation which obtained prior to the agreement when cases involving many defendants, facing charges which were frequently unrelated in time or place, were still being considered over long periods of time by a single judge, largely on the basis of the uncorroborated evidence of a supergrass.</P>
    <P>We particularly welcome the changes made to the public order legislation in the North this year and the efforts which we have seen in the recent marching season to police marches, parades and other events in a more effective and fair way.  There is still some way to go to secure public safety during the period of the marches and to implement the principle that parades and marches should not be permitted where local residents do not accept them.  It is fair to say, however, that progress has been made and we welcome and acknowledge it.  I believe we can acknowledge the changes which have been made to emergency legislation.  For example, to require &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; as a basis for arrest, to transfer the onus from the defence to the prosecution in the important area of bail and to better guard against the admission of confession evidence obtained by the threat of violence. A code of conduct for the RUC has also been introduced.  These matters all represent worthwhile progress and there are other matters, which I have not mentioned here, in which we also see merit.</P>
    <P>A number of these changes seek to put right problems which should not have <Col N="31" /> been allowed to arise in the first place. However, they represent an improvement from the point of the view of the population in the North &mdash; in particular the minority population &mdash; and they are obviously welcome and desirable.  We will, of course, be actively and strongly pursuing all of these matters with the British Government with a view to obtaining further progress in the provisions and operation of emergency legislation, in the administration of justice, in relations between the security forces and the community, in the area of prisons and in other areas where the rights of persons need to be strengthened.  That will be an ongoing process under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat the suggestion made by the Taoiseach that we in each jurisdiction, withour reflection on either system, might do well to initiate a formal study of the special arrangements for handling terrorist cases in both jurisdictions to serve as a basis for further discussion between both Governments. The courts in Northern Ireland and the special court system here were, of course, set up many years ago to deal with what was then thought to be a short-lived campaign of terrorist violence.  That assessment has not proved to be correct.  In the circumstances, I would see much merit in the proposed study to ensure that our courts are put on a footing in the medium and long term to deal as democratic courts with the terrorist menace.</P>
    <P>I should also wish to emphasise that the Government share the widespread concern about certain cases in Britain dating from the seventies where there is reason to believe that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.  However, in the light of the current hearing before the Appeal Court in the case of the Birmingham Six I would prefer not to make any further comment on this aspect at this time.</P>
    <P>There is a determination, I believe, in the minds and hearts of our people that those who commit the terrible deeds of which I spoke earlier should be brought to justice.  But there is an understandable <Col N="32" /> hesitation also about sending people out of the jurisdiction to be tried elsewhere. Those feelings exist in every country, and not least in Great Britain.  They exist very strongly here.  They exist even between countries which have no political problem in their relationship remotely comparable to the problem of Northern Ireland.  In giving effect to the new Extradition Act, therefore, we are also acutely conscious of the need to ensure that proper safeguards exist for any of our citizens who may be subject to extradition.</P>
    <P>In practice, citizens who have been extradited, have been extradited to Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is so because there has been no bar on the return of citizens of one jurisdiction to the other, which is not the case in Europe generally.  It is also important to note that we have had a backing of warrants arrangement with Britain which is different from our arrangement with other European states.  That arrangement, whatever it once reflected, now reflects the unique relationship between Britain and Ireland; that is a fact of life.  I do not think it would be advisable to establish a new and more elaborate extradition arrangement at this point in Anglo-Irish co-operation, not just because it would lessen our capacity to act against terrorism, but because it would seriously inhibit the further development of our relations.  However, as I have said the restriction of the political exception, brought into effect by the commencement of the Act today, does in my view require safeguards in the administration of the arrangement.</P>
    <P>First, let me say that the Act which commenced today does not replace the existing legislation in the Extradition Act, 1965.  It amends that legislation for the purposes of limiting the scope of the political offence in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Convention which comes into operation today.  The role of out courts which is already stronger in the operation of our extradition system than is generally the case among our European neighbours will be in no way diminished.  All the procedures which are required under the 1965 Act in cases of <Col N="33" /> extradition are retained.  Any person whose return is requested will still be able to appeal to the courts and to contest the extradition request.  The Act itself, in addition, makes provision that there is no obligation to extradite if a person can show that he or she would be prosecuted or punished on account of race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that his or her position might be prejudiced for any of these reasons.  There is already a reciprocal provision in the British legislation.</P>
    <P>Extradition cases, therefore, will continue to be decided by the courts on their merits and there is a safeguard for occasions where there is a question mark about a fair trial.  The only cases in which there will be an obligation not to regard an offence as a political offence are the cases specifically provided for in the Extradition Act, 1987, pursuant to Article 1 of the Convention.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, of course, that there is concern about the adequacy of the evidence which may lie behind a warrant for the return of a fugitive.  First, let me say that it is the general expectation in Europe that in cases where a warrant is presented for the return of a person who is found within one jurisdiction, the evidence available to the requesting authorities in the other is sufficient to mount a prosecution.  That expectation lies behind the Convention on Extradition of 1957 which dispensed with the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  I should add, of course, that the fact that there is evidence which is sufficient to mount a prosecution, does not mean there is evidence which will secure a conviction.  There is a vital difference here which needs to be made clear.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise, however, the public concern in this area.  For legal reasons it is not practical to respond to this concern by the introduction of a requirement to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case in our courts.  At the same time, the present Bill will provide an alternative statutory safeguard which, in my view, will meet the problem in a satisfactory and positive way.</P>
    <P>This important alternative safeguard <Col N="34" /> will mean that the Attorney General, the legal adviser to the Government, will form an opinion himself, having considered such information that he deems appropriate, that there exists a clear intention to prosecute and that this intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  As the Taoiseach has said, it is the Attorney General's intendion to operate this procedure as efficiently and with as little complication as possible, while providing the necessary safeguards for the person whose extradition is sought.  I believe the Attorney General is the appropriate person to consider every case.  By doing so he will also be in a position to monitor the new arrangements and will report to the Government annually.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise &mdash; and I do this in response to Deputy Shatter &mdash; that the role of the Attorney General will not be a substitute for the present role of the courts.  It will be an additional safeguard in the matter of evidence.</P>
    <P>Under Article 30 of the Constitution the Attorney General is the adviser to the Government in matters of law and legal opinion.  The Supreme Court in the case of McLoughlin <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare, 1955 Irish Reports, p.17, Judge Kingsmill Moore J. has said:</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Attorney General is in no way a servant of the Government but is put into an independent position... While he is in office he holds and, if he is to do his duty and discharge his responsibilities, he must hold an independent position. He is specifically excluded from being a member of the Government, which again underlines his independent position.</P>
    <P>That judgment arose from the judge's very positive interpretation of the role of the Attorney General, who is specifically written into Article 30 of the Constitution as the single, most important law officer of the State.  The Government have also introduced important safeguards in the Bill in relation to the possible addition of further charges after extradition and to the issue of retrospection.  These, we <Col N="35" /> believe, respond fully to the concerns of public opinion on these issues.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise also to the House that the Government will be keeping the present Act under constant review.  If it appears to us that its arrangements need to be modified in any particular way, in order to respond to deficiencies which may emerge, We will not hesitate to take whatever action is required.</P>
    <P>We have a political framework with Great Britain which provides us with the means of promoting our objectives by peaceful means.  The Anglo-Irish process which the Taoiseach initiated with the British Prime Minister in December 1980 involves the advancement of our relations by constructive and peaceful means.  I believe the new extradition arrangement will strengthen that framework and bring new vitality to the relationship established between the two Governments. Those of us with political responsibility, North and South, must not let this opportunity slip.  It is time for an act of faith in the relationships on and between these islands.</P>
    <P>To paraphrase what the Taoiseach said at Bodenstown, it is incomprehensible that, when leaders of a divided Germany can meet and talk together, the two communities on this island, who have shared and suffered so much in common together, should still remain at arms length one from the other.  This should and must not be allowed to continue.  For the sake of all the people on this island, therefore, let all of us who are in a position to influence events resolve to ensure that next year marks the beginning of a new period of reconciliation, of dialogue and of political development in Ireland as a whole, North and South.  In the light of recent tragedies, this would surely be an objective which would be worthy of all those who have lost their lives in the futility of the last two decades of violence on this island.</P>
    <P>In this spirit, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, from the <Col N="36" /> start, to outline the Progressive Democrats' approach to the whole issue of extradition and, in particular, this new Bill which was so hurriedly prepared for the Dáil last week.</P>
      <P>We are unambiguously in favour of extradition for serious criminal offences between democratic countries.  We have no principled objection to allowing the Extradition Act, 1987, to come into effect from today.  We are concerned, however, about legal safeguards for Irish citizens extradited to Britain and Northern Ireland.  We want to see a workable and safe extradition process being agreed by the Dáil arising from this debate.  We believe that the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, fails on these two counts.  It provides no real safeguard and, by putting a private barrier into the Bill, it could make extradition unworkable. Furthermore, we believe that the Taoiseach has been wrong in his whole attitude to the extradition issue since he came into office last February.</P>
      <P>He told the Independent Deputy, Neil Blaney, during talks about the formation of a Fianna Fáil Government last March that he would allow the Extradition Act of 1986 &ldquo;to wither away&rdquo;&mdash; as Deputy Blaney so graphically stated in the Dáil last Friday.  The Taoiseach assured the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at his first Anglo-Irish meeting in June that the Extradition Act would take effect from December.</P>
      <P>Following the concern expressed by my party, and other Opposition parties, in September that the Government were not pursuing the link between the coming into force of the Extradition Act and changes in the administration of justice in the North, under Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Government changed their mind again.  They sought the respectable cover from the Opposition parties to allow for the postponement of extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strategy was revealed when the Taoiseach, through his Press Secretary, accused Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats of being unduly influenced by &ldquo;the over and above the normal level of <Col N="37" /> activity&rdquo; by the British Ambassador in their attitude to extradition.  The Progressive Democrats, at that stage, saw that the Government were looking for every excuse to postpone the implementation of the Extradition Act and do untold damage to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>It was after the atrocity at Enniskillen, the kidnapping of John O'Grady and the <i>Eksund</i> arms find destined for this country last month that the Taoiseach in his own words in his speech last Friday, noted and I quote: &ldquo;The impact on public opinion has been profound, a mixture of anger, revulsion and sorrow and a deep underlying anxiety about what our society is facing in these disturbed times&rdquo;. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, said today that there was clearly a need for a response.  The response to the horrible crimes last month is the reason for the Government bringing the Extradition Act into force from today.  The Extradition Act, 1987 implementing Ireland's ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism has come into effect from midnight.</P>
    <P>The Government's twists and turns on the whole issue of extradition highlight the background against which the Taoiseach has brought forward the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987 into this House for hasty debate and decision this week.  This Bill of so-called safeguards has much more to do with placating the 57 outspoken backbenchers in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party than it has to do with providing proper and workable legal safeguards for the Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had approached this issue consistently from the start, we believe that the Government could have taken the opportunity to consolidate the whole extradition code in this country. It dates back, in principle, to the Petty Sessions Act of 1851 and was based on the assumption that Ireland was a sub jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.  The main extradition law in this country dates back to 1965.  In the meantime, we have acceded to two international conventions &mdash; the Convention on Extradition in 1957 and now the European <Col N="38" /> Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.The Government missed a golden opportunity to consolidate the whole extradition process with all civilised democratic countries in a new Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Government did not want to standardise our extradition code with all democratic countries, they could have taken the opportunity, in the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to negotiate a proper bilateral treaty with the British Government.</P>
    <P>The two Government's could have sat down together, within the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference, to work out a bilateral extradition treaty along the lines of the Irish-American Treaty of 1983 or the British-American Treaty from around the same date.</P>
    <P>None of these things was done in a planned way because of the Government manoeuvrings on extradition all year. The Taoiseach, instead, came into this House last Friday with a hastily cobbled together safeguards Bill with the primary aim of satisfying his own backbenchers.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, fails on two counts.  It proposes to give the Attorney General the discretion to direct that an extradition order shall not be endorsed.  We have taken legal advice on this proposal and we are firmly of the view that it will be struck down as unconstitutional.  It brings the Attorney General into the domain of exercising a judicial power.  This he is not entitled to do.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if the Attorney General is only exercising an automatic administrative power &mdash; and the Taoiseach kept referring to the word &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; in his speech &mdash; the Attorney General is being given the power to exercise no real safeguards.</P>
    <P>I now come to the nub of the safeguard matter.  The proposal that the Attorney General should have an intervening power is an illusory safeguard.  The Bill does not require the submission of warrants to the Attorney General.  Therefore, it is open to the Garda Commissioner to endorse a warrant without reference to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> This raises four extremely important points about the alleged safeguards being introduced by the Government: (a) there is no requirement that the Garda Commissioner refer a warrant to the Attorney General; (b) there is no requirement that the Attorney General consider every case; (c) there is a presumption that if a direction is not given by the Attorney General it was not required to be given, and, (d) since there is no obligation to refer to the Attorney General but, presumably, some cases will be referred to him, who decides that any case will go before the Attorney General?</P>
    <P>Is it the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice who will decide which extradition cases go before the Attorney General?  Is it appropriate that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice should be the person to make such a decision in the light of certain events in 1982?</P>
    <P>The House will recall that in 1982, with or without the connivance of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice took certain steps in relation to certain matters without the knowledge of the Cabinet. Will the same thing now happen on extradition cases?</P>
    <P>Will this proposed power now being given to the Attorney General and dressed up as a safeguard for Fianna Fáil backbenchers mean that people well disposed to this Administration will get their cases reviewed whereas those of a different political colour will not have them reviewed?</P>
    <P>The Government have drawn up this Bill in such a convoluted manner that it is difficult to get around the treble negatives and assess the full implications of the Bill.  I would ask the Government to clarify during this debate who will decide whether a case will go before the Attorney General.  This is an extremely important point.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the substance of the Bill. The Bill, in essence, purports to provide that the Attorney General should be the person who will evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence in each case for an extradition warrant to be endorsed for Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Leaving aside the constitutionality of this matter, Progressive Democrats contend that the Attorney General is not the correct person to make such an evaluation.He is, after all, the politicallyappointed legal adviser to the Government of the day.  He would be subject to hire and fire at the whim of the Taoiseach and Government of the day.  He would be open to representations and lobbying from Ministers and Deputies in this House.  And, after all of that, he is supposed to exercise in secret his new function on the sensitive issue of extradition.</P>
    <P>We believe that even if the Attorney General could enter into the judicial domain, he is not the proper person to be exercising a safeguard in secret.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, we are opposed to the giving of extra powers &mdash; which we believe to be unconstitutional &mdash; to the Attorney General in this Bill.  We will be voting accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have devoted a great deal of time to examining the implications of this Bill.  We are in favour of safeguards.  We believe that workable extradition and legal safeguards are both absolute requirements. They impose on us the fulfilling of duties to our own citizens and to other countries as well.  We do not believe that the Government have struck the correct balance.</P>
    <P>This party proposed that a full <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be inserted as a safeguard into the Extradition Act last year.  We now understand, in the light of the actions of two successive Governments, that to do so unilaterally would damage relations with Britain and would be outside the ambit of the Convention on Extradition which we ratified 30 years ago.  This desirable objective cannot, therefore, be attained unilaterally at this late stage.  It could well, however, have formed an essential part of a bilateral arrangement with Britain if this matter had been addressed prudently from the start of this year.  That cannot now happen.</P>
    <P>In the light of this situation, we, as a parliamentary party, spent a considerable time examining safeguards that <Col N="41" /> would make extradition workable so that we, the country most affected by terrorism in Europe, could ratify the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. We came up, in the end, with the only workable formula.</P>
    <P>We think that, short of the full-blown <i>prima facie</i> requirement, the most desirable safeguard to protect the liberty of the citizen who is being extradited is along the lines of that contained in the two treaties negotiated between Ireland and America and Britain and America a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The Washington Treaty of 1983 provides, in section 4, that when the request for an extradition relates to a person who has not been convicted, it shall also be supported by the original or an authenticated copy of the warrant of arrest, or equivalent order, issued by a competent authority of the requesting State; by the original or an authenticated copy of the complaint, information or indictment; and in the case of a request emanating from Ireland, by a statement of fact, by way of affidavit or statutory declaration, setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed and that the person sought committed it.</P>
    <P>Our proposal for a real, workable legal safeguard, therefore, is that the defendant should be allowed to go before a district justice, in open court and that the district justice would be supplied with a short set of facts from the country requesting the extradition.  It would not be required to produce the full book of evidence as would be the case with <i>prima facie</i>.  The person concerned would not be allowed to call witnesses so our proposal would not obstruct the extradition process or make it unworkable.  At the same time, it would allow the person sought for extradition to go before an open court in this country and avail of a judicial process.  That is infinitely preferable to a secret arrangement with an Attorney General.</P>
    <P>This proposal is workable and could have been accepted by the British, in the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, had it been on the agenda of the <Col N="42" /> conference earlier this year.  The proposal is already contained in a treaty which the British themselves negotiated with the USA.  It has the advantage of retaining the matter before the district justice who would be the person making the order for extradition anyway.  We have struck the right balance between a real safeguard for the citizen and workable extradition which will allow us to fulfil our obligations to the international community.The Government can still do likewise, given time.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the proposal from the Fine Gael Party that the Director of Public Prosecutions should evaluate warrants instead of the Attorney General.The DPP is an independent civil servant of the State who is not open to the same representations and political pressure as a short term political appointee.  But, the proposal to have the DPP instead of the Attorney General would run into the same constitutional problems: a non-judge would be exercising judicial powers.  For reasons of constitutionality, we are opposed to it.  It is a short-sighted proposal which will not overcome the basic difficulty which we have pointed out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, or the DPP, as non-judicial persons cannot exercise judicial powers.  The difficulties with giving the DPP this power cannot get over the inherent invalidity of asking a non-judicial person to perform a judicial function.  We will oppose the Fine Gael proposal to alter the words &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; in the Bill and substitute &ldquo;Director of Public Prosecutions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would now like to set this new Bill in the context of current Anglo-Irish relations.  The accession of this country to the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism is linked in Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to certain unspecified changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland. This link is also evident in paragraph 7 of the joint communiqué issued by the two Heads of Government the day that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed at <Col N="43" /> Hillsborough.  We have fulfilled our obligations set out in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and I now call on the British Government to act, with understanding, to fulfil their obligation.</P>
    <P>It was difficult for this party, in the light of the statement made by me at our National Conference in early October that we would postpone the coming into force of the Extradition Act if there were not changes in the administration of justice, to take the decision we are taking today.  Ireland has now acceded to the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism since midnight.  We, in the Progressive Democrats, made a fundamental judgment that we would do more damage to the Anglo-Irish Agreement by not acceding to the Convention that we would by acceding to it and placing the moral obligation on the British to come forward with more changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have made a mature judgment and we trust that the British will bear this in mind at future meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We will be encouraging the Government to press the British Government to reciprocate by taking a fundamental look at the working of the courts and the justice system in the North in the near future.  I appeal to the Government to look again at the Bill which they have brought so hurriedly before the Dáil.  It is fundamentally flawed.  That has been made clear by speakers from the Opposition parties.  The safeguard this Bill proports to provide is illusory.  It is noteworthy that the two Departments most concerned with the preparation of the Bill, the Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice, could not provide officials to give the technical briefing on the Bill to political correspondences last week.  This task had to be done from outside the House.  This is a sorry comment on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dáil can produce better safeguards as it goes through the various Stages of this Bill.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and Government to draw on the consensus among speakers on each <Col N="44" /> side of the House and change the proposal for an evaluation by the Attorney General.  If this proposal is unconstitutional &mdash; and we believe it is &mdash; the whole extradition process to Britain and Northern Ireland could be struck down in the courts with it.  This Bill is inextricably woven into section 3 of the 1965 Act.  If it is unconstitutional, the whole extradition procedure to Britain and Northern Ireland would collapse with it.  In that way, the Taoiseach would end up fulfilling his promise made to Deputy Blaney last March that &ldquo;extradition will wither away&rdquo;.  That outcome would be catastrophic for this country in the current climate.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach and the Government will reflect again in the interests of providing real safeguards for Irish citizens.In the event that the Government persist with the Bill in its present form, I hope the President will refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for an evaluation.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this debate is taking place against an unparalleled background of violence and brutality.  This is taking place against a background which includes the massacre at Enniskillen, the mutilation of Dr. O'Grady and an attempt to import 150 tons of arms into this country, with allegations that four other arms shipments had already arrived here.  This background quite rightly produces a massive wave of revulsion and hostility towards the people committing such outrages. Against such a background it is difficult to plead for safeguards and for civil liberties.Many people feel that hanging would be too good for people guilty of such crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extradition is perceived as a weapon in the fight against terrorism and many people feel that all weapons available must be used in that fight.  Opinion polls have reflected public concern in recent times.  Of course, the answers given in opinion polls are valid only in the context of the questions asked.  With extradition being perceived as a purely legal means of fighting terrorism, it is hardly surprising that a majority of people favour it.  If the <Col N="45" /> question asked did not refer to &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; but referred to handing people over to the courts which convicted the Birmingham Six, it is unlikely that there would be the same response.</P>
    <P>I have personally encountered people, reputable, intelligent, concerned, lawabiding citizens who are in favour of extradition but against handing persons over to the RUC or to British courts. I see that as what I would describe as perception, symbol politics, totally unrelated to real politics.  It is an unfortunate ambiguity in people's minds but it exists. While public opinion will oscillate, inevitably and understandably, in the light of the most recent atrocity or latest miscarriage of justice, there is a duty on us here in this House to consider the whole complex question logically and dispassionately.</P>
    <P>Extradition is the means whereby civilised countries prevent their territories becoming a haven for fugitive criminals from other jurisdictions.  The need for extradition predated terrorism.  It is as necessary to prevent our country becoming a safe haven for drug pushers or thieves as it is to prevent it becoming a safe haven for terrorists.</P>
    <P>Extradition is always a two-way process.One could hardly expect another country to expend its resources on capturing and returning persons wanted here unless we were willing to reciprocate. Without international willingness to enter into and enforce extradition arrangements, the ease with which international travel can now be undertaken would ensure that crime would almost always pay.  Therefore, to suggest that there should be no extradition as an emotional reaction to some miscarriage of justice in a country with which we have an extradition agreement, as at present, is both deliberately missing the point and dangerous.  To call for &ldquo;no extradition&rdquo; is, in fact, to call for a withdrawal from the community of civilised nations.</P>
    <P>However, to extradite a person is a very serious process which should not be lightly undertaken.  In this country we value the liberty of the individual and protect it under the Constitution.  Under <Col N="46" /> our system of law a person cannot be remanded in custody by our District Court for a period greater than one week without his or her consent, or a District Court will not send an accused person forward for trial to the Circuit Court on bail, let alone in custody, unless it is satisfied there is sufficient evidence against him or her to justify that step.  For serious offences it is necessary, before a prosecution is undertaken, that the Director of Public Prosecutions or, in some cases the Attorney General, is satisfied that there is a case against the accused.</P>
    <P>The extradition of any person involves placing him or her outside the jurisdiction and protection of our courts, handing him or her into the custody of a police force, into the power of courts over which we have no control and which are not restricted by the safeguards provided in our Constitution.  It is an ultimate step.  Once a person has been handed over there can be no changing of minds as far as he or she is concerned.  Should that trust implicitly reposed by us in that foreign police force and those foreign courts not be honoured it might teach us a lesson but it would be of little consolation to the person at whose expense the lesson was learned.</P>
    <P>The proponents of easy extradition are as mistaken as the opponents of any extradition.  Easy extradition has about as much merit as capital punishment.  The &ldquo;beam them up Scottie&rdquo; school of extradition is about as plausible as the &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; brigade.  Where extradition is concerned our duty is to strike the right balance between international obligations and our respect for civil liberties.We must not become a haven for those guilty of crime committed abroad. Neither can we deny any Irish citizen alleged to have committed offences abroad an equivalent degree of protection as that to which he would be entitled had the alleged crime been committed in Ireland.  This is effectively true today; apart from the direct victims of their murderous violence the Provisional IRA have other victims to their credit.</P>
    <P>There are countless innocent Irish <Col N="47" /> people living in Britain who are, by virtue of birth, immediately suspect in the wake of any IRA bombing campaign on that island.  The whole population of the Six Counties is and has to be denied the right to jury trial by virtue of the activities of the IRA and the loyalist murder operators.The Diplock courts are most definitely unsatisfactory, particularly in their one-man format, but trial by jury in the present climate may not be an alternative.One only has to look at the trials by jury of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven to see the reason therefor.  None would suggest that the perpetrators of the Birmingham Six pub bombings or the Enniskillen massacre should have a safe haven on this part of the island.  On the other hand it would be clearly appalling if, on the basis simply of a warrant alleging such an offence, any Irish citizen were handed over to face such a trial as that which convicted the Birmingham Six.  There has to be safeguards.It is simply unacceptable that we are willing, on the basis of the law as it stands at present, to send any Irish citizen anywhere on any old basis.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are intended to provide safeguards.  If enacted, our extradition process will be commenced only if the highest law officer in the land is satisfied that those requesting a person's extradition have a clear intention of prosecuting, as opposed to interrogating, and that there is sufficient evidence against him or her to justify that extradition.Those who attack this proposal on the grounds that it will complicate the extradition process are, in fact saying that an Irish citizen, alleged to have committed crimes abroad, has none of the rights he or she would have if the offence was alleged to have been committed here.  It is my respectful opinion that such a view is unworthy of serious consideration.On the other hand, there has also been criticism expressed about the proposed role of the Attorney General, it being construed as giving him a judicial or extra judicial role and that, therefore, his role would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> I have heard my respected constituency colleague, Deputy Geraldine Kennedy, make the case on behalf of her party.  She is absolutely entitled to make the case she has made but I would suggest that the law is about interpretation, that illegal actions are about plaintiffs and defendants, the accused and the prosecution.There is always that tension between the legal advice she has received on the one hand and that I am about to place on the record of the House.  She may be right: on the other hand, the legal advice at my disposal may be correct.  In the final analysis she may have a very good point in having the suggestion made that the case should be referred to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.Before the State or anybody else goes to that expense I might draw the attention of the House and anybody else interested to the views expressed by Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, Senior Counsel &mdash; a leading constitutional lawyer &mdash; in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 29 November 1987 when he spoke about the intent of the Bill:</P>
    <P>...In a sense, this may be a stronger protection than having the matter considered by a court; a court can act only on the documents that are before it. The Attorney General will have other means of checking the facts and the background to the case.</P>
    <P>Under a caption &ldquo;Safeguards of new Act&rdquo; he had this to say:</P>
    <P>He scrutinises all cases and, thus, a dossier is built up; trends can be observed and this may have advantages over a situation where cases may be heard by distirct justices throughout the country and who, as I have said, would be confined to the particular documents put before them.  It has to be said, too, that the new Act provides additional safeguards.  All the old safeguards that the matter has to go before the District Court; that the suspect's rights have to be explained to him; his right to repair to the High Court to seek <i>habeas corpus</i>&mdash; all these are preserved.  The argument that the <Col N="49" /> Attorney General's role is unconstitutional&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is the point:</P>
    <P>&mdash;would seem to be without foundation since the Supreme Court has held in the Shannon case that there is no constitutional need for the legislation to provide for a <i>prime facie</i> case. The legislation is experimental&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;another very good point made by this leading barrister:</P>
    <P>&mdash;but it is worth a try.  If it does not prove satisfactory, then something else can be tried.</P>
    <P>There are two schools of thought in this &mdash; first, that there should be no safeguards and, secondly, that there should be safeguards. We have to provide safeguards. It is very difficult for me to understand, having been across the Border on many occasions, involved in elections on behalf of my good friend, Séamus Mallon of the SDLP during the past number of years and having found the temper and feeling of the legal unrealities in the Six Counties, that anybody would want to extradite a person from this jurisdiction to that jurisdiction without safeguards.  On the other hand, I have had relatively close associations with the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain.  I wish to pay particular tribute to its President, Mr. Séamus McGarry, an Irishman who should be given some recognition by the Government for the work he is doing on behalf of our people in Britain.  He is doing a magnificent job and is giving great leadership, a balanced, good, decent leadership of the very highest integrity, to the Irish population in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have also been involved with various cases, including the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Annie Maguire case.  I know that those cases have nothing to do with extradition because they occurred in the British jurisdiction but, at the same time, I could not envisage an extradition from this jurisdiction to the British jurisdiction without safeguards.The British are at present trying to drop the <i>prima facie</i> element.  They <Col N="50" /> made an effort to railroad the Bill through the British House of Lords in the past three or four weeks when their Lordships in their wisdom quietly suggested that the <i>prima facie</i> element should be retained in the legislation before them.  Obviously the proposing Lord, on behalf of the British Government, withdrew it quietly and presumably went back to No. 10 Downing Street for further instructions.</P>
    <P>This whole process would more or less find full support in a proposal that we have public accountability on the operation of the Act and its safeguards.  What I mean by public accountability is that the Government of the day produce an annual analysis or report by way of statistical information and place it on the table of the House or make it available in the Library to help convince people of this Government's openness on the issue. I know there has been a sneering reference to those of us who happen to be backbenchers in the Government party, the question of placating those of us who have a very strong point of view on extradition without safeguards.  I have never shirked criticism, in Government or out of Government, of whatever issues that arise.  This openness was very evident on the parliamentary party meeting and four or five Ministers of State spoke.</P>
    <P>To suggest that in some way these safeguards are a knee jerk reaction to the views expressed at the parliamentary party meeting is totally unfair.  On the one hand Fianna Fáil are being narrow and isolationist and, on the other hand, they are criticised for being too open.  I do not think we can win.  To prove the genuineness of the openness of the Fianna Fáil Government, the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and the Fianna Fáil organisation on this whole issue, I propose to the Minister who is dealing with this matter that some form of accountability be made to the Dáil on an annual basis so that we can clearly see how the Extradition Act is working and to leave no doubt in the minds of people who would have genuine fears about what the Government are doing at present.  Those fears should be allayed by the production <Col N="51" /> of a full analysis of how the Act has operated with the safeguards as proposed at present.</P>
    <P>Another area which I would like to comment on very briefly is the role of the Attorney General.  I know the Attorney General, who cannot be in this House to propose his own case because he is not an elected representative of the House. I want to reassure him that the views expressed here in this debate are not a personal attack on him as Attorney General, because he is a man of the very highest integrity, but rather it is a general view expressed by Government and Opposition of the Office of Attorney General.  He should not feel under any personal attack by virtue of views expressed for or against his role on extradition.The Attorney General is being given an administrative as opposed to a judicial role.  He is not being given a role in the judicial part of the extradition process.  The Bill provides that his consent is necessary before the process is commenced.  His role <i>vis-à-vis</i> whether a specific extradition process should commence is no different from the role of the DPP in deciding whether the criminal prosecution process is to be commenced in any particular case.  Certain offences, for example, fishery offences in our territorial waters, are still the role of the Attorney General and not that of the DPP.</P>
    <P>The new role of the Attorney General is no more judicial than the role of the Minister for Justice under section 44 of the 1965 Act which states that the Minister for Justice can direct at any stage that a warrant should not be endorsed in the first place or that an extradition should not proceed if he is of the opinion that any of the reasons whereby the High Court can refuse it applies to the case in question.  The advantage of providing an administrative as opposed to a judicial safeguard is that the technical differences which exist between our law of evidence and that of the various &ldquo;British jurisdictions&rdquo; will not be permitted to prevent the extradition of persons against whom <Col N="52" /> there is a bona fide case.  The Bill provides safeguards, not loopholes.</P>
    <P>Another valuable safeguard is provided in section 2 (1) (b) of the Bill. Effectively, it gives the Minister and the High Court power to direct, under section 50 of the 1965 Act, that an extradition should not take place by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of the alleged offence.  This will prevent any unfair retrospective application of the change in definition of a political offence which came into effect at midnight last night on foot of the 1987 Act.  Both the Minister and the High Court will now be able to prevent any extradition which in their view would be unjust, oppressive or invidious by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides that the Minister may, if he thinks it necessary, formally introduce the rule of speciality into our extradition arrangement with Britain and Northern Ireland, which is provided under section 3 of the 1987 Act. This is the rule of international law whereby a person who is extradited can only be prosecuted for the offence on which his extradition was sought and granted.  In fact, no person extradited from this country to Britain has ever been prosecuted in breach of the rule.  But the Bill gives the Minister power to formally bring the rule into effect should there be any abuse by the British authorities.  The effect of the Minister's order would be to allow extradition only if the British changed their law so as to prevent prosecution in breach of the rule.  That is the case for the safeguards.  Of course, there is the possibility of a constitutional challenge, but I am certain that the Government would welcome such a challenge as an indication of the bona fides of those people who are concerned about the safeguards set out in the Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>Eksund</i> affair, the O'Grady kidnapping and the Enniskillen massacre, I did not have the opportunity to speak in the recent short debate in the context of security; I was not requested or required to speak on that occasion.  It is opportune now to make the type of <Col N="53" /> speech I would like to have made at that time.</P>
    <P>First I would like to pay particular tribute to the Garda Síochána for the performance of their duties in the recent past.  There has been a lot of criticism of the Garda, but we should remember that it is basically structured as an unarmed force.  The induction facilities are, to say the least, not good enough and the responsibility for Garda training, in the final analysis, lies with the politicians and not the Garda; in that respect we should take responsibility for any lack of efficiency the Garda may appear to have. Despite this we cannot deny the role of the Garda in recent weeks.  They had nothing to do with the <i>Eksund</i> affair but they had a lot to do with the Dr. John O'Grady rescue.  Let us be fair to the Garda in regard to their record in kidnap cases.  They realeased Dr. Tiede Herrema; they released Ben Dunne Junior; they released Don Tidey; they released Jennifer Guinness and they released Dr. John O'Grady.  I think, with the greatest of respect, that is a record second to none, and something that has not been adverted to in all this controversy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the gardaí in Dún Laoghaire; the Garda station in Dún Laoghaire was the headquarters for the rescue of Dr. John O'Grady and they did a superb job. In paying tribute to the gardaí in Dún Laoghaire I would like to mention Sergeant Spring and Detective O'Connor. Sergeant Spring, who I coincidentally saw the night he was shot at, happily only had damage done to the side of his head and I hope he has recovered from it.  Detective O'Connor had a bad time of it and is hopefully on the way to recovery.  I wish them well and thank them for their courage.That is what the Garda Síochána is &mdash; a courageous force of unarmed men based on the concept of an unarmed Garda force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Garda on their apprehension of Dessie O'Hare who, by any standards, gives the fox a bad name. <Col N="54" /> Taking account of all this, the Garda have a record that we should be grateful for. Of course, a lot remains to be done with the structure of the Garda Síochána. Nobody denies that and they would not deny it themselves.  But the responsibility for this lies with this House and the Government of the day.  Of course there should be an officer corps, extended training and a modern management approach.  But the exigencies of security and the concern properly felt by the people may result in that being left for another day.  But when the security situation does settle down, when the economic condition of the country improves, then the Garda Síochána could be effectively modernised towards the end of this century with its proud record intact.</P>
    <P>As far as the Enniskillen massacre is concerned, it was a huge tragedy done in the name of some perverted philosophy, certainly not done in my name.  I have heard people say they are ashamed to be Irish.  I am not ashamed to be Irish, quite the contrary.  I am proud to be Irish. What I am ashamed of is that atrocities like the O'Grady kidnapping, the <i>Eksund</i> affair and the Enniskillen massacre are done in my name.  I am ashamed of the people who commit these acts in my name.  I am ashamed of the Provisional IRA as much as of Loyalist murder gangs, and I come from a very strong and proud Republican background.  I am not ashamed to say that I am a Republican who wishes to see the unity of this country in time.  It may not happen in my lifetime but I want to see it done by consent and by peaceful means, through co-operation with the SDLP, through the Anglo-Irish process.  I am a supporter of the SDLP and of the Anglo-Irish process.  I see good in all these associations and have no difficulty with them at all.  This may be slow and we must be patient but we may, through those processes, bring about a reconciliation of the hearts and minds of the whole island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have to pay tribute to the religion which could bring Mr. Wilson to forgive us all for what happened to his daughter. It is a magnificent religion that allows a man to express himself in the manner in <Col N="55" /> which he expressed himself on the murder of his daughter in Enniskillen.  It is a wonderful religion that inculcates that sort of forgiveness in a person and that religion should be proud of an individual like that who can express such wonderful sentiments.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in the Birmingham Six case which is now coming to an end.  I have been over on a number of occasions to act as an observer on behalf of my party and myself as one who has been involved in the case for quite a number of years now.  No later than Friday last I visited the six in their cell in the Old Bailey and I am glad to say they are very hopeful.  My concern is that their hopefulness is not misplaced.  My concern is that the outcome of the case will be positive, that the first-class team of defence lawyers will achieve the success they deserve in this clear miscarriage of justice against those six people who have now been in prison for over 13 years.  I just want to let the House know they are in good spirits and appreciate what has been done for them on this side of the water.  Three Saturdays ago I visited Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon in Longlartin, which is a maximum security prison two hours outside London, to assure them that we would continue to press for a review of their case despite rejection by the British Home Secretary in January last in the British House of Commons when he allowed the appeal before the Court of Appeal of the Birmingham Six. We undertook to see his two colleagues in the Guildford Four case, Carol Richardson and Paddy Armstrong, in due course.  Our concern for the Maguire case is ongoing.  Of all the cases, that has probably been, if one can have degrees of miscarriage of justice, the most serious miscarriage of justice; those people were treated very unfairly.  When one looks at and hears the forensic evidence regurgitated before the Court of Appeal by Dr. Skuse, one can understand one's doubts about the efficacy of forensic evidence in the hand of such an individual.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one case which I undertook to mention which is still <Col N="56" /> ongoing, although it may be a little sensitive in the context of this debate.  If so, I am sorry but I must discharge an obligation given and that is the case of Martina Shanahan.  I received a full dossier from, I believe, one of the finest lawyers it has been my privilege to meet, Ms. Gareth Pierce who is the solicitor for the Birmingham Six.  If she expresses her concern, it is a legitimate concern.  She has expressed a legitimate concern about the treatment of Martina Shanahan.</P>
    <P>Martina Shanahan, as the House knows, was one of the three people detained and remanded for being in or on the property of Mr. Tom King, the Northern Secretary.  Ms. Pierce expresses her concern under a number of headings, one being the conditions at court and another the criticisms of the court hearings and the conditions for travelling to court.  She is also concerned about the conditions at the place of Martina Shanahan's detention at Risley.  She goes on to set out the complaints about the conditions which she said speak for themselves, that it is, in her experience, impossible for any prisoner charged with such an offence to be considered on his or her own merits for the determination of prison conditions.  At least one prison governor has complained to Miss Shanahan's solicitor, in relation to other Irish republican prisoners, that he has no credibility with Irish prisoners because they remain as category A prisoners until the day they leave prison, whatever their behaviour.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I should like to digress and ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs particularly to ask the British authorities, through Mr. Tom King or the Anglo-Irish process or whatever, at this stage to lift the category A status of Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon.  The men have been incarcerated now for long enough.  I have been in Longlartin on a number of occasions and I must say for the prison authorities that they are most co-operative.They are embarrassed, because they must sit there in your presence when you are dealing with a category A prisoner.They would much prefer to send <Col N="57" /> me and others into a room with the prisoners on our own to have a quiet chat and get on with the business of continuing to conduct and construct the campaign for their release.  In the meantime, the deputy governor, who is a decent man, and his colleagues have to sit in our presence, much to everybody's embarrassment.That category status is an irritant and it is an unfair category for people who have been in prison since 1974.  You can imagine how they feel spiritually, mentally and physically, 13 or 14 years on in their incarcerated state.  I am asking that the Minister for Foreign Affairs consider urging the British Home Secretary or the Northern Secretary to have a look at the prison category status of the Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>The Shanahan case is another kettle of fish and Ms. Pierce, in her document to me, goes on to state that Martina Shanahan faces the prospect of up to nine months or a year before a trial at which she will almost certainly be acquitted of the charge brought against her.  In that time it would be expected she would physically and mentally deteriorate.  She is suffering already from obvious signs of strain.  Her family are likely to face enormous debts to pay for weekly travel to allow for any human contact.  Her solicitor is in as much contact as possible but distances are considerable.  After each court appearance at present her solicitor is requesting a joint conference with her co-defendants and their solicitors to try to make some form of human contact. Ms. Pierce concludes that Martina Shanahan is the most severely disadvantaged prisoner in the entire United Kingdom prison system, infinitely worse off than convicted prisoners who are provided with work, exercise and other facilities which are given to prisoners in custody. Ms. Pierce goes on to say that Martina Shanahan is, of course, innocent in the eyes of the law but that she will not do justice to herself or her case if she appears for trial broken or dented in mind or body.  She faces trial in almost impossible conditions in any event, because of her prejudicial pre-trial treatment.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another concern that <Col N="58" /> must be expressed in all these matters relating to the trial of Irish people in the British jurisdiction, namely, that there appears always to be a huge intimidatory presence in a trial of an Irish citizen in Britain.  In the Shanahan case, Martina Shanahan is effectively convicted before she has even gone through the due process.The British have a dreadful habit of producing helicopters overhead, snipers on rooftops, the shrieking of sirens and so on, in the lead up to the introduction of an Irish accused person into court. That is unfair.</P>
    <P>In advance of any such hearing, such a person is entitled to be presumed, and the public are entitled to presume, he is innocent.  Given every opportunity, as we know, the British gutter press, in particular, are prepared to assume that all Irish men who arrive on the British mainland are guilty of something or other.  In that climate I would be concerned about the treatment of Irish prisoners both in court and in British prisons.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the case of the &ldquo;King Three&rdquo;, for the want of better words, I believe they will not be found guilty of the charges on which they have been accused.  In the meantime, they are entitled to the dignity of the presumption of their innocence and they are not being given that opportunity because of the manner of their treatment by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I have outlined graphically and as shortly as I possibly can, in the context of a rather lengthy document which I received from Ms. Pierce, solicitor for the Birmingham Six, the treatment of Martina Shanahan.  That treatment is not good enough and I ask the authorities to examine it as a matter of some considerable urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by calling the attention of the House to the political history of this Bill before us.  We are, I think, willing to some extent on both sides to give an amnesty to one another in regard to &ldquo;political offences&rdquo;, of a purely political kind, that have been committed in the past. Although if I wanted to I could stand on a barrel and twist the tail of Fianna Fáil for a couple of hours on end about their former record in this whole area, I am going to forebear.  The conditions with which we are dealing are far too serious and nobody recognises that more promptly, and I believe fully and sincerely. than the Fianna Fáil Ministers themselves.  Nobody could doubt that Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Foreign Affairs when he spoke here this morning meant every word he said.</P>
      <P>I hope I shall be forgiven for going back over the relatively recent history behind this Bill, in order to show why I have no misgivings about supporting, in general terms, the Government in this.</P>
      <P>In saying that I know I will give some displeasure to my colleagues &mdash; and I hope I will not be thought self-important if I say my own humble position is one which forbids me to take a line about a legal Bill which I do not genuinely believe &mdash; but I think the Government deserve to be helped in the situation in which they now find themselves, although I do not overlook the fact, that if we go far enough back, they have brought many of the difficulties upon themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me a couple of months ago that the Bill which the last Government rightly put through this House with the intention of giving effect to our obligations under the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was not going to be allowed to come into force.  I suspected, as many people suspected, that the Taoiseach and the Government were shifting around trying to find a convenient political point from which to <Col N="60" /> launch an assault on that Act and prevent it from coming into force; but events overtook them.  I am not going to go back over those events because they have been mentioned by nearly every speaker.  The bombing at Enniskillen, the arms find on the <i>Eksund</i> and the horrifying kidnapping of Mr. O'Grady overtook them, and I cannot blame the Government for changing their minds.  They would be less than human if they did not.  If there was any sneaking intention on the Fianna Fáil benches to prevent the Act giving effect to the European Convention coming into force, they are behaving in a fully human way in changing their minds about it.</P>
    <P>How could you possibly refuse to activate a Bill such as that, and not allow it to come into force, with the kind of situations which these events and a long list of other events produced?  Before these events occurred it seemed to me that the Government were making an effort to get off this hook; and the thing which convinced me that I was right in thinking that was what I can only call the Taoiseach's absurd assault on the British Ambassador whom he accused of overdoing the arm-twisting with members of the Opposition.  Speaking as one who has not had his hospitality, and whose opinion he presumably does not think worth conciliating, I do not believe any of my colleagues in my party would permit himself, no matter how much entertainment he was offered, to have his arm twisted in regard to a matter of this kind or in regard to any other matter where his public duty was concerned.  I am sure the same is true of members of the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and even Deputy Blaney.  I imagine he is the least accessible Member in this House to being won over by British hospitality; but I had better include him or he might have a grievance.</P>
    <P>The Government have shifted their ground.  I cannot blame them for doing so because changing of minds in response to developments with awful human dimensions is right and they should be helped to change their ground. <Col N="61" /> They evidently were trying to get themselves into the position where this Act could be allowed to come duly into force on 1 December and they faced, apparently, a certain degree of revolt on their back benches.  The only way that revolt could be stilled, and I hope I am not giving offence by saying this, was by promising an extra safeguard.  If this safeguard was in itself objectionable, I would be in full cry against it; but I have to say, and I am sorry if I give displeasure to colleagues, that I do not see anything objectionable in it.  As a matter of fact, in general terms, I am all for safeguards in the extradition process.  I do not want to cause resentment on the other side of the sea by saying this, but there is substance in the feelings which have been expressed in this House often enough about the British and the Northern Ireland judicial and administrative arrangements where criminal law is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go over the ground that Deputy Andrews went over.  I also want to disclaim that I necessarily agree with everything he said in that context. There is ground for being uneasy about the treatment people get either from the courts, the police or while in prison when they are in any foreign jurisdiction.  I can recall that a little over ten years ago, during a period when Deputy Garret FitzGerald was sick and when I was Parliamentary Secretary <i>inter alia</i> in his Department, I was given the job by the Government of taking advantage of an official attendance at a funeral in London to call privately on Merlyn Rees &mdash; here I am talking about the Liam Cosgraveled Government &mdash; to express the Government's lively concern about the way in which, we understood, Irish prisoners were being treated in British jails. I did that without publicity.  Nothing appeared in the newspapers about it, because we did not wish to abrade the skin of people with whom we were trying to do business.  We were trying to do it quietly and thereby, perhaps, more effectively.</P>
    <P>These things cannot and ought not be forgotten.  I have always been uneasy <Col N="62" /> about extradition to any jurisdiction over which, necessarily, we have no control; but the European Convention puts us into a different situation.  This Convention puts us under obligations of European size, and, as the Taoiseach said in his opening speech, it will make us above all people the object of derision and of incomprehension to our European neighbours, since we suffer more from terrorism than they do.  Why should we be the heel-draggers in this trans-national process of putting down terrorism? Therefore, I have a political disposition to helping the Government in allowing this Act to come into force and to stay in force.  Since I see nothing in principle objectionable in the measure they propose, namely the insertion of an extra safeguard, I cannot oppose them.</P>
    <P>Since I am on my feet I had better go through some of the matters which have been mentioned to explain, in case anyone suggests that I have not given the matter any thought, why I feel, with the greatest of respect, that the apprehensions expressed about the involvement of the Attorney General are not well grounded.  The main apprehension bears on his involvement in what is said to be a &ldquo;judicial process&rdquo; or in the &ldquo;exercise of a judicial function&rdquo;.  I must frankly tell the House and admit to it that there is no area of constitutional law as grey as this question of what is a &ldquo;judicial power&rdquo; or what is the exercise of a &ldquo;judicial function&rdquo;.When is a function such that it can only be properly exercised by a judge, and when does it stop short of that importance and so as to be still exercisable by someone who is not a judge? There is no more difficult area in constitutional law than that.</P>
    <P>In the early days these cases usually centred on the functions of the Land Commission.  Case after case since about 1930 has centred on this problem.  It is no nearer a definitive solution now than it was then.  The best that can be said is that there are rough guidelines for deciding what is a judicial function.  The simplest and clearest of these guidelines are ones expressed over 20 years ago in the case of McDonald <i>v</i>.  Bord na gCon.  In that <Col N="63" /> case Mr. Justice Kenny made an attempt to define what is a judicial function, and the Supreme Court provisionally accepted his criteria.  I will read them, if I may, to the House; they can be found in the <i>Irish Reports</i> of 1965 in the pages subsequent to page 217.</P>
    <P>He said the characteristic features of an administration of justice were (1) a dispute or controversy as to the existence of legal rights or a violation of the law; (2) the determination or ascertainment of the rights of parties or the imposition of liabilities or the infliction of a penalty; (3) the final determination, subject to appeal, of legal rights or liabilities or the imposition of penalties; (4) the enforcement of those rights or liabilities or the imposition of a penalty by the court or by the executive power of the State which is called in by the court to enforce its judgment; and (5) the making of an order by the court which as a matter of history is an order characteristic of courts in this country.</P>
    <P>My own feeling is that the functions which it is proposed to attribute to the Attorney General under this Bill do not correspond at any point to the description of a judicial function given in the Bord na gCon case although in this area which is so difficult and uncertain nothing is final.  I do not in any way want &mdash; as Sherlock Holmes used to say &mdash; to stake whatever little reputation I have on the prediction that the Supreme Court is not going to shoot down this Bill &mdash; or Act if it becomes law &mdash; at some future stage. It may do so.  As former Deputy Jack Lynch said when he was Taoiseach: &ldquo;The courts have become so adventurous nowadays that it is a brave man who will predict what they will do in the constitutional area&rdquo;.  I do not want to appear any braver than Jack Lynch when he was asked whether he was sure he was doing something constitutional when he was introducing some measure here.  It is possible that I am wrong about this, but for what my opinion is worth I do not think the function which it is here proposed to give the Attorney General is judicial in character.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> In particular, I think the best of the five guidelines suggested by Mr. Justice Kenny ought to be the uppermost one: what has been characteristic of courts in this country down the years?  If we are trying to decide what is a judicial function and what is not, that is the only safe guideline.  It is rather indefinite in some respects and brings us back to the days of the Free State and beyond that to the days of the British.  But the important point here is that there is no evidence that the Government presided over by Deputy de Valera, or this Dáil which approved the draft Constitution, or the people outside, intended any substantial change in this area.  There is not a pick of evidence anywhere in the Constitution debate which took place in this very Chamber just over 50 years ago that any substantial shift in the judicial function was intended by Article 34 or Article 37. Essentially, as I read those Articles, it was intended to keep matters as they had been, but to make special provision for the operation of semi-judicial, semiadministrative bodies like the Land Commission in an area where administrative authorities have in practice to operate. You cannot have the Supreme Court sitting on every land acquisition.</P>
    <P>That is a respectable point to make. Since there is no evidence of any intention to change the pre-existing pattern; on the contrary, since the Constitution specifically says in Article 50 that, so far as they are not inconsistent with the Constitution, the laws in force heretofore were to be preserved &mdash; since all considerations of prudence, convenience and fairness were in favour of the preservation of the <i>status quo</i>, even when there is, so to speak a chemical revolution here as there was in 1937, we are not far out in saying that the easiest and simplest way of telling what is a judicial function and what is not, is to say that this is the kind of function which down the years in this State, in the Irish Free State and under the British before that, has typically and characteristically been performed by our courts, while some other kind of function has typically and characteristically been performed by a board, <Col N="65" /> a Minister, a council or some kind of statutory authority.  I am not offering that as a clear guideline, but as a rough and ready layman's guideline which is very often a better one than lawyers are able to think up.  It has the authority of Mr. Justice Kenny and the tacit approval of the Supreme Court behind it &mdash; which is not to say that it will not be overruled or departed from &mdash; but I am reasonably happy with it.</P>
    <P>I would start out by assuming that this function of the Attorney General is not all that clearly a judicial function, as I have heard said from some of the benches on my side.  I am sorry to personalise this, but I feel that I will not be giving value for money, if I do not make these things clear.  In particular two PD spokesmen, both enjoying rightly the respect of the House in other ways, perhaps in all ways, have given reasons over the last couple of days against this measure of a legal kind which, with great respect to them, I think are misconceived.  I heard an interview given by Deputy Desmond O'Malley on Sunday.  While it is difficult to be sure you are doing justice to somebody if you have only a memory of what he said on radio or television, I believe he said that the function here attributed to the Attorney General was judicial and, therefore, impermissible constitutionally.If I understood him correctly he said that the Supreme Court had ruled lately that the act of returning somebody for trial &mdash; an act not all that different from what we are talking about here; of course it is different but it is a workable analogy &mdash; was a judicial act and was impermissible if performed by the Attorney General or by the DPP.  I beg the Deputy's pardon if I am misquoting him, but I understood him to say that.  I am afraid that is a misunderstanding of what the Supreme Court said, unless I misunderstood it.</P>
    <P>The case to which I take it he is referring is Costello's case, which departed from what the court had said in Shanahan's case over 20 years previously.  That decision of the Supreme Court, I think quite rightly, was to the effect that the Attorney General &mdash; nowadays the DPP <Col N="66" />&mdash; had no constitutionally permissible function in returning someone for trial whom a district justice had previously, in consequence of a preliminary examination, decided there was not enough evidence to return for trial.  It was the element of setting at naught the act of a court that was impermissible, not the act of returning for trial in itself.  The Supreme Court in the very case which Costello's case departed from had said, in a dimension which was not in the later case questioned &mdash; in 1964 in the Shanahan case, one of the cases arising out of the Shanahan Stamp auctions prosecutions &mdash; speaking through the mouth of Mr. Justice Walsh &mdash; who is still a member of that court, a most senior and influential member &mdash; that there could be no constitutional objection to the Oireachtas providing that a prosecution on indictment before a jury, the most serious of all prosecutions, could be instituted by the mere administrative act of an Attorney General &mdash; the DPP did not exist in those days.  I am quoting Mr. Justice Walsh.  The case is the State (Shanahan) <i>v.</i> Attorney General, in the 1964 <i>Irish Reports</i>, page 239:</P>
    <P>It would be within the powers of the Oireachtas to provide by legislation that persons may be put on trial on indictment preferred by the Attorney General without any preliminary investigation and sending forward for trial by the District Court.</P>
    <P>The case has been overruled, but not on that point.  That still stands as a dictum, as far as I know not disapproved afterwards by the Supreme Court or any judge of it.</P>
    <P>In other words, our apparatus here whereby there is a preliminary investigation first in the District Court, followed by an indictment on trial, is not constitutionally necessary.  It is an extra safeguard that somebody should be before the District Court first, which court decides whether there is a case to justify putting the person on trial, but the Constitution does not require it.  It would be within the terms of the Constitution, even though you and I might not like it <Col N="67" />&mdash; we might prefer the old system &mdash; for these Houses to enact a law which provided that even a jury trial could be initiated with no preliminary investigation, merely on the certificate or order of the DPP.  That is within the powers of these Houses.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating it or saying that I want to see it, but I believe it is, as the Supreme Court said, within powers of these Houses.  Therefore, unless I am doing him an injustice, and I do not intend such a thing, I believe Duputy O'Malley misunderstood the decision he purported to quote and there is no objection to a DPP or an Attorney General returning somebody for trial provided that that Act does not have the effect of overthrowing a judicial decision previously taken in regard to the very same subject-matter.</P>
    <P>It seems, a <i>fortiori</i> because this seems to be a stronger case, that the Attorney General under this Bill is not purporting to have someone tried; that still remains to be determined.  He is doing a less drastic act altogether.  It seems to me, therefore, that on the argument of Deputy O'Malley there could be no problem about the Attorney General forming a view on whether the spread of evidence &mdash; about which he has information &mdash; is enough to warrant forming the intention to prosecute.  I heard &mdash; I tried to find it in the paper this morning but it does not seem to have been reported &mdash; Deputy McDowell quoted on the news this morning as saying, and I think I heard Deputy Kennedy repeat, in more elaborate terms a little while ago &mdash; I confess I was looking something up and I did not give what she was saying my full attention &mdash; I think she did say this under four heads, that the Bill entitled the Garda Commissioner to bypass the Attorney General altogether and to leave him out of this process.That is what I understood Deputy McDowell to be reported as saying on the news this morning.</P>
    <P>That, with respect to the two Deputies and not in any sense pretending to be infallible on such a point, I think is an entirely wrong reading of the Bill.  The <Col N="68" /> Bill says as clearly as it can be said that the Attorney General must be given a chance, in every extradition application, to give a direction that a warrant be not endorsed.</P>
    <P>It would have been well if the Government, instead of introducing this amending Bill, had produced a Bill for an entire consolidated Act.  I have put together with scissors and paste the various sections from two Acts and a Bill in order to get a connected, text and the result is not pretty.  I sympathise with the Deputies who have not thought of using scissors and paste in trying to manage this Bill, and the things which it amends, in one case for the second time.  I make allowances for the shortage of time, but it certainly is not an easy Bill with which to work.</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation, under section 43 of the 1965 Act the commissioner is to endorse the warrant for execution issued abroad but he is to endorse it &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Part&rdquo;.  Into this Part there are interpolated, by the Bill we are dealing with, several new sections, including this discretion for the Attorney General.  The consequence of that is that the commissioner must have regard to the other provisions of that Part of the Bill, and if he fails to have regard to them he is behaving illegally.  In so far as his actions may deprive somebody of his rights he is behaving unconstitutionally.  A layman would understand that very well.</P>
    <P>A Garda Commissioner who says: &ldquo;Listen, lads, we will get this man out of the country and not bother giving the Attorney General a chance to look at the case at all&rdquo;, would be doing something flagrantly unlawful and patently unlawful under this Bill, because the duty of the Garda Commissioner is exercisable only subject to the provisions of the whole of that Part of the Bill, which will now include this discretion of the Attorney General.  Before he has jurisdiction to endorse that warrant he must be satisfied that the rest of that part of the Act has been complied with.  He cannot be so satisfied if the Attorney General has had no opportunity to consider whether or <Col N="69" /> not to issue a direction that the warrant be not endorsed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on and on about this because it is a legal point and one can be as easily wrong as right.  I only want to tell the House my own clear opinion that Deputy McDowell and Deputy Kennedy, if I did not misunderstand them, are quite wrong on this point.  The Commissioner has absolutely no right to by-pass the Attorney General, and every instance of seeking extradition will have to be, under this Bill, laid before the Attorney General so as to allow him to decide whether there is enough spread of evidence to justify the authority in the other jurisdiction in forming the intention to prosecute.  He cannot be by-passed.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not contain a time limit, I should think if the authorities of the State are anxious to afford extradition they will find it in their interest to get the Attorney General's view as quickly as possible.  I see no interest on the part of the Garda Commissioner or of anybody else in delaying it, but I think Deputy Fitzpatrick is right.  I was not aware that he was listening so carefully to what I was saying.  He is right, there is no time limit that I can see, but I have not had a chance to look at the Bill under that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points which I want briefly to mention which are in a general way relevant to the whole question of this legislation.  I should like first of all to agree &mdash; I could not in conscience do anything else but agree &mdash; with what I heard Deputy Andrews say a while ago. As I said at the start &mdash; it is difficult for me because in the past I have been as blood-shot a controversialist as anybody here, but I am trying to amnesty the Fianna Fáil Party as well as I can from the things which they have done and said in the past, and to start with a clean sheet. To be fair to them I have not noticed <Col N="70" /> them being especially mean, begrudging or ungenerous in their references to the Government which preceded them. That is something new and I hope it will contribute in a way that is deeper than is easily seen to the development and evolution of politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews is right in pointing out that the purpose of the Bill &mdash; on the face of it &mdash; is not as an extra oppression of the person wanted for extradition but as a safeguard for him, and I have no objection to there being as many safeguards as we can decently put in, consistent with our obligations under the European Convention.  It is only fair to colleagues to remind the House that when Deputy Dukes was putting the Bill to give effect to that Convention through the House last year and was being asked then about a <i>prima facie</i> requirement he said, and I think he was quite right, that he could not insert such a thing without effectively attaching a new condition of our own to the European Convention. We have signed this Convention and we have got to give effect to it.  We cannot import a completely new condition into it.  That is a reasonable argument, and from that point of view one could perhaps say that the present Bill is objectionable. One could say that the Irish alone among the signatory nations are giving their own Attorney General the right to consider whether there is a reasonable spread of evidence sufficient to support a prosecution.I do not know whether this point has surfaced much during the debate; but that certainly would be something in which there might be some substance. Deputy Dukes quite rightly made that point last year.  Apart from that point, the Bill is intended as an additional safeguard and not as an engine of oppression.</P>
    <P>I think this is also relevant and is not altogether without some interest in regard to the Attorney General's powers. He has a far more drastic power, namely that of declaring that in his opinion the ordinary courts are insufficient to secure the administration of justice and, by that declaration, to justify the Government in bringing the Special Criminal Court into <Col N="71" /> being.  That power of the Attorney General was assailed as long ago as 1940 or 1941 by a prisoner called McCurtain who had been tried and sentenced by the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The case made for McCurtain was that the Attorney General was exercising a judicial power which did not belong to him in purporting to decide that the ordinary courts were inadequate.  He was shot down by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, with whom the Supreme Court subsequenly agreed.  I mention Gavan Duffy's name for the reason that he was the judge, of all judges, who was most sensitive to an invasion of the judicial power.  He was the judge who amazed the Fianna Fáil Government of those days by striking down the Sinn Féin Funds Act as being an invasion of the judicial domain.  Even Gavan Duffy, pernickety though he was, did not see anything in this function by the Attorney General amounting to an infraction of the properly judicial area.</P>
    <P>Another misconception &mdash; I believe it is a misconception &mdash; I want to mention to the House is this.  It is not the law, even if perhaps it should be the law, that every single invasion of personal liberty has to be preceded by a judicial determination.That is not correct.  If it were correct there could be no such thing as an arrest without warrant, whether by a member of the police or a private citizen. If it were correct there could be no such thing even as an arrest with a warrant; because a district judge or a peace commissioner, who issues an arrest warrant, does not have to review the entire evidence on which the sworn information is based.  If it were the case that there could be no arrest and that personal liberty could not be infringed in any way without a judicial determination first, these things would not be possible.</P>
    <P>I admit that the question of the boundary is very difficult.  At present when a proceeding intended to prosecute someone leaves the hands of the administration and enters the hands of the Judiciary, it is difficult to decide whether one bit is too long or the other bit is too <Col N="72" /> short.  It is an unnatural or troublesome junction, like the junction of the steel blade of a knife with a bone handle.  It can come loose and cause problems of all kinds.  Sometimes the blade is too long or the handle is too long.  Perhaps that is a homely comparison, and I do not know whether it is of any use, but it is intended to show that you are dealing with two very different kinds of function.  In the process of detecting a crime, finding someone you suspect and collecting enough forensic or other evidence to justify you in charging him and bringing him before a court.  There is a transition between the purely governmental operation of the police and the judicial function of holding a trial and deciding whether the suspect is guilty.  There is always going to be a rubbing discomfort in the interfacing of those two areas.  I do not deny it and as I said before I do not predict that this Bill will not subsequently run into trouble.  I think I am at least right in saying that some deprivations of liberty, the instances of which I have just given, take place without any judge in any court having decided beforehand that it should take place after considering the evidence relating to the possible prosecution.I want to make two more points.</P>
    <P>Some of the arguments against the involvement of the Attorney General relate to his exercising his function &ldquo;behind closed doors&rdquo;.  I protest against that cliche simply as a matter of linguistic aesthetics.  What use are doors if you do not close them?  The purpose of giving discretion to any official, whether the Attorney General, a planning authority or anybody else, is that they will do their business properly and efficiently.  You cannot do that if you have the public breathing down the back of your neck. The old stuff about &ldquo;open government&rdquo; is trendy rubbish, instantly dumped by whoever gets in when he finds himself actually having to do the jobs which formerly he thought should have been done in a goldfish bowl.  As things stand, the Director of Public Prosecutions could make up his mind, perversely enough no doubt, to charge Deputy Kennedy or myself with murder.  That proceeding, <Col N="73" /> totally unjustified and loony, would take place behind closed doors.  He must make some decisions in private in consultation with his own advisers.  All the operations of the DPP's office which result in very serious prosecutions take place &ldquo;behind closed doors.&rdquo;  If there is nothing in our system which renders that impermissable or objectionable, what makes it objectionable that the Attorney General can sit down behind those closed doors and consider whether there is enough, in the dossier furnished to him from the North of Ireland or British police, to justify him concluding that their intention to prosecute is genuine, that there is enough there to give them a fair change of making a charge stick?  I cannot see that distinction.</P>
    <P>I want to try to remove another misapprehension.It is not correct to say that the office of the Attorney General is a political office; at least it is not correct to say it in the sense in which that expression has been employed in this debate.  He is, of course, a political appointee and he must be, if a Government are to be happy with him, somebody with much the same political opinions and background as the Government.  Otherwise, he cannot sit at Government meetings and be more or less <i>au fait</i> with what a Government are doing or what problems they have.  To that extent, of course, he is political.  He is appointed by a Taoiseach who is not going to appoint one of his bitterest opponents and he will leave office, as I did, when the Taoiseach goes out of office.  The Taoiseach can fire him or request his resignation in the meantime. But during his tenure of office he is not a political creature in the sense in which he is now said to be; and I do not believe that any Attorney General since the State was founded behaved in that way.  He is supposed to be independent and he has always considered himself as independent and I do not believe that any Attorney General would ever allow his professional or official judgment to be bent or twisted in response to a political exigency expressed to him by his Taoiseach.He would have said: &ldquo;look, Taoiseach, I am here to give you advice and <Col N="74" /> to advise the Government on the legality or illegality of what you are doing.  My advice is as follows and I am not going to certify otherwise.&rdquo;  That certainly is how I would have behaved if I had been there long enough for such a matter to present itself.  I have never heard the suggestion from any side that an Attorney General of any political persuasion behaved otherwise.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on that note by citing to the House what three judges of the Supreme Court said in the one case in which the function of the Attorney General was discussed at great length.  It is a case which has avoided classification in many indexes because the head note to the case does not mention this aspect of it.  Nevertheless, it is the leading case on the Attorney General's functions.  It is the case of McLoughlin <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare and it is reported at page 1 of the 1958 <i>Irish Law Reports.</i> The court was divided but not on the point I am talking about here.  The Chief Justice of the time, Conor Maguire said that the Attorney General &ldquo;exercises executive power under the authority of the Government while he retains in the day to day decisions he has to make the independence which he has always enjoyed.&rdquo;  Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore said: &ldquo;It is quite clear that the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government but is put into an independent position.&rdquo;  Mr. Justice Cearbhall O'Dalaigh said: &ldquo;Whatever room for debate there may be as to the position of the Attorney General prior to 1937 it can, in my opinion, no longer admit of argument since the enactment of the Constitution of Ireland that the Attorney General is not, in the discharge of his functions as public prosecutor, subject to the directions of the Taoiseach but is an independent constitutional officer.&rdquo; I realise that Deputies who make the opposite case are not operating from malice or deliberately distorting a position but that corresponds with my understanding of the office.  I do not believe that the present incumbent of the office would or could possibly have the faintest intention to allow that independence to <Col N="75" /> be reduced.  So far as that aspect of the matter goes I must declare myself as not sharing the apprehensions I have heard expressed.  I apologise if I have given displeasure to colleagues.  I would find it harder to forgive myself if I had either not spoken on this matter or had spoken in a sense which I did not believe.</P>

      <P>I want to open my remarks by stating that it is purely as a non-legal person I am making my contribution.There is an old saying that fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  It is with a genuine sense of trepidation that I follow so many eminent contributors. It has been interesting to listen to the various debates.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Kelly for the point he made towards the end.  It was good to hear a very eminent professional say that he could be as legally wrong as legally right.  There have been contributions from people during the past few days who brooked no arguments, legally or otherwise.  They gave final statements on issues and it was good to hear that opened up a bit today.</P>
      <P>Some questions have been raised and some comments have been made, political and otherwise.  I would like to comment on the fears and the concerns of non-legal people, of the vast majority of people.  I have read the transcripts of the discussions from last December and they have helped me to judge the consistency or otherwise of various individuals and groups.  Those transcripts show very clearly that some people, in particular two of the Opposition groups, have changed their ground and attitudes quite a lot.  They may have done so to embarrass the Government, politically but I am not sure.  However, nasty comments were made by individuals which I would like to comment on later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is total confusion in the public mind on the legal position on extradition and where we stand in regard to it.  I would like to spell out a few points as I see them.  We have had extradition since 1965 but many people seem to be ignorant of that fact.  Quite clearly, <Col N="76" /> people have been extradited up to the present.  The Extradition Act, 1965, had certain safeguards including the political offence defence.  I believe there has been a constant nibbling away at the basic safeguards and particularly since the decision of the former Chief Justic O'Higgins, a total air of mystery appertains to that defence.  I will not quote from his judgment on the case but it was certainly so vague that it left no defence as had been previously the case within the Act. People are concerned.  The confusion has been added to by some mistakes with the warrants and other slip-ups.  I do not know whether Acts are written with the intention of confusing the public, but it appears that there is an attitude of confusing the public and thereby keeping them ignorant and happy.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which came into force today adds further to the confusion in the public mind.  The Criminal Jurisdiction Act has not been used widely, but it is still quoted regularly when people get up to speak.  This again adds to the confusion.  We have various safeguards built into the Acts, such as the 15 day right to appeal to the High Court, which is obviously included, the order of <i>habeas corpus</i>, a direction for release, couched in the language of the legal profession, including Members in this House, but which is totally confusing to the public. It is against this background of a conglomeration of rules, regulations and test cases that we are discussing the present Extradition Bill.</P>
    <P>I immediately join with all previous speakers when I state clearly I do not want to protect any guilty person, and under no circumstances do I want a haven for terrorists.  However, I want to see a reasonable level of protection for an innocent person.  I believe the simplest way to do this is to write down clearly explicit instructions on the steps that are to be taken when a warrant is issued or measures taken to extradite a person.  I have debated my case at the parliamentary party level in Fianna Fáil and I will refer to that later.  As a non-legal person.  I want to see fairly simple rules <Col N="77" /> laid down, rules I can understand, and which I could explain to somebody if a case were brought to me.</P>
    <P>We have listened to long debates of a legal nature, with arguments about the implications of and protections in the Bill.  We have heard a few mischievous digs at the political implications of the role of the Attorney General, which I will refer to later.  At the end of the debate, I would venture to say that even those who contributed to the debate will find that the situation is more confused than ever.  Again, I thank Deputy Kelly for his contribution because I have heard conflicting statements here from very eminent people.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a situation whereby people would not likely be transported to face what is a dubious standard of justice, or as most of us would see it, a bias against the Irish in mainland Britain.  It has been said we are prisoners of history with 800 years of history behind us and that we are only imagining it but I do not think that is so.  I do not want to quote again the cases which were used as examples in this situation, but I would refer to the implementation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act where we can look for guidelines on how British justice will affect the Irish in Britain.  The figures are horrendous to put it mildly.  There has been no respect shown for Irish citizens under that Act.  The number of cases are legendary as was quoted by Deputy Andrews this morning when he went into the details of some of the people held.  It is frightening for the ordinary Irish citizen to feel they could face that situation without being guilty of any crime whatsoever. People have been and are being lifted under the PTA.  We need to build in every possible safeguard and, at the same time, establish that we will not be a haven for terrorists.  It is a very difficult path to walk.  I believe the Minister has listened very carefully to arguments from all sides of the House.  I am quite sure he has referred back to the discussions of 4 and 16 December 1986 in reaching his decision on this issue and presenting this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would not like to get bogged down in <Col N="78" /> any legal arguments but the arguments against the involvement of the Attorney General have taken up practically all the time.  My simplistic approach would be that if the Bill were to be tested to be unconstitutional so be it.  Let somebody take a test case when the time comes, as many other Bills have been tested. Various tomes and books were brought forward to prove whether the Attorney General had a right or not under the Bill.  I will contribute to the argument by quoting &mdash; for a geographical balance more than anything else &mdash; a UCC law faculty lecturer, Mr. David Gwynn Morgan &mdash; who states:</P>
    <P>the Attorney General's duty in the field of extradition is not very different from the task performed by his Office for centuries and now performed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, namely to determine whether to prosecute a person for any ordinary crime before the Irish Courts.</P>
    <P>There are pages and pages of conflicting points of views.  If we took cognisance of all the quotations we would never bring in any law.</P>
    <P>The first challenge would probably decide whether the Act was constitutional.People may say we should have this decided beforehand but it is all part of the legal process.  There is an entitlement, just as there is an entitlement to go before the District Court, to appeal to the High Court and so on. My approach as a person without legal training would be to say, let it be challenged.Likewise a case has been made along the way that the British would not like what we are doing and I would say pretty much the same thing: if they do not like it that is too bad.  We are a sovereign State and I do not make any apologies for stating my point of view.  I want to protect Irish citizens and if some other country does not like it that is just too bad.  I think we have gone as far as we can to meet the international needs, the European needs and the local needs on terrorism but we must safeguard our own people.  We should not apologise for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> There is a suggestion that a person who worries about the safety of Irish citizens, particularly in relation to the British scene, is conniving in some way with Provos or terrorists.  That is an attack on constitutional republicans that must be put down, otherwise we will have to forget coming into this House.  I will look for safeguards for Irish citizens and make no apology for it.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Kelly when he states that the involvement of the Attorney General would be an extra safeguard.  I am looking at it again in that light.  Taking his advice on the legal position, I must than ask those who did not have a firm stance on this issue last December what their objection is to an extra safeguard, if it is not due to political connivance.  What has changed since 16 December when it was said that we must co-operate with Europe and Britain to stamp out terrorism?  One objection which has been raised is that this does not go far enough and is not plain enough. I totally disagree.</P>
    <P>I wanted an assurance that there would not be extradition for questioning, which would be intolerable.  I have that assurance.The specialty aspect was adhered to in the past, particularly in the McGlinchey case.  When he was acquitted he was brought back here and I wanted to ensure that that system would remain.  I am worried about the wording of the retrospection clause, although I accept that it is the best possible wording.  Most important of all is the fact that there must be sufficient evidence to support the case. When this point was argued last December it was construed as an attempt to slow things up.  I do not accept that.  The people who argued for safeguards were genuine in their concern and they are still genuine.  There has been no change in the Fianna Fáil stance.  We still say that evidence must be produced to support the case and we want our system to deal with these matters in the best possible fashion.  We must welcome the extra safeguard, but I do not want to become bogged down in legal niceties.</P>
    <P>If we are to remove the legal smoke <Col N="80" /> clouds which have been thrown up to confuse the public, Opposition spokespersons must be asked to say what has changed since December.  Why are they now saying that this is not satisfactory? They say on the one hand that it does not go far enough and on the other that it is too extreme and that no case could be brought.  Do they agree or not to an extra safeguard in this process?  If they are not simply trying to wrong-foot the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice they should agree that we need all these safeguards and vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>During this debate Deputy Sean Barrett referred to me as a reckless Fianna Fáil backbencher.  I object strongly.  If asking for the advice of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice on any issue and making suggestions to them as a non-legal person, while taking cognisance of the dubious standards of British justice, makes me a reckless backbencher, I would welcome that description.  I am sure, however, that this is not what Deputy Barrett was referring to.  It was a disgraceful slur on people who wish to make a contribution within their own party.  The same man had been saying a month earlier that nobody would be listened to within the Fianna Fáil Party. I will not accept such remarks from anybody, no matter how long he has been a Member of this House or what standing he has achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke about changes in the Fianna Fáil position.  I looked as carefully as possible at the December debate in an effort to find the Labour position but I failed to pin down a firm stance.  Perhaps they felt as part of the Government that they had to agree with the Minister for Justice in everything he said.  Deputy Taylor referred to the Fianna Fáil Party meeting.  Like Deputy Barrett, he spoke about the great number of Deputies who contributed at that meeting.  Is this a good or a bad point for Fianna Fáil?  Are people to be shut up or asked to contribute?  I believe members of all parties should be encouraged to contribute.  I believe the Labour Party have changed their stance.  It appears from my reading of the debate that they <Col N="81" /> were quite prepared to allow the ratification of the European Convention with absolutely no safeguards.  Now we are told that the present Bill does not go far enough in respect of safeguards.  Surely that is a total contradiction and does not give Deputy Taylor the right to criticise Fianna Fáil people who make points within or without the parliamentary party.</P>
    <P>Deputy George Birmingham described the Bill as shabby and tatty.  The motives for the introduction of the Bill were questioned.  There were many references to approaches to the Attorney General and I will deal with this matter in the context of Deputy O'Malley's comments. His comments amazed me, coming from somebody who has been here so long and who held such a high position, particularly in the years 1970 to 1973 when he would have been in touch with the Attorney General and others.</P>
    <P>In describing the work of the Attorney General, and telling us how he could be approached, he referred to darkened rooms, people sneaking in back doors and made other derogatory remarks.  I do not know if he was drawing on personal experience but I find it incredible that a person who outside the House would attack those who say anything against the institutions of the State should descend to this level.  I expected better from him, a former Minister.  I was shocked to hear that description.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that that description was thrown out for political reasons.  I am sure the only Attorney General he was referring to was the holder of that Office during a Fianna Fáil administration.  I was pleased to hear Members on both sides of the House defending previous Attorneys General.  I do not know if the Deputy I referred to dressed up his description for public consumption, if he meant what he said or if he was simply putting forward the standard anti-Government attack, but irrespective of his reason he should withdraw his reference to the Attorney General and how that Office is run.  Such snide and sneaking attacks bring the institutions of the State into disrepute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> A number of the contributions amounted to no more than a political attack on the Government.  I am pleased that today we have returned to debating the provisions in the Bill, the need for them and the difficulties that may arise when they are implemented.  I am a reasonable person and I make no apologies for being a constitutional Republican.We should never apologise for being Irish, as Deputy Andrews said, although some people have attacked us in that regard.  I want safeguards I can understand and it is important that those who are making decisions in regard to the extradition of citizens have a proven track record.  I am happy that everything done under this measure will be subject to review.  It is unfortunate that the fact that the annual report of the Attorney General in regard to extradition will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for review has been skipped over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly in a subtle way asked the Minister to let the British know that the House in adopting this measure can change its views or rescind the measure. It is important to have an annual review to keep track of what is going on.  If there are mistakes &mdash; it is important to remember that people are not infallible, even those in politics &mdash; we should be able to deal with them at the time of our annual review.  I appeal to Members not to vote against the measure for purely political reasons or from an anti-Government motivation.  Deputy Andrews referred to the recent kidnapping and the criticisms of the Garda.  I should like to take this opportunity to say that the least beneficial thing that could happen to the Garda at the outset of their investigations was to have a trial of the Force by the media.  At that time members of the Force were risking their lives investigating that kidnapping.  It is shocking that during that event gardaí were questioned as to why they took certain action before they had completed their investigations.That is not good enough and did not benefit anybody.  It was not good entertainment, was not good for the public, the Garda or for law and order. <Col N="83" /> While such a programme might mean interesting viewing for some people, at the end of the day it did not do any good for the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions in the Bill will provide safeguards for those whose extradition is being sought.  The ordinary Joe Soap does not want to be confused by legal terminology and he has to accept the word of certain people that the provisions are valid and necessary.  I accept that view and I recommend that the Bill be passed by the House.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Dennehy has left the Chamber without hearing my contribution.  In my view he was looking for the best of both worlds.  He seemed to have difficulty in understanding what has changed in the past 12 months in relation to the parties who then formed the Coalition Government but ended his contribution by pointing out that last year Deputy Kelly reminded the <Col N="84" /> Government that things change all the time and that in those circumstances legislation should be constantly reviewed.  I accept that Deputy Dennehy prefaced his remarks by saying he was a layman delving into very difficult legal terminology but he must understand that with the introduction of any new legislation there is a certain amount of experimentation involved.  What we try to do is shape the rules for civilised society and, obviously, that will be subject to changes at all times.  In the past 12 months I have had an opportunity of studying and observing the administration of the British system of justice in greater detail and I should like to put on record a number of points in regard to this.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of debate about the contents of the Bill inside and outside the House.  I was very anxious that the House should have an opportunity of debating this issue, as is its entitlement.  I regret a great amount of the debate has been founded on a total misconception of the powers of the safeguards we have been told are in the Bill. I listened last Sunday to a discussion on radio about the Bill.  It involved the leader of one of the parties in the House and I got the impression that the person involved, and the person interviewing, operated throughout on the assumption that the Bill imposed certain obligations on the Attorney General and that individual warrants could only be proceeded with if the Attorney General agreed to them.  This assumption is entirely inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest some people take umbrage at my statements I should like to preface my remarks by saying that the present office holder, a fine upstanding lawyer, and former Attorneys General have served the State well.  That should not muzzle us when we are looking at new obligations which are being given to the Office of the Attorney General, irrespective of who the office holder is at any given time, or irrespective of what political party he is associated with.  In this Bill the assumption is entirely inaccurate.  It imposes no obligation whatever on the Attorney General.  It gives him the power to stop <Col N="85" /> a warrant.  There is no sense in which the Attorney General must exercise that power; there is no obligation on him to get involved at any stage in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I make this point even though it was made by the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Taylor, but unfortunately to date it would appear that this point which I consider to be of fundamental importance when it comes to understanding this Bill, has not been emphasised enough.  I want to stress this misunderstanding of the role being given to the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Bill must be looked at in context &mdash; in the context of the overall 1965 legislation, in particular in the context of the sections immediately preceding these new powers, and in the context of the practice of extradition procedures generally.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the 1965 Act obliges the Garda Commissioner to endorse an extradition warrant for execution, provided certain minimum things have been complied with.  Section 44 empowers, not obliges, the Minister for Justice to refuse to endorse that warrant if he believes it should not be endorsed.  Several grounds are specified for his refusal to endorse a warrant &mdash; if a political offence is involved, or an offence under military law, or a revenue offence.  He has the power also, under the section, to refer any question in his mind to the High Court and the High Court may, if the question is referred to them, refuse to endorse a warrant on the same grounds.</P>
    <P>Within the existing legislation, there is no obligation on the Garda Commissioner to consult the Minister and there is no obligation on the Minister to consult the High Court.  There is no obligation on any of the three parties to refuse to back a warrant, no matter what the offence is.  In fact, the Garda Commissioner must back a warrant irrespective of the offence involved and the Minister can stay out of the proceedings entirely.</P>
    <P>The consequence of all this is to be seen in the history of extradition proceedings since the Act was brought in 23 years <Col N="86" /> ago.  Upwards of 1,000 people have been the subject of extradition warrants from the United Kingdom and from Northern Ireland in that time.  The Minister for Justice has not intervened once in all that time to refuse to endorse a warrant and this has happened despite the fact that there have been a number of occasions when his intervention would have led to a warrant being refused, that is to say, on those occasions when a political offence was involved.  In every case where warrants were refused on the grounds of a political offence they were refused by the High Court after an application by the suspect himself under section 50 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the 1965 Act contains a power for the Minister for Justice to refuse to endorse a warrant.  It has never once been used.  It was put in as a safeguard, but it never worked.  The reason it never worked is that it was a power and not an obligation.  Ministers for Justice down through the years would have had different reasons for declining to exercise that power.  One reason would be that they were never asked to do so by the Garda Commissioner or anyone else. Another reason would be that individual Ministers would have seen an involvement by them as politicising the process. Yet another would be that an intervention by the Minister &mdash; who is, after all, a member of the Government &mdash; could be upsetting to the &ldquo;Government to Government relations&rdquo; that the Taoiseach referred to in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason, the fact is that one of the principal safeguards inserted in the 1965 Act was never used.  It is ironic in the extreme that the Minister for Justice who inserted a safeguard in 1965 is now the Taoiseach who wishes to insert a safeguard in 1986.  Regrettably the 1965 safeguard was an illusion.  Will the 1987 safeguard be an illusion too?</P>
    <P>The similarities between this new safeguard and the old one are striking.  In both cases, the power is given, but not the obligation.  In both cases, there is no mechanism for precipitating any involvement.In both cases, even in the case of an intervention, the exercise of power is <Col N="87" /> entirely discretionary and in both cases, the reasons for not getting involved at all are equally valid.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed in its present form, Attorneys General in the future will have to decide if an intervention by them would be seen as the politicisation of what is essentially a judicial process.  They will have to weigh up the consequences of their intervention against the possible diplomatic fall-out, for example, and the consequences for relations between the Government he serves and the Government of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In short, no doubt the reasons Ministers for Justice never intervened in the extradition process, despite having the power to do so, seemed overwhelming to them.  Exactly the same reasons apply to any other politically-appointed officer of the Government.  For all these reasons, I believe that if this Act is passed, the safeguards allegedly contained in it will never be activated.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to speculate that the British authorities know that or that they have been given quiet assurances that this legislation will not disturb the process in any way.  But I am quite certain that the British authorities will be fully aware that the equivalent safeguard already present in the Act has never been activated in the entire history of the Act.</P>
    <P>To say, therefore, that the safeguards inherent in this Bill are an illusion is probably understating the case.  It has all the appearance of a piece of legislation which was designed solely for the purpose of offering shelter to those Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have hang-ups about the whole principle of extradition.</P>
    <P>There is another vital point that arises in this connection.  The last Government, in their consideration of the arrangements necessary to ensure safeguards of a civil libertarian character, secured certain arrangements.  These arrangements were secured by way of agreement with the British authorities.  They placed an obligation on the British Attorney General to confirm in writing to the Irish Attorney General that a warrant had only <Col N="88" /> been sought because the British prosecuting authorities were satisfied that there was a clear probability of a prosecution based on a sufficiency of admissible evidence and that all relevant requirements had been complied with.  I emphasise that those arrangements were put in place by agreement, and they involved the British authorities undertaking particular obligations.</P>
    <P>Has this safeguard now disappeared? Is it now the position that there is no obligation on the British Attorney General to do anything unless the Irish Attorney General intervenes?  Since there are overwhelming reasons to believe that the Irish Attorney General will never intervene, as I have pointed out, it now appears to be the case that the Government have allowed a real and practical safeguard to wither, in favour of a safeguard which is totally illusory. How can the Government or the spokespersons describe this action as responsible?</P>
    <P>We will be putting forward amendments on Committee Stage which will have the effect of writing in real safeguards to the legislation which the Labour Party consider very necessary. Those amendments will include what we regard as the minimum safeguard necessary, namely, that the courts will be asked to endorse warrants on the basis that there is a case to answer.  The question will be asked, no doubt: why after all these years is it now necessary to introduce safeguards that were introduced in 1965?</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act which comes into operation today limits the operation of one of the safeguards inherent in present legislation by limiting the definition of a political offence.  This in itself is welcome to anyone who believes, as I do, that naked terrorism should never be allowed to masquerade as political action.  But the change that is coming about must make us look carefully at the need for the protection of basic civil liberties and human rights &mdash; and one of the most basic of those rights is the right to a fair trial for any citizen, in this instance obviously for Irish citizens.  Concern about the right <Col N="89" /> in particular has been amplified by the conduct of the Birmingham Six hearing. I make no secret here that the conduct of that hearing, so far as I can make a judgment from carefully following the reports from the Old Bailey, leaves a lot to be desired.  It confirms me in the view that extradition is a very serious process, a process which must be taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>The difficulty here is that we are extraditing our citizens to a jurisdiction where many of them feel there is a danger that they will not receive equal treatment before the law.  I do not want to comment on whether this perception is based on reality, but in all my contacts with Irish citizens living in Britain, and they are many, I have to say that there is a very real sense that they are likely to be treated as third-class citizens by the British judiciary.  I have lived and worked in Britain myself &mdash; and been glad of the opportunity to do so &mdash; and I understand that perception very well.  There are, of course, times when the perception is stronger than at other times, but it is nevertheless the case that our citizens expect &mdash; and they are entitled to expect &mdash; that we will take special care in relation to any foreign jurisdiction where there is a doubt about the issue of equal treatment before the law.</P>
    <P>I do not ever want it said of our jurisdiction that it is a haven for terrorism.  I know that is not true and we should all be grateful for the efforts of the Garda in recent weeks &mdash; and for many years past &mdash; in combating terrorism and ensuring that this State is not a haven for terrorists and never will be.</P>
    <P>When we talk about safeguards, we must ensure that the safeguards implemented in our legislation dealing with the extradition of suspects to other jurisdictions will mean that the rights of Irish citizens are not treated in a cavalier fashion.  Obviously we must extradite but we must insert real, viable safeguards into our legislation governing extradition and that is what the Labour Party will seek to do on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill <Col N="90" /> by the Government is a clear recognition of the urgent need to protect and safeguard Irish citizens from being offhandedly and casually handed over for trial to a foreign power, specifically to Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is consistent with the stance taken by Fianna Fáil since Ireland first signed the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in February 1986.  We made it quite clear at that time that, in conjunction with the coming into being of the Convention, adequate safeguards must be included in our extradition legislation.</P>
      <P>There have been three much publicised occurrences in the weeks leading up to this debate, one in our own State, one in Northern Ireland and one off the coast of France.  I speak, of course, of the O'Grady kidnapping, the Enniskillen bombing and the <i>Eksund</i> affair.  The carnage that occurred in Enniskillen must be condemned by all civilised people.  No right thinking person could condone the taking of human life in this cold, callous and bloody manner.  The events surrounding the O'Grady kidnapping were equally repulsive and one's blood runs cold to even contemplate the mental and physical suffering which this unfortunate man experienced in captivity but however unjustifiable and regrettable these events were, they must not <i>per se</i> be the reason for or the motivation behind decisions taken by this House regarding the serious issue of extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have memories spanning centuries of such atrocities perpertrated on them by the English.  Such dwelling on the past serves no useful purpose today but it is significant that our people have a basic, in-built mistrust of England, a lack of credibility in her justice and an inherent awareness of her anti-Irish prejudice.  As far back as 1877, in a speech in Manchester, Charles Stewart Parnell said he believed that you may go on trying to conciliate English prejudice until the day of judgment and that you would not get the breadth of his nail from them.  He said we will never gain a single sixpenny worth from them by conciliation.  There is ample evidence <Col N="91" /> to suggest that the same prejudice to which the great Parnell referred 110 years ago still obtains to this very day.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the safeguards included in the Bill must be considered and brought into law, not only for the protection of those who may be the subject of extradition warrants but for the peace of mind and reassurance of the Irish people as a whole.  Much has been said and written about the need for improvements in the administration of justice and in the security system in Northern Ireland.  However, the many calls for the introduction of these improvements appear to have fallen on deaf ears.  Despite the lack of response to these demands and the absence of any formal commitment in this direction, the British Government continue to expect us to row in with the extradition without demur.</P>
    <P>Much British pressure has been applied to ensure that we will implement extradition and the more simple and facile our mode of implementation the better they would welcome it.  They have already voiced their aversion to what we are proposing to do, stitching into our legislation appropriate measures to ensure the protection of innocent Irish citizens.  This attitude is extremely difficult to reconcile with their own track record in the area of extradition.  Britain down the years has had a reputation of being one of the most difficult countries in the world from which to secure fugitives, even those of non-British origin, not to mention their own citizens.  However, we must also consider this entire matter in the context of our European involvement and the high hopes our citizens hold for future economic benefit with our European partners. We have already taken a decision not to remain economically isolated.  We decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the massive European marketplace will be available to us in future years.  Could we now, as has been suggested, seriously consider not ratifying the European Convention?</P>

      <P>The Government have, to date, allocated a total sum of £10.1 million to the health and welfare areas from the proceeds of the national lottery.  In May 1987, the sum of £2 million was provided to finance the activities of the Health Education Bureau during 1987.  A further provision of £100,000 to develop services for the elderly and £2 million for the 1988 Health Capital Programme was approved subsequently.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government announced on 19 November 1987 that a further sum of £6 million is to be allocated to the health and welfare area. Final decisions on the detailed distribution of these funds are now being taken.  Accordingly, I will, in the near future, be notifying the various agencies who are to benefit from the distribution of national lottery revenue in 1987 and in <Col N="93" /> 1988 of their individual allocations.  In broad terms the allocation of £6 million will be expended on the following health programmes:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that in determining the final distribution of national lottery proceeds I have taken into account the views of health boards and voluntary agencies involved in the daily provision of health services.

      <P>A final decision on the allocation for individual projects has not been taken yet.  A sum of £2.262 million will be allocated for services for the physically and mentally handicapped, this being allocated for the implementation of resocialisation programmes designed to assist in the transfer of patients from institutional to community-based services.The object is to ensure that such persons will, through a programme of resocialisation be able to meet the challenge to live independently in their own community.  The programme will necessitate the purchase of houses, the provision of day nursing facilities, day care centres, and the employment of house parents to encourage independent attitudes and behaviour.</P>
      <P>A sum of £888,000 will be allocated for the provision of services for the elderly and this will be spent on the development of community-based services.  The provision of these services will reduce the level of admission of the elderly to institutional care and, at the same time, greatly enhance the lifestyle of our senior citizens.  The £700,000 for the psychiatric services will accelerate the continuing programme of deinstitutionalising long stay psychiatric patients.  The programme will involve the provision of a range of modern community-based facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is being provided <Col N="95" /> for the development of community information and development services.  Particular attention will be given to the services provided by voluntary agencies but it is intended that they will operate within a broader framework than heretofore provided under the aegis of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>A total of £450,000 will be spent in 1987 and 1988 on the provision of AIDS prevention programmes.  Special emphasis will be placed on the need to minimise the spread of HIV infection amongst intravenous drug abusers.  To date there have been 26 cases of AIDS and 13 deaths here.</P>
    <P>A sum of £700,000 is to be provided for the development of a range of services to facilitate investigation and management of cases of child abuse.

      <P>It has been agreed by the management side and the Irish Medical Organisation that, having regard to the delicacy of the negotiations and the importance being attached to the talks, details of the proceedings would remain confidential.  I can say, however, that the preliminary stage of the negotiations, whereby both sides are considering the key issues, is proceeding constructively.</P>

      <P>I do not have the information requested in the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question which, in fact, is a separate question altogether. With regard to his second question &mdash; the common contract &mdash; I should say that consultants are paid a fee for a limited number of hours of work.

      <P>I initiated discussion on the review of the common contract.  I attended the first meeting held between the management side and the Irish Medical Organisation on 8 September last.  At that meeting I stressed the need for both sides to work together with a sense of urgency to examine the existing arrangement for consultants.  I should say that consultants, through their pivotal role, control the resources deployed in our hospitals system.  It is essential that hospital consultants work in a setting which ensures that resources are used effectively and with regard to the need for accountability.  There have been three meetings to discuss the review of the common contract to date, one on 8 September last, another on 6 October last, another on 17 November and the next has been set for Thursday, 10 December 1987.</P>

In view of the complicated matters to be resolved, <Col N="98" /> would he agree that it could be years before any decisions are taken, or a year anyway?  In view of the widening gap, which is proceeding at an accelerated pace, between private and public medicine in this country and the general concern felt by the community generally about this development, would the Minister not agree that there is a great degree of urgency in ensuring that these talks are brought to a satisfactory conclusion as speedily as possible so that we will know in what direction Government health policy intends to move in the years ahead?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I accept your ruling on my earlier supplementary.Could the Minister make the figures I sought available separately? Would the Minister agree that the erosion of the existing contract concerning the percentage of beds in public hospitals available to consultants for their private patients now far exceeds the actual terms of the contract, is touching 40 per cent of all public beds in public hospitals rather than the 15 per cent maximum originally intended?</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary, I will ascertain whether it is possible to provide the relevant information, although I doubt it because I doubt that individual hospitals would have that information available to them.  As regards the consultants and the number of beds, perhaps we have laid too much emphasis on the number of beds.  It is the number of patients and the procedures carried out for them in those beds that I would consider to be important.</P>

Furthermore, would he agree that the use <Col N="100" /> of beds in public hospitals is of prime importance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 178 together.  It is the intention that a charge will be introduced in certain circumstances for persons who avail of in-patient services in hospitals outside their board's functional area without the approval of their board or in the absence of an agreement between the board and the relevant external hospital for the provision of specified services.</P>
      <P>These measures are necessary to ensure that, where services of appropriate quality are available locally, a person will not have unrestricted access to similar external services.  The necessary legislation to give effect to these measures will be introduced in the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
      <P>At this point in time it is not possible to indicate the yield in a full year from such charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements will be discussed with the appropriate officers of the health boards.  The health boards will be informed as to how the system will work.  Obviously the decision will be a <Col N="102" /> clinical one based on the doctor's view as to whether such treatment can be provided in a patients's own health board area.  Certainly I see no reason why a very ill patient should suffer because such a patient can be treated either in his or her own health board area and if appropriate that is where such a patient should be treated but the area may not have the high-tech facilities in which case the patient will be transferred to an appropriate hospital outside that health board area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures for the cost to each health board but shall forward the cost to each health board for services outside their area.  I accept that all the services provided outside the health board area could not necessarily be provided within that area.  Two health boards in particular have raised this issue and are concerned about the amount of funding spent on hospital services outside their area.  We want to try to ensure that, for example, a patient suffering from appendicitis would not leave a health board area in the country and come, say to a Dublin hospital where the charges are very high in the high-tech hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance to the House that it is only when patients leave their own health board areas that these charges will be implemented?

With regard to the decision as to what services are available in the health board area, the services which are available to everybody would be obvious.  It will be a clinical decision based on the doctor's opinion.  If the doctor believes the patient should be sent out for a service, it would be his opinion that would count.

      <P>Naturally, I am concerned that all health contributions which are due would be collected.  In the years 1985 and 1986 the health boards succeeded in collecting arrears that had been outstanding for some time.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.  The board have informed me that with the revised bed complement at Roscommon Hospital, and access to Galway Regional and Portiuncula Hospitals, adequate arrangements are in place to provide hospital services for the population of Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The board considers that community nursing and home help services in County Roscommon are adequate to meet the needs of the area.  If any additional funding is required it will be a matter for the Western Health Board to make this available from within their approved non-capital allocation for 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the bed complement in Roscommon County Hospital has been reduced from 135 to 60 in the past number of months? Is he also aware that at present, due to the reduction in the number of beds in the Castlebar, the regional and Merlin Park hospitals, no alternative arrangements have been made for Roscommon patients?  Is the Minister further aware of the deep concern expressed by the people of Roscommon, of the rejection by the <Col N="108" /> members of the Western Health Board of the 60 bed concept and of the deep concern expressed by the medical and surgical staff there at the lack of facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but let me say to the Deputy that in regard to the number of beds, the number of in-patients in the hospital in October was 44 and the number of beds in the hospital was 58.  It would appear therefore that a sufficient number of beds to cater for the needs of patients in the Roscommon area was available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 22 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>There is no irradiation of food taking place in this country and no commercial enterprise has applied to the Nuclear Energy Board under the nuclear energy order, 1977 to use an irradiation device in regard to food.</P>
      <P>At present there is no test to determine whether a foodstuff has been irradiated. Labelling of irradiated foodstuffs will ensure that the consumer is properly informed.  The EC is currently addressing the question of the labelling of irradiated foodstuffs and, when the relevant EC Directives are adopted, these will form the basis of Irish legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>Irradiation is a widely accepted technology for the preservation of food and the destruction of harmful food pathogens.Following extensive international research the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, and the International Atomic Energy Agency have accepted the safety of the process and have approved food irradiation for use on certain foods at specified levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foodstuffs which are being irradiated abroad at present and are most likely to be eventually imported into Ireland are strawberries and spices.  The other foods which are more commonly <Col N="110" /> irradiated abroad are grains, potatoes, mushrooms and chicken products.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently involved in the preparation of an EC Directive to regulate food irradiation, which will include specific labelling requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a wide range of foods coming into this country which have been irradiated and that people are becoming increasingly concerned about this?  Many do not wish to eat foods which have been irradiated.  What are the Minister's Department doing to ensure that foods which have been irradiated at the very least are labelled so that members of the public would know what they are eating? What is the Minister doing about this matter besides talking about directives which will not be implemented for many years go come?  We are talking about now and the concern which has been expressed by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency have accepted the safety of the process and have approved food irradiation for use on certain foods at specified levels. Officials of my Department are involved in the preparation of an EC Directive to regulate food irradiation.  It is important that there should be labelling and we will try to ensure that that is done as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that many people would not be totally happy with statements made by the World Health Organisation or anybody else to the effect that it is in order for them to eat irradiated foods?  Leaving aside what the World Health Organisation may or may not be doing I ask the Minister whether he is going to bring in directives and controls on foodstuffs to ensure that those which had been irradiated are clearly marked?  Is the Minister not aware that this is a technique not used for health purposes but rather <Col N="111" /> to make the product look more shiny, fancy and attractive and is used in the interests of good business rather than in the interests of health?  People should not be compelled to eat foods which have been subjected to irradiation if they do not want to do so.  I put it to the Minister that there is an obligation on him as Minister for Health to ensure that the information is made available now and not in a few years time when the World Health Organisation may or may not get around to dealing with the matter, depending on what lobbies may be involved at that end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have legislation at present specifically relating to the irradiation of food.  However, the food safety legislation which prohibits the sale of food not of the mature, substantial or quality demanded or the sale of food unfit for human consumption, such as the Sale of Food and Drugs Act or the food hygiene regulations, could be used to prevent the importation or sale of irradiated foods but, as I have said, it is not clear what foods have been irradiated before reaching here as it is not necessary to label the foods.</P>
    </Speaker>

There is a feeling that they are aloof from the people and are not accountable to the Department of Health, to this House or to the local authorities.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has considered the proposals in the 1984 development brief for the upgrading of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15; his views on these proposals; whether any funds have been provided in the 1988 capital allocation for this purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the funding and management of James Connolly Memorial Hospital was transferred to the Eastern Health Board on 30 September 1987. The hospital will contine to function as an acute general hospital providing general <Col N="115" /> medical, general surgical and casualty services to its catchment population.  It will continue to participate in the general arrangements for the provision of accident and emergency services and will cooperate with the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals in the provision of a wide range of out-patient clinics for the higher medical specialties.  Services at the hospital will be fully integrated with all other health and welfare services provided in its catchment area.</P>
    <P>The development brief for the James Connolly Memorial Hospital is being considered in my Department in the context of the capital funds available and of plans for the rationalisation of acute hospital services in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the James Connolly Memorial Hospital was intended originally as a hospital which would provide services to that very expanding area of Blanchardstown and environs and was to operate in tandem with the Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital to service the north side and that included in the services which were planned were a paediatric service and a maternity service?Are those two services to be provided?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The future development of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital is being studied by my Department.At present the hospital has 308 beds and will continue to provide acute hospital services for the people in that area of the north city.  I am glad to say that Beaumont Hospital was opened on Sunday and will improve considerably the level of service available in the north city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the future of this hospital is now being decided in the Department of Health or in the EHB?  Will he confirm that the process of the past year when services were knocked off this hospital is now ended and that its future is secure? Was that for 1986 or is it seen as an integral part of the services for Dublin for the future?  The management of the hospital and the services will be primarily the responsibility of the EHB as the hospital has been handed over to them since 30 September.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister because of the crisis that exists in the care of the elderly at present where the accommodation situation is appalling if he will consider transferring the role of some of the hospitals, which are now under threat, to care for the elderly.  For example, in my own city, could the North Infirmary, which is very much in the news, now be converted into a hospital for the elderly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there <Col N="118" /> is a crisis existing in regard to hospital accommodation for the elderly. I accept there are gaps in the service and, indeed, there were gaps in the service long before I came into office.  I am awaiting this report and I hope to be in a position to do something about it.  On the question of providing hospital facilities I made a decision, and reversed the decision of my predecessor, to maintain Baggot Street Hospital as a community hospital in the city and, hopefully, it will alleviate the need for hospital accommodation for the elderly, or at least part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's response in terms of gaps that existed before he came into office, will he accept that at this time there is not a single geriatric bed available in County Wexford since the closure of Browns-wood Hospital, Enniscorthy?  This is a tremendous cause of concern for general practitioners who have no reference point now for elderly patients in rural isolated areas.  What steps does he propose to take to fill that particular gap which has come into existence since he assumed office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-one bone marrow transplant operations on children have taken place in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, since 1984. Fifty transplants have taken place mostly on adults in St. James's Hospital in the same period.</P>
      <P>In order to make the best possible use of our limited resources, it has already been decided that a National Bone Marrow Transplant Unit should be developed through close co-operation and a high degree of integration between those involved in St. James's and Our Lady's Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently made arrangements to meet with the managers and clinicians <Col N="120" /> involved to discuss at first hand the steps necessary to develop a unified, fully developed, bone marrow transplantation service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, am I to understand there is one designated centre for bone marrow transplants for children and that that is intended in the future to be St. James's Hospital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now, bone marrow transplants are being carried out in two hospitals, St. James's and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.  It is my desire that there should be a unified approach to bone marrow transplantation.With that in mind I have invited the managers and the clinicians to meet me on 9 December to discuss having such a unified approach and having one national bone marrow transplant centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister if he has spoken to those involved in the bone marrow transplant unit in Crumlin to date?  The people who have informed me are aware that the treatment of children should not be handed over to a general hospital where there would be a mixture of children and adults.  Secondly, is the Minister aware that the expertise, the machinery, equipment and so on are in Crumlin and have been used at a minimal cost compared with UK unit costs and have survived to date?  What does he intend doing with this expertise and with these pieces of equipment in Crumlin if they are not to be used in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

I did not suggest there would be one specific centre and that it was the only centre that would be used at St. James's.  I said I was meeting the managers and the clinicians to ensure a unified approach to this problem to ensure that the very highest level of service would be available.  The centre may well be placed in both hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on a recent report (details supplied) that the joint committee of his Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal which has been examining the rationalisation of acute hospital services in this country has recommended the closure of a further 15 hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I say that the report referred to was not a report of a joint committee of my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It was <Col N="126" /> a preliminary copy of an internal working document which the comhairle were considering on what they believe might be the future long-term shape of the hospital system.  I might say that as Minister for Health I have received a number of reports offering me advice on a variety of topics.  May I say that I welcome such advice?</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a review of the acute care hospital system earlier this year and as part of this review I consulted widely with all interests involved in the delivery of these services. Many of the findings of this review are now being implemented as part of the rationalisation of the acute hospital system and this rationalisation has not been influenced in any way by the document.In conclusion may I repeat that the document in question has no official standing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the committee who released the document were appointed by him, that he was given guidelines that they should achieve a one-third reduction in acute hospital beds and a reduction of £165 million in hospital allocations?  Would the Minister now confirm to the House that the following hospitals are safe and will remain open: Cherry Orchard, Peamount, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, Bantry and Mallow hospitals?  Will the three voluntary hospitals and the orthopaedic hospital in Cork city continue and will the hospitals in Airmount, Waterford, Cashel, Clonmel and Nenagh survive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated, the document referred to by the <Col N="127" /> Deputy was not requested by me.  It was an internal working document from Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, within their rights, may advise the Minister or any other body established under the Health Act, 1970, on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services.  I made it clear in this House that, so far as I am concerned, the acute hospitals to be closed have either been closed or are in the process of being closed at present.  I made that clear to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone did I say that when this report was published, but also speaking to the chairman and CEOs of the health boards when they received their allocations I informed them that I did not see any reason why there should be further acute hospital closures.  In regard to some of the hospitals Deputy Allen mentioned, for example, Cherry Orchard Hospital, obviously the role of that hospital should be reviewed in the light of the fact that there has been a drop in the number of infectious diseases and perhaps the spare bed capacity could be used up for some other purpose.  As regard the closure of acute hospitals, it is not my intention that there should be any further closures of acute hospitals other than those that have been already announced and are either closed or in the process of being closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the comment made by the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board that hospitals in the region must close in 1988 because of a £4 million reduction in that health board's allocation for 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments made by the chief executive officer <Col N="128" /> of the South-Eastern Health Board that it is not likely that the board will be able to avoid further acute hospital closures in 1988 as a result of its allocation for next year.  It is a matter for the board in the first instance to determine a budget within allocation and to take whatever measures it considers necessary to live within its approved allocation.  Nevertheless, I am concerned at the comments of the chief executive officer since it is my belief that there should be no further hospital closures in 1988 other than those which are already in train.</P>
      <P>However, this is a matter for consideration by the board itself in the first instance and I will ensure that the management of the board receive all the necessary help and assistance from officials of my Department in framing a budget which will hopefully avoid the need for hospital closures.  Pending the passing of a budget by the board for 1988 I do not propose to say anything further on the matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister's reply to this question and his reply to a previous supplementary are contradictory.  Earlier he said that there would be no further closures in the coming year and now the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board is saying that at least five hospitals will close.  Will the Minister give an assurance that a sufficient allocation will be given to the South Eastern Health Board to secure the survival of hospitals such as Gorey District Hospital, Dungarvan District Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, St. Otteran's Psychiatric hospital in Waterford and the Haughton Hospital in New Ross?  Will the Minister guarantee that these hospitals will survive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive officer <Col N="129" /> of the South Eastern Health Board has said that the reduction of the allocation from £91.26 million this year to £87.24 million for next year will ensure that some hospitals under the control of that health board will close.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the evidence in the recent Eastern Health Board report that few women in the high risk groups come forward for cervical smear testing and if he will indicate whether he intends to introduce a comprehensive screening or smear testing programme to ensure all women are offered a test.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 55 together.  Cervical smear tests are available on request to all women through general practitioners, clinics organised by health boards, maternity hospitals and family planning clinics.  It is available without charge to women who are exempt from charges under the Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Eastern Health Board Report on Cancer of the Uterine Cervix suggests that the epidemiological factors related to this disease in Ireland are similar to those reported in international studies.  These studies have shown a greater incidence of cervical cancer among women from lower income groups, older women and women of high parity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> An application for funding of a pilot scheme for cervical smear testing has been received from the Eastern Health Board.  It is being considered in my Department in the context of the other competing proposals for funding.</P>
    <P>A study on cervical cytology screening is at present being undertaken by the Faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland. The agreed objectives of the project are:</P>
    <P>1.  To review the present organisation of services by addressing such questions as where services are currently being provided, and by whom; what, if any, is the target population; what are the characteristics of the population utilising the service; and what resources are being devoted to the service.</P>
    <P>2.  To evaluate the service against the criteria suggested for a successful screening service.</P>
    <P>The project is funded by my Department and is expected to be completed in June of next year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I have set up a group chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department to let me have by mid-January detailed proposals to improve the existing service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the plans, if any, he has to review <Col N="131" /> the decision made in 1982 to delist 900 items under the General Medical Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1982 the then Government delisted the vast majority of &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; items from the GMS.  That decision arose from a specific recommendation of the Trident Report and was essentially endorsed by that Government's successors in office, with some relatively minor modifications.</P>
      <P>The items which remain excluded from the GMS scheme are characterised by the fact that they are quite inexpensive to purchase.  As the term &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; implies, these products are available for retail purchase without any need for a doctor's prescription.  Many of these products are sold in a variety of retail outlets, including pharmacies, super-markets etc.</P>
      <P>Very significant savings have accrued to the Exchequer in each year since these products were delisted.  I am monitoring all aspects of the General Medical Service in the context of the negotiations with the IMO in regard to the remuneration of doctors participating in the scheme and in relation to the supply of drugs and medicine to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that the delisting in 1982 was justified.  After such a period of time there is evidence that certain drugs which are more expensive are now being prescribed within the GMS by doctors to get over the delisting factor.  Would the Minister agree that there is evidence that we have the highest usage of Ponstan <i>per capita</i> anywhere in the world, as well as one of the highest usages of Tagamet and Zantac because they are substitutes for the cheaper drugs which have been delisted?  Would the Minister consider delisting those items as well as one or two of the expensive cough mixtures?  Is he prepared to consider delisting certain items?</P>

Is the Minister aware that the future of one of the best processing plants in Europe which employs 200 people has been endangered by the idle talk and unsubstantiated evidence of diseases?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we, as has been suggested, have seriously considered not ratifying the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism?  Could we realisitcally have considered distancing ourselves in this way from our European partners?  What would be the effects of such a decision?  Would we be conveying to the world the impression that we were enamoured of violence and supporters of subversives and terrorist tactics?  Would we be setting up our country as a base or haven for the criminals and terrorists of Europe?  Would that approach ensure the safety and security of our country?  Would it ensure the safety and security of our people now and for generations to come? I think not.  The correct course is to combine the ratification of the European <Col N="251" /> Convention with the safeguarding measures proposed in the Bill.  I would have preferred to combine the former with a full <i>prima facie</i> provision in our legislation but I accept that is not attainable.</P>
      <P>What is attainable has been incorporated in the Bill.  I have listened attentively to the views of legally qualified Members on this issue and I have been intrigued by the contradictory interpretations.I do not have a legal qualification but I am satisfied that the best legal advice has been secured to assist in the preparation of the Bill.  Consequently, I am satisfied that the proposed role of the Attorney General will ensure that the individual whose extradition is sought will be afforded adequate safeguards in keeping with his rights.  By the same token I am satisfied that this process will in no way inhibit the justifiable extradition exercise.  I am enamoured of the inclusion of the provision for introducing a rule of specialty as a statutory measure. That will have the effect of ensuring that a person extradited is not subjected to additional charges for non-extraditable offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of a provision on lapse of time is also to be welcomed.  I have heard concern voiced about that on many occasions recently.  I welcome the decision to statutorily monitor the entire procedure.  The regular report by the Attorney General to the Government can be carefully scrutinised with a view to making any necessary corrective measures to the procedures.  That provision in itself is a safeguard that will ensure the continued effectiveness of the legislation. I am satisfied that among the great majority of people there exists serious apprehension regarding this issue.  To have to transfer one's own countrymen to a foreign jurisdiction, especially to England or Northern Ireland, will prove to be extremely emotive and traumatic. There will be great concern whether guilt is involved, whether there will be interrogation and whether a fair application of justice will prevail.  It is in that context that the safeguards in the Bill will <Col N="252" /> prove of major significance.  I wish the measure passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to offer to the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Justice, my sincere congratulations for having put together machinery that will succeed in allaying the fears of the Irish people that an injustice might be done while simultaneously enabling us to join with our European partners in the battle against international terrorism thereby portraying to the world the full extent of Irish responsibility in this regard.</P>

      <P>This debate on today, 1 December, could be associated in the minds of people with the saying about the closing of the stable door after the horse has gone.  The 1987 Act, with all its objectionable features, came into operation at midnight.  It appears for a considerable time that the objections, and they are many, would succeed in having that Act suitably amended.  It is difficult for the Members of the House, and particularly the public, to dissociate the introduction and the coming into operation of the 1987 Act last night from the clamour that there has been about the recent atrocity in Enniskillen, the kidnapping on this side of the Border and the capture of the <i>Eksund</i> off the French coast.  They were matters of the gravest importance but to come to the conclusion in this House, either through the efforts of well meaning people in the media, through the public or Members of the House deluding themselves that those incidents were reasons why a law which is wrong, was wrong a month ago, is wrong today and will be wrong next month, should be passed is incorrect.  I do not think that those happenings, unfortunate though they were, should be the basis on which the fears of the public, usefully expressed in recent weeks against the excesses possible under the 1987 Act, are a justification for that Act coming into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fell into the same trap a considerable number of years ago.  Some Deputies will recall the Dublin bombings when many people were killed. That night a vote in this House was <Col N="253" /> altered radically because of that event. We know that happened, that the result of the vote in this House was different because of the bombing.  The repeated mentioning of these three happenings in recent times can be dangerously misleading because while in themselves they are horrific acts they are not a basis on which we can justify allowing to become law, legislation which is intrinsically bad, dangerous and unfair to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I am not against extradition.  Last Friday some Deputies spoke in scathing terms about my being a member of the then Government when the 1965 Act went through, as if this did not give me the right to speak against this legislation. A couple of things have happened since 1965 which would have changed anybody's mind, never mind mine.  In 1965 we passed an Act which had a political exemption enshrined in it.  This Act has been in operation for the past 20 years. However, some time ago there was the hastily called hearing of the Supreme Court which directed the delivery of McGlinchey across the Border, no doubt to show our goodwill from a Government whose leader was to meet the British Prime Minister the following week.  That was an offering but it radically changed what was put through this House in 1965. I can safely say that had that political exemption not been enshrined in the 1965 Act it never would have passed through this House, in fact it would never have been brought before this House.  Yet, having used the provisions of this Act for the past 20 years, it is now being upended.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise, and it is probably even more important, is the jurisdiction of the Six Counties and Great Britain.  In the last 17 years they have exposed to the world in all its nakedness their maladministration of justice so far as Irish people are concerned.  That state of affairs did not exist in 1965.  Had it done so, the 1965 Act would never have been brought before the House, even with the political exemption enshrined in it.  Last night, 22 years later, we should not have allowed that Extradition Act to have become law because it is the most <Col N="254" /> extreme form of extradition on the Statute Book of any civilised country.</P>
    <P>To those who plead, and some who believe, that under the European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism, we must introduce that Act, let us ask ourselves why, for nine years, we objected to and did not sign that Convention while other countries did so, despite some of the worst troubles which have erupted in the Six Counties since 1969?  Why was this acceptable in 1986? Was it not because it was the most important part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave us nothing but took from us a promise to sign a Convention, as a result of which we were obliged to bring in the Extradition Act to which I and the majority of people object?</P>
    <P>We in this part of the country have been in a position to freely elect our own Government for a very short period.  Can we, no matter how we attempt to safeguard our citizens, face up to the prospect of sending any Irish citizen across the Border or across the Channel and expect from either jurisdiction a fair trial?  Think of what has been happening in recent times.  Many Members have been across the Channel and back on a number of occasions appealing on behalf of the Birmimgham Six.  Some people who were not interested in this case ten, six or even five years ago, but who are interested in fair play, got involved and this case is now being heard on appeal.  What would be those Deputies' reaction if one of the Birmingham Six escaped and came to Ireland?  We would be obliged to extradite them despite all the talk about the injustice which has been suffered by these people who have spent 13 years in prison for a crime they did not commit.  That highlights in no uncertain terms what we have embarked upon and no amount of talk about this Bill, or the safeguards allegedly in it, would prevent the return of those people to Britain.</P>
    <P>As well as this we have Long Kesh, the H-Blocks, the Maze, call it what you will.  We have had people convicted on supergrass evidence but who escaped from the Maze.  Their colleagues have <Col N="255" /> had their sentences and convictions quashed because of the odium attending the supergrass system.  We have a number of these people on this side of the Border and the only crime they are guilty of is having escaped from unlawful detention in Long Kesh.  Yet we are proceeding along the same lines with this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the present climate it is not possible for an Irish person to have a fair trial in Britain or the Six Counties.  I say this very deliberately and with no bitterness &mdash; it is not possible for an Irish citizen to have a fair trial in a British court, especially in the Six Counties.  This is part of our history.  There is nothing we can do about it.  We have a responsibility to ensure that under any extradition law, to whatever country but particularly to Britain and the Six Counties, the fair trial clause must be part and parcel of any extradition warrant that may be executed.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for that, no safeguard and nothing in the amendment to the 1965 Act or within the 1987 Act that in any way safeguards our people in the special situation that obtains only in so far as Britain and the Six Counties are concerned.  I have been amazed listening to the debate that so many speakers on all sides of the House treated this matter as if Britain and the Six Counties were the same as the rest of the countries in Europe, that their relationship with us is the same and that it is a normal situation. Of course it is not and while that is the case we must specifically look at those two jurisdictions when it comes to handing over any of our citizens for alleged crimes they may have committed.</P>
    <P>We are aware that claims have been made in regard to the miscarriage of justice in relation to the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire case, the O'Shea case and the more recent McNamee case of which I am sure we will hear a great deal in the future in this House, and rightly so.  Deputy Andrews also referred today to Martina Shanahan who has been on remand in prison since last August although there is no likelihood that she will be brought to trial for another six or nine months.  That is not <Col N="256" /> unusual treatment in so far as our people are concerned.  However, it is most unusual that Martina Shanahan spends 23 hours out of the 24 in her cell.  Is this the sort of jurisdiction we agreed to by allowing the 1987 Act to go through last night?  Even that pales into insignificance when we cross the Border of our own country and see the administration of justice there in relation to our people. The Diplock Courts are presided over by well known &mdash; indeed notorious &mdash; Lord Chief Justices where a confession of the accused is accepted without corroboration as full evidence for putting them away.  In the same jurisdiction the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 1984, was brought in on a temporary basis and has been extended each year since then. However, it is now recommended that it should become a permanent feature of the law in Great Britain and the Six Counties.Under the PTA, provision is made for seven day detention, the first 48 hours of which do not allow or provide for the suspect to be in touch with his or her legal adviser or to communicate with their families.  If they are not broken in 48 hours it is very doubtful if any direct contact with anyone who could help would be allowed.  There are seven days in which to break a person, to extract a forced confession and a signature.  During that extreme interrogation night and day, they are allowed to sleep for five minutes, woken up again, taken out and soft talked and hard talked both in the light and in the dark.  This is what is going on and we proved it in the European Courts many years ago.  It has not changed, you need not take my word as Amnesty International said the same thing in the very recent past.  There is also the evidence of so many individuals across the Border who have gone through the horror of the seven days detention and interrogation. They can confirm that nothing has changed and yet the Diplock Courts will accept a confession gained in such circumstances, no matter how many days it took to get, without any corroboration and despite the ultimate denial by the accused before the court that it was signed under duress.  That confession <Col N="257" /> condemns, convicts and sentences so many people.  That is the jurisdiction into which our extradition laws are now committing our citizens.</P>
    <P>Can we think again about the Diplock Courts and the nonsense that is talked about two, three or five judges?  Ten members serve on that court at the moment and one of the most eminent &mdash; if that is the proper word to apply &mdash; is Lord Justice McDermott.  When he heard a murder charge against a member of the security forces, he congratulated the accused during the hearing on his sharpshooting ability.  In another case, again a murder charge against a member of the security forces, the late Lord Justice Gibson also congratulated the accused for bringing their victims to the final court of justice.  These are the sort of people that the very climate and situation in our occupied country bring to the fore.  They are there to do a job and, as Kitson once said, the law is another weapon against those who tried to disestablish the regime in the Six Counties. These are the sort of people who, through no fault of their own but through the circumstances in which they find themselves, are there to do the bidding of their masters who put them there.  The defence you will hear of all this is that there are four Catholics &mdash; so called Nationalists &mdash; among the ten.  I would rather go before one of the non-Catholics if I had to face the Diplock Court than go before one of the Catholic Nationalists now sitting on those benches because they have taken the shilling and the soup and are even more committed to deliver people to those who give them their high standing than is the case in relation to the majority who had already made their way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It amazes me that we can have interjections such as this from people who are very clearly aware of the non-administration of justice in that regime, of the non-administration of <Col N="259" /> justice in this peculiar Diplock Court.  I set out to say that it makes no difference whether there is one judge or three judges sitting there.  If anything, since this suggestion was made by those who advise us from the Six Counties publicly and privately, having thought about it a lot, I have come to the conclusion that I would prefer to have one judge trying me in the Diplock Court than three, despite the fact that one judge may be under duress from his betters to deliver the right verdict that would make the law and the dispensation of it by the Diplock Courts another part of the armoury against those who would disestablish the whole system. In the circumstances one judge is less to be feared than three because one judge carries the full responsibility in this maladministration of justice in the Diplock Courts, and even harking back to his oath, when he would have been promoted to be a judge, that in his mind must weigh somewhat heavily regardless of the climate in which this court meets, sits and is expected to deliver.  If we have three of a kind together on the same bench trying the same case, there would be divided responsibility and therefore divided guilt and they are far more likely to give the expected required verdict than would one judge.</P>
      <P>Leaving that aside we must concern ourselves with the issue of a fair trial. There is no possibility, nor is it conceivable that a fair trial is available particularly in the Six Counties, nor is it, now that our eyes have been opened, possible to have a fair trial in the climate that exists in Great Britain.  In our statements, in our wish to conform, and to be seen to be anti-terrorist, to be good Europeans, to be friends of Great Britain, we tend to back up that climate because we lean over backwards in order to be seen to be what we are not.  We are neither good friends of the Brits, as they occupy our country, nor are we falling over ourselves to be good Europeans.  Apparently it is the image that counts rather than the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What brought about this proposed amendment of the 1965 Act was the <Col N="260" /> growing public opinion demanding that the 1987 Act do not come into operation on 1 December.  That opinion, as is to be expected, made itself felt right through the ranks of all the parties in this House and especially through the ranks of Fianna Fáil who no later than last Wednesday week discussed and expressed their views on this issue. Indeed they expressed fairly truly the views of their public who are responsible for sending them here and whom they come here to represent.  It appears that at that meeting the overwhelming number who spoke &mdash; not all had the opportunity within the hours available &mdash; spoke against the coming into operation of the Act as it now operates from midnight. That meeting appears to have been adjourned with no conclusion having been reached and the meeting was reassembled the following Tuesday.  Lo and behold there was then done what one can only take one's hat off to as the greatest con operation ever in the history of that party.  Those who had adjourned the meeting and who were resuming the meeting to discuss the 1987 Act and all its objectionable features were presented with, not a continuation of the discussion on the 1987 Act but a series of amendments to the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>These amendments have been deliberated upon here by many spokesmen and some very eminent legal people to whom I have listened with great concern have spoken on them.  The safeguards, which is what these amendments are now being described as, are not safeguards against an unfair trial in any jurisdiction. There is no effort to answer the real problem that exists between Britain, ourselves and the Six Counties courts.  While I would not agree to the 1987 Act being on our Statute Book for any country in Europe, it should have been amended suitably as it could have been, regardless of all the clap trap we hear about how it could not have been amended because it would mean welching on our commitments.How is it that 12 countries of the signatories of this Convention have the political exemption enshrined in their extradition laws?  How is it that eight <Col N="261" /> further countries have enshrined in their extradition laws that they will not extradite any of their citizens.  How is it that a further seven have enshrined in their extradition laws that they will not extradite any of their people or indeed anyone who would be going before a special court?  There are 27 countries altogether with those principles enshrined in their laws.  We had our opportunities and we still have an opportunity to suitably amend the very Act that became law last night.  We would not breach our commitment to the European Convention by including any of these exemptions that have been included variously in up to 27 instances.  What are we trying to hold ourselves up as?  What sort of paragons of justice and virtue do we want to pose as to the rest of the world?  Who are we trying to impress, and to what end?</P>
    <P>Is it not true that this House, this Government and this Parliament should be first committed to the protection of our citizens regardless of other commitments, conventions or anything else. Do we not have a binding obligation to our people looking at the British maladministration of justice, at the Prevention of Terrorism Act and all the horrors it has brought, at the Diplock Courts in Castlereagh, and knowing what is happening?  Looking at all those things can we in truth and in honesty go along with extradition to either of those two jurisdictions and still keep faith with the very purpose for which we exist, which is to govern our own people in their best interests?  We have been put here by those same people to do just that.  This is not what we are doing and we are doing it with our eyes open.  We are doing it by deluding ourselves, traipsing our recent various happenings that are horrific in themselves but have no bearing on this legislation and will not be prevented under its terms in the future.</P>
    <P>We go along and talk then about the Director of Public Prosecutions, or the Attorney General, who is not obliged to review any of the warrants that come here, nor is there an obligation to have them sent to him under the amendment now proposed.  At the end of the day, <Col N="262" /> even when he seeks out those warrants, or when they are brought to his attention by somebody else &mdash; but not by way of the rules as laid down by the law we are proposing to amend and pass &mdash; and comes to an opinion, based on information, we might well ask, what is information, has it been defined, is it being defined?  What is an opinion as against a judicial decision when, if the Attorney General is not of opinion to prohibit the warrant, it means that the person is extradited?If he is not of the opinion the person is extradited.  Surely there is clear evidence here &mdash; which is not sought in the amendment &mdash; that whether it be the Attorney General, as is the stipulation in the Act at present &mdash; the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other individual person outside the Judiciary and outside our courts the formation or non-formation of an opinion determines whether a person is extradited?  Surely that is a judicial function?  Surely it is a decision of the gravest concern to the individual concerned, particularly if it is across the Border or across the channel that person is going?</P>
    <P>We cannot get away from the fact that this is no substitute for proper safeguards. The only proper safeguard, in so far as Britain and the Six Counties is concerned, is that we do not extradite any of our people to their jurisdictions while they occupy part of our country.  While they do, it is inevitable that a fair trial is not ever possible, particularly against a background of the continuing problems, troubles and violence that are part and parcel of that same entity, especially since 1969, but which are always there; even if not in evidence, it is only a matter of when it will arise again.</P>
    <P>While going through these motions of trying to save the face of people who are not in favour of the 1987 Act, of saying that this is an improvement on it, why do we not take it up seriously, consider the position in the full light of day, as we now have it, look at ourselves and ask ourselves whether we have the moral right in this Parliament &mdash; even though we have the law on our side &mdash; to commit any citizen of this State or of this country <Col N="263" /> into the maw of the justice operations that pertain in the Six Counties or in Great Britain?  The answer to that question will be that while Parliament has the right, legally and constitutionally speaking, those who constitute it have not the moral right to commit our citizens to an area in which they are assured of anything but a fair trial because of their nationality.  This is the message I would like to get through to the Government, to the Members of the House as a whole, particularly to those Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who stood up last Wednesday week in no uncertain terms making it very clear where they stood, in the majority, in so far as the 1987 Act is concerned but who have sadly been deluded and misled since into the belief that anything, any part of the loaf, is better than no bread.  I would say to those who perpetrated that delusion on them: you can have what you want but we do not want a slice of the loaf, we want the whole loaf.  I would rather see the Fianna Fáil Government in the position that they are left stark naked in so far as they allowed the 1987 Act to go through last night rather than get away with this Houdini act of allegedly making the bitter pill less bitter by inserting these rather doubtful, if not spurious, safeguards within the amendment of the 1965 Act now before us.</P>
    <P>I contend also that our Government and spokespeople should be talking to the British about the manner of their administration of justice under the terms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act which have been used almost exclusively to harass, hassle, upset and incarcerate members of our community, citizens of this country, that it is an Act brought in allegedly for general security purposes but clearly, in its use and abuse, has almost confined its operations to the hassle and harassment of our people whether living in Great Britain, travelling to or from Great Britain, through that territory or wherever.  This has been the result of its operation.  Surely that should have been one of the things long since <Col N="264" /> considered under the terms of this wonderful Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Conference that meets in Dublin, Belfast and Westminster, that appears to be so allembracing, such a wonderful gift to mankind?Surely this matter could have been dealt with before now.  Surely the Diplock Courts maladministration could have been dismantled before now.  Surely there could have been some semblance of notice taken of what one would assume our representatives had to say &mdash; perhaps they did not say any of these things; I do not know &mdash; but I would have expected that they should have done and that they would have been listened to.  Remember that, first, last and all the time: they got their Anglo-Irish Agreement, they got nothing from it but they have given away this Act that became law at midnight last night.  That is on our Statute Book and cannot be changed unless this House decides to rescind it.  Since it was impossible to stop the stampede that allowed it to go through last night I do not have any great hope that it will be rescinded in the foreseeable future.  Surely, having given so much, having sacrified many of our citizens &mdash; as will be the case &mdash; under the extradition laws of this country we can expect something in return.  Surely we can expect a clean up of the maladministration in the British courts, in the Six Counties courts, in the implementation of the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the release of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, compensation for their incarceration suffered so unjustly over the years and the bringing to trial of Martina Shanahan, who is spending in her cell 23 hours out of every 24 as a remand prisoner.  This is what is going on, what is being given a finger sign in so far as the efforts of our Government are concerned.  This is the treatment of the Irish, the treatment we have long since known.  This is the treatment that we seem to be hell bent on continuing to have showered on us.  Not only do we appear to be satisfied as to what the British and Six Counties regime can catch of our people, can harass, prosecute and persecute them, but we are now hell bent under these laws &mdash; with or without this <Col N="265" /> amendment of the 1965 Act &mdash; to send our people to them if they have not been able to get them themselves.</P>

There is no possibility of a fair trial for Irish people in either the Six Counties or the British courts in these days, nor will there ever be while we are occupied and have the climate prevailing, as surely as night follows day in which we, as a Parliament, have the right, legally and constitutionally, to put through any law we desire by agreement of the majority of the House.  We have no moral right to commit the people whom we represent to being sent for by the British authorities or the Six County authorities and, on foot of these laws about which we are now talking, have them delivered up to be treated, as they will be treated, badly and unfairly in the courts of the Six Counties or of Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney is not the only Member of this House who fears for Irish men and women and, indeed, children, who appear before British courts.  He is not the only person in the House who suffers pangs because of their problems.  Every nation has a responsibility to protect the lives and welfare of its citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At one end of the spectrum there is the clear responsibility of the nation to protect its people from those who operate outside the law.  Nobody contests that duty of the State.  The State has a co-equal responsibility at the other end of the spectrum to protect its citizens from those who exercise judicial functions, who in doing this could put in <Col N="266" /> jeopardy the rights and interests of its citizens.</P>
      <P>While the Extradition Act of 1987 and the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism exist and must be seen in a full European context as part of an international effort to protect the lives and interests of citizens of many states, the concerns which the Act engenders in thinking Members of this House arise closer to home.  The Members of this House would be less concerned on this issue and less convinced of the vital need for safeguards if it were not for our recent history and our history going back over all the years.  The simple, unadorned fact is that the system of justice in the nation with which we are most likely to be involved and to which we are most likely to be requested to extradite Irish people is tainted in so far as its handling of Irish men and women is concerned.  I, like other Deputies, am as conscious of that taint as Deputy Blaney.</P>
      <P>Any reasonable person must be concerned at the handling of the cases of men and women who regard themselves as Irish and whom the British authorities regard as Irish in the courts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is the nub of the issue that we must consider. The cases that give rise to our concern are multiple.  They are growing practically by the month.  Any Member who takes the trouble to examine the case of Dinny McNamee will find in it a Crown case which bears disquieting echoes of the Maguire, Guildford and Birmingham Six cases.  Any Member who considers the media circus which has attended the preliminary hearings of three Irish people held for trespass on Mr. Tom King's property or who witnessed the show of force when those people were brought into a specially prepared courthouse, with helicopters overhead and full military display on the ground, would again be concerned at the type of justice that can be expected by an Irish man or woman in an English court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem which confronts us jumps from the pages of recent history; it screams at anybody who wishes to hear it from the pages of our papers daily.  The <Col N="267" /> struggle for liberty by six Irishmen as played out in the Old Bailey, is an example.  Any reasonable person following the retrial of the Birmingham Six knows full well that Hugh Callaghan, Pat Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power and Johnny Walker are innocent men.  Their only crime is that they were Irish.  They were tried at a time when emotions in Britain understandably ran high.  They were found guilty, but the crime for which they were found guilty could be reasonably characterised as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The logic of their attending a bomber's funeral may be questionable.  The fact of their attending such a funeral is not a capital offence.  Because they intended to attend a funeral, they have spent over 13 years in British gaols.  They are now fighting quite literally for their freedom.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Birmingham Six, confessions were beaten out of the men. This is not so in the case of Annie Maguire.  She was carried from the dock protesting her innocence in March 1976. Like the six, Mrs. Maguire, her husband Pat, their two sons, one of whom, Pat junior, was only 13½ years of age at the time, were convicted on so-called evidence which would not and should not be tolerated in a civilised court in a civilised country.  With the Maguire family went Seán Smyth, Mrs. Maguire's brother, P. J. &ldquo;Giuseppe&rdquo; Conlon whose only crime was that he came to England to see after his son, and unfortunate Pat O'Neill who had called to the Maguire household looking to have his children cared for while his wife was attending a hospital. The Maguire case is, of course, inexplicably tied up with the case of the Guildford Four, Paddy Armstrong, Paul Hill, Gerard Conlon and an English citizen, Carole Richardson.  These four existed in what Robert Kee points to in <i>Trial and Error</i> as a twilight world of London squats, of drugs, of petty criminality. They were manifestly not the stuff of a terrorist army.</P>
    <P>Again, confessions which simply do not meet the requirements of evidence were <Col N="268" /> extracted and on these confessions were based convictions.  How could all this happen?  The answer was provided by a simple man, Paddy Maguire, at the end of his trial in March 1976.  When the verdict of guilty was being delivered on his family, Mr. Maguire turned to Vincent, who was at that time 17, and to Pat who had just turned 14 and said: &ldquo;Sons, I am sorry.  I have to apologise.  I have always told you that British justice was the finest in the world and that you should trust and respect it.  I was wrong.&rdquo;.  None of these 17 men, women or children imprisoned in the Maguire, Guildford or Birmingham Six cases was extradited but I put before the House the points I have made just now to remind us of a problem that we face and the dilemma in which we find ourselves.  It is sad that Deputy Blaney has left the House because a point I intended to make was that had the evidence that was presented in their case come before any Irish Attorney General or any Irish official who would have cared to sift through it, I doubt that there would have been a case for them to answer at all.</P>
    <P>The blatant injustices from which these people have suffered and continued to suffer weigh heavily on us all.  It is true that the issue of terrorism has been elevated to international level; as such, it has to be addressed at international level. The problem we have is closer to home. It arises from the long and sometimes bloody relationship between this and our neighbouring island.  It is because Paddy Maguire was right that the coming into effect of the 1986 extradition legislation must be accompanied by the strongest possible safeguards.  It is because of the vicious nature of international terrorism that in casting those safeguards we must at the same time ensure that they work but do not create loopholes through which the guilty can escape.  Therefore we must achieve a balance between defending the interests of our citizens on the one hand and defending the interests of all citizens on the other.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Bill introduces a number of safeguards which did not exist in the 1965 Act.  First, it will <Col N="269" /> provide that a bona fide case must be made before any request for a person's extradition is heard.  It will deal also with the situation where the extradition request is based on a desire to interrogate as opposed to prosecute.  It will, in effect, in this safeguard deal with most of the points made by Deputy Blaney.  No warrant will be executed unless the Irish Attorney General is of the firm opinion that those asking for extradition have a clear intention of prosecuting the person sought and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence. Such safeguards are highly desirable.  The necessity for and the purpose of extradition is to prevent one's territory from becoming a haven for criminals.  None of us in this House would wish our territory to become a haven for criminals.  It is to ensure that persons against whom a case exists are made to answer that case.  It is not for the purpose of handing over for interrogation to a foreign police people against whom there is no evidence or insufficient evidence.  It is because of this that these safeguards are introduced.</P>
    <P>It is not only reasonable but desirable that a government which has been asked to extradite a person should request its law officers, the Attorney General in this case, be satisfied that the application is a bona fide one.  A further valuable safeguard is provided in section 2 (1) (b) of the Bill.  In effect, this would give the Minister and the High Court the power to direct that an extradition should not take place by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of an alleged offence.  This would prevent any unfair or retrospective application of the change of definition of a political offence which comes into effect on foot of the 1987 Act. Both the Minister and the court would be able to prevent an extradition which in their view would be unjust, oppressive or invidious by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of the alleged offence.</P>
    <P>A further additional protection provided by the Bill arises with regard to the rule of specialty.  The Bill provides that the Minister may, if he thinks it necessary, formally introduce the rule of <Col N="270" /> specialty into the extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland. This is a rule of international law whereby a person who is extradited should only be prosecuted for the offence in respect of which his extradition was sought and granted.  This, I suggest, is another additional welcome safeguard.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have vacillated over the past few weeks in their position on this Bill.  The Labour Party, after threatening his expulsion have now joined with Deputy Stagg in demanding a full blown <i>prima facie</i> case.  It is a pity Deputy Spring and his colleagues did not adopt the same line while in Government when the Extradition Act was rammed through the Dáil.  Fine Gael, characteristically, are having a field day on the legal points, not always the same points but legal ones nonetheless.  The Progressive Democrats are, once again, attempting to find a position.</P>
    <P>For the cacophony which has been put up from the benches opposite a number of points do arise which should be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important point being put forward is that the safeguards which would be put in place by this Bill are not strong enough.  This is an argument which is made by many Deputies and it circulates around the point that administrative safeguards are less valuable than judicial safeguards.  Anybody who examines that proposition will find it fails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage of providing an administrative as opposed to a judicial safeguard is that the technical differences which exist between our laws of evidence and those of the various British jurisdictions would not be permitted to prevent the extradition of persons against whom there is a bona fide case.  As I <Col N="271" /> have said at the outset, the Bill provides safeguards; it does not provide loopholes. For that I suggest that Deputies who care and who are not ambivalent should welcome this Bill.  The simple fact is that the Bill in effect brings in a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  On this point a peculiar twist was introduced by the reported comments in this morning's newspapers of Deputy McDowell.  He is reported as saying that the Bill was, in effect, an elaborate sham and that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána could by-pass the Attorney General and hand people over.  This, I submit to the House, is arrant nonsense and suggests that Deputy McDowell has either not read the Bill, has read it poorly or is simply being mischievous.  The latter is probably the case.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the role of the Attorney General would be unconstitutional.Again, this is patent nonsense.David Gwynn Morgan touched on this point in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 November when he said:</P>
    <P>...the Attorney General's duty in the field of extradition is not very different from the task performed by his office for centuries and now performed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, namely, to determine whether to prosecute a person for any ordinary crime before the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>I submit to the people who make the point about the constitutional infirmity of this Bill, that their arguments simply do not hold water.  The Attorney General would be given an administrative as opposed to a judicial function under this Bill.  He would not be given a role in the judicial part of the extradition process. The Bill provides that his consent would be necessary before the judicial process is commenced.  His role in a specific extradition process would be no different from the role of the DPP in deciding whether a criminal prosecution process would be commenced in any particular case.  In fact, as regards certain offences, the prosecution role is still the Attorney General's role and not that of the DPP.  The <Col N="272" /> new role of the Attorney General would be no more judicial than the role of the Minister for Justice, for example, under section 44 of the 1965 Act.  For these reasons it is difficult to understand the arguments of constitutional infirmity which have been put forward.</P>
    <P>There are two formal points being made about the Attorney General's role. The first of these, again being made by the Progressive Democrats who seem to specialise in raising spurious hares, is that the Attorney General would be operating in secret and the second point being made is that he would be a cats-paw of the Government.  The Progressive Democrats make much of the first point and in doing so they ignore the fact that the DPP acts effectively in secret.  While this may cause some frustration from time to time, it does not mean nor does it suggest that the secrecy has been abused or that his Office has been abused.  So it is with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The position of the Attorney General in our Constitution is fundamentally misrepresented by the second point.  The true position of the Attorney General in our system of government was well represented by Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore in the case of McLoughlin <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare in 1958.  He found in that case that the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government but is put in an independent position. He is a great Office of State, with great responsibility of a quasi-judicial nature as well as of an executive nature.  I submit to the House that successive Attorneys General have been fully conscious of their role and all of its aspects.  I submit to the House that it is an impertinence to suggest that Attorneys General in the future would exercise their role any more lightly than Attorneys General in the past.  The point about the Attorney General being in effect a cats-paw of Government is a spurious and insulting one.</P>
    <P>The attack on the safeguards provided in this Bill are in my mind quite unpardonable.Some Members have effectively argued that we should have gone ahead with extradition without safeguards.  Our <Col N="273" /> history, in particular the recent history of relations between this country and our nearest neighbour, argues strongly that we should have safeguards.  I have no problem about putting it on the record that I was one of those who had doubts about extradition but I am convinced that in drafting this legislation and in putting it before the House the Government have answered all the problems with regard to safeguards.</P>
    <P>There is an additional safeguard which is that we can review this measure in the fullness of time when we will be able to see how these procedures have operated. If we are not satisfied with those procedures or happy that they give the safeguards to Irish citizens which they deserve, then we can address any of those shortcomings but it is necessary to put safeguards in now.  It is necessary to do what this Bill seeks to do.  For that reason I have pleasure in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to two speakers on the other side, Deputies Jacob and Roche, and to Deputy Blaney, it seems clear that of the three only Deputy Blaney was honest in his approach.  He said he was against extradition.Deputy Jacob and Deputy Roche made it clear that they were equally against extradition and, having regard to the contumely, contempt and abuse they poured on the British legal system, they could not logically be otherwise. However, instead of following through their views, which we were given to believe were expressed at length by many people at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, to their logical conclusion, honestly here in the House or within their parliamentary party, they are taking refuge in the sham excuse provided by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, Deputy Roche said that this Bill has answered all the problems of safeguards against the dangers that he has just gone into in great detail, the dangers in question being defects and defaults of a serious nature in the British criminal system.  He said that the role <Col N="274" /> given to the Attorney General to ensure that various evidence is sufficient to justify a prosecution, if it had been in place, would have prevented the Birmingham Six episode.  Of course it would not, because all the Attorney General can do and is required to do pursuant to the Bill is to look at the case and see if there is a colour of a case against the defendant. He is not obliged to, nor could he, go into the merits of the case.  To present to us as a safeguard against the dangers that Deputy Roche and Deputy Jacob waxed eloquent on here the power being given to the Attorney General is dishonest nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche talked about suffering pangs for the victims of British justice. Deputy Jacob's talk about transferring one's own countrymen to England or Northern Ireland is emotive and traumatic.Having regard to what we have heard of what transpired at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting I regard both these Deputies as typical.  Deputy Roche feels pangs and Deputy Jacob suffers from emotionalism and trauma.  If those are their views they should not be in here lending their support to this cod Bill, because that is what it is.</P>
    <P>Are we for extradition or not?  The Fianna Fáil Party in their heart of hearts are against extradition for so-called political offences but they are coerced into supporting it for a number of reasons. The first is that they are afraid to face the understandable and proper international contumely and contempt they would attract to themselves if they showed themselves to be against the process of extraditing criminal terrorists, or that they were prepared to renege on the collective wisdom of all our European fellow countries.</P>
    <P>After many tedious years a Convention was finally brought into being which declared that certain offences are so henious and obvious of their nature that they cannot in any civilisd community be deemed to have the protection of being called political.  That is all it does and that is all the Act passed in 1986 does.  It implements that amendment to the nature of what is or is not political.  It <Col N="275" /> does not remove the political exemption from the extradition code.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to define objectively what is a political offence.  Political exemption has been part and parcel of the legal code of extradition since it became part of international jurisprudence, and its history shows varying views of what is or is not political.  For example, notwithstanding the fact that between the US and the UK the political exemption exists, there was a recorded case of a Soviet spy being extradited from the UK to the US.  Surely that was a political offence if ever there was to be a political offence.  We have the position between the US and Cuba where the extradition treaty provides for the extradition of people who hijacked aeroplanes, notwithstanding that the hijacking may have been for political reasons.</P>
    <P>The law is not at all clear or certain as to what constitutes a political offence.  It is not capable of being defined objectively.It must be defined subjectively from time to time.  We had an instance of that here in the McGlinchey case with its subjective judicial definition which was on all fours with the emerging jurisprudence from the Council of Europe in this area.  The Council of Europe has as far as possible made a definition of a limited kind by excluding from the protection a certain number of heinous, violent crimes, and we are here now to implement that.</P>
    <P>That is the first reason the Fianna Fáil Government could not renege on the 1987 Extradition Act and retain any standing of credibility or respect in the international community of nations.  That is why it was allowed through at midnight last night.  That does not represent the true feeling of that party with regard to the problem.  We have had two examples of it here in the House today and we know that at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting there was thundering opposition to that measure.</P>
    <P>Another reason Fianna Fáil were afraid to be honest and say they are against extradition is that they are windy of the political consequences of the <Col N="276" /> damage it might do to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I will not say much about the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It was designed to do two things: to reduce violence and procure reconciliation between the communities.  We will have to give it a little longer to see if it will achieve either of those objectives.  Nevertheless, it represents a glimmer of hope in the Northern situation.  Again Fianna Fáil, possibly for domestic political reasons because it is a popular agreement domestically, were afraid to do anything which might be seen to endanger that agreement.  If they were to renege on the 1986 Act and propose to this House that it should not come into force on 1 December, there is no doubt that they would have given a great deal of ammunition to the enemies of that agreement.</P>
    <P>The third reason they were not prepared to renege on it has to do with the current security position.  In a number of instances in the last few weeks the Government were exposed in the general security area.  The first was the kidnapping of John O'Grady.  The response of the State through its agents, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, was entirely inadequate to deal with that kidnapping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was common case and common cause throughout the country that the superintendents, district officers and dividional officers had not the resources to mount the type of operation required to rescue that unfortunate man. There should have been systematic house to house searches throughout the nation. An intensive system of cordons should have been put up.  We had the debacle in Midleton where the hijackers were able to drive away and then drive up and down the country at will because there were no cordons in position and the money to turn them out was not being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were sporadic road blocks.  If a superintendent had some money in his budget he called out a road block until that money was exhausted, or he organised a few house to house searches.  It was <Col N="277" /> as sporadic and spotty as that, whereas the cause demanded an all out drive on the part of all the forces of the State to release that unfortunate man.  The proof of that is information that I got from the Minister for Justice on the spending on Garda overtime this year.  There was no increase in any quarter of this year of Garda overtime.  It was an outrageous, casual approach to a most serious and cruel situation.  That position had to be retrieved.</P>
    <P>We had the scandal of the <i>Eksund</i> coming with a large amount of arms from Libya, a country the leader of which says he has a great affection for the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach has socialised with that international bandit and I use the word advisedly because that is what he is.  In spite of being called on in this House to break off relations with that particular country and that particular leader the Fianna Fáil Government have refused to do so.  As recently as last week this man reiterated his support for the IRA &mdash; this terrorist organisation that has destroyed a generation in this country and has made the cult of the gunmen endemic in this society.  He has reiterated his support for them and yet this Government is not prepared to break off diplomatic relations with that man.  Instead we have this other piece of cosmetics here.</P>
    <P>We had the further piece of cosmetics when, after the security debacles, this huge national search was mounted to try to locate the three shiploads of arms and explosives which had come into the country in 1985 or 1986.  There was the &ldquo;hint hint&rdquo; that that was during the time of the Coalition.  When I heard of that operation being mounted I had to confess to being sceptical.  It seemed to me as a matter of commonsense that it would be very difficult to land three shiploads of arms and ammunitions, keep them concealed and have no sign of them emerge from that day to this.  The Army and Garda combined have now been searching for ten days.  They have discovered a few home made rocket launchers in the bog in Clara, they have uncovered a few Maze escapees and discovered a dugout in Gort.  The millions of pounds in overtime <Col N="278" /> and effort that have gone into that search would have been better spent searching for John O'Grady.  It was a cosmetic exercise from start to finish.  It exposes serious shortcomings in the efficiency of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In my constituency two alleged Maze escapees were found.  They had been living there for the last X number of years.  Another was found in Raheny. Outside Gort a most elaborate dugout was found, an underground chamber 20 feet by ten feet, eight foot high and a 20 foot long tunnel connecting it to another chamber.  There was a most elaborate system of lighting, ventilation and heating.That was not built overnight.  It took a considerable time to construct.  I am amazed in this intimate community of ours where most people know what is going on that the members of the Garda Síochána did not know that living outside the town of Granard were two northerners who had escaped from the Maze some years before, that in Raheny the same thing took place and that in Gort this large scale excavation &mdash; this substantial building &mdash; was carried on and apparently nobody detected it.</P>
    <P>It points to one thing only &mdash; that there is a serious lack of ordinary intelligence gathering in the Garda Síochána.  Indeed there was one time one humble duty that the Garda Representative Association regarded as being beneath their members and that was taking the livestock census. Discharging that duty brought the members into contact with the people and up every lane and byway in Ireland. They knew exactly who was who, what was what and what was going on.  There will have to be a fundamental reappraisal and look at the efficiency and efficacy of our police force.</P>
    <P>This search exercise is cosmetic.  It is part and parcel of this Bill because it, too, is cosmetic.  It is designed to show that the Fianna Fáil Government are in favour of the extradition going through, but having built into it conditions and requirements that make, in my opinion, a nonsense of the whole thing.  These conditions and requirements are built in to placate Deputies Roche and Jacob but <Col N="279" /> not Deputy Blaney &mdash; he is too forthright and too honest on this matter to placate the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party who are on the verge of rebellion on this issue and who are fairly wrath as a result of the proposed changes in the primary education sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is silly.  I do not think it is unconstitutional.  I do not see that there is anything wrong in giving the Attorney General the power to direct a superintendent not to endorse a warrant.  That is still part of the administrative procedure of extradition.  It does not interfere with the judicial part which is still open and without prejudice and is not prejudiced by the action of the Attorney General.  It is still open to the accused to pursue his right to any level he cares to pursue it.  I do not think that is unconsitutional and I do not care particularly whether it is the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions who is involved.  I understand that my party feel that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be a more appropriate official to intervene in this area and that Attorneys General are political officers.  I have confidence in the integrity of the holders of that office, whoever they maybe or whatever party they may belong to.</P>
    <P>In this sensitive area I can see that it might be desirable and keep that power at arm's length from the Government. Many of the points I want to make are points which I look forward to going into on Committee Stage.  I can see this Bill being a great source of litigation particularly when an arrested person exercises his right and goes to the court to have his warrant set aside possibly on the grounds that the Attorney General should not have given his direction.  At that stage there would be a very awkward and distressing situation.  With the endorsement depending entirely and directly on the Attorney General, will he be amenable to the courts to explain himself?  It is being put into an Act of Parliament that he must have formed an opinion that there was a clear intention to prosecute and that such intention was founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> If a person sought to be extradited goes to court for relief and says to the court: &ldquo;I am not satisfied that there was an intention to prosecute me up there, nor am I satisfied that that intention, even if it was there, was founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  I want to be told that.  Why should my warrant be endorsed on the say so of a particular official who does not have to explain himself?&rdquo;There is a lot of weight in that argument.  If it is not answered it is contrary to much of our legal system where justice to be done and has to be seen to be done.  People must be aware of the reasons their legal status will be changed. I can see a very fruitful area of contentious litigation.  This might well be a Machiavellian plan by the Government to create such a ridiculous legal system that it gets jammed up in the courts anyway.  This would be one way out of it, it would be one way of placating the wilder men in their ranks.  These are all questions which will be gone into in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I conclude by repeating that I consider this Bill to be a fraud, a dishonest ploy by Fianna Fáil to placate the voice in that party who are opposed to extradition, who have revealed themselves in this debate.  The depth of their antipathy to Northern Ireland and to Britain had to be heard to be believed.  That antipathy, I am convinced, reflects a deep distaste and a deep hostility to the concept of extraditing into Northern Ireland or to Great Britain.  The Government were aware of that.  It has to be placated and, I am sorry to say, this ridiculous measure is being brought forth to placate that political need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to get the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The 1987 Extradition Act &mdash; Ireland's ratification of the European Convention of the Supression of Terrorism, came into force at midnight last night.  The Act is an important aspect of Ireland's involvement in the fight against terrorism.  For that reason, it is vital that it operates effectively and efficiently.  It cannot do <Col N="281" /> that in a context of mistrust and fear.  It cannot do that without clearly understood safeguards in place around it.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, essential that, as parliamentarians, we put such safeguards in position, and &mdash; just as importantly &mdash; that we ensure the people of Ireland understand and feel secure about them.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach talked last week to the House about &ldquo;the politics of the latest atrocity&rdquo;, he was underlining the major problem facing us, as parliamentarians, in dealing with this Bill. That major problem relates to defining our terms.</P>
      <P>There is every danger that we will approach this pivotal matter, not rationally, but through a filter of confused emotions, fears, misunderstandings and unshared assumptions.  That danger has been exacerbated by recent horrors, recent examples of man's inhumanity to man.</P>
      <P>You will all recall Yeats' summing up of 1916: he said that &ldquo;a terrible beauty is born&rdquo;.  Yeats also talked of Ireland as being a country of &ldquo;great hatred, little room&rdquo;, and, sadly, what has happened during the last month amply justifies that description: great hatred, little room, a great deal of confusion, and a groundswell of informed fear.  It is therefore my priority today, in addressing the Members of the Dáil, to define precisely the terms in which I believe we must discuss the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  Let me, therefore state, by way of background to all I wish to promulgate today, the basics I wish to affirm about my stance.</P>
      <P>I am a passionate, lifelong, constitutional Republican.  I am a Minister of a Republican nation.  It is central to our status as a nation that we create the means whereby we can, together with other nations, control terrorism, and by so doing, ensure Ireland's future as a parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a measure of the damage done by terrorism in this island that so many people are now wary of declaring themselves to be Republicans, and that, once someone had made such a declaration, the assumptions made about it tend to be <Col N="282" /> pejorative.  One of those assumptions is that Republicanism means unthinking, rigid narrowness, unenlightened gut reactions and a ruthless mono-culturalism.  At best, in recent months, Republicanism has been assumed to stand for ambivalence.At worst, it is assumed to stand for mean-minded cruelty.  When the terrorists seem to own the high ground of Republicanism, the growth of those damaging assumptions is inevitable.  Not only is it inevitable, but it is the most subtly subversive factor in the terrorists' arsenal.</P>
    <P>It is false and fatuous for the IRA to release statements promising that they have no enmity towards the armed forces of the Twenty-six Counties.  The terrorists have an abiding enmity towards constitutional Republicanism and towards the nation &mdash; and the political party &mdash; which expresses such Republicanism.</P>
    <P>Their recent appeal, using emotive disinformation, to Republicans in the South to see the IRA as the only &ldquo;true&rdquo; bearers of the standard, establishes with total clarity their crude contempt for the Government and people of Ireland &mdash; not of Northern Ireland but of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA now see all the Twenty-Six Counties, as they stated this week, as &ldquo;Free Staters&rdquo;.  The battle lines of so-called &ldquo;real Republicans&rdquo; versus The Rest are now being drawn, drawn in a way which can only damage this country as a place to live in, damage our international reputation and damage the cause for which, ostensibly, there is shared support.  There can be no doubt whatever that the IRA have sought to make the extradition issue one which will polarise Republican feelings to the detriment of those, like myself, who seek the reunification of this country by constitutional means.</P>
    <P>Hence the timing of the Enniskillen bomb, clearly designed to stampede through the Dáil an Extradition Bill which would be shorn of significant safeguards for our citizens &mdash; as a result of inappropriate deference to those hurt and bereaved in Enniskillen.  Once that had <Col N="283" /> been achieved, the IRA could claim &mdash; as they came close to claiming this week &mdash; that they were the only true Republicans in the State, and that Fianna Fáil's commitment had been emasculated.  It was a plan relying on the real care and empathy of people in the South for those in Enniskillen.  That care and empathy has been profound.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that after 18 years of death, destruction and demoralisation, we might have become innured to the process, that we might have grown an extra, self-protective skin which would allow us to dismiss the latest trauma as little more than a repetitive statistic.  Two and two make four, four and four make eight, and it all adds up to 3,000 dead.  In fact, thank God, the people of Ireland have not grown that extra self protective skin, and so they were bruised and sickened and shamed by Enniskillen and by the O'Grady kidnapping.  The terrorists cynically relied on that reaction.  They set out to use it to paint us into a corner.  The terrorists underestimate the strength, the intelligence and the complexity of constitutional Republicanism, and I suspect that this week's speeches in the House will go far to disabuse them of their self-seeking misapprehension.</P>
    <P>The Republicanism of Padraic Pearse, with its explicit rejection of `cowardice, inhumanity or rapine', has no problems with a properly structured Extradition Act &mdash; as indicated by the lack of controversy during the years since 1965 when special arrangements for extradition between this State and Northern Ireland and Britain were put in place.  That Republicanism has been grossly distorted by recent terrorism; indeed, distorted to such an extent during the last few weeks that the cause, the credo must be restated and reaffirmed.  The distortion of Republicanism has put it on the same scale as urban violence.  There is a great danger that it will merely be seen as part of a pattern of crime and violence which is self-perpetuating and which fills people with fear of their own neighbourhood and place.</P>
    <P>Look on this portrait that I paint for <Col N="284" /> you.  We have, in this country as in most countries in the West, come to a dulled acceptance of violence in our city streets, of the need for electronic warning and protective devices.  A fortnight ago, in towns on both sides of the Border, little country towns, there was fear which kept people in groups, which led to locked doors once nighttime fell, which led to telephone checks between families to ensure that each person was still safe.</P>
    <P>That happened because a dangerous man was on the loose.  What kind of Republicanism is it which creates a shaking fear in the people to whom the Republican could claim to devote his life? What kind of Republicanism is it which merely adds to the uncontrolled escalation in the level of violence in our streets, and which leads, inevitably, not to freedom, but to anarchic hopelessness?</P>
    <P>By not abjuring a squalid, sordid, infinitely divisive parody of Republicanism, we propagate a public perception of all Republicans as squalid, sordid and stereotyped.  They are not that.  Republicanism in Fianna Fáil is deeply rooted in traditional values, but never unthinkingly rooted in those values.  Republicanism in Fianna Fáil reveres courage and the culture of courage, but it has no reverence for the sick cruelty which would have Ireland's future written in blood with a hammer and chisel.  Republicanism in Fianna Fáil is fundamentalist. That, <i>ipso facto</i>, rules out the possibility of casting the innocent by-stander as enemy.  The sad irony of that last horror is that Marie Wilson and John O'Grady have, by their unsought sufferings, taught this nation more about grace and dignity and courage than the terrorists who would claim to have a monopoly on such traits.</P>
    <P>Republicanism such as animates this Government is a philosophy of nationhood, not a gang-war slogan.  If we are a nation, then we must frame our laws as a nation, neither seeking to cower before international pressure nor seeking to express defiance.  It would be grand if the issues here could be narrowed down to the crudity of a proposition like &ldquo;It's <Col N="285" /> Ireland <i>versus</i> Britain&rdquo;, but it is not that simple.  There is a massive European dimension to the question.</P>
    <P>We have signed the 1957 Convention and the 1977 Convention, and failure to pass the Act which came into force at midnight would have placed us in breach of both, hence distancing ourselves from the civilised nations we justly see as our peers.  Yes, we must be very well aware of the deficiences in the delivery of justice in countries which will be involved in the extradition process, but we must not allow our law making to be trivialised by the desire to make a public point about such deficiencies.</P>
    <P>Lest there by any misunderstanding about what I mean here, let me make it doubly clear.  I am gravely concerned about what I would perceive as an unchallenged recent racism in British justice as meted out to Irish people.  Unlike beauty, racism is almost never in the eye of the beholder &mdash; it is in the hurts of the victim.</P>
    <P>It has been said that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.  I would go further.  It must be felt to be done.  There have been many cases in recent times of people of Irish birth being processed by British justice &mdash; and I use the phrase advisedly &mdash; in a way which leaves them without the feeling that justice has been done.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to make reference to any particular case because it is the generality of such cases, the fact that there are an number of them, which makes that odd prototype &ldquo;the reasonable man&rdquo; doubtful about this decade of British judicial history.</P>
    <P>We must not damage our own corpus of law because we have reservations in this area; nor should we damage our standing as a nation in Europe for the same reason.  On the contrary, what we must do is co-operate with other countries to defeat terrorism while protecting the rights and freedom of our individual citizens.</P>
    <P>Co-operation with other countries to defeat terrorism is not new to this country.We are not bringing in extradition for the first time.  Extradition has been part of Irish law since the foundation of <Col N="286" /> our State and before that.  What we are talking about is updating a law so that it works better.  If the 1987 Act had not come into power last night, if the 1987 Act were to disappear entirely, extradition would not.  It would continue to operate.</P>
    <P>By &ldquo;updating a law so that it works better&rdquo; I mean that the 1987 Act will remove a wall behind which terrorists could hide.  The Act ensures that nobody will be able to claim as &ldquo;political&rdquo; a crime which falls into one of four categories, those cateogries being the hijacking of an aircraft, kidnapping or killing by use of explosives, automatic weapons, etc., or murdering a diplomat or high official.</P>
    <P>Removing that wall, afforded by allowing criminals to interpret their acts as &ldquo;political&rdquo; is the only change this Act will make.  Extradition will not start &mdash; it has always been in position.  What it does, however, is to affirm our nationhood by placing us among our peers in the international fight against terrorism.</P>
    <P>We share with the Community countries in Europe a view that people who hijack planes, people who perform atrocities such as Enniskillen, people who murder, should not be allowed to evade justice by an exercise in semantics.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Let us call murder murder.  Let us confine the term &ldquo;political&rdquo; to the forum wherein it belongs.</P>
    <P>There is a strong belief in this country in the primacy of human rights.  Those who have a racy memory of second-class citizenship, as is the case with every country conquered for a long period of time, tend to be particularly sensitive to human rights issues.  That is the reason for the horror, the sympathy, and, yes, the curiosity in relation to individuals like Mr. O'Grady.</P>
    <P>The sad reality is that John O'Grady, having suffered dreadfully, will never be fully free of that suffering.  Apart from the physical damage he has to live with, despite his right to privacy and peace, he will now always represent for many of us the line beyond which a cause cannot go. The pre-meditated inhumanity of taking a man's hands and hurting them for life is not a political matter.  The inhumanity <Col N="287" /> of damaging the hands a man works with, greets his friends with, loves his children with &mdash; that inhumanity is not something I want to see Irish law used to support.</P>
    <P>We are not talking, when we examine this Act, of a danger to heroic idealists. We are talking of a means of coping with international terror and subversion which cares neither for people nor for national tradition.  Without such means of coping, we will be seen by the nations of Europe as a country without national selfrespect.That has not been the case in the past.  Irish Governments have faced their own conflicts, and, without compromising their genuine Republican principles, have coped with threats to the State.</P>
    <P>Today, we must follow the example set by de Valera and his colleagues in the forties.  We must do it with clarity, with resolution and without ambiguity.  Safeguards are central to the success of any challenge to terrorism.  Without built-in, carefully thought out safeguards, we will be seen as endangering innocent citizens of this country, and preventing that &mdash; either in shadow or substance &mdash; must be a priority.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks most of us have had our concerns over the detailed operation of this legislation buttressed by human realities, reinforced by constituents who have come with stories of a minor infraction of several years ago which might, they believe, put them in danger today.  The safeguards with which we wish to hedge this Act around set out to remove the cause for that fear.  They do not &mdash; and let me reiterate this &mdash; they do not deny that there is substantive cause for such fear.  I believe there is cause for that fear.  I believe it is something we must address as public representatives.</P>
    <P>You don't drink tea with a fork.  You pick the right method for the task in hand and failure to allow the 1987 Act into our legislative framework in order to indicate our dissatisfaction with the operations of justice in another country would, very decidedly, have been a case of using an inappropriate method.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> It is important to acknowledge that the whole area of extradition hits a raw nerve in the Irish psyche.  Together with the concept of informing, the concept of handing over your citizen to the custody of another country, even if that country, in diplomatic terms, can be described as &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; is problematical and it always has been.  The fact that more than 700 Irish citizens have been extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland within a 20 year period has done little to reduce the anxiety associated with extradition.</P>
    <P>If that sense of dread and revulsion is to be met, it can only be met by ensuring against arbitrary or unreasonable return of fugitives to foreign jurisdiction.  It can only be met if there is a reasonable expectation that an extradited person will get a fair trial in the receiving country.  That means someone will not be extradited for an ordinary criminal offence if there are substantial grounds for believing that a person's position would be prejudiced because of his race, his religion, his nationality or his political opinions.  That safeguard will be specifically enacted into law by this Act, when amended.</P>
    <P>The Courts, if they believe a person's right to fair trial would be compromised on any of the grounds I have mentioned, will have, under the 1987 Act, full jurisdiction to refuse extradition.  In addition, this Act provides for a change in the nature of the endorsement required by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.This change means that the Commissioner will be obliged not to endorse a warrant if the Attorney General directs him not to.  That direction would come from the Attorney General when he does not hold that there is a clear intention to prosecute, based on sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>In other words, there will be, in future, no possibility of individuals being handed over to another sovereign power on an assumption when that sovereign power merely wants to hold the person as a method of finding evidence on which to prosecute them.</P>
    <P>In addition, this Bill sets out to prevent the &ldquo;and furthermore&rdquo; syndrome.  This is the approach which would seek to extradite someone for a particular offence and <Col N="289" /> would then make additional charges against that someone for offences which are not in themselves extraditable.  This could not happen in future &mdash; except if this country consented to the placing of the additional charges.</P>
    <P>This is the rule of specialty.  It ensures that additional charges of a political nature will not be brought after extradition &mdash; a very real fear current at the moment.  I mentioned the valid dread of many people throughout the country that they might be vulnerable as a result of something done many, many years ago.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill on lapse of time will mean that a person whose extradition is sought will be able to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused if there is sufficient time since the alleged offence was committed to make extradition on such charges unjust, oppressive or invidious.  Lapse of time alone would not constitute grounds for refusal of extradition.  There would also have to be particular circumstances contributing to make it unjust, oppressive or invidious.</P>
    <P>It is worth emphasising, at this point, that the passing of this Act by this House will be a gesture of strength, a confirmation of our value on constitutionalism.It will speak clearly to the men of violence, indicating to them that we will not glamourise or shelter those who torture, disfigure and kill ordinary citizens of Ireland or of other countries. It will disabuse them of the notion that they can destabilise this part of Ireland, although they have wanted to do that for a long, long time.  It will establish with absolute clarity that we will not, as a nation, constitute a safe house for wicked people doing wicked, cruel things in the name of a great cause.</P>
    <P>In addition, this Act publicly confirms that this country does not hold life cheaply.As a nation, we value courage and commitment &mdash; not slieveen racism disguised as patriotism.  The republicanism I stand for is worth standing for: Ní fochultúr é a thagann salach ar gach oiliúint atá faighte againn ar scoil agus sa mbaile.  Ní fochultúr é ach oiread lena dtréigeann muid gach bun-chreideamh <Col N="290" /> eile dá bhfuil againn.  Ní fochultúr é, faoi dheireadh, a mhúsclaíonn suim an phobail le heagla, le cruáil, le mi-dhaonnacht adeir, an té nach bhfuil linn, ní amháin gur namhad é ach nach duine ceart chor ar bith é.</P>
    <P>Is Poblachtánach go smior mé ach ní gá dom beagmheas ar dhaoine eile mar chuid den fhealsúnacht sin.</P>
    <P>Yes, I am a Republican to my core.  A Republican steeped in history and proud of it.  It is a truism to say that history repeats itself.  Sometimes, it only gives the appearance of repeating itself.</P>
    <P>What is happening in this country at this time in the name of republicanism is no repeat of the selfless heroism I learned about at school, and later, took pride in teaching other young people at school. Much of what we are now seeing is a subculture claiming republicanism as its life blood but more truly informed by paranoia, sadism and greed.</P>
    <P>What we must never forget is that the means used to achieve an end must, inevitably &mdash; as night follows day &mdash; affect the end.  Thus, if a Republic were to be created in a crucible of dread, of covert cruelty and of crime, what kind of nation could result, other than one where all of these were built &mdash; like flaws in steel &mdash; into that nation?</P>
    <P>That way we must not go while, at the same time, avoidance of that way must not dilute our strength.  Our laws must assume innocence until guilt is proven. Our laws must afford protection to the innocent.  But our laws must not be used to protect a murdering cult group which has more in common with Al Capone's Mafia than with Padraic Pearse's idealists.</P>
    <P>Our approach is clear and unambiguous and it has been stated clearly in the House.  We support the legislative arrangements which confront international terrorism and terrorism on this island.  At the same time we feel that it is absolutely essential, as part of our philosophy and in support of our stand on constitutional republicanism, that we should write into Irish law the clearest and unambiguous safeguards that we can to protect the basic civil rights of all our <Col N="291" /> citizens.  That is what this Bill seeks to do and it is being done by those who hold dear the ideal of true constitutional republicanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>After 26 years in this House and having spent the majority of those trying to understand why Irish people are in conflict I have regrettably come to the conclusion that this is a Southern Irish Parliament that has no ambition to be anything other than a Southern Irish Parliament.This notion that we are in pursuit of a united Ireland is a total fallacy; it is unreal.  The only difference between this Parliament as a Southern Irish Parliament and the old Stormont is that in Stormont they admitted that it was a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.  We are not even that honest.</P>
      <P>I have just heard Deputy Flynn say, and he is entitled to put forward his point of view, that he is a constitutional Republican.I have also tried to understand what a Republican is.  What is a Nationalist? What is Unionist?  What is a Loyalist?  In the United States of America they do not go around saying they are a hyphenated American.  In France they do not go around saying they are hyphenated Frenchmen or Frenchwomen.  They do not say that in Germany.  They simply say that they are American, French or German.  Why cannot the Irish be mature enough to say they are Irish?  Why do they have to hyphenate what they are to prove they are something great or super in this small island?  I do not want to hyphenate myself.  I have discarded those labels which people attach to themselves because of their insecure political positions.In case the people who vote for them might misunderstand what they are saying they run in front of the posse and say they are Republicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have a constitutional Republican.This is not terribly unlike Ian Paisley shouting &ldquo;I am a Loyalist.&rdquo;  There is no difference.  Why can we not jettison all this nonsense and say we are Irish and that we want the people of Northern Ireland to share in the pride of calling ourselves Irish?  Why does the Minister <Col N="292" /> for the Environment have to come in here and highlight the fact that he is a Republican?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

I say, with no great pride or satisfaction because it annoys me to have to say it that I, too, have come to terms with all of this.  This is not a row between Republicans and Loyalists, between Nationalists and Unionists.  This is a sectarian conflict between bigoted Catholics who cannot tolerate the politics of Protestants, and bigoted Protestants who cannot tolerate the politics of Catholics.The sooner we see it in this very narrow sense and stop this damn nonsense of putting respectable labels on ourselves, that we are Republicans, that we are Loyalists or that we are Unionists, the better.  The fact is that the people you call unconstitutional Republicans are bigoted Catholics.  You should say so and settle for &ldquo;I am Irish.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The sooner we become mature enough to follow truly in the footsteps of Tone, to push aside the titles Catholics or Protestants, and call ourselves Irish, and feel a pride in calling ourselves Irish, the better.</P>
      <P>When I go to the United States, England, Scotland or anywhere else I am not asked if I am Republican Irish or Unionist Irish.  I am asked if I am Irish and I say with pride that I am Irish.  I can share that identity with people like Ian Paisley.  On one occasion I asked Ian Paisley why he had said something and he said it was the Irish in him.  I asked him if he called himself Irish and he asked me what I would call him.  I said: &ldquo;It is not what I am calling you but you have just called yourself Irish&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;Let me put it this way: your tradition has never given my tradition the real choice of calling ourselves Irish.  We had to be Republican or Nationalist, Catholic or Gaelic, we had to be anti-British.  There always had to be a clause.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is why I say that this Parliament after 60 years, is a southern Parliament. It is a terrible thing to have to admit but it is the naked truth.  The party to which I belong is predominantly a southern party trying to get away from those shackles.  I cannot see any evidence of that in the Fianna Fáil Party.  One or two Fianna Fáil Deputies I have spoken to privately &mdash; people for whom I have tremendous admiration &mdash; see the position as I see it but they are caught up in the pack when they start running in front of extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowing this debate was scheduled for this week, I made it my business to talk to a number of people in Donegal and the Border areas.  I made it my business to stay away from Fine Gael people.  I socialised with people who are life long friends, and I hope they will remain so, but I respect that they do not share the same politics with me.  They are loyal members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Even as late as Sunday last I asked one or two if they sensed emotion against extradition <Col N="294" /> within their family or within themselves and they said no.  I believe that is true all over the country except for a few Fianna Fáil Deputies who thought they should get on the bandwagon because there could be a whiplash.  They whipped up anti-extradition feeling in this part of the country.  I do not know why they did that but they made no attempt to try to understand the problems of the two cultures in Ireland which had little or nothing to do with British-Irish politics.</P>
    <P>Let us look at extradition.  We are arguing that there should be protection for Irish people being extradited to Britain. That is a fair argument.  I know people who would probably fall into that net and I would have great sympathy for the members of their families if they were to be extradited.  It would be unnatural of me to see it any other way.  Some of these people could be called my neighbours, but that is not the point.  The point being put forward by Fianna Fáil is that we must have protection.  I do not disapprove of that, but let us look at the naked truth. What are we protecting?  We have to protect Irish people being extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland.  Irish people must have a fair trial in Britain or Northern Ireland, otherwise we are neglecting our responsibility to those people.  I do not think anybody could take issue with that but that is not what I want to debate.</P>
    <P>Let me pose this question: what Irish person, man or woman, has been extradited to the British mainland or to Northern Ireland who received an unfair trial? Who is this person?  When did it happen and what action did the Fianna Fáil Party take?  We are getting sidetracked about the court cases going on in Britain at the moment but those people were not extradited.  They were already in Great Britain.  As a people we are entitled to seek protection, but let us not misunderstand the position.</P>
    <P>Let us admit and recognise that Britain is the only country in the world where an Irishman can go without a passport or a visa and get employment without a work permit.  If he needs rehousing he will get the same treatment as any other person on the housing list.  If he goes to Scotland <Col N="295" /> he will be received and respected in the same way as an Englishman.  If he goes to England he will be received and respected in the same way as a Scotsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister.I am making my speech now.</P>
      <P>The Irish have privileges in Britain which they do not have anywhere else in the world.  Hundreds and thousands, maybe even millions, of Irish people have gone to Britain over the centuries.  While it is true that some of them may not have got fair play in the English courts, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, got opportunities in Britain which we could not give them in Ireland.  Are we so bigoted, anti-British and small-minded we are afraid to admit that is the case and that, therefore, we have to protect anybody going into that society in case they might not get a fair trial?  That is the nub of this whole argument.  If the Government feel that people may not get justice in a British court of law, why do they not say they will extradite anyone who has broken the law in Great Britain but that they will send a lawyer with them to ensure that that person has had a fair trial and to report back to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that Margaret Thatcher said tomorrow that it is a fair argument for the Irish to seek protection in regard to extradition but that she, as Prime Minister of Great Britain, also had a responsibility to protect the British people on the mainland of Britain, that from 1 January every Irish person coming into Britain will have a passport or will have to apply <Col N="296" /> for a visa and that every Irish person looking for a job will have to apply for a work permit.  Would we think she and the British Government were acting unfairly towards the Irish?  What if she said she would only allow the good people, those she can trust, to come to Britain?  Let us ponder the logic of that and visualise what would happen if she applied that to Northern Ireland as well.  It would mean that the Bill is partitionist from a party which claim to be anti-partitionist.  Their whole history shows examples of partition, including the break with sterling. All their policies are partitionist.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about extraditing people to Britain but I have not said anything about extraditing people to Northern Ireland.  When I spoke to my Fianna Fáil friends in Donegal I asked them if they would have more confidence in extraditing a person from the Republic to Northern Ireland than in extraditing someone from the Republic to Great Britain.  Without exception, they all said they would have more confidence in extraditing people to Northern Ireland and they would have less confidence in courts in Britain.  That is the feedback I got.</P>
    <P>On the question of Ireland, North and South, I believe that until there is some political settlement our history will not be very different from that of the past 20 years.  The troubles may wane but they will flare up again.  Until politicians sit down and talk about the future of Ireland, until we get a mature Parliament here that recognises you do not have to call yourself a Republican to be an Irish-man, until we sit down as brother Irishmen and talk to one another, there will not be peace.  If someone in the South says he or she is an Irish Republican people in the North can retort that they are Irish Unionists.  The old argument will be raised that you cannot be an Irish Unionist, that it is a contradiction.  It would be better and less complicated if we just called ourselves Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have listened to it.  In extraditing someone from here to the North of Ireland, my kitchen sink politics tell me that as an Irishman who believes in some type of political settlement between the Protestants of the North and the Catholics of the South &mdash; which is really what we are talking about &mdash; we can share Ireland as Irish people, develop a future and have an undivided nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If I fundamentally believe in that, if I am sincere in that belief and if I say to fellow Irishmen who do not want to engage in dialogue with me at the moment that I want them to engage in dialogue with me and that I am inviting them to do so, unless I give them an assurance and I understand that with that invitation to enter into dialogue is a full commitment to protecting their lives, limbs and property, then, it will be seen as Paisley once said a case of, &ldquo;come into my parlour, said the spider to the fly&rdquo;. We will not be taken seriously.  When we invite the Protestant North to have dialogue with us we must be mature enough to realise that extending that invitation is not a conditional promise of security but an absolute commitment to security, not on the day they sit down to talk but on the day the invitation is issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a terrible contradiction in Irish public life.  James Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, John Taylor and all the leaders of the Unionist or Protestant tradition are talking about the situation as they see it. They talk about the need for security but never about the need for better politics and what we will all have to do to settle our differences.  We think it very strange <Col N="298" /> that they will not sit down and talk about politics but continue to rant and rave about security.  Do we ever stop to think that it is the reverse in our case?  We talk about a united Ireland, a new political future, politics and the ongoing political development but not about the security of Ireland.  The Minister is smiling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had a very informative and interesting discussion.  I wish to remind Deputy Harte that if he continues to look provocatively at the Minister inevitably he will provoke him into questions.  Deputy Harte has given a very interesting background but maybe he will now direct himself to the provisions of the legislation before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Extradition is central to all this.  The point I am making is that I would find it very difficult as a Catholic living in the Border area to tell Catholics across the Border to join the RUC or the UDR.  I do not think I would be big enough to do that.  The Minister merely had to say that he could not do that either.  Until politicians in this House and Northern Protestant leaders understand that politics and security run along parallel lines and that we cannot have one without the other, then the troubles will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bishops of Ireland in their letter read out at all Masses immediately after the events in Enniskillen said that there must be no ambivalence, that people <Col N="299" /> must clearly choose between good and evil.  I do not suggest that the ambivalence which took place at the meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting two days later was about good and evil, but it was ambivalent on a very fundamental issue.  It had to be.  Fianna Fáil members of Government talked with ambivalence about extradition and two days before that they were applauding the Cardinal and every Catholic bishop in Ireland on the courage of their statement.I know that &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; is an emotive word in certain places, but so is &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; and &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;.  We say that we will not have divorce but that we will recognise that there are broken marriages and that there are reasons why couples separate.  When we come to sovereignty we get bogged down altogether. The word &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; can be used by anyone who wants to generate emotion. People can be made to feel emotional and to react against extradition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney gave a very convincing argument, but he was not talking about extradition.  Deputy Blaney was talking about the possible bad results of the bad court system they have in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  If there was not a fear of a bad court system in the North and in Great Britain, if we were sure that people would get a fair trial, would Deputy Blaney still be against extradition?  Was the Deputy arguing against extradition or against the system of Justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he did or not, the fact is that the people who are shouting against extradition were roaring like mice when he was extradited.  It could be interpreted by an impartial observer that the Irish are not really against extradition but that they are against extraditing Catholics to the North of Ireland and to Great Britain.  They are against extraditing aggressive militant Catholics who are prepared to kill Protestants because they disagree with their politics.  It has nothing to do with religion, because some of these people have not been in their churches for years but it cannot be ignored that the conflict in Ireland is between Catholics and Protestants.  It is not about religion, but it must be about sectarianism.Sectarianism is the hatred of another person's tradition and culture. To make it respectable we put a label on it and on one side we call it republican nationalism and on the other we call it Loyalist-Unionist.</P>
      <P>From the discussion so far one would think we were about to introduce extradition.Extradition has been here since 1965.  It was introduced by the Taoiseach as Minister for Justice.  Deputy Blaney, who has taken a very hostile position in the matter, was a Minister in that Cabinet.Extradition operated right through the seventies and eighties.  There is nothing new about extradition here. Before we had extradition we had an arrangement which I believe was better and, maybe, more mature.  This debate has all to do about nothing.  The European Convention automatically became law last night.  We can huff and puff as much as we like and we can be as &ldquo;republican&rdquo; as we like but it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone breaks the law in Northern Ireland he should go back to the North. Ireland is an island of 32 counties.  The people who live here are Irish of different cultures, different religions and different politics but the people in the North are as Irish as the people in the South.  If we are not prepared to accept that, to accept the Irishness of the northern Protestant tradition we are not really in pursuit of a united Ireland.  If I identify Ireland as I do, and if I identify the people who live <Col N="301" /> here as I do, then there is an obligation on me, as a public representative, to say that if someone breaks the law in Kerry and is arrested in Donegal, he must face trial in Kerry because he has offended the life, limb or property of some person in Kerry.  Likewise, if a person breaks the law in Derry or in Antrim and is arrested in Donegal he should be sent back to Derry or Antrim.</P>
    <P>If the fear of the House is that a person may not get a fair trial, that is a totally different debate and there are other ways of dealing with that, but not by refusing to send people north.  I recognise that as one moves further from the Border areas the picture gets greener but if it does there is a greater challenge in this House to be something greater than it is doing at the moment.  I do not want to belong to a Parliament that is a southern Ireland Parliament.  My ambition is to be part of an Irish Parliament that can raise itself to a level where we can accommodate the values of people who differ from us and try to persuade them that our future in the island is together, that together we will have to find solutions to the problems which separate us.  We cannot do that if we huff and puff about this Bill.</P>
    <P>I recognise that people want safeguards and acknowledge the fear in the minds of some people.  These fears are exaggerated in many ways.  Perhaps we could just have one debate in this House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

I hope I have conveyed my thoughts to the House and I hope the House has heard them as I have meant them to be heard.  Let us be clear that nobody has monopoly on being Irish.  In our dealings with the Northern majority let us not generate fear in the minds of Protestants. <Col N="302" /> I really think that Northern Protestants at present are looking for friends.  This morning I received a necktie from an old man on the Shankill Road in Belfast who, every Christmas since the early seventies, has posted me a tie.  He sent me a beautiful letter this year.  I came away without it but I said to my wife this morning: &ldquo;I am going to put this on the record of the House this evening.&rdquo;  His letter was pleading for understanding, for friendship, for an end to all the troubles.  I want to say to Joe Shaw and his wife Dorothy in Belfast that in sending that little token, I have read into his thoughts that the Protestant people &mdash; and this backs up the sentiments expressed by other people &mdash; I have spoken with are looking for friends.  Could they really say they have many friends in Dáil Éireann?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to place on record my abhorrence of the recent <Col N="303" /> events that have been perpetrated in this country.  They bring into perspective exactly how terrorism is a threat to our State and democracy.  It is our duty to ensure that there is no corner of this island where people can hide.  We have a duty to all our citizens, both in the Twenty-Six and Six Counties to protect them from this terrorism.  As a constitutional Republican, one who aspires to a united Ireland by peaceful means, I admit I have had problems about extraditing to the Six Counties.  However, I do recognise that the Government have a job to do in the interests of the common good.</P>
      <P>I am more than happy with the safeguards being written into the procedure to be followed under the provisions of this Bill, as they afford our citizens the knowledge that no one will be extradited unless there is a justifiable case against them.</P>
      <P>The extradition law in Ireland has had a chequered career.  The first standpoint was taken in the Extradition Act of 1965 which gave effect to the 1957 Convention on Extradition.  Part III of that Act brought into being a very simplified procedure on the extradition of persons wanted in Britain and the Six Counties. Both the 1965 Act and the 1957 Convention ruled out extradition in the case of a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  The Act also ruled out the <i>prima facie</i> rule in future cases.  From 1965 onwards the <i>prima facie</i> requirement could not be applied to extradition to any of the countries which were party to the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going on then &mdash; arising out of the Sunningdale Agreement &mdash; the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1967, was passed in order to take into account the special problems obtaining between Britain and Ireland.  These specific problems were mainly as outlined by the Law Enforcement Commission established at that time jointly by the British and Irish Governments.  It was the Irish members particularly who felt there was a problem in relation to Article 29.3 of our Constitution which they felt precluded the <Col N="304" /> Irish Government from changing the political offence exemption laid down under the provisions of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The next standpoint was the 1977 European Convention on Terrorism. This arose out of the intention of the Council of Europe to ensure that legislation was in place to prevent terrorists from escaping justice by going from one jurisdiction to another.  It attempts to de-limit the age old offence of political offence.  The offences stipulated under the terms of that Convention include: hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping, hostage taking, also offences involving the use of bombs or automatic firearms if such use endangers persons' lives.  The terms of that Convention also set out to ensure that alleged terrorists were tried in the jurisdiction where the crime was committed.The 1987 Extradition Act was passed to give effect to this Convention. To date 20 of the 21 member states of the Council of Europe have signed that Convention, Ireland is the only country that has not yet signed.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a number of extradition cases which have allowed the Judiciary to take up the running on the question of extradition, something that our Legislature has failed to do in recent years.  The first was the McGlinchey case in 1982.  In that case the Chief Justice, T. F. O'Higgins, held that &ldquo;modern terrorist violence is often the antithesis of what could reasonably be regarded as political&rdquo;.The next case was the Shannon one in 1983 which confirmed the thinking in the McGlinchey case.  Again, Chief Justice O'Higgins stated that it would be a distortion of language if the offence in that case was to be regarded as a political offence.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the Quinn case, it was held that deeds carried out by the INLA whose intention was to destabilise both sections of this island could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as political. It would appear from that that every case coming before the courts would have to be decided on its merits as to what was or was not to be regarded as politically motivated activity.  This was an unacceptable situation, in that what might be <Col N="305" /> regarded by one person as being politically motivated might not be regarded as such by another.</P>
    <P>Those judgments left the way open for the Government to implement the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.Obviously the British authorities were putting immense pressure on the Coalition Government at that time to implement this Convention as part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  They exerted that pressure while they themselves were not, and still are not, a signatory to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  That is the reason they can insist on a <i>prima facie</i> requirement in their extradition proceedings, as they did in the case of the Heysel Stadium.The recent attempt to change this rule in the British Parliament met with tough opposition.  The United Kingdom is renowned as being the most difficult country from which to extradite.</P>
    <P>We must look at the question of extradition in a wider context than that which has prevailed in public debate so far.  No one in this State has any problem with extradition to any foreign jurisdiction apart from the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the enactment of the 1965 Act it would appear that we have extradited 145 people approximately to the Six Counties and over 600 people to <Col N="306" /> Britain.  To say that extradition to the Six Counties is being brought in for the first time is a nonsense.  The fact is that it has been in place since 1965 in a very simplified form.  Part III of the 1965 Act provided a much more simplified procedure for extradition to the United Kingdom, including the Six Counties, than that pertaining to extradition to other countries.  Obviously the 1965 Act was drafted in a period of virtual stability on this island.  To say the least, the law on extradition has been unsatisfactorily dealt with by both arms of this State, the Legislature and the judicial system.</P>
      <P>I contend that the 1987 Extradition Act has gone too far.  While every decent person would agree with the sentiments expressed by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, that none of the offences laid down in Article 1 of the Convention should ever be regarded as political, it has to be said that the Act, as drafted, does not contain any proper reservations or safeguards to protect our citizens going to other countries.  In Article 5 the Convention endeavours to preserve the right of asylum in that there is no obligation to extradite if a country has substantial grounds for believing that the request to extradite has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. However, it remains to be seen if this reservation could be used to effect.  In practice this clause would not be of much use.  What do substantial grounds mean?</P>
      <P>A number of other countries under this Convention will not extradite their own nationals.  A number of parties to the Convention will not extradite where the extraditee is going to be tried by a special court.  That is why this Administration have seen fit to follow on from the constructive points made by them during the debate in the Dáil on the 1987 Act.  At that time Deputy Michael Woods listed a number of areas which he said could have been looked at.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply not politically credible to continue to base extradition agreements on the premise that we can trust <Col N="307" /> foreign courts.  Our experiences in this regard are all too common.</P>
    <P>As far as Fianna Fáil were concerned at that time proper safeguards were required so as to ensure that our citizens were protected from these types of injustices.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the treatment of Irish citizens in the UK has been unsatisfactory.The numbers detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are there for all to be seen.  In 1971 the Irish Government found it necessary to take the British authorities to the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds of ill-treatment of people in custody, which action resulted in the British authorities being found guilty.  The litany of cases in which the quality of justice and fair play has been called into question, even by leading British commentators, is damning.</P>
    <P>The monitoring and observation provisions built into this Bill will ensure that we are in the driving seat in the area of extradition.  I respectfully suggest that perhaps some official from the Department of Foreign Affairs could be delegated to be present at court hearings in the Six Counties and in Britain of persons extradited from here to there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly, in the debate on the 1987 Act, emphasised two points.  He said that before we operate the Bill we should get concrete assurances that when extradition is being sought it will be on grounds which will substantiate the successful bringing of a charge.  He also felt that we should emphasise that the State should reserve the right to review how the Act worked and that the State could repeal the Act if in future the standards which we are entitled to demand and expect are not met.  This Bill is doing exactly what Deputy Kelly was asking, but which his Government were not willing to implement at that time.</P>
    <P>This Bill will bring in the necessary safeguards which will endeavour to establish whether or not there is a valid reason or basis for the request for extradition. Before he can certify a warrant under the <Col N="308" /> Bill the Attorney General must be of the opinion that there is a clear indication to prosecute and that this intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  He must base this opinion having considered such information as he deems appropriate.  That is a very important phrase.  This is the procedure by which this Bill attempts to get as close to a <i>prima facie</i> requirement as possible. The Taoiseach has already explained why it would not be possible to put a <i>prima facie</i> element into the legislation.  It would force us to leave the 1957 Extradition Convention.  It would also lead to difficulties with regard to the production of a Book of Evidence to comply with our law.  Also the examination of witnesses would be difficult.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have questioned the Attorney General's involvement in this Bill.  The Attorney General for years and more recently the DPP have decided in their offices whether or not to prosecute a citizen before the courts in this State.  I cannot see what is different, as proposed in the Bill.  Even Garda superintendents perform this type of procedure, day in and day out.</P>
    <P>I read a very interesting article in last week's <i>Sunday Press</i> by the leading senior counsel, Hugh O'Flaherty, in which he stated that the role of the Attorney General under this Bill may be &ldquo;a stronger protection than having the matter considered by a court: a court can only act on the documents that are before it.  The Attorney General will have other means of checking the facts and the background to the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All the speakers who are suggesting that this is a judicial process are advocating a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, it is not possible to have this included without having unacceptable consequences.  Hugh O'Flaherty also stated in his article that the argument that the Attorney General's role is unconstitutional would seem to be without foundation since the Supreme Court in the Shannon case held that there is no need for the legislation to provide a <i>prima facie</i>, that is, a judicial procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I would also suggest that those who suggest that the Attorney General's role under the Bill is unconstitutional should leave the decision on this to the courts who are the sole adjudicators as to whether the legislation is constitutional or not.  This argument of constitutionality is often raised by Members in this Chamber regarding other legislation, but that is as far as it goes.  The legislation is passed and it is either up to the President or to an aggrieved individual to decide whether to question the constitutionality of the Act.  I respectfully suggest that we should leave this decision to the proper forum.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the Attorney General's role is not judicial but administrative. The reason for this is that there have been over the last few years many instances in which the legal differences between our system and the British system have become apparent.  Anyone who opposes this element will in effect be advocating an extradition procedure that is open to question.  They would also be calling into question the time honoured functions of State solicitors, Garda superintendents, the DPP and the Attorney General.  All these people operate independently of the State.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General in other cases must form an opinion and must give his consent when he is dealing with offences under the Official Secrets Act.  Under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act his consent is also required.  I see no reason an accused person cannot question the Attorney General's direction, under section 44B, in the subsequent District Court proceedings to decide on the validity of the warrant.  Also, the people who question the Attorney General's role do not seem to have any problem with the power of the Minister for Justice under the 1965 Act.  The Minister has much more power under that legislation than that proposed to be given to the Attorney General in this Bill.  As far as I am aware, no attempt has been made by any party to limit the Minister's involvement in extradition proceedings, apart from the 1987 Act in regard to political offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> I am respectfully suggesting that their argument against the Attorney General's involvement in extradition procedure is inconsistent with their lack of action over the years with regard to possible limitations on the Minister's power.  With all due respect, Ministers are undoubtedly political figures, whereas the Attorney General is not.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the implementation of the rule of specialty into our dealings with Britain, provided they bring into their legislation a similar rule.  I understand that to date Britain has not in fact breached this rule.  This section is merely giving a formal basis to the rule of specialty and should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The monitoring procedures as laid down by the Bill are to be welcomed.  As I have said before, Deputy Kelly advocated this type of procedure when speaking on the 1987 Act.  Should the experience not be satisfactory, the Attorney General will be in a position to inform the Government of the situation, who then may repeal or suspend the legislation.</P>
    <P>One other safeguard in the Bill which is to be welcomed is the lapse of time provision.  This extends to the Minister or the High Court the power under section 50 of the 1965 Act to refuse to extradite, by reason of lapse of time.  This will prevent any avalanche of warrants which some commentators are all too prone to harp on.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this legislation provides excellent safeguards for our citizens in connection with an extradition procedure to the Six Counties and to Britain, which heretofore has been merely a very simplified &ldquo;backing of warrants&rdquo; procedure.</P>

      <P>Coming as I do from the Border county of Louth, a county that has been touched by the tragic divisions in Ulster, I have had plenty of opportunity to witness at first hand the very sad conflict that has occurred in that part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have to respect the contribution of Deputy Blaney who, at least, was totally honest in his views, views that are unacceptable to me personally, but nevertheless delivered in his customary forthright way.  Not so the contributions of the Fianna Fáil Deputies which had a theme of ambivalence running right through them.  Only three weeks ago in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> nine of those Deputies trotted out their opposition <i>per se</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>They trotted out their opposition <i>per se</i>.  Every one of them opposed.  Now, three weeks later, we have yet another U-turn on the part of that unhappy party.  However, it is a very welcome one so far as I am concerned although I have to say they are being brought screaming up to the mark.  They will ratify the Convention because of the weight of international and public opinion here following the sequence of events starting with the <i>Eksund</i> affair, continuing with the O'Grady drama and culminating in the horrific events in Enniskillen.  I wonder what event made the greatest impact on that politically expedient decision of Fianna Fáil?  Was it the frightful slaughter in Enniskillen or was it the fact that the O'Grady crime was committed in this State?  I really suspect it was the trauma of the O'Grady kidnapping, the sequence of events <Col N="312" /> resulting from it and the fact that it would be politically expedient to be seen to do something to put down the animals that kidnapped that unfortunate man.</P>
      <P>I recently visited Enniskillen to take part in the remembrance ceremony commemorating the death of 11 gentle people.  I was saddened by the absence of a representative from the Irish Government.  I can now understand the cynicism with which Ulster Unionists look towards any moves by the South, particularly people associated with Fianna Fáil.  That a representative of the Irish Government could not attend on that very sad day was frightening after 20 years of horrific slaughter in the North, sometimes spilling into the South.  That was a day of national shame; it was a day on which the Irish Government, had they been sincere in their overtures to the Unionist people in the North, should have been represented at the very highest level.  Is it any wonder that the Ulster Unionists say &ldquo;no surrender.&rdquo;  After 20 years of non-stop assault on the Protestant community in the North they say &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; to the human animals of the IRA, and I join them in saying &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; to people who commit crimes against mankind and who have reduced this country to the level of Beirut with savage crimes perpetrated against a section of the community.  Is it any wonder there is no confidence on the part of international business in this unhappy State?  Does anybody on my side of the House dispute the ambivalence that is traditional in Fianna Fáil?  There is no doubt that the myth of the shadow of a gunman hangs over this country.  It is part of our tragedy that in 1987 we cannot face up to the harsh realities of life, that is, that the IRA are enemies of both North and South and that has been demonstrated very forcibly in the past month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect Deputy Blaney's contribution here tonight.  I do not agree with it, but he had the courage to come in and enunciate his views, unlike the Fianna Fáil Deputies who, if the various leaks are right, had a lot more to say at their parliamentary party meetings but are coming in here now and hiding under the spurious <Col N="313" /> safeguards they are demanding because they have been left with no alternative but to ratify the Convention.  Notwithstanding that, I support the Extradition Act with no ifs and no buts.  No civilised country should provide a hiding place for people like the IRA or the various shades of it.  We should not provide a safe haven for such people but undoubtedly we have done that over the past 20 years.  I know that because I have seen people in my own town and in my own county who are wanted for frightening crimes by the Ulster authorities.  That is undeniable.  I have to object to that.</P>
    <P>While every Irishman has a doubt about the trials going on in England at present in relation to, for example, the Birmingham Six, and I share the concern that any innocent man might be convicted, nevertheless I want justice for the almost 3,000 people who are lying in their graves in the North and more than 100,000 people maimed and injured in the steady war of attrition committed mainly against the Protestant community and against any other unfortunate people who get in the way.  If we are to be civilised and seen to be so by the outside world we must accept and ratify this measure and take our place with the civilised countries of Europe who have already signed.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that there are over four million normal Irish people living in England, grateful for the opportunity, which perhaps they did not get here, to live and work there. Those people accept and respect British law.  As Deputy Harte has said, there are no passports or visas required.  England, while undoubtedly the cause of problems in this country, is a country with which we should have more and better ties.  It takes most of our produce and many of our people, giving them hope and opportunity.We cannot blame the present English Government and English people for crimes committed against Ireland thousands of years ago.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Ulster conflict can be solved, because, as Dr. Herrema said, we are a nation with our backs to the <Col N="314" /> future.  That is a very profound statement.On one hand, we have the 1690 brigade as exemplified by Paisley's mob and, on the other hand, we have the Fianna Fáil Party living in the past also, in 1916.  If any progress is to be made towards reuniting this country and ending its tragic division, surely some compromise must be made by people on both sides.  Surely we cannot live in the past with old catch cries at election times of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; in the case of Paisley and a visit to Bodenstown in the case of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would have no difficulty in supporting this Bill because if we are to show any sincerity to the Ulster Unionists, if we are to have any credibility as a civilised nation, we must be prepared to provide no safe harbour or refuge for people who have committed unspeakable crimes.</P>
    <P>The tragedy in Enniskillen really plumbed the depths.  It sickened and revulsed most people here.  There is an overwhelming desire by the ordinary people of Ireland to see the tragedy in the North end.  We as politicians have a duty to be responsible.  We have a duty to be honest and to look to the future, not to look to the past.  We should not be continually harping back to the past or singing songs about our glorious or inglorious past. This Bill is absolutely necessary, despite various dangers that might arise.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Irish Government to look at the possibility of proscribing the IRA and Sinn Féin, of banning &ldquo;An Poblacht&rdquo;, of dropping all relations with international terrorists, for example, the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadaffi, and of standing up for a modern Ireland without the shadow of a gunman hanging over it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy McGahon and the House for agreeing to this sharing of time.  The issue in this debate is not of terrorism or of how best and most effectively it can be tackled.  All parties in this House support the principle that all civilised peoples and nations <Col N="315" /> should act together effectively to combat terrorism, both within national boundaries, however artifical these may be, and between national states.</P>
      <P>Within this House the Government party, Fianna Fáil, the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Democratic Socialist Party have all indicated their support for the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and for the extradition of terrorists and other criminals between these countries. The issue is not terrorism; we are agreed on that.  The principles of such co-operation, the 1965 and 1987 Extradition Acts and the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, are therefore not at issue.  The issue for the Labour Party and, I believe, the Irish people is to ensure that the innocent are protected, while ensuring also that those guilty of most reprehensible crimes against humanity and the Irish people are apprehended, convicted and punished.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach and the House that the Labour Party are not soft on terrorism but that they are very hard on the protection of the innocent and the provision of justice, because every man and woman is innocent until proven guilty in an acceptable judicial forum.  In the Bill now before us the Government have failed on two counts.  First, they have failed to provide the required, or even minimum, safeguards necessary for Irish citizens before they are extradited.  Secondly, they have proposed an unacceptable non-judicial forum which amounts to a gross perversion of our judicial process.  The history of our extradition procedures demonstrates our unwillingness to construct an indigenous, truly republican criminal justice system and a contradictory attitude to terrorism. In support of this position, I would point out that extradition with the United Kingdom is conducted much as it was prior to the limited independence we now enjoy, the simple endorsement of warrants for the arrest of persons by senior police officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1965 Extradition Act failed to <Col N="316" /> reform extradition with the United Kingdom, with the noticeable exception of the notorious political offence section. The third point in support of my main argument is that the 1965 Act also made a distinction that there was no requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case for extradition to the United Kingdom while it could be required for other jurisdictions.  Effectively, therefore, our judicial relations with Britain were maintained as though we were still part of the United Kingdom. The political offence clause in the 1965 Act foiled the intention behind that Act and established double standards in practice.While there were no safeguards &mdash; for example the <i>prima facie</i> type safeguard &mdash; for Irish citizens sought to be extradited for non-terrorist crimes, terrorist could claim political status and escape unscathed, even though that term was not defined by the Act.  This double standard created a haven for terrorists in the Twenty-six Counties and led to charges against us as a people and a nation that we were soft on terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court definition of a political offence in the McGlinchey and Shannon cases, while open to various interpretations and legally imprecise, was an advance on the earlier position and would effectively deal with the perpetrators of the Enniskillen massacre should they be apprehended and seek political offence status.  A further positive advance was made by the 1987 Act which ratified the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism when it specifically ruled out certain terrorist acts which could previously be claimed as political offences.  It was at that time that the omission was made that has led us to the present impasse.  It was then that the Coalition Government failed to enter reservations which they could have done, to provide legal safeguards for Irish citizens. A golden non-controversial opportunity was missed and is, in large, part of the reason that we are debating this Bill in a rushed and highly charged atmosphere, with threats, or promises, of a Christmas election.</P>
    <P>Many other countries included reservations <Col N="317" /> in their ratification which ensured that the judicial <i>prima facie</i> rule was retained for the protection of their citizens.  The question must be posed, are Irish citizens not entitled to the same protection?  The Coalition's 1987 Act provided no such safeguards.  In the runup to this debate, Government back-benchers have been making headlines for themselves and, indeed, the last Government speaker left me unsure whether he was voting for the Bill as proposed by the Government or was against it.  There has been a great deal of ambiguity.  Indeed, by and large, their silence now makes all that noise very suspect.  They are not at all interested in the legal protection of Irish citizens.  This was demonstrated last year when this House approved an extradition treaty with the United States and not one voice was raised at the lack of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement for Irish citizens. Ironically that extradition treaty required Ireland to furnish a <i>prima facie</i> case when requesting a fugitive from the United States.</P>
    <P>What we witnessed in the past two weeks was nothing short of the old hypocritical green drum beating by members of a so-called repubican party.  This was a farcical display for home consumption with little, if any, real interest in the legal protection of Irish citizens.  Indeed, I welcome the statement made today by the Minister for the Environment on what he sees as being republicanism within Fianna Fáil.  I welcome his clear statement on that and it was quite unambiguous.  It was this green drum beating that produced the unacceptable hodgepodge of a Bill which is now before us.  This measure, if implemented would be a massive retreat from the standard rules of justice, may well be unconstitutional and represents a diabolical intrusion of the Executive into the judical process, thereby compromising our system of justice.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to provide even the minimum legal protection of a <i>prima facie</i> rule.  This mess of <i>pottage</i> is a result of the green drum beating which I have referred to but let us be clear about this <Col N="318" /> Bill.  It represents a dangerous authoritarian trend in criminal justice and, if passed unamended, it will mark a new phase in legal development in Ireland. I wish to develop this point.  The Bill provides for the setting of extradition warrants not by an independent Judiciary but by the Attorney General who is a political appointee, an adviser to the Government and an attender at the Cabinet.This invests in the Executive wing of Government a function which belongs to and is especially reserved for the Judiciary.  This division of the Executive and the Judiciary is an established rule in our country and in many others and is designed to protect citizens from Executive or Government abuse.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to make political parties and their appointees the arbiters of who would go to jail and who would not.  It is a dangerous road to follow. Decisions regarding extradition would not be made in open court before an independent judge where the defendant and his lawyer could challenge the warrant or request; they would be made behind closed doors by the political appointee of the Government of the day and that is unacceptable.  Can the Minister guarantee that the Attorney General's decision will be open and public? Can the Minister guarantee that the Attorney General will not come under any influence in the Cabinet room, in the inner governmental secretariat, from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice? Can the Minister guarantee that future Attorneys General will be bound to have due regard to past decisions and precedent?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister guarantee that defendants will have the right to challenge the warrants, at least in the Attorney General's office?  Can the Minister guarantee that the Attorney General will not have any communication with his or her counterpart in the United Kingdom regarding particular cases?  Can the Minister guarantee that there will be no trade offs between the British and Irish Attorneys General &mdash; you give me X and I will give you Y?  Can the Minister even guarantee that a twisted form of <Col N="319" /> collective responsibility will not enter into such decisions by the Attorney General who is an attender and adviser to the Cabinet?  Can the Minister guarantee that precise definitions and guidelines on the nature of sufficient evidence will be provided?</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister cannot give any such guarantees because the procedures so outlined rule out any such guarantee.  This is an open invitation to bring the law into disrepute, public suspicion and public influence and for that reason it is also unacceptable.  I would like to ask the Minister whether this investing in the Attorney General of a judicial function is a precedent.  Can we now expect future legislation to place the power of deciding whether or not people should go to trial in the hands of a political appointee?  If this principle of deciding whether Irish men and women should go to trial in a foreign jurisdiction is accepted what is the qualitative difference with our own courts?  Can he assure us that this is the direction the Government do not intend to take?  If it was proposed that Irish citizens should be committed to trial here in Ireland by a political appointee a furore would be raised, and rightly so.  If the Minister gives such a guarantee, can we believe him?</P>
    <P>It is for these and for other reasons that the Labour Party will be opposing this Bill on Second Reading.  If it survives Second Reading we will be putting forward a number of amendments to remove the monstrous perversion of justice as it relates to devolving judicial functions to the Attorney General and to provide at least the minimum safeguards for Irish citizens.  These safeguards which we will propose are of themselves highly contentious but they will keep Irish judicial procedures in line with contemporary European judicial systems.</P>
    <P>We seek to ensure that all Irish citizens will be extradited only if there is a case to be answered.  We seek to ensure that all such extradition hearings are made before a judge in an open court where the defendant will have the right to challenge <Col N="320" /> the warrant on <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  We seek to ensure that the book of evidence has been completed by those requesting the extradition of an Irish citizen.  We seek to ensure that there will be no retrospection and that there will be a regular review of the operation of the Act by the Oireachtas.  It is appropriate that the 1965 Act treats extradition between the United Kingdom and other countries separately.Our experience of the United Kingdom judicial system is greater due to the proximity of our countries.  This proximity makes us even more wary of rushing through a Bill without the proper safeguards.</P>
    <P>The British system of justice is riddled with abuses as far as our people are concerned.The obvious examples of these excesses and abuses are the Diplock courts regardless of whether they are comprised of three biased judges or just one, the emphasis in famous and supergrass trials, the long term remand cases, the most notable at present being the Martina Shannon case, and the past and probably continuing violations of the human rights of prisoners.</P>
    <P>We believe in the present political climate where racist anti-Irish hysteria is whipped up daily by the British gutter press it is well nigh impossible for any Irish man or woman to receive a fair trial in a British court.  We do not need to engage in academic argument to show this as we have all the proof we need in the form of the Birmingham Six trial, where six innocent people are in jail only because they are Irish, and likewise in the case involving the Guildford Four.  Further proof is provided by the McNamee case where new charges were introduced midway during his trial and where the press had publicly convicted the accused before his actual trial.  The treatment of remand prisoners at present adds to that long litany.  Let me say that I view the British system of justice as it applies to Irish men and women with a very jaundiced eye and, therefore, I am all the more concerned that safeguards for the innocent are assured.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the hypocrisy of the British authorities and politicians in this <Col N="321" /> affair.  They have a requirement with every other country except Ireland that <i>prima facie</i> evidence must be supplied before they extradite any of their citizens. The United Kingdom has not signed the 1965 Convention on Extradition, unlike Ireland, precisely because they want to keep their <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Their attitude seems to be that what is good enough for others is not good enough for them.  However, we have our own decisions to make in the best interests of Irish citizens and without British interference.We must decide whether we will pervert our judicial process because we refuse to provide basic judicial safeguards and whether we will modernise our criminal proceedings and bring them into the mainstream of European practice.</P>
    <P>This Bill does the first but fails to do the second.  It gives us the worst of both worlds and for that reason, if unamended, it should be opposed.  If this proposal becomes law it will be an abnegation on the part of the Government of their duty to defend the rights of Irish men and woman both at home and abroad.  It foreshadows more ominous, dangerous and authoritarian tendencies which the Government have no qualms in advancing.  Finally, I say again that the Labour Party are not soft on terrorism but very strong on justice and the protection of the innocent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to place on record my abhorrence of the 20 years of violence that has gone on in Northern Ireland and of the recent events of the <Col N="322" /> kidnapping of Mr. O'Grady and the Enniskillen bombing.  I take the opportunity to congratulate the Garda, the Army and everybody involved in the successful operation in the past few weeks in regard to the kidnap.  They worked in very difficult circumstances and at times the security forces were not helped by the various armchair generals we had in the media and, unfortunately, on various sides of this House.  Terrorism has no place in a civilised society.  It is unfortunate that anybody who declares he is a republican has to dissociate himself from these people who for years have besmirched the name of republicanism and nationalism.  It is not popular to say you are a republican now simply because of the acts those people have engaged in for many years.</P>
      <P>I am a republican and I make no apologies to anybody for saying that.  Nobody involved in terrorist activities should escape the rigours of the law but should be brought to justice.  There is no doubt that that happens in this State, although listening to some of the contributions here in the past few days one would think we were in a country that was a haven for terrorists.  The last speaker but one, Deputy McGahon, said so and said he was aware of people in his town who were wanted for horrific crimes in the Six Counties.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty in relation to extradition <i>per se</i>.  I have a difficulty, which I do not mind admitting, about extradition to Britain or Northern Ireland because of the system of justice as it operates for Irish people in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Deputy Cooney referred to backbenchers in Fianna Fáil having a certain antipathy to Britain.  I have no antipathy to the British people.  I have certainly antipathy towards the British establishment.  I do not believe Irish people will get a fair trial in Britain or Northern Ireland unless we see that safeguards are put in place to ensure that they do.  I am happy enough that this legislation we are passing here puts safeguards in place that will go most of the way towards ensuring that Irish people will not be extradited from this State for <Col N="323" /> interrogation or questioning in relation to matters for which they should not be extradited.</P>
    <P>People might ask what justification I have for my stance about British justice. We have had plenty of examples in the past years.  Deputy Blaney mentioned 1965.  Possibly the trouble has been only since then but I think it goes back further. We have examples of the almost exclusive use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act against Irish people.  We have the case of the Birmingham Six currently on appeal in which it was stated more or less that it was easier to believe that these six people beat themselves up than that the police committed organised perjury.  We have the recent case referred to by Deputy Stagg of those on remand in relation to the trespass of Tom King's residence.  The treatment of those and other people on remand is scandalous and would not be tolerated in any civilised country.</P>
    <P>The case of Danny McNamee is now coming to light and will in time probably cause the same outcry as the case of the Birmingham Six.  He was arrested in midAugust 1986 and was on remand in respect of charges relating to offences in 1983 and 1984.  While he was on remand and being brought to court to continue his remand there was a huge security presence with armoured cars etc., more or less letting the British people know a dangerous terrorist was being held on remand.  The tabloid press that Deputy Stagg mentioned have done their job in relation to this individual.  He was initially charged with crimes committed in 1983 and 1984 in the UK.  This was later amended to &ldquo;charges relating to crimes committed between 1982 and 1984.&rdquo; Later again it was amended to read &ldquo;in the UK or elsewhere&rdquo;.  That addition to the charge was made after the defence had summed up their case.  No connection has been established between him and the Hyde Park murders, yet he has been convicted of these.  The judge spent five hours summing up for the prosecution and one hour for the defence.  He was so biased in his summing up that the defence <Col N="324" /> QC, Mr. Richard Ferguson, stood up and stated that the judge's summary was unfair.</P>
    <P>I go into detail on that because of the reservations I have about extradition without the safeguards the Government are putting forward here.  We cannot have faith in the British system of justice unless we have those safeguards.  It has been said here that people such as the Birmingham Six were not extradited.  The point I am making is that the quality of justice in relation to Irish people cannot be depended on and that is why we need these safeguards.  I accept the necessity for extradition but I also see the need for safeguards in relation to extradition to Britain and Northern Ireland.  I have no intention of going into the legal background because we have had enough legal people on both sides of this House who have gone into that particular argument. Indeed, some of the people who have gone into it might take a note from my stance and stay out of it, so little they know about the legalities of the situation.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the safeguards, as proposed by the Government, are as strong as they can possibly be.  I am very dubious about the position now being taken by sections of the Labour Party.  The position Labour adopted last year was that there was no need for safeguards but now, they say, there are needs for safeguards &mdash;<i>prima facie</i> evidence and so on.  In relation to the position of the PDs &mdash; the latest position they have adopted and which, I think, is their third one &mdash; it is as weak as each of the others. They have shifted ground continuously from the time their Leader met with the British Ambassador.  I do not think they know where they stand on this issue.  The argument in relation to the Attorney General being used in a judicial capacity betrays a lack of understanding by members of the Opposition in relation to the proposals being put by the Government.I would ask them to have a closer look at this before they oppose the safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is not being used in a judicial role.  The part he will play will be at a pre-judicial stage.  He is <Col N="325" /> not taking over the functions of the court and even a cursory reading of the amendments proposed to the Act will show that. The safeguards that have been included in this Extradition (Amendment) Bill are very important.  The most important to my mind is the question of retrospection that has been mentioned by previous speakers.  There are quite a number of people who have been living in this country for some time and who may have been involved in activities years ago.  They have now settled down and become good citizens.  I believe they should be free from the fear of being extradited.  I also welcome the safeguard in relation to the rule of specialty where a person cannot be tried for another offence when they are extradited.  It is important that this should be established.  It is important that we should carefully monitor this rule so that we can ensure it is fully complied with.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I should like to make in general terms.  I have listened in the last two or three days to a lot of criticism of Fianna Fáil backbenchers who express their views within their own party in relation to extradition.  All I can say to some Members of this House is that we were allowed to do so.  Unlike some Deputies in this House we did not have anybody rapping us on the knuckles publicly afterwards about it.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Dempsey.  I will try to be concise and speak for five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, things are not quite the same for us as for other signatories of the Convention. There is no use pretending they are.  It would be dishonest and foolish, it would even be dangerous to pretend they are. We might wish that things were the same for us as for others but they are not.  I wish that, like France, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark or Holland, I lived in <Col N="326" /> a nation that was at peace with itself and with its neighbours, that functioned within secure and permanent boundaries, that did not have to conduct its social and commercial life under the dark shadow of partition.  Of course we do have to remember the realities.</P>
    <P>For most nations terrorism is an alien and brutal intrusion into what is otherwise a sober and lawful existence.  It is purely criminal and malicious.  It is an outrage that is in no way associated with any aspect of national history or aspiration.The terrorism we face, the method chosen by a few in pursuit of an end, is a deep and emotive part of our history. Many of the Members of this House who were eloquent and sweeping in their condemnations of such acts and who rightly recoil in horror at these abominable acts often chose to ignore the realities of our position.</P>
    <P>Let me say clearly what I think that position is.  We are, all of us I presume, Republicans in one form or another.  I have heard this word used a lot today. All of us who are the representatives of the Irish people believe in our country's right to be one nation in peace and harmoney.All of us, and most of the people we represent, hope for the day when partition will be no more, when there will be a genuine union of hearts and minds throughout Ireland.  This is a legitimate and historic aspiration of the Irish people. That aspiration is being frustrated now as in the past in a way which is deeply offensive to many of our people.  A grave wrong is being perpetrated on this nation. There is no use in ignoring this fact.  There are still many people in Ireland who lived through the struggle for our independence.There are many more who have felt the full brunt of what is sometimes misnamed &ldquo;justice&rdquo; in Northern Ireland.  These people and many others who observe these events are left with what can be politely called a somewhat jaundiced view of the standards of justice which are available to Irish people in British courts; examples have been mentioned throughout the day.</P>
    <P>I know that many very reasonable people in Britain are not a little offended <Col N="327" /> that we should have any doubts about their fairness.  Britain has a well founded reputation around the world for the care and consistency with which its law enforcement agencies operate.  British justice has become a synonym for decency and fair play amongst many far flung nations of the world.  It is a sad fact of life that this perception of British justice is not universally accepted in Ireland, North and South.  It is not accepted because it has not been our experience of it.  It would be very helpful to all of us if Britain, its political leaders and its people, would try to understand this.  Thinking and fair minded people in Britain &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; must surely understand that a perception based on the misdeeds of centuries cannot be forgotten in an instant.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to be an apologist for those in Ireland whose political outlook and values is based on a bitter hatred of England and of all things English, but I am entitled to articulate the reasonable doubts and fears of the numerous decent people who find themselves in a cruel dilemma, not of their own making, the dilemma of loathing and detestation of the killers and kidnappers who blacken the name of Ireland by their evil deeds and yet who hesitate to trust fully in British justice.  We are entitled to have some regard for the feeling of these people.  No Government can hope to command the respect of its people unless there are attempts to take account of the views of these people.  We do not need to apologise to anyone for attempting to do this.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthy of support, not because it is perfect but because it is the best solution possible to a difficult problem.  It provides a reasonable degree of supervision and involvement in the important early stage of extradition.  It provides for specificity, ensuring that extradition is used for the purpose for which it was intended.  It safeguards against the dredging up of events of long ago and it provides for a procedure of effective and timely review to take place. If any of the provisions of this Bill are of <Col N="328" /> doubtful constitutional value, there are adequate means by which this can be settled in court.  All I would ask of Britain in return is that they at least try to understand that the situation created and maintained by them in this country does not make it easy for any of us to be enthusiastic about handing people over to them. Their record is not good, however much they might believe the contrary.  We will enact this whole packet of measures on trust and I hope we will not regret it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before Deputy Dukes speaks, the order of this House is that the speaking time is to be allocated in accordance with the relative strength of the parties.  My party as a result of the manner in which the business of the House has been conducted this evening, are about to get a disproportionately small amount of time in terms of the number of speakers.  We are to be the party with the least number of speakers, apparently, in this debate. It should have followed, in my submission to you a Cheann Comhairle, that when Deputy McGahon gave up Fine Gael speaking time and shared with the Labour Party and that when a similar arrangement was dealt with, that that was clearly on the understanding that it would not give that party a greater advantage in terms of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Extradition Act, 1987 is now in force.  I can assure the House <Col N="330" /> and everybody else that I am glad that we have arrived at this point.  I would count that Act among the achievements of the last Government &mdash; an achievement with which I am very happy to have been closely associated.  It is a very positive step on our part and it makes it clear beyond any doubt that we are totally and unambiguously committed to playing our part in the fight against the scourge of international terrorism.  This scourge, as we all know to our cost, affects us; it affects our brothers and sisters and it affects our neighbours and friends.  It is a fact to be deplored that there are people on this island who participate in, who foment and who support barbarous acts of terrorism.  No sane person can have any hesitation about the necessity to use our resources to the best of our ability to frustrate these terrorists and, if they succeed in their murderous designs, to apprehend them and bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>The 1987 Extradition Act and the Bill which is currently before the House are both of considerable importance in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I take great pride and satisfaction in the fact that the last Government negotiated this historic agreement.  I regretted and deplored the fact that when the agreement was brought before this House the Fianna Fáil Party, then in Opposition, opposed it and voiced very ill-considered and uninformed reservations about it.  It is encouraging however, that the Government have now seen the light on this issue, as indeed on many others, and have decided to operate the agreement and to work for the achievement of its objectives.I hope this means that we have seen the re-establishment in a real and fundamental way of a bipartisanship in relation in Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish affairs which has been largely in abeyance since 1980.  If that is the case, then we can congratulate ourselves on having achieved something of immense value in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is in some respects at least of doubtful origin. On the face of it, it arises from a concern on the part of the Government to ensure <Col N="331" /> that there are adequate safeguards in the process of the backing of warrants procedure which was legislated for by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1965.  That is how it appears on the surface.  In reality, however, this Bill has more to do with deflating the exaggerated fears and expectations built up by the Government party, then in Opposition, during the debate on the Extradition Bill, 1986, which is almost a year ago.  I can find no better example of a <i>volte face</i> than a comparison of the Taoiseach's speech in this House on Friday last introducing this Bill with speeches made by him and other spokespersons for his party around this time last year.  There are many things in the Taoiseach's speech of last Friday with which I agree.  I would like to mention a few.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I wish first of all to make it clear that we are not &ldquo;introducing&rdquo; or &ldquo;bringing in&rdquo; extradition.  We have had extradition in this country for a long time. It is not perhaps widely appreciated that extradition has been part of the normal law of this country since the foundation of the State.  The present special arrangements for extradition between this State and Northern Ireland and Britain have been operating since 1965.  They are laid down in the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>Had the Taoiseach been making that kind of remark at this time last year he might not now find himself between the rock and the hard place where he is.  He went on to say that under the 1957 Convention, that is the Convention on extradition, it is not possible to have a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Again, had that point been made by the Taoiseach or any of his spokesmen at this time last year we could all have saved ourselves a good deal of trouble.  I will return to that issue later on.</P>
    <P>In connection with the arrest of the <i>Eksund</i> by the French authorities he went on to say:</P>
    <P>In that connection it is important to recall that the very purpose of the <Col N="332" /> Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, the legislation due to come into operation on 1st December, is to enable us to subscribe to a convention among the nations of Europe to assist each other in responding to exactly this type of situation.</P>
    <P>He referred to states that share common democratic traditions and values and that are political partners and said: &ldquo;... persons who commit acts of terrorism in or against any one of them should not be able by escaping to a neighbouring country to avail of the political offence exception and claim exemption from extradition.&rdquo;  He went on to say that of course we must join in this common fight against terrorism and &mdash; and in this I agree with him: &ldquo;I would not be prepared to see Ireland isolated on this issue and become the victim of accusations and reproach&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach made a number of other statements, with many of which I entirely agree with.  He went on to speak in a different connection about the rule of specialty and again I quote from the Taoiseach's script:</P>
    <P>The rule of specialty is not designed to shield people against additional charges in general but only against additional charges for offences which are not themselves extraditable &mdash; for example, a political offence.  The way this safeguard works is that charges cannot be added except with the consent of the State which has granted extradition.  But if the other charge is for an offence which would itself have been extraditable, that consent must be given.</P>
    <P>In that the Taoiseach was interpreting very faithfully the provisions of our existing legislation.  Had the Taoiseach taken that view at this time last year the House would have saved itself a great deal of time, the Fianna Fáil Party would have saved themselves a great deal of internal aggravation, and perhaps more to come, and we would have had a much more sane approach to the debate on the issues that are raised in this Bill and in the Act <Col N="333" /> that came into operation at midnight last night.  Elsewhere in his script the Taoiseach made a statement with which I cannot at all agree.  He said:</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to point out that in Opposition Fianna Fáil accepted the 1987 Act in principle.  We did not vote against it.</P>
    <P>If I was to parse and analyse that statement I would have to admit that as far as the Second Stage debate was concerned the Taoiseach was accurate in what he said but we all remember that as far as the Committee Stage debate on that Bill was concerned the Taoiseach, and his colleagues, took a very different view. That has a lot to do with the position the Taoiseach finds himself in today.</P>
    <P>Some part of the reason for that great difference in approach between last year and this year may be found in the fact that the Taoiseach is now in the position to know more about the issue.  I do not think that is an important part, or even a small part, of the explanation.  The real explanation is that the Taoiseach now has responsibility and finds himself in a position in which he cannot make exaggerated claims, extravagant claims or provoke exaggerated fears.  On this issue, as on others &mdash; I need only to refer to education, the debate on the Single European Act and the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition exaggerated and misrepresented without the slightest thought for the future and they now find themselves in considerable internal difficulty because they have been brought face to face with reality.  They are now finding it is a difficult and dangerous thing to stop a runaway horse which they have whipped into a mad gallop in the first place.</P>
    <P>During the course of our preparations for the 1986 Extradition Bill, now the Extradition Act, 1987, we examined the question of safeguards.  On introducing the Bill to this House I set out clearly what had been done in this connection.  I should like to quote from the Official Report of 4 December 1986, column 1386, where I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> ...a full review has taken place and it has been decided bilaterally that a warrant for the return of a fugitive will not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain, has considered the evidence and is satisfied that it is sufficient to ground a clear expectation of a prosecution.This means sufficient evidence of a kind that is admissible in court.</P>
    <P>In effect, this means that a warrant will not be sent from Northern Ireland or Britain for execution in the State, or <i>vice versa</i>, unless the case has been examined at a high level to see if there is sufficient evidence on which to bring a charge.  This accords with the principle that extradition is for the purpose of charging a person and not merely for questioning him.</P>
    <P>At a later stage in that debate, as reported in the Official Report of 16 December, 1986, column 3058, I said:</P>
    <P>The British authorities have now agreed an addition to this arrangement.In all cases where a warrant is sent to this jurisdiction for backing the British Attorney General will send to our Attorney General through diplomatic channel a confirmatory note to the effect that he, that is the British Attorney General, has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with the arrangements I have just described.  That note will serve as an additional reassurance that those arrangements have been complied with in each case.</P>
    <P>The passages I have just quoted show very clearly that we were concerned about safeguards at that time.  Our concern then, as now, was that the procedures should work properly in the manner intended in both jurisdictions while providing proper legal safeguards for the persons concerned.  The Bill sets out to provide or to reinforce safeguards. In that it is consistent in principle with our stand on this issue last year.  If the Government now consider it is necessary and feasible to provide by statute what <Col N="335" /> we set out last year to achieve administratively, then I do not object in principle as long as it can be done without putting an obstacle in the way of handing over of persons who are properly charged in the other jurisdiction.  I would like, either during his reply to the Second Stage debate or at the appropriate time in a later Stage of the debate, that the Minister for Justice would indicate to the House what follow-up has been given to those administrative arrangements which we set up and which were fully set out to the House during the course of the debate on the Extradition Bill almost a year ago.</P>
    <P>My spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Sean Barrett, will be putting down a number of amendments to deal with concerns which we have about the provisions of the Bill.  There is room for doubt about the constitutionality of giving the Attorney General the power proposed in the Bill.  There may, indeed, be room for doubt about the constitutionality of giving that power to any other officer. Some Members of the House, far more qualified than I am, have given an opinion on these issues, including my good friend and colleague, Deputy John Kelly, who has expressed strong views on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly takes the view, which I respect, that the proposed action is constitutional.There are other Members who disagree.  On the other hand, the Government are being advised, I assume, that the proposed powers would be constitutional also.  The difficulty is, of course, that the person who is advising the Government on the constitutionality of the action proposed is the very person on whom it is proposed to confer these powers, the Attorney General.  I would prefer to see those powers being given to the Director of Public Prosecutions who has a clear, unambiguous functional independence from the process of Government.I say, &ldquo;process of Government&rdquo;, very deliberately because I want to make it clear to the House that I do not subscribe to the facile belief &mdash; there is a danger that Members of the House will cultivate it &mdash; that persons involved in a political process are to be suspected of ill <Col N="336" /> motives just because of that involvement. That is why I say I would prefer the powers being proposed in the Bill to be given to the Director of Public Prosecutions because of his functional independence from the process of Government.  That is the central point of most importance.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is room for doubt on this issue of the constitutionality of the conferring of those powers on the Attorney General and, indeed, perhaps on the Director of Public Prosecutions. In view of that doubt, I would strongly urge the Government to request the President to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for a decision.  We are putting down an amendment to that effect.  I further support that amendment, and that request to the Government and to the House, by saying that it would be far preferable &mdash; I am sure the House will agree with that &mdash; if the matter were disposed of one way or the other in that way than to have the matter raised as a result of a particular case in one of our courts and have the question of the constitutionality of one of our Acts brought into question in the kind of atmosphere that sometimes surrounds some of those cases.</P>
    <P>During the course of his introductory speech on Friday last, the Taoiseach said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I also wish to make it clear that should it emerge after a period of 12 months that these arrangements are not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition is fully justified can evade the law, the Government will bring forward revised proposals to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>I believe it is essential that we follow that course and we will, accordingly, put down an amendment providing for such a review in the Bill.  The amendment will provide that the central provisions of the Bill shall cease to operate at the expiry or 12 months from the commencement date unless a resolution is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas that they should continue in operation.</P>
    <P>In this specific connection, and also <Col N="337" /> because I believe it to be desirable in any case, we intend to propose the insertion in the Bill of a provision that the report proposed to be made to the Government by the Attorney General each year shall be brought before the Dáil.  Given the interest and concern that the House has clearly shown with the process of extradition, it seems to me that if the Attorney General is reporting to the Government on the circumstances surrounding all of these cases it is a matter which should come before the House since it may well be, although one hopes to avoid the necessity for this kind of legislation very often, that the House will be called upon again at some stage in the future to legislate further on the issue.</P>
    <P>One thing the debates last year and this year, not only in this House but elsewhere, has shown very clearly is that while there is a very strong degree of concern, a very proper degree of concern, in this country about the process of extradition, that strength of concern is matched in many cases by an almost equal depth of ignorance about what is involved in this process.  I believe that bringing that report before the House will give us all an opportunity not only to be clear in our minds on the subject but also to ensure that the general public are far better informed about the issues which arise in connection with extradition.</P>
    <P>In order to make it clear that the functions under this Bill which I believe should be assigned to the Director of Public Prosecutions should not be open to any untoward influence, we will propose the insertion in the Bill of a section providing that it shall not be lawful to communicate with the officer concerned for the purpose of influencing a decision to give or not to give a direction as provided for in the Bill.  As of now I can say that this provision will mirror one already in enactments concerning the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Because we are talking about the allocation of new functions to the Director of Public Prosecutions, which in my preference, we should make it clear at the same time that <Col N="338" /> the same concern would apply in this connection.</P>
    <P>In section 2 (2) (b) of the Bill, it is proposed that the High Court shall be enabled to refuse extradition on the grounds that, by reason of the passage of time since the commission of the offence, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite the person concerned.During the course of his speech last Friday the Taoiseach said he wanted to make it clear that:</P>
    <P>...The mere passage of time itself will not constitute grounds for a refusal of extradition.</P>
    <P>In my view, this provision is not sufficient.It needs amendment to make it clear what the intention is; it needs the addition of a phrase to put that beyond any doubt and we will propose such an addition.</P>
    <P>This is an important section.  We heard the same concerns and allusions expressed during the debate on the 1986 Bill this time last year.  The House should be clear on just what is involved.  I have heard this case being made many times and I know I am not the only person in the House who has heard it.  The proposition goes something like this.  We all remember the events in Northern Ireland, particularly in the period from 1969 to 1973-75.  A great many young people in Northern Ireland were caught up, as young people will be in those kinds of tragic circumstances, in incidents such as throwing bricks or general rowdy conduct in the course of some of those most unfortunate events at that time.  Numbers of those people, having lived some years in those circumstances, decided they no longer wanted to live in those surroundings.They came down here, settled, put down roots and now have families.  They are afraid that with a provision like this &mdash; and this arose in the context of the debate last year &mdash; they might suddenly find a warrant had been produced to hand them over to Northern Ireland.  That is the way the case is put, but that is not the complete picture.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, say, in ten years <Col N="339" /> from today, persons who committed an outrage like the bombing in Enniskillen should not be handed over to justice for trial wherever the appropriate place is simply because ten years have passed.  I cannot think of any defence that could possibly justify our taking such a position. There still are, and the House knows it, cases around the world of people who are being pursued for atrocities committed during the Second World War.  I do not think there are many people who would say that if people are found against whom there is strong evidence of involvement in such atrocities, they should escape scot free simply because of the lapse of time. That is the other side of the case being addressed in this provision.  That is why we will be proposing that a further addition should be inserted in the section of this Bill to refer to other exceptional circumstances which should be taken into account by the court.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I believe our courts would be lax or excessively lenient in their application of this Bill, or whatever comes out of the process of debate we are going through now.  We should make it clear what we intend to be the law, and we should make it clear that we have not been seduced by the simple siren song that is built on the particular case of people who, in their early teens, were involved, probably against their will, in violent incidents and have now turned their back on all that.  In this connection we should leave no room for ambiguity. We should make it perfectly clear just what we have in mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech on Friday last, the Taoiseach referred to a number of other issues that have arisen in debates last year and this year about extradition.  He referred to the fact that under the 1957 Convention on Extradition it is not possible to have a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>...the reality is that if this country were to require a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made out by a country which is party to the Convention on Extradition, then we would no longer be able to remain <Col N="340" /> party to that Convention under which we have operated for more than 20 years.</P>
    <P>He went on further to say:</P>
    <P>...a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would be a major practical obstacle to extradition.  It would mean that prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction would have to produce a book of evidence founded on their law but which would also have to comply with our law.  The problem of having to have key witnesses from that jurisdiction available in court for examination on their written statement would also arise.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party and, indeed, other Deputies in this House had taken that same view a year ago, we could have saved ourselves a great deal of time here in this House, and I think I may fairly state that the issue would not be before us today in the same framework &mdash; indeed, I suspect it might not be before us today at all.</P>
    <P>I have not changed my view on this issue over the past 12 months, although other people seem to have done so.  I believed then, and I believe now, that the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement into the arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom would be a substantial move back from the position which has obtained up to now.  It would be, in every sense, a retrograde step and would clearly be seen to be a step away from anything like a full commitment to international co-operation in the fight against terrorism.  My party, therefore, will not support any proposal in this House to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out many times during this debate, and this evening by Deputy Kitt, that when we talk about extradition the situation is not the same for us as it is for many other countries.  I would agree with that much, but we should bring out into the open all the differences between our situation and that in other countries.  We are speaking <Col N="341" /> mainly in the context of crimes of violence that arise from subversive or terrorist activities.  Mind you, I heard very little comment during the course of this debate or during the course of the debate last year about the other side of the extradition process.  I cannot remember &mdash; although I had this information last year &mdash; how many people were handed over from the United Kingdom to the Irish jurisdiction for trial here.  There are many such cases.  A number of the people handed over are convicted and some are acquitted.  We should be very careful and very wary about adopting in debate a line of argument which would suggest that we expect that everybody who is brought before a court and charged should be convicted and that, in some way, an extradition procedure has failed or shown that it is not of value if somebody is extradited, tried and acquitted.  That is not the case.  Otherwise we would have to believe that everybody who appears before a court should automatically be convicted.</P>
    <P>There are other differences in our case of which we must take account because if we do not we are turning our backs on reality.  Clearly, we are concerned about Irish citizens and we also have citizenship laws in this country that are wider than those in any other country in Europe and &mdash; I think I am right in saying &mdash; than any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>Every person born on this island is entitled to Irish citizenship.  Every person who has one grandparent born on this island is entitled to Irish citizenship.  It is just one more reason, among many, which gives rise to the fact that Irish citizenship is an awful lot wider than the people who live on this island or indeed in the jurisdiction of this State.  It is legitimate to express concern about what happens to Irish citizens when they are extradited but it is not legitimate to go on from that and to say that in the case of Irish citizens we should put some special condition or obstacle to the process of extradition, other than those that are properly required to ensure that the law is observed properly and fully in the two jurisdictions concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> If all who participate in this debate recognised and accepted the effect of the breadth of our citizenship laws on relations between this island and the neighbouring island, we would be doing a far better job for the people whom we represent and who expect the protection of the law because that is what it comes down to in the end.  People expect the full, wholehearted and unambiguous protection of the law for their persons and property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to respond in general terms to the main points which have been raised so far in the debate, some of which I will be going into in more detailed fashion when we examine the Bill on Committee Stage. First, however, I think it is worth recalling again the context in which this Bill has come before the House.</P>
      <P>The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, came into force this morning. This means that we are now in a position to ratify that Convention.  The parties to the Convention have pledged themselves to counter the problem of international terrorism by facilitating the extradition of fugitives from justice who claim a spurious political justification for serious crimes of violence.  In office and out of it Fianna Fáil have always acknowledged the need for international co-operation in the battle against terrorism.  This is why we supported in principle the legislation enabling us to ratify the terrorism Convention when it came before this House last year.  Our only difficulty with the legislation was that it did not address the safeguards issue to the extent that was necessary.</P>
      <P>After some of the events of recent weeks, the problem of international terrorism is present in a particularly immediate and acute way in the minds of people in this country.  The general feeling of revulsion against terrorism, which has always been there, has been intensified by these events and they have served to remind us that we are confronted with a grave problem in dealing with subversive violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> We have all been shocked beyond words by the savagery shown in the John O'Grady kidnap and the Enniskillen bombing.  Adding to the universal feeling of outrage at these events came the news that terrorist elements with international links have been actively seeking to build up a deadly arsenal of sophisticated weapons with which to maim and kill people on this island on a scale away beyond anything we have experienced up to now. The horrors of the past few weeks have served only to confirm our determination to deal with subversive violence.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, special policing and security measures have been taken in the aftermath of these events and are continuing.  A massive search for arms and ammunition has taken place and a number of people are now before the courts on charges arising from finds that have been made.  Searching will go on for some time yet.  When the major search operation began I expressed confidence that members of the public who might be put to any inconvenience as a result of the search would understand what we were doing and why.  I stressed that the operation was in the interests of each one of us and I asked the public to help in any way they could.  The public have co-operated very well indeed and I want to express thanks to them for this co-operation.I confidently ask for a continuation of this co-operation.  The Garda deserve it and have a right to expect it in carrying out the difficult and, as we have seen only too clearly, the dangerous job we have entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement in this debate on Friday last the Taoiseach paid tribute to the courage, dedication and diligence of the Garda in dealing with the kidnapping and said he was confident that, as a result of their continuing search for him, the reputed leader of the kidnap group would be captured too.  Later that same day he was apprenhended.  In the course of the operation he was seriously injured, a man travelling with him was killed and an Army officer was injured, though I understand not seriously.  It is regrettable that operations of this nature, <Col N="344" /> involving our Garda and Army in the necessary use of gunfire should have to take place.  Thankfully, they are fairly rare occurrences but it is a pity that they have to happen at all.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to see people killed or injured, to see innocent people put at risk and to witness then the grieving of relations and friends but no one can be allowed to take the law into his own hands.  We jealously guard our tradition of having our police force unarmed but if and when the occasion demands it the Garda, backed up when necessary by our Army, can be relied upon to take whatever action is called for with courage and resolution.  We are all deeply grateful to the Garda Síochána, and the Army, for bringing this difficult and dangerous operation to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Side-by-side with nationwide concern about the terrorist threat, we have had an unprecedented level of public interest in the issue of how Irish people might be treated before foreign courts, particularly in the wake of an atrocity that stirs people's passions and may affect their sense of fairness.  This concern has arisen in the context of the appeal in the Birmingham Six case and the ongoing efforts to have the cases of the Maguire family and the Guildford Four reviewed.</P>
    <P>This is the context in which today's Bill is set.  There is a consensus throughout the country that we must play our part in the international struggle against terrorism.There is ongoing concern about cross-Border or Border-related subversive activity.  At the same time the public are deeply anxious that the authorities here should be vigilant in their scrutiny of requests to surrender Irish people for trial in foreign jurisdictions. They want everything possible to be done to ensure that the treatment of an extradited person will not in any way be arbitrary or unfair.  Irish people of every political persuasion &mdash; and none &mdash; are concerned about this matter.  The Bill before us today reflects the widely held view in this country that existing safeguards in the matter of backing of warrants do not go far enough, especially in the context of the coming into operation <Col N="345" /> of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>What this Government have done has been to listen to the concerns being voiced by the public and to take the appropriate action.  We wanted to ensure that a person's extradition would not be sought merely for the purpose of getting enough evidence to charge him with the offence cited in the warrant or indeed some new charge.  We have devised statutory arrangements to ensure that, at the time when a warrant is sent here for backing, there is a clear intention to prosecute him and that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  We have also addressed our minds to the rule of specialty which is already in force in our arrangements with places other than Britain and Northern Ireland.  The application of this rule ensures that a person's extradition for a particular offence is not followed by the bringing of additional charges against him for offences for which extradition would have been refused.  The Bill also provides that a person's return may be refused where, by reason of lapse of time it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to return him.</P>
    <P>Our concern in drafting the provisions governing the issues of sufficiency of evidence and specialty has been to respond to the legitimate concern of many responsible people in this country that our extradition arrangements should protect the rights of the accused to the greatest possible extent.  We wanted to do this without at the same time undermining the principle that those against whom there is a well-founded serious charge to answer should, where possible, come before the courts of the country in which the alleged offence occurred.  There is a delicate balance to be struck between these two objectives.  Nothing that I have heard in the debate so far has shaken my belief that we have got that balance right.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with the main points that have been raised in the debate.  The debate has centred mainly on the provisions of section 2 of the Bill which relate <Col N="346" /> to the functions which it is proposed to allocate the Attorney General.  This is as it should be because that is the most important safeguard provided for in the Bill.  Section 2 will provide a meaningful safeguard in the matter of sufficiency of evidence but will not suffer from the drawbacks that a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would involve.  The Government have decided that the appropriate person to perform the function under section 2 is the Attorney General.  A number of speakers queried this.</P>
    <P>Article 30.1 of the Constitution provides that there will be an Attorney General &ldquo;who shall be the adviser to the Government in matters of law and legal opinion&rdquo;.  Some Deputies have sought to make much play of this provision in the Constitution, suggesting that the Attorney's role is confined to that of legal adviser to the Government.  But that is not the Attorney's only function because the same Article of the Constitution goes on to state that he &ldquo;shall exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties as are conferred or imposed on him by this Constitution or by law&rdquo;.  The function which section 2 of this Bill confers on the Attorney General is one conferred by law in accordance with Article 30 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It has always been accepted that the Attorney General is independent in the exercise of his functions.  The leading work on the Office of the Attorney General in Ireland cites the following statement with approval:</P>
    <P>in the discharge of his legal and discretionary duties the Attorney General is completely divorced from party political considerations and from any kind of political control.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has already in the course of this debate referred to the statement by Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore in McLoughlin <i>v</i>.  Minister for Social Welfare that</P>
    <P>the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government, but is put into an independent position.  He is a great officer of State, with grave <Col N="347" /> responsibilities of a quasi-judicial as well as of an executive nature.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the fact that the Attorney is removable from office at will, as indicating that he would be subject to influence and pressure in the discharge of his functions under the Bill. That is not the way Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore saw the matter.  He said:</P>
    <P>The provision for his voluntary or forced resignation seem to recognise that it may be his business to adopt a line antagonistic to the Government, and such a difference of opinion has to be resolved by his ceasing to hold the post...  But while he is in office he holds, and if he is to do his duty and discharge his responsibilities must hold an independent position.  He is specifically excluded from being a member of the Government, which again underlines his special position.</P>
    <P>The kind of suggestions we have heard from some speakers in this debate about Attorneys General being subject to political pressure in relation to the exercise of their functions under this Bill are unworthy, are quite unwarranted and are out of keeping with the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>In this context, Deputies will have noted the remarks of Deputy John Kelly on the radio last Friday on the question of the independence of the Attorney General.  He said:</P>
    <P>An Attorney General is not there to take orders on a day to day basis from the Government and I am not aware that any Attorney General ever has done so.  He is an officer whose position is specified in the Constitution and he always has behaved as though he is conscious of that status.  I do not think you need be afraid that if this Bill becomes law the Attorney General is going to be exerting his new statutory powers merely to accommodate himself to a shifting political wind.  I do not think that is going to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> Deputy Kelly expressed similar sentiments in this House this morning.</P>
    <P>We have also heard suggestions during the debate that the function which the Bill confers on the Attorney General ought more properly to be conferred on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would be quite inappropriate to do this. The functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions relate to the prosecution of offences within this jurisdiction.  He has no function in relation to extradition applications, whereas the Attorney General has.  Responsibility for representation of the State in extradition cases in court rests with the Attorney General.  He also has an important role, as matters stand, in relation to the vetting of warrants and accompanying documentation before warrants are endorsed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.We are all aware of the kind of technical difficulties about warrants that have arisen in certain extradition cases. The Attorney General is directly concerned in a number of administrative measures that are being taken to reduce to the minimum the risk of extradition warrants and associated documentation being found by our courts to fail to meet the requirements of Irish law.</P>
    <P>I would also point to the non-statutory arrangements on the sufficiency of evidence which the previous Government were proposing to participate in.  These arrangements would involve the British Attorney General providing, through the diplomatic channel, a certificate to our Attorney General &mdash; the arrangement was to be on an &ldquo;Attorney General to Attorney General&rdquo; basis.  The Attorney General in Britain is the Law Officer who would have ultimate responsibility on their side for arrangements there might be in the prosecution service to ensure that every extradition case is scrutinised for sufficiency of evidence.  The appropriate law officer here to be in communication with the British Attorney General on this matter and to be given a statutory function with regard to it is clearly the Attorney General and not the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The previous Government accepted that this was <Col N="349" /> so when they were proposing purely administrative arrangements.  Why should the position be different now that the safeguard on sufficiency of evidence is being strengthened by giving our Attorney General a strengthened rule and by putting it on a statutory basis?</P>
    <P>Finally, conferring this function on the Attorney is consistent with the principle that has been maintained in other areas, namely that in criminal law matters which involve our relations with other countries, it is the Attorney General, not the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has responsibility.  For example, it is the Attorney General and not the DPP who has the function of prosecuting for offences under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Similarly, the consent of the Attorney General is required for prosecutions under the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, the Official Secrets Act, 1963, the Genocide Act, 1973 and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  The reason that responsibility for prosecutions has been reserved to the Attorney General in all these areas is because of their international dimension. That dimension very obviously exists in the case of the present Bill too.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked on what basis would the Attorney General form his opinion that there was a clear intention to prosecute and that that intention was founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The short answer to that question is that the new section 44B, which is to be inserted in the Extradition Act 1965, provides that the Attorney General will consider &ldquo;such information as he deems appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In practice what that will mean is that it will be a matter for the Attorney General himself to decide in the light of each case, the nature and extent of the information which will be necessary, in the case, for the purpose of forming the opinion which is required by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious that the new requirement should not act as an obstacle to legitimate extradition requests.  What the Attorney General will be looking for is material which will enable him to form his opinion one way <Col N="350" /> or the other as to the matters mentioned in the section.  Obviously, it is not possible for me to say in advance what he will be requiring in any particular case.  I am confident that the British authorities will co-operate to ensure that the provision operates successfully and with a minimum of complication.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and Deputy McDowell have suggested that the procedure proposed in section 2 will provide an inadequate safeguard because, as drafted, the section does not require that all warrants should be submitted by the Garda Commissioner to the Attorney General for his consideration.  This is not so.  In fact, the proposed sections 44A and 44B which section 2 inserts into the 1965 Act have been carefully drafted to ensure that the Attorney General will be required to form an opinion one way or the other in the case of all warrants to which this Bill relates.</P>
    <P>Section 44A says that such a warrant shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs.  Section 44B then goes on to say that a direction of the Attorney General shall be given unless the Attorney General is of opinion, etc.  This clearly places the Attorney General under a duty to form an opinion in relation to each warrant under the Bill. It is only if he is of opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute etc., that he is entitled to decide not to give a direction.  To enable the Attorney General to fulfil this duty, it will be necessary for the Garda Commissioner to refer every warrant covered by the Bill to the Attorney General.  The Garda Commissioner will, of course, be obliged to do this in view of the very clear statutory requirements on the matter.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, the duty of the commissioner under section 43 of the 1965 Act to endorse a warrant is subject to the provisions of Part III of that Act and the new sections 44A and 44B will be included in Part III.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Shatter also asked what &ldquo;sufficient evidence&rdquo; means in section 44B.  It is quite clear from the terms of the section that it can refer only <Col N="351" /> to sufficient evidence to found an intention to prosecute.  There can be no question of it referring to evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Deputy Shatter asked what would happen if a person was extradited and subsequently acquitted.  That, of course, would not reflect in any way on the opinion the Attorney General had formed in the case.  As the Tánaiste has already pointed out, evidence to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt and evidence sufficient to found on intention to prosecute are altogether distinct concepts.</P>
    <P>The new procedure involving the Attorney General's opinion has also been criticised from opposite points of view on the score of its being open to review by the courts.  Deputy O'Malley was of the view that the most worrying feature of the Bill was that it had been drafted so as to attempt to exclude from judicial review the substance of the decision entrusted to the Attorney General. Deputy Barrett, on the other hand, was afraid that section 44C would cause enormous problems because it would involve the Attorney General being called to court to explain why he had not given a direction prohibiting the endorsement of a warrant and would have to indicate what the reasons were for his opinion.</P>
    <P>The true position, of course, lies between these suggested extremes.  The Bill does not seek to exclude the possibility that the court might review the Attorney General's decision.  It would not be appropriate, and might well be unconstitutional, to seek to do that.  It is properly a matter for the courts themselves to decide whether a decision of this kind should be reviewable and, if so, to what extent.  Some executive acts which require the deciding authority to be &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; as to certain matters have been held by the courts to be subject to review by them, while other such acts have been held not to be reviewable or to be so on relatively narrow grounds only.  It seems to depend in part on the nature of the act in question.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not, therefore, seek to <Col N="352" /> exclude the possibility of review.  What it does is try to ensure that, if somebody wants to put the question of a direction by the Attorney at issue in extradition proceedings, the onus will be on him to show that a direction was given or ought to have been given.  It will not be open to somebody to simply make an assertion to that effect in court and thereby put the State on proof that a direction was not given and ought not to be given.  That is the effect of section 44C.  It is a reasonable and acceptable application of the principle that he who asserts must prove.</P>
    <P>The other thing the Bill does is that it reserves judicial review of the Attorney General's decision to the forum where such review of executive or administrative action normally takes place, namely, the High Court.  That is the intention of section 2 (1) (c) of the Bill which provides that in any proceedings in the District Court in relation to a warrant to which the Bill relates, it shall not be necessary to prove that a direction of the Attorney General was not given or required to be given.  This will mean that it will be possible to raise an issue about the Attorney General's direction only in the High Court.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the functions which the Attorney General will be required to perform under section 2 are essentially judicial in nature.  The implication appears to be that section 2 is therefore unconstitutional because it empowers the Attorney General to take decisions as to people's rights and liabilities and, therefore, amounts to a usurpation of the functions of the courts to administer justice.  But the fact that a statute empowers the Attorney General to take a decision that will affect the right of a person to take some legal proceedings, or his liability to such proceedings, does not mean that the statute empowers him to determine the issue in the legal proceedings.  It is not as if it were empowering him to try a criminal or civil case.</P>
    <P>Essentially what section 2 requires the Attorney General to do is to form an opinion as to two matters &mdash; that there is an intention to prosecute and that that <Col N="353" /> intention is based on the existence of sufficient evidence.  For the purpose of future requests from Northern Ireland and Britain, it will be necessary for the Attorney General to form that opinion before a warrant may be endorsed and the processes of our legal system set in motion.  The formation of that opinion will be a necessary preliminary step to the initiation of the extradition process. In no sense will the Attorney General be deciding that the offence for which the person is sought is an extraditable offence.  That will remain a matter for our courts and, in certain limited circumstances set out in the 1965 Act, for me as Minister for Justice.  Nor will the Attorney General in any sense be deciding that the person sought should be committed for trial.  That will remain a matter for the courts of the requesting jurisdiction in the event that the person is extradited.  Those are not the purposes of the procedure.</P>
    <P>Rather its purpose is to ensure that there has been adequate scrutiny of evidence on the other side, reflecting the principle which underlies extradition. The principle was stated in the Supreme Court in the Shannon <i>versus</i> Fanning case as being that extradition must be bona fide, that is, for the purpose of putting the person on trial on the basis that there is already sufficient evidence to put him on trial.  Proceedings which are not bona fide should not be permitted to go before the courts any more than the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions should bring a prosecution before our courts on a charge which was without sufficient supporting evidence.</P>
    <P>There is no question, therefore, of any functions of the courts being usurped. Deputy Kelly, who is a leading authority on the Irish Constitution, has said that he feels the apprehensions about the involvement of the Attorney General are not well founded.  He has referred to the case of McDonald <i>versus</i> Bord na gCon, Costello's case, Shanahan's case and MacCurtain's case and has said that he thinks the functions proposed in the Bill do not correspond at any point to the description of a judicial function given in <Col N="354" /> McDonald.  He has dealt with these cases in a most authorative way and I do not propose to try to cover the same ground. However, I do want to take up some of the points that were made by some other speakers in support of the suggestion that the Attorney General's function would be a judicial one.</P>
    <P>The new procedure we are introducing is an executive or administrative &mdash; not a judicial &mdash; procedure.  A strong parallel exists, I would suggest, between the functions we are conferring on the Attorney General in this Bill and his functions in respect of certain prosecutions where his consent is necessary before a prosecution may be taken.  I have already mentioned the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and other statutes which require the authority of the Attorney General for a prosecution.  These functions are not of a judicial nature.  The decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute or not to institute proceedings is not a judicial act either.  That decision involves an evaluation of the strength of the case against a suspect.  Why, then, should it be maintained that the function conferred on the Attorney by this Bill is judicial just because it involves his forming an opinion on whether there is a clear intention to prosecute, which is founded on sufficient evidence, on the part of prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction who are seeking a person's extradition from here?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that what was at issue in the Bill was different from a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring, or not to bring, a prosecution.He said that a decision as to whether a person should or should not be deprived of his liberty and surrendered into the hands of another sovereign power is a justiciable controversy.  Of course it is and will continue to be but that decision will not be taken by the Attorney General.  The formation of the opinion of the Attorney General under section 2 of the Bill will simply be a necessary preliminary step to the determination of that justiciable controversy by a court.  The decision to extradite or not to extradite will remain one for the <Col N="355" /> court, in the same way as the decision as to guilt or innocence in a prosecution remains one for the court after the DPP or the Attorney General has decided in the light of the available evidence that the case is one in which a prosecution should be brought.  Is Deputy O'Malley suggesting that a decision by the DPP to prosecute somebody does not result in that person being deprived of his liberty, by way of arrest and remand, pending the determination by a court of the justiciable controversy that is involved in a criminal trial?</P>
    <P>Another existing function of the Attorney General which I think is clearly in point is his function in relation to criminal appeals.  Under section 29 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, no appeal lies from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court unless the Court of Criminal Appeal itself or the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions certifies that the decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken.  How can it be said that a decision affecting the availability of an appeal in individual cases to the highest court in the land is not a judicial function but that the forming of the Attorney's opinion under this Bill is?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also indicated that the Attorney General's function under the Bill could not be less than judicial because in the Senezio case the issue of a summons by a District Court clerk was held to be a judicial act.  He said that the very fact of a District Court clerk being supposed to make up his mind whether he should issue a summons was held to be judicial.  But the fact of the matter is that in the Senezio case the Supreme Court was interpreting a specific statutory provision which conferred on district justices the function of receiving information or complaints.  The court held that the issue of a summons upon the making of a complaint was a judicial as distinct from an administrative act but it did so upon the terms of section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  Far from <Col N="356" /> holding that the issue of a summons was inherently a judicial act, on the contrary the court held that there was nothing to prevent the provisions of the 1851 Act being replaced by statutory provisions which would provide for the procedure of issues of summonses being an administrative procedure only.  That is what the Court (No. 3) Act, 1986, subsequently did.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also said that the Attorney General's opinion would be essentially indistinguishable in character from the opinion which a district justice must form in a preliminary examination under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, that there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial on indictment for an offence.  The district justice's function under the 1967 Act, he said, has been found to be a judicial function, so how could it be argued the opinion of the Attorney General as to the sufficiency of the evidence in an extradition case is not a judicial evaluation?  What the Bill provides for is something that will be a necessary procedural step in extradition proceedings, not a decision by the Attorney General that the person sought should be committed for trial in the requesting jurisdiction.  As I have already said, that will be a matter for decision in the committal proceedings in the requesting jurisdiction if the person concerned is sent back.  Even a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in a court here would not in fact amount to a decision to commit for trial.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have suggested that the safeguards in the Bill as regards sufficiency of evidence is not enough and that we should go further and impose a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in our courts before a person could be extradited.  The Labour Party, for example, now appears to want a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Last December their position was quite different in that they were prepared to support the 1987 Act on the basis of an administrative arrangement under which assurances would be given by the British Attorney <Col N="357" /> General as to the existence of an intention to prosecute, founded on a sufficiency of evidence.  Their spokesman on legal affairs, Deputy Taylor, could not see then why there should be a difficulty in transferring the decision on this issue to an Irish legal officer.  The decision he said, could rest with a senior legal officer who would be performing an administrative function, not a judicial function.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling reason for not imposing a <i>prima facie</i> requirement &mdash; it would constitute an excessive restriction on extradition.  The only country in Europe at present which in practice requires that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in court before granting extradition is Britain itself, which is not as yet a party to the Extradition Convention of 1957 and, of course, has never imposed this requirement in relation to extradition to Ireland.  The British have found that their imposition of this requirement on other European countries is a substantial technical barrier to extradition, which some of these countries have found virtually impossible to meet.  In recognition of this situation the British Government have brought forward legislation, which is now going through parliament to enable the <i>prima facie</i> requirement to be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Turning to our own situation, it would not be acceptable if we were to impose a requirement in our extradition law which would have the effect of causing considerable expense and delay in extradition proceedings and would result in the failure of legitimate requests.  The suggestion being made by those who advocate a <i>prima facie</i> requirement seems to be that an extradition hearing in the District Court should be the equivalent of a preliminary examination in the case of an offence under our own law and that the wanted person should not be sent back unless it is shown that there is enough evidence to warrant his return for trial if the offence had been committed here.  This would mean that the prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction would have to prepare, at short notice, a book of evidence which would comply with our laws of evidence.  It <Col N="358" /> would also mean, if the same level of protection were to be afforded as in an internal case, that witnesses from the foreign jurisdiction would have to be available to be examined upon their sworn depositions should they be called upon to do so.  Can anybody seriously doubt that they would be called upon to do so in extradition cases?  I am not satisfied that it would generally be possible for the authorities concerned to meet these requirements.  We would face an unacceptable situation in this event where fugitives from justice would be able to treat this jurisdiction as a safe haven.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has said that having a <i>prima facie</i> case does not necessarily mean that one has to bring over many witnesses and has said he understands that, in the normal domestic procedure where a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established in court on the documents in a preliminary examination, the district justice can and does refuse to order the attendance of witnesses where they are from outside the jurisdiction.  But what guarantee would there be that this would be what would happen in an extradition case, where all the witnesses would be from outside the jurisdiction and the wanted person strongly challenged their written statements?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla also pointed out that one may have to have police presence in the normal extradition procedure anyway, in that a policeman may have to come to identify the person who is brought before the court.  But that just serves to illustrate the problem very clearly.  The practice Deputy Mac Giolla is referring to stems from the need to establish that the person before the court is the person named or described in the warrant.  If the whole of the prosecution evidence in the case were to be in issue in the District Court, the possibilities for calling various witnesses, both police and others, would be greatly multiplied.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Kennedy have suggested that, to avoid such difficulties associated with a <i>prima facie</i> requirement, we should instead provide for something similar to the American concept of &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; and simply seek <Col N="359" /> an affidavit or statutory declaration from the requesting authorities which would contain a statement of facts, setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that an offence had been committed and that the person sought committed it.  Deputy O'Malley said that the defendant could not in these circumstances have the right to seek to have the witnesses brought. However, he went on to say that the defendant could make a statement in open court that a part of the affidavit was untrue or not fully accurate or that he contested it.  His legal representatives could contest or argue about the charges and he could let the public know via the press what his position was.  If that was to be the case surely its only purpose would be to put the other side to further proof of the case against him.  Otherwise doubts would be raised as to the case against the person without being resolved.  Deputy O'Malley says that this system works without these difficulties in the United States.  That may well be but can we be sure that the same would necessarily apply here.  Introducing concepts from one legal system to another can run into difficulties because of differences in traditions, procedures, judicial approach and so on.  I am far from being satisfied that this particular transplant would work satisfactorily and without undue complication in our system.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the problem about the <i>prime facie</i> requirement is that in legal systems similar to ours it has tended to afford an excessive degree of protection to the accused.  It has proved very difficult in practice to apply the requirement successfully when there is an external prosecuring system involved.  To put it simply, it is the victims of crime committed by fugitives from justice whose rights would suffer if meritorious extradition applications were to fail because of such a requirement.  I am very much afraid that any of the variations upon a <i>prima facie</i> requirement that we have heard advanced during this debate would be likely to suffer equally from such disadvantages in practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Besides, to require the production in court of an affidavit of the kind suggested would be out of keeping with the European Convention on Extradition.  Article 12 of that convention specifies the documents whose production may be demanded in support of an extradition request and they do not include an affidavit of this kind.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to something which Deputy Mac Giolla said.  He suggested that, as well as being concerned about people who may be extradited to Britian or Northern Ireland, we should also be concerned about the fate of those who may be extradited to other countries that are parties to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  Of course, we are concerned about all extradition cases.  The fact of the matter is that the extradition arrangements we have with other European countries are different from those we have with our immediate neighbours.  That is reflected in the more formalised extradition procedure provided for in Part II of the 1965 Act. Besides, in practical terms when we speak of extradition from the jurisdiction we are talking almost exclusively about extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain.  There have been very few cases under Part II of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla's specific concern was that in some countries covered by Part II people might be jailed for their political beliefs.  However, the principle of non-extradition for political offences properly so called will remain.  Furthermore section 11 (2) of the 1965 Act provides an explicit safeguard against the eventuality about which Deputy Mac Giolla was concerned.  It says that extradition shall not be granted if there are substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.  One of the purposes of this provision &mdash; and of the corresponding provisions in sections 8 and 9 <Col N="361" /> of the 1987 Act &mdash; is to safeguard the traditional right of asylum.</P>
    <P>Between common law countries, whose jurisdiction in criminal law matters is generally territorial, there has never been a tradition of non-extradition of nationals.  Extradition between this jurisdiction and Britain and Northern Ireland has accordingly always operated without any distinction on the basis of nationality.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a point that was made by Deputy O'Malley.  He suggested that Part III of the 1965 Extradition Act substantially re-enacted the arrangements set out in the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, and that the system of execution of warrants which Part III provides for is appropriate only to the internal movement of defendants within one jurisdiction.  He said that in Part III we do not look on the United Kingdom as an independent foreign country at all but rather as some kind of associated jurisdiction with a common sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The facts do not bear out this view of the position.  The 1965 Act made vital changes in the system of backing of warrants that operated before then.  Under the 1965 Act warrants are endorsed for execution by the Garda Commissioner but when a person is arrested he must be brought before the District Court before his return can be ordered.  Before it makes an order the District Court satisfies itself that the procedure prescribed in Part III has been followed and must refuse to make an order if the offence in question does not correspond with any offence under the law of the State which is an indictable offence etc. After an order is made by the District Court the Act expressly requires that the person concerned must not be delivered up, except with his consent given before a district justice, until 15 days have expired from the date of the order.  This allows him an opportunity to apply to the High Court to be released either on specific grounds provided for in section 50 or on any ground on which <i>habeas corpus</i> would normally be available.</P>
    <P>There is no good basis for suggesting that this whole procedure is one which is <Col N="362" /> not appropriate to an inter-state arrangement.To take just one facet of the procedure, who ever heard of non-return of a fugitive for a political, military or revenue offence within a common sovereignty area?  Deputy O'Malley's comments are wide of the mark as regards the position that has obtained since Part III of the 1965 Act came into operation.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for an extradition procedure &mdash; the Supreme Court has said as much.  That extradition procedure is a simplified one: for instance, it does not involve the use of the diplomatic channel as Part II does.  That procedure is a recognition of the immediate geographical proximity of the neighbouring jurisdictions, the close economic and social ties and the common travel area that have existed with them down the years and the fact that dual citizenship is fairly common among residents on either side.  Special arrangements on extradition between neighbouring, independent jurisdictions are a recognised feature of international relations &mdash; they exist between the Nordic countries, for example.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with what have seemed to me to be the points made in the debate that have most required a response. There were other points which were also deserving of a reply.  To the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, I say that I have listened closely to what he had to say about the amendments which his party will be proposing.  At first sight, a number of these do not seem to present any undue difficulty, and I will consider them carefully when I see their actual content.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion about asking the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court, it is a matter for the President himself, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution, to make such a reference.  It is, of course, open to any group to express a wish for such a reference, and naturally if the President should decide to do so, I would have no objection whatsoever to such course.</P>
    <P>With regard to comments made by the British Prime Minister in the House of <Col N="363" /> Commons this afternoon, I do not accept her viewpoint that extradition will become more difficult because of our new safeguards.  We do not anticipate that these safeguards will cause any difficulties that cannot be overcome.  It is not correct to say that our protective measure for Irish citizens will make Great Britain the least favoured state in Europe.  It must be remembered that there is a special arrangement for the backing of warrants already in existence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that I believe that the debate we have had on Second Stage of this Bill has been a credit <Col N="364" /> to this Assembly.  Members on all sides have given serious, reflective contributions on a complex subject which affects the liberty of the citizen and the need at the same time to bring terrorists to justice.  The spotlight of public and international attention is on Dáil Éireann and its handling of the extradition safeguards issue.  I am confident that the legislation which we are now enacting in this respect will work as it should and it will also reflect well on all the Members who took part in our deliberations on this subject.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins has asked permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the composition, terms of reference, procedures, criteria for the evaluation and time scale for submissions and decisions of the Quota Review Committee for Primary Education.  May I suggest that the Deputy has 14 minutes to make his case and the Minister eight minutes to reply. Is that satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never question your arithmetic, a Cheann Comhairle.I thank you for the opportunity to return to the topic, in a way, of the implications of Circular 20/87 on the primary education sector.  My purpose in raising the issue of the quota review committee announced by the Minister for Education when we were discussing primary education in the Dáil and the general review of primary education that she announced after a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting on 24 November is to provide the Dáil and the Minister with an opportunity for clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These announcements by the Minister, both inside and outside the Dáil, have sown more confusion, distress and uncertainty than they have resolved.  In so far as I have a very limited amount of time, I should like to state what I have to say in the form of some simple questions to the Minister which I hope she will answer because they are questions which the public would like to have answered.  My first question to her is this: Why, when she was issuing invitations to participate in the Quota Review Committee, did she not issue an invitation to parents to be directly involved, or to the National Parents' Council?  After her announcement was made publicly she stated on television in answer to a question put by Olivia O'Leary that a representative of the Catholic School Managers Association represented parents, that in so far as parents were represented on boards of management, they were represented. She then went on to name an individual. As it happened the individual the Minister named was not a parent with a child in primary school at present.  This must have caused embarrassment to the person concerned as he is not a member of a school management board as a representative of parents but rather as a representative of a patron on the board. The Minister's logic simply does not stand up because if she says that people could have a secondary type of representation, that teachers are on management boards, I might remind her that she found it necessary to issue an invitation to the <Col N="367" /> INTO to be directly involved in the Quota Review Committee, an invitation which they, quite understandably, for reasons which I have made clear, rejected.  The Minister was gratuitously insulting to parents and their national representative association, the National Parents Council, in her summary on this point.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with two reviews. What will be the terms of reference of the general review of education in the primary sector?  It did not even merit one completed sentence in her press release of 26 November.  In the first half of the first sentence of that press release she announced that such a review would take place and then used the rest of the circular to announce how she would like the Quota Review Committee to work.</P>
    <P>We must ask some questions immediately.What will be the terms of reference of the general review?  Turning now to the Minister's second review which will be carried out by the Quota Review Committee I would like her to tell us what is the present status of circular 20/87?  Will the review committee she speaks about recommend, for example, the <i>status quo</i> in primary education?  Did she seriously think that she would secure the compliance and the collusion of the INTO in the implementation of circular 20/87? Was that not the true meaning of the invitation she extended to them?</P>
    <P>She extended an invitation to them to participate in the Quota Review Committee though circular 20/87 was still being implemented.  Of course, the INTO saw through the Minister's camouflage and last Friday at their executive meeting in Bundoran decided, as reported in the press the following morning, that their campaign against the implementation of circular 20/87 would continue, that they would participate in a general review of the primary sector but did not want to have anything to do with the Quota Review Committee.  They also decided that they would oppose increases in class sizes.  Equally they felt anger at the denigration of parents by the structure of the <Col N="368" /> Minister's invitation to participate in the Quota Review Committee.</P>
    <P>The Ministers statement of 26 November merits clarification in this House for another reason.  In her statement she stated that in order to give the review committee an adequate opportunity to carry out a thorough examination, no changes under circular 20/87 will take place before the end of the school year, June 1988, but what does this mean?  A teacher at a school in Swords, County Dublin, whose roll number is available for supply to the Minister, received a letter the following morning from the Department of Education.  It was headed &ldquo;Reminder to Chairman of Board of Management and Teachers&rdquo; and stated that they were being informed that the average enrolment of pupils in their school for each of the three quarters for the period ended 30 September 1987 failed to reach the minimum of 570 units required for the continuance of normal recognition to a teacher whose name was supplied and who was the fifteenth assistant in the school.  It went on to place the individual on the panel.  Further inquiries to the Department of Education have confirmed that the Department were implementing circular 20/87.</P>
    <P>Indeed, confusion arises as a result of the nice three card trick the Minister is seeking to play with Circular 20/87 &mdash;&ldquo;now you see it, now you don't,&rdquo; but we know the joker is in the pack.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister will be suppressing posts in education as and from January.  It is equally clear that the Minister has never estimated correctly the number of posts to be suppressed. She began with a figure of 1,300.  Last week her Department confirmed the figure for the number of posts to be suppressed by 1 January as being 1,650 with another 150 to 250 being suppressed by next June and an unestimated figure to be suppressed from June to the end of the year.  She is moving perilously close to the figure of 2,100 which was the figure she rejected as the INTO survey figure and which is the figure she instructed her representatives in the Fianna Fáil Party to reject around the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> As late as this afternoon two schools, the CBS in Tralee and another in Kilbride, County Meath, both of which figured in the press release of Senator O'Toole this evening, who is the campaign organiser for the INTO, were refused permission to go ahead with appointments planned for 1 January.  I ask the Minister to tell the truth, to answer the following questions.  Will the names of the teachers already placed on the panel be withdrawn?  Can they be considered to be withdrawn in the light of her statement, made publicly, that the circular was not to take effect until June 1988?  Will the post already planned and approved for 1 January go ahead despite the implications of the circular?  It would be helpful if she answered either yes or no to these questions.</P>
    <P>The reviews which the Minister has announced are, even within her own statements, quite contradictory.  On the one hand she states that the purpose of the Quota Review Committee is to consider schools with difficulties after the implementation of Circular 20/87 but then she goes to the Parliamentary Party, the great locus of conversion in the Minister's educational thinking, and states that she is now reviewing all schools. Can the Minister tell us whether all 3,300 schools are to parade before her for inspection in order to see whether they qualify under the circular?</P>
    <P>Let me ask her the following questions which she should answer.  How are we to know which schools are being reviewed? Will we have to put down questions in this House to find out what schools are being reviewed?  Should I ask my local Fianna Fáil Deputy which schools are being reviewed by the Minister?  How many schools would qualify for such a review?  Would they qualify under this general half sentence review or would they qualify after the circular which has been implemented but which has not really been implemented, has created notional difficulties?</P>
    <P>Perhaps, all these questions are irrelevant because buried inside a speech made by the Minister outside of the Dáil was the sentence, &ldquo;Sanction for the <Col N="370" /> retention of teaching posts will rest with the Minister&rdquo;.  Obviously, when all the froth is blown away the cases of individual schools may be made the subject of representations to the Minister who will relay the good news back like crumbs from what is left after her destruction of the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Let me ask the Minister another question in relation to the costings and economics which occasionally flit through her speeches.  How free is she, in all her reviews, of the Minister for Finance?  Let us suppose, for example, that her review committee suggested the retention of the <i>status quo</i> in primary education, could she stand in this House and say that that is what would prevail in primary education and that she could put a figure on it?  I pity the Minister in some ways.  In the Estimates for the public services, abridged version, for 1988 reference is made to the figures for education.  One figure is relevant.  The superannuation figure for teachers for 1987 is given as £48,738,000 and the figure for 1988 is given as £54,347,000.  The difference allowing for the implication of Circular 20/87 is £5,609,000.  The Minister never made provision for the implications of Circular 20/87.  She never estimated it or worked out what it would cost.  Given the enormous opprobrium she has drawn on herself, even if it is regarded as the new grit of the Cabinet to ignore opprobrium, because of continual statements and appeals from everybody in primary education, parents, teachers, boards of management, why not withdraw the circular now?  I ask her to withdraw the circular generously and proceed with her general review of primary education, and she will be thanked and will get co-operation. But, of course, we are told the circular stands or does not stand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I announced last week, I confirm that I will shortly be engaged in carrying out a major review of the primary school sector of education including the establishment of a primary quota review committee.I have already commenced that review in that I set up a primary school curriculum review committee two months ago and at present they are proceeding with their work.  The terms of reference for the overall review of the primary school curriculum will be issued in due time to all interested parties.  The purpose of my primary quota review committee will be to see how, within the limits of expenditure laid down in the 1988 Book of Estimates the best possible arrangement can be made in the deployment of teachers, the size of classes and the organisation of our primary schools generally.  In particular the committee will concentrate on any difficulties which may arise in certain schools.  This answers the Deputy's question as to whether it will be 3,400 or 1,200.</P>

The maximum size of any class will be 40. Where, because of exceptional circumstances, it is impossible to adhere to <Col N="373" /> this limit the permission of the review committee will be required and the Minister will then study the data.  (3) The effects on schools of population changes will be taken into account.  I think all Deputies will agree with this.  (4) Special consideration will be given to schools in disadvantaged areas.  Surely Deputies agree with that.  (5) Special consideration will be given to the remedial needs of schools.  Surely they agree with that.</P>

The principal teachers will be expected under the general direction of the board of management to reorganise class sizes.  Surely Deputies agree with that.</P>

      <Col N="374" /> Total expenditure on education is estimated at £1,184 million in 1988.  Of this, £420 million relates to primary education.Let me clear up a misconception. It has been widely reported that primary education has received the most severe cut of any sector of education.  That is completely untrue.  The primary section has been cut by 2 per cent, post primary by 4 per cent and third level by 10 per cent.  Total expenditure on education is estimated at £1,184 million in 1988.  Of this £420 million relates to primary education and over 80 per cent of expenditure is on pay and pensions.  I know Deputy Higgins agrees with me on the guidelines laid down by the Government when they reached agreement with the social partners including the teachers, that the teachers were worth their rise and were not to be penalised by having their pay dropped.</P>

      <P>In June 1985 in Milan and in December 1985 in Luxembourg the Heads of State and of Government stressed the importance of launching a European programme to fight cancer.  On 7 July 1986 a resolution was adopted by the council laying down the outline of a European programme of action against cancer.  This programme involves a total of 74 specific actions in the area of cancer prevention which it is intended to carry out by 1989.  The detailed proposed actions are in the following areas; a campaign against tobacco; improvements in nutrition; protection against carcinogenic agents; systematic screening and early diagnosis, European code against cancer; information and health education in the prevention of cancer; training of health professions; research to improve the prevention screening and detection of cancer; research on cancer therapy and fundamental cancer research.  I participated in a Council of Health Ministers of the EC in May 1987 which agreed <Col N="138" /> upon one aspect of the &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer&rdquo; programme.  This relates to the &ldquo;European Code Against Cancer&rdquo; which will form the basis of information and education activities throughout Europe, in this area, for the duration of the programme.</P>

      <P>The specific level of the non-capital allocation for Ardkeen Regional Hospital, Waterford, is a matter to be determined by the South-Eastern Health Board and I understand that the board has not yet made any decision in this regard.  With regard to the capital allocation for the construction of the new hospital at Ardkeen, the expenditure required for the development in 1988 will depend on several factors which are difficult to quantify and as a result it is not possible to give an exact expenditure figure for 1988 at this stage.  However, the funds will be provided to allow the project to proceed according to the timescale agreed in the contract.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the new pathology laboratory will be both completed and commissioned by the end of 1988 and that by that time construction will be almost at the halfway stage on a number of areas including a three-storey ward block, a delivery suite, the neo-natal department, catering and staff dining, central stores, pharmacy and staff changing.</P>
      <P>Shortening the programme for completion of the hospital is not possible within the terms of the contract already entered into for the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>To date, there have been 27 cases of AIDS in Ireland, of which 13 people have died.</P>
      <P>Figures supplied to the Department from the virus reference laboratory, UCD, indicate that 2,305 persons were tested for the HIV virus during the period 1 May-31 July 1987 and that a total of 1,583 persons were tested during the three months period prior to the launch of the public information programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cases of AIDS are treated in general hospitals by the appropriate consultant depending on the nature of the opportunist infection which the individual may be suffering from.  I am happy that adequate services are available for the treatment of AIDS sufferers in general hospitals.  I am equally happy that other services, such as the HIV antibody testing service, information and medical support services in general are adequate.  My Department keeps in regular contact with the health boards and other relevant <Col N="142" /> organisations to ensure that the adequacy of the services is maintained.</P>
    <P>General practitioners are a primary source of care and counselling for AIDS sufferers and for persons who undergo an HIV blood test.  General practitioners have been integrated successfully into the anti-AIDS campaign through a number of measures.  The Health Education Bureau and the Irish College of General Practitioners are currently running seminars for general practitioners on AIDS. They are being attended by general practitioners from each faculty of the ICGP with the objective of having highly trained GPs who will act as resource persons on AIDS to the GP service in their local areas.  In addition, the Department has circulated to all doctors, including general practitioners, a special, comprehensive, booklet on AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau is currently completing a survey to determine the information status and the needs of the general population, on AIDS.  Future initiatives in the area of general public information would be determined by the findings of the survey.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to project with any accuracy the potential spread of the HIV virus in a given population.  The rate of transmission of the virus is determined by factors such as the specific epidemiology of the virus and the behavioural and cultural characteristics of the population and of groups within the population.</P>
    <P>At present, the results of confirmatory tests carried out by the virus reference laboratory, UCD, showed that 687 persons are HIV positive compared with 524 in November 1986.</P>
    <P>While it is clear that there has been an increase in the level of HIV infection in the community, the newspaper report which attributed certain statements to the official in question, appears to have overstated the rate of spread of the virus in this country, on the basis of the current indications.  The newspaper report in fact took some of the comments of the official out of context and drew inaccurate conclusions regarding the potential number of AIDS cases in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> The results of tests show that 60 per cent approximately of HIV positive persons are intravenous drug abusers. Special measures are required to deal with the problem of AIDS amongst HIV drug abusers and my Department is currently addressing the measures required with the agencies involved in this field.  I propose to allocate a sum of £450,000 from the national lottery funds to assist the development of a programme in this field and to some other initiatives related to drug abuse and AIDS.</P>
    <P>My Department is also considering proposals, in consultation with the Department of Education, for providing AIDS education in secondary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises health education as a major factor of the preventative and promotional nutrition policy in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nutritional Surveillance System was established in 1984 to provide ongoing information about the nutritional status of the population.  It can identify at-risk groups of the population and, amongst other measures, steps can be <Col N="146" /> taken to provide information and education on nutrition appropriate to these groups.</P>
    <P>The Food Advisory Committee in recent years has issued four major reports on diet and nutrition.  These are &ldquo;Report on Fats and Oils in Human Health&rdquo;, &ldquo;Public Health Policy on Diet and Heart Disease&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nutritional Preparation for Pregnancy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guidelines for Preparing Information and Advice to the General Public on Healthy Eating&rdquo;, which has recently been revised by the committee.  The reports form the basis for education in their subject areas.  For instance, the Health Education Bureau has based a number of booklets on diet and health on these reports.  These include &ldquo;Healthy Eating&rdquo;, &ldquo;Your Guide to Better Eating&rdquo;, &ldquo;Health and Sport&rdquo; and &ldquo;Food and Babies&rdquo;.  These booklets will continue to be made available through the new Health Promotion Unit which is being established in my Department and which will have a continuing responsibility for the provision of information on diet and nutrition education at national level.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that all patients at Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals were transferred to Beaumont Hospital on Sunday, 29 November 1987.  All of the services are now in place in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital Board has entered into discussions with my Department and representatives of the hospital consultants on the building of a private facility to include consulting rooms and in-patient beds.  In the interim the board is leasing temporary consulting rooms to the consultants.</P>
      <P>While no nurses' residence has been built at Beaumont, it is intended that student nurses will be accommodated in the existing nurses home at St. Laurence's Hospital for the present.  This arrangement will be monitored by the hospital board and reviewed at a later stage.  The whole question of nurses' residences is being examined by An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Beaumont Hospital Board that consultations have taken place with Dublin Bus and Irish Rail to ensure adequate arrangements to have the hospital served by public transport.The Eastern Health Board who administer the Accident and Emergency arrangements has nominated Beaumont Road as the main ambulance access route.</P>

The condition is rare and, therefore, would not justify the provision of a special facility.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.  Every dentist is qualified to <Col N="150" /> and provides a certain degree of orthodontic treatment but the more complicated cases require the services of specialists in the field.  Six posts of consultant orthodontist have been approved for the health board service but only one such post has been filled to date.  Every effort is being made to recruit suitable persons to fill the vacant posts.  The post that has been filled is the one for the Mid-Western Health Board.  Special arrangements have been made between the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Dental Hospital to treat eligible children in the Eastern Health Board area by or under the guidance of the consultant orthodontists on the hospital staff.  A certain amount of orthodontic treatment of eligible patients is also carried out by orthodontists on the staff of the Cork dental school.  In addition the health boards avail of the services of orthodontists in private practice to provide treatment for eligible persons.  In all health boards, priority in the provision of orthodontic care is granted to children with a handicapping condition such as cleft palate.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be given.</P>
      <P>The number of companies on tax records in the tax year ended 5 April 1987 was 59,000.  Of these, 44,000 were assessed to corporation tax in that year and the remaining 15,000 were not assessed after an examination of their cases showed that taxable profits were unlikely to arise in respect of accounting periods ending in the year.  At 31 October 1987 the number of companies with balances of tax on the Revenue record in respect of assessments raised in the year ended 5 April 1987 was 30,000.  It is estimated that the number of companies from which amounts of tax, or further amounts of tax, will be collected for the year in question is of the order of 9,000.  This number consists mainly of companies which have already made substantial payments on account and which will pay the balances when their final liability is determined, together with companies which have yet to make any payments.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from 1 January 1988 customs declarations on the new Single Administrative Document will, save in special cases (e.g. personal imports), be required to be typewritten, as the design of the new form is not considered suitable for completion by hand.  In addition, completion by hand, which is allowed at present, has not proved satisfactory in ensuring an adequate standard of legibility.Furthermore, typewritten completion is considered to be a reasonable <Col N="161" /> requirement in view of the fact that customs declarations are usually made out by professional, fee-charging agents or by the exporting or importing firms concerned.I am also informed that while approximately half of the member states of the European Community intend allowing hand-written completion for certain categories of declaration (e.g. export declarations) the remaining member states will normally require typewritten completion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 25 November, a decision has not yet been taken as to when the next Garda recruitment competition will be held, but as soon as a date has been decided details will be announced in the newspapers. The competition will be open to both men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that about 20 candidates remaining from the last competition will be medically examined shortly and that, if they meet <Col N="165" /> the entry requirements, the question of their appointment to the force early in 1988 will be further considered.</P>

      <P>Any premises in which a baking or confectionery business is carried on is required by the local health board to be registered under the Food Hygiene Regulations and to maintain adequate standards of hygiene.  The use of an unhygienic or unregistered premises would be in contravention of these regulations and should be reported to the local health authority or to the Minister for Health.  The non-payment of VAT would be a matter for investigation by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the serious unemployment situation in Cork city and county.  I have been assured by the Industrial Development Authority, which has national responsibility for the implementation of industrial development policies, that they are actively promoting the Cork region for the development of new industry.</P>
      <P>In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that a new project, Island Pharmaceuticals, is being established at Carrigtwohill for the manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals and that Millipore Ireland Ltd also plan to start production of pharmaceuticals at Carrigtwohill early in 1988.  Furthermore, negotiations by the IDA on a number of further significant investments in the Cork area are at an advanced stage. For example I also recently announced details of a major clothing plant which is to be located in Ballincollig.  The project is expected to result in 650 jobs when the plant is in full production.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the fact that insurance companies will not insure local authority flats in the Cork area; if he intends to raise this matter with the companies involved; and if he intends to take any measures to ensure that companies operating this type of practice will be dealt with as appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that companies meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  No obligation can be placed by me on an insurer to quote in respect of any risk if that insurer is not prepared to do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised this question on a number of occasions in the past and the matter was taken up with the insurers' representative body.  Insurers maintain that there is no general policy of refusing cover on flats although flats do present extra risks for them.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy provides details of specific cases where the cover was refused I will arrange to have them taken up with the insurers concerned.  I must emphasise, however, that I cannot compel insurers to take on risks that they do not want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the serious disadvantages that the south-west region has as a result of Government policy which gives special status to the mid-west and to the Dublin area, as a result of the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Corporation and also because of the proposals for the Custom House Docks site in Dublin; if he proposes to take the necessary steps to ensure that all areas in the State operate <Col N="181" /> on an equal basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion by the Deputy that Government policy has in any way placed the south west region at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other areas of the country.  It is the aim of Government policy to promote the economic development of all parts of the country equally with each area being developed on the basis of its particular needs and potential.</P>
      <P>The decision to extend the remit of SFADCo in the mid-west region reflected the particular need to streamline and rationalise the structure of State organisations involved in the promotion of industry and tourism in that area.  Similarly, the promotion of international financial services at the Custom House Docks site is based on the particular potential of the site for promoting such activities.</P>
      <P>The proposed establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy is a further reflection of the Government's belief in the contribution which local areas can make towards national recovery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statistical table showing imports and exports between Ireland and the USSR for 1984, 1985 and <Col N="182" /> 1986 and for January-August 1987 in both cash and volume terms.  Also included is a breakdown of imports and exports by product category in cash terms for the latest full year for which figures are available &mdash; i.e., 1986.  It has not been possible, in the time available, to abstract corresponding volume details for 1986. The Deputy may wish to contact the Central Statistics Office for this information.</P>
      <P>While the overall level of Irish-Soviet trade has been relatively static over the past few years there have been wide fluctuations between imports and exports due mainly to intermittent large Soviet purchases of food commodities.  The pattern of Irish imports from the Soviet Union is also erratic where petroleum products and wood are predominant.</P>
      <P>The general economic conditions in the Soviet Union have meant that it has been an extremely difficult market for Irish exporters in the recent past.  All indications are that 1988 will be at least as difficult a year for exporters as this year. Irish firms can find it difficult to develop and sustain business on the Soviet market where availability of hard currency is a significant determinant on the level and range of imports.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, considerable resources at official and CTT level are being and will continue to be brought to bear on this market.  The main export drive is carried out within the framework of the Ireland-USSR Joint Commission and the Working Groups on the Agriindustry and Machinery and Equipment. These are the officially designated bodies which meet annually to review and plan for future expansion in economic cooperation between the two countries.  In addition, CTT through its office in Moscow, will work with a number of companies already exporting to the USSR to help ensure contracts are renewed in the earlier half of 1988.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the extent of this country's exports to the United States in terms of cash and volume; the extent of this country's imports from the United States in similar detail; the plans, if any, he has to expand our trade with the United States; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statistical table showing imports and exports between Ireland and the United States for 1984, 1985 and 1986 and for January-August 1987 in both cash and volume terms.  Also included is a breakdown of imports and exports by product category in cash terms for the latest full year for which figures are available i.e., 1986.  It has not been possible, in the time available, to abstract corresponding volume details for 1986. The Deputy may wish to contact the Central Statistics Office for this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, the USA was our fourth largest export market, after the UK, West Germany and France.  The decline in the value of the dollar has meant that exporters' margins are tight and against this background the main thrust of Córas Tráchtála's programme in the United States for next year will be to maintain exports at their present levels.  In addition, opportunities for increased exports exist in the food and drink areas and the engineering, electronics and chemical sectors.  This year CTT will have provided their full range of support services to up to 1,000 firms exporting to the US market through head office, through offices in New York and Chicago <Col N="185" /> and regional correspondents in Boston, Atlanta and San Francisco.  In 1988, CTT <Col N="186" /> support for exports to the US will reflect the importance of this market.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the extent of this country's exports to Great Britain in terms of cash and volume; the extent of this country's imports from Great Britain in similar detail; the plans, if any, he has to expand our trade with Great Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statistical table showing imports and exports between Ireland and the United Kingdom for 1984, 1985 and 1986 and for January-August 1987 in both cash and volume terms.  Also included is a breakdown of imports and exports by product category in cash terms for the latest full year for which figures are available &mdash; i.e., 1986. It has not been possible, in the time available, to abstract corresponding volume details for 1986.  The Deputy may wish to contact the Central Statistics Office for this information.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom remains our largest export market.  This market, along with Germany which is our second biggest export market, offers the best opportunity for export expansion in 1988.  I am advised by CTT that last year, for the first time in several years, Irish exports share of overall UK imports showed an increase and CTT are confident this trend will be maintained in 1987 and that 1988 will show further improvement.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála maintains a strong presence on the British mainland through five regional offices.  The CTT programme of events in 1987 reflected the importance of this market.  This programme included seminars and workshops for exporters and potential exporters in Ireland, executive market research which is made available to exporters, group visits overseas by exporters, participation in trade fairs and exhibitions and bringing UK buyers to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The main sectors where prospects exist for increased exports in the UK market are those where we are already strong, i.e., electronics, engineering, food, clothing, textiles and consumer goods. While not yet finalised, CTT's programme for this market for 1988 will reflect the importance of this market for Irish exporters.</P>

    <P>(c) No Government subventions are paid to fund the operations of these commercial State bodies, with the exception of INPC.  In 1984, INPC received a grant-in-aid of £10 million this being a once-off payment to purchase and refurbish the Whitegate refinery.  In 1986, £450,000 was paid to the INPC by way of grant-in-aid in respect of care and maintenance at the Whiddy Island oil terminal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the plans his Department have to retail a major quantity of Christmas trees from State forests when his Department have already, on 4 November, held an auction of Christmas trees for the trade at which much higher than normal wholesale prices were paid because of the limited amount of trees offered, which practice can only be described as sharp, and will lead in some cases to artificially high prices for trees and will lead to the bankruptcy of some wholesalers.</P>

      <P>Almost 100,000 Christmas trees, twothirds of the Department's overall supply of 150,000 trees, were offered by auction on 4 November, 1987 for this year's wholesale Christmas tree market.  The balance of 50,000 trees was retained to meet traditional local wholesale and retail demands throughout the country.  This year's auction replaced sales by tender and direct allocation in previous years whereby only 50,000 trees, roughly one third of the Department's supply, were sold direct to the trade.</P>
      <P>Seventy-five thousand trees (approximately) were sold at the auction leaving 25,000 trees unsold.  These unsold trees together with the 50,000 trees retained for local forest sales will be sold on a wholesale and retail basis at the Department's 250 forest centres throughout the country.  Christmas trees are normally sold at forests from Monday to Friday. Members of the public will be given the opportunity to buy trees direct from the Department at weekends at a limited number of forest centres as follows: Saggart, County Dublin; Comeragh, County Waterford; Clonmel, County Tipperary; Cratloe, County Clare; Adare, County Limerick; Donadea, County Kildare; Kingscourt, County Cavan; Lough Gill, County Sligo.  In addition trees will be sold from centres in Galway city and Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>

Where planning authorities exercise that power, such buildings or interiors are listed in their development plans and the effect is that planning permission is required to carry out any development including alterations.  The development control requirements in relation to listed buildings or interiors, in private ownership are not changed by the sale of the properties.</P>

      <P>Under Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act, 1981, the onus of responsibility to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on premises to which the public have access and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises if fire occurs is placed on the person in control of such premises and a regulation is not required in the matter.</P>
      <P>A draft of the part of a code of practice dealing with the management aspects of fire safety in places of assembly was submitted by my Department by the Fire Services Council in June last.  This draft is under consideration at present.  I hope to be in a position to make the regulations under section 37 of the Fire Services Act and issue the code of practice in a matter of months.</P>
      <P>The Fire Services Council are not defunct, as stated by the Deputy and provide an effective service in appropriate areas.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were authorised in mid-October to offer the terms of the Government's voluntary redundancyearly retirement scheme to all grades of staff except key staff or those required to maintain essential services including the fire service.  The question of deciding <Col N="225" /> upon applications by the staff to whom the terms are offered is a matter for each local authority with due regard, of course, to whether particular applications can be accepted without adversely affecting the efficient operation of essential services.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the rule are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  To ensure that young people particularly below leaving certificate level should not be enticed out of the educational system and provided with places which could be taken up by people who are genuinely unemployed and seeking training.</P>
      <P>(2)  To allow leavers reasonable opportunity to obtain employment.</P>

      </P>
      <P>In early 1987 the following modifications were made to the rule in certain cases for a year's trial period to be reviewed at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>(1)  Applicants in the Social Guarantee category i.e. early unqualified school leavers need be only four months out of full-time education.  Leavers who are less than four months out of school will be considered only if sufficient longer-term unemployed are not available.  In no case should those less than six months out of school exceed 25 per cent of the total participants on any course.</P>
      <P>(2)  For other programmes, leavers who are less than six months out of school will be considered only if sufficient longer-term unemployed are not available.  In no case should those less than six months out of school exceed 15 per cent of the total participants on any course.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a third level qualification is an essential requirement for a particular course the six months rule need not apply but preference will be given to leavers who are at least six months out of education.</P>

      <P>There has been no decrease in the provision of influenza vaccination.  The situation inherent in the Deputy's question has arisen because of an unprecedented increase in the demand for flu vaccine. This increase is not due to any increase in the prevalence of influenza this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Vaccination is not recommended by the Department of Health for the attempted control of the general spread of influenza but to give individual protection to the groups most at risk.  Each year a circular issues from the Department setting out these groups and indicating the vaccines to be used, based on WHO recommendations.</P>
    <P>The target groups are adults and children with chronic disorders of the cardiovascular or pulmonary systems and residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.  Persons who are 65 years of age or older are considered to be a moderate risk and the decision to vaccinate such a person is a matter for the family doctor.  The vaccine is supplied free of charge to all those for whom it is recommended.</P>
    <P>Each year the health boards order influenza vaccines from the major suppliers to meet the projected demand as determined by the uptake of the vaccination in the previous year.  This year, largely as a result of media attention on the subject of 'flu there has been a 50 per cent increase in the demand for influenza vaccination in certain areas.  For instance, approximately 10,500 doses of vaccine were provided by the Eastern Health Board for the Dublin area in 1986 and demand in this area has not exceeded 11,000 doses in recent years.  However, the Eastern Health Board has supplied over 15,000 doses this year to date and the normal stocks of the vaccine have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>The Department is keeping in touch with the health boards about the situation with a view to ensuring that the Department's policy on influenza vaccination as notified to the health boards is implemented.  Specific problems such as those mentioned by the Deputy would be examined in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy to encourage doctors to prescribe, and pharmacists to dispense, generic products where appropriate.</P>
      <P>A statutory authorisation system was introduced by the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations 1984 under which all original proprietary medical preparations (and all non-proprietary generic medical preparations placed on the market after 1 October 1984) require product authorisations issued by the Minister for Health, acting on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB).</P>
      <P>In the case of generic products on the market prior to 1 October, 1984, it was decided that these should be reviewed by the NDAB before April 1989 as set out in the Second Schedule to the 1984 Regulations.</P>
      <P>This review was structured to ensure that products with the greatest therapeutic benefit would be reviewed initially.  The review is continuing and is due to be completed in April 1989.</P>
      <P>All medical preparations, except those in categories specifically so exempted by the 1984 Regulations, must now hold a product authorisation.  Remaining exempted products must obtain a product authorisation by April 1988, September 1988 or April 1989, according to therapeutic category as defined in the second schedule to the 1984 Regulations.</P>
      <P>Since 1975, all drugs manufactured within the EC require a licence to manufacture, which includes testing in the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Where medicinal products are manufactured outside the EC a manufacturers licence, under the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1974, is required for the importation of such products into this country.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no evidence to suggest that any generic product on the Irish market is unsafe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has written to all the <Col N="235" /> companies known to be marketing medical preparations in categories (a), (b) and (c) requesting that they withdraw all products from the market which do not have product authorisations, are not the subject of applications for product authorisations or the subject of application for review or renewal of product authorisations.</P>

    <P>Notes &mdash; Enrolment figures are for the quarter ended 30 September, 1987.  Figures for enrolment and teachers do not include pupils and teachers in special classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to (c) and (d) there is no provision for the employment of part time teachers in the national school system.  The position with regard to nonteaching principals is that this arrangement only applies in schools with at least eight ordinary assistants on the staff.  Of the schools listed in the Table, those at Nos. 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15 and 17 fall into this category.  There is no arrangement whereby vice-principals of national schools may be released from full time teaching duties.</P>
    <P>The position of national schools where staffing may be affected under the new schedule of averages will not be determined until the school returns of averages for the quarter ended 31 December, 1987 are available in January 1988.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, therefore, to say at present what the staffing of these schools will be on 30 January 1988.  My Department will communicate with the school authorities in due course.</P>

      <P>Two of the schools referred to are national schools, and the following is the position.  The individual referred to as the contractor acted in these cases as a sub-contractor to the main contractor and, as such, would have no direct contractual relationship with my Department.The work is being grant-aided and payments fall to be made by the school authorities to the main contractor.  The Department's role is to assess and act on applications by the school authorities for grant payments at the agreed levels towards the cost of work carried out.  I understand that in the case of one of the schools the grant has been fully paid and in the other the architect acting for the school authorities has yet to issue the certificate on the basis of which the grant would be paid.</P>
      <P>One of the schools in question is a secondary school and, as such, the school authority is the client body for contract purposes and is, therefore, responsible for all payments.  In these circumstances the question of money being due to contractors by my Department does not arise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of remedial teachers appointed to each district in 1986 and 1987; the reason no remedial teacher was appointed in the district Louth, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan in 1987; the reason the recommendation to appoint a remedial teacher for the Bellurgan area, County Louth, with 500 pupils, was not implemented; when this will be done; <Col N="244" /> and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Thirty additional remedial teaching posts were sanctioned for the entire country in both the 1985-1986 and 1986-1987 school years.</P>
      <P>Available remedial teaching posts are allocated in accordance with the priority of educational need of the application. On the basis of this criterion, neither Bellurgan National School nor any school in Counties Louth, Leitrim, Cavan or Monaghan was considered high enough in priority to warrant the appointment of a remedial teacher in 1987.  The application referred to by the Deputy will be reconsidered in the light of the availability of such posts in the future.</P>
      <P>I should add that over 1,000 schools nationwide have or share the services of remedial teachers including over 70 schools in the poor counties in question. Close to 7 per cent of the national school population is enrolled in these counties.</P>

      <P>In seeking to cater for individual pupils such as the child in question here, my Department investigates the possibility of extending existing transport routes to facilitate the child.  However, in this case, a total daily extension of 60 miles would be required and this was not a feasible proposition.  Also, the cost involved would be outside the financial limits for individual cases within which my Department must operate.  Boarding facilities with week-end travel are available but these facilities are not acceptable to the parents.  The child's parent has been offered a grant of up to £600 to be paid at the end of the current school year to assist in the cost of providing private transport for him.</P>

      <P>The decision to charge a fee <Col N="248" /> of £200 (£100 course fee and £100 examination fee) was taken in the context of the very difficult financial circumstances facing the country at present.  In view of the financial pressures at various levels of the education system, it was considered not unreasonable that those who had already benefited by the normal course of post-primary schooling, and who wished to take an extra year, should be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources. Pupils whose parents or guardians are medical card holders are exempted from payment of the £100 course fee and are required to pay only the standard examination fee of £33.</P>
