      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 4.  It is also proposed that Dáil Éireann at its rising for the summer recess, do adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 14 October 1987.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann at its rising on 26th June, 1987, do adjourn for the Summer Recess. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government considered bringing back the Dáil sooner than the day the Taoiseach has mentioned? Could he outline to us the reasons why the Adjournment of the House is going to be so long, given the scale of the problems, economic and other, that we are facing?  Secondly, is the Minister for Energy going to make any announcement on changing the exploration terms on either the oil side or the mineral side?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if the announcement should be made in the House, not outside the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the time of the <Col N="3950" /> Adjournment I would like to point out that the House will resume a week earlier than last year when the Deputy was, partially at least, responsible for these matters. Secondly, I am quite satisfied that what the Government propose in this respect is the right way to do our business. My intention is that from now on the Government will get down to detailed, thorough work on the finances in particular and on economic development generally and at the same time the legislative process will be carried on in the Seanad.  We are going to put a number of Bills to the Seanad where they can be dealt with in detail and difficulties, anomalies and problems teased out there so that, when we return in October we will have, I hope, a reasonably expeditious passage for this legislation through the Dáil on the basis that the general debate and discussion will have taken place in the Seanad and without, of course, curtailing the debate, the legislation will have a relatively simple passage through this House.  It is urgently necessary that the Government should concentrate in the months ahead on dealing with the departmental Estimates and the economic situation and progressing the very important discussions we are having with the social partners on a medium term economic plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I gave notice to you, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order No. 30, that I intended at the commencement of business today to request leave to move the Adjournment <Col N="3951" /> of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration. The urgent and important matter which I wish to raise is the decision of the milk management committee of the EC to renege on a promise to grant Ireland a derogation from the new regulations relating to the selling of butter into intervention due to come into force on Monday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy has given me such notice.  I regret that I cannot accede to the request as Standing Orders do not provide for the moving of such a motion on a Friday sitting. However, the Deputy can raise this issue in the course of the Adjournment Debate which is now in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am disappointed that I do not have an opportunity to proceed with this motion today. Two matters now arise.  I have a difference of opinion with you, Sir, on the question of the interpretation of the Standing Order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have this looked at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Secondly, perhaps more important, it is altogether ludicrous that when the House is in session such an urgent and serious matter cannot be raised.  If the interpretation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is in line with your own, that such an urgent matter could not be raised on a Friday, I would ask that consideration be given to an amendment of the Standing Order to enable such a serious and urgent matter to be raised on any day on which the Dáil is sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek your guidance, Sir, as to the relative position of this proposal on the Order of Business about Wednesday, 14 October <i>vis-à-vis</i> the three amendments which are down to motion No. 4 and which I and others put down yesterday.  If this proposal on the Order of Business today is carried, does that mean that the three amendments fall to the substantive motion?  Is it not appropriate that that matter be decided on the motion for the Adjournment rather than on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will entertain the amendments although they could be deemed late at this stage.  I should point out that on many occasions in the past when a motion similar to No. 4 was on the Order Paper the proposal for the date of reassembly was included on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Can I put my amendment to the motion on the Order of Business?  I think it is the only one that is in order this morning.  The motion for the Adjournment is a little more complicated than we understand it to be.  I understand the motion will not be put until we are about to vote at 4 p.m. and that rules out amendments during the course of the debate.  I want to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to put down this amendment.  When Deputy Bruton was in charge of Dáil reform we made a submission that the summer recess should be not more than two months.  That was in 1983.  At that stage we got no support from Deputies O'Malley, Molloy, Spring and Desmond.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,998,000 <Col N="3959" /> be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, including certain cultural and archival activities and for payment of certain grants-in-aid. &mdash;(The Taoiseach.) </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to Deputy Birmingham's contribution and the tactics he adopted of attack as the best form of defence.  This was clearly a case of using diversionary tactics to prevent any analysis of his own party's performance over the past four months. I could only conclude that it was a little more of the shadow boxing in which Fine Gael have been indulging over the last week, but he should be aware of the dangers of such activities.</P>
      <P>The lack of any positive content in Deputy Birmingham's contribution was matched, and maybe even surpassed, by the contribution of his senior colleague, Deputy Noonan.  I find it more difficult to listen to Deputy Noonan each time he speaks on economic matters because he tends to be repetitious, especially in his opening remarks.  His comments yesterday were similar to those he made during the budget and Finance Bill debates.  I wonder why he keeps repeating these comments.  The only conclusion I can come to is that he is trying to convince himself of the truth of what he is saying. He probably presumes that if he says something often enough even he will believe it.  He did the same thing yesterday as he did in the Finance Bill debate; he had a bad case of selective amnesia.  He can remember what happened six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years ago but he cannot remember one thing about the last four years when he was a member of the Government.  During the debate on the Finance Bill I reminded him again of his Government's record, and I do not intend to be repetitious, but the record is there for all to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3960" /> His concern for the Fianna Fáil back-benchers was very touching.  He referred to their possible nervousness in facing whatever cuts might have to be made by the Government in the coming year, but as a new Deputy, I can assure him that he need have no concern about me or my commitment to supporting my party's policies.  His concern is completely misplaced. If he is thinking of back-benchers losing their nerve, maybe he is referring to his own back-benchers, or even to people a lot closer to him who attempted to do a little shadow boxing over the last week but failed miserably when their bluff was called and they lost their nerve.</P>
    <P>He spoke at length and with great authority about a lot of codology which has gone on in this House over the last four months.  As a new Deputy I am prepared to accept that he may be an expert in this area, but I think he was trying to exonerate his own party from that codology. I agree that there has been a great amount of codology over the past three or four months, although more than one party indulged in it.  We have the example of the Progressive Democrats who launched themselves about 18 months ago with all sorts of promises about how they would change the face of Irish politics, get away from civil war politics and make the Dáil more relevant.  They have wasted more time over the last two or three weeks than was necessary or right. Then, this morning, they were looking for an extension of time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party indulged in similar tactics.  They also wasted time and Deputies were put out of the House because they failed to respect the Chair. However, one of them was very badly caught out although he maintains he did not mean to have himself thrown out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that some Deputies in the House have no respect for the Chair and will use every opportunity &mdash; as two Labour Deputies did in this session &mdash; to get cheap publicity by getting themselves thrown out of the <Col N="3961" /> House.  I am particularly pleased that one of them was badly caught out this time.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the Finance Bill I referred to the revisionism of the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Noonan, in relation to recent Irish history.  His contribution yesterday was a prime example. He admitted that by the time the previous Government left office the public had lost confidence in them.  In an amazing display of &ldquo;logic&rdquo; he tried to blame Fianna Fáil for this although it was the Coalition Government who increased the national debt by £12 billion in the space of four years.  The Coalition were also responsible for increasing unemployment by 80,000 people but that also was the fault of Fianna Fáil.  The Coalition drove money from the country but they also blamed Fianna Fáil for this.  Thousands of our young people have been driven out of the country and Deputy Noonan even managed to blame Fianna Fáil for it.</P>
      <P>Ministers of the previous Government fuelled speculation about our economic survival and said that the international monetary fund would have to intervene. When the new Government were formed they were still talking in that vein and articles appeared in many foreign newspapers; they seemed to have a source here fairly close to the previous Government. According to Deputy Noonan, we are responsible for a lack of confidence, in Government and in Opposition. People have seen through his party and will not accept his arguments or those of his colleagues.  It is time Deputy Noonan shouldered some of the blame for the mistakes of the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past four months have been referred to by previous speakers.  After the general election the then Taoiseach appeared on television and conceded defeat on the night of the count.  He admitted that Fine Gael could not form a Government and promised to support the incoming Government.  On the first day of this Dáil session he attempted to have himself renominated as Taoiseach and failed.  However, he repeated his promise of support and promptly <Col N="3962" /> resigned the following day.  Shortly afterwards, Deputy Dukes became leader of Fine Gael and he also promised support although it was slightly more conditional.</P>
    <P>What does Deputy Dukes mean by his promise to support the Government? Later it seemed that the Fine Gael Leader and the Progressive Democrats spokesman were saying that, provided Fianna Fáil adopted a strategy to reduce borrowing and to control expenditure to get the economy right, they would have the support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  They said that if the Government showed leadership they would not be obstructed by their respective parties.  After four months, everybody will agree that Fianna Fáil are taking charge of the economy.  Some people may not agree with their methods but they are facing up to their responsibilities.  I put it to the other major parties in the House that they have a moral duty to support the Government in view of the commitment they made.  They may, of course, as Opposition parties quibble and quarrel about details and dispute the effectiveness of some of the measures which Fianna Fáil implement, but they must support the Government as long as they are taking charge of the economy and tackling our problems.  We cannot hedge that.  There is a broad consensus of the problems facing this economy.  In general terms there is a broad consensus of what must be done to tackle those problems. When this Government take on that job, as they have done, those parties must support their efforts.  The Opposition cannot expect the right to formulate the details of the policy; they cannot expect that they will be consulted on every single detail and they will not be.  They have committed themselves to broad support for Fianna Fáil in tackling the problems of the economy.</P>
    <P>I have listened over the past four months to lectures from Opposition members here about Fianna Fáil's irresponsibility when in opposition.  It is alleged that they opposed for opposition's sake, that they called for <Col N="3963" /> increased expenditure, that they embarassed the Government at every opportunity; that may be true.  The Opposition parties now claim that what Fianna Fáil did was wrong.  Perhaps they will give good example over the next ten years or whatever in opposition and that they will live up to the commitment they have made to us, particularly in these next four years when the economic problems we face must be tackled.  If they are sincere about the good of the country and where it is going perhaps they would go a step further and give a commitment not to vote against any of the budgetary or economic measures this Government will put in place over the next four years.  It will take at least three to four years to put things in place and get the country on the right road.  I know I am a new Deputy but I am not so naive as to believe that such a commitment will be forthcoming. I can see already &mdash; and again we had the recent example of it &mdash; that Fine Gael are waiting to get out of the straitjacket into which they put themselves.  They almost did it last Wednesday but they know now they cannot at this time, unless they want to lose whatever face they have left.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to turn to an area which has received probably more attention than any other in the past four months and that is the whole area of health and health expenditure.  The first thing to be said about expenditure on health care is that it has become a very emotive subject.  That makes it very difficult to have a logical debate on it.  Perhaps this is the best time for a debate, when we have removed the issue from the party political arena.  It is important for future policy development in health care that we have a logical debate which analyses the facts of the situation, because this is happening not alone in Ireland but in most developed western democracies where health services have resulted in expensive large scale institutional and hospital provision.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are not and should not be political, despite all the rantings and ravings of recent weeks and days and <Col N="3964" /> the frankly nakedly political manipulation of mostly well motivated concern within the health service.  The important point to be made is that no matter how much fuel is added to this emotive fire, no matter how much political posturing is done, no matter how vociferous the clamour of vested interests, there can be no escape from the fact that there is a fundamental institutional and structural problem to be faced in the area of health care.  The problem will not go away because we throw increasing amounts of emotive arguments and ideologies at it; it is more fundamental than that.  The policy of giving open cheques to health boards has proved that the problem cannot be solved by throwing more money at it.  It should be patently clear that the strategies based on wholesale disruption will not make it go away, rather the reverse is true.  It is certainly more fundamental than that.  Our society as a whole need to face this problem in a constructive and organised way.  The issues and problems are not unique to us, even though they may be more endemic in our case because of the policies we have chosen to pursue in the past.</P>
    <P>The writing has been on the wall for some time now in terms of the nature and dimension of our problem.  It has been carefully and analytically addressed by, among others, Dale Tussing's ESRI report &mdash;<i>Irish Medical Care Resources: An Economic Analysis</i>, which was published in 1985 and also by the NESC report &mdash;<i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>, which was published in November 1986 and by the Department of Health's document &mdash;<i>Health.  The Wider Dimensions (a Consultative Statement on Health Policy)</i>, published as recently as December 1986.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that we as legislators owe it to those whom we represent to dig ourselves out of the quagmire of party political considerations and raise the level of debate to considering the issues raised by these documents.  It is useful to look briefly at the way in which our health services have developed and the expenditure that is involved because it raises <Col N="3965" /> some issues about the funding and structure of health services.  It also raises some questions which have formed the basis of debate on the health services generally and it helps to focus the debate on those considerations behind the requirement to gain a better control of health expenditure, perhaps in a different way and on the basis of a qualitatively better consensus on where we should be going.</P>
    <P>Let us first get some facts on the table and some of these may not be palatable. It has been mentioned before that our expenditure on health care as a percentage of GNP has grown from 4 per cent in 1960 to 5.6 per cent in 1970, to 7.7 per cent in 1975 reaching 8.7 per cent by 1980.  This was a trend that could not continue.  A levelling off and some reduction had to be achieved.  The effect of this on recent budgets has been to reduce the percentage to about 7½ per cent. It is still a huge growth in real terms and we are spending about £1,300 million on health care this year.  Two things need to be said about this pattern of expenditure. First, it represents a rate of growth that far outstrips any underlying rate of growth in the economy.  In effect, we have been providing ourselves with and supporting a health service that we cannot afford and that is away above anything we have earned through real growth.  Secondly, our expenditure on health care is totally out of line, as a percentage of GNP, with other European countries when related to <i>per capita</i> income.  Again, it is an unfortunate fact of life that we are living byond our means.</P>
    <P>For example, the Danes spend about 5.8 per cent of GNP on their public health care system.  The underlying concern for policy makers has to be that despite such massive investment there is grave doubt that any real improvement has been achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health policy document 1986 said it was a matter of concern that, despite the <Col N="3966" /> increase in the level of national resources devoted to health services over the past two decades, the level of health in the population did not show any marked improvement.  A case could be made that we were going in the wrong direction in relation to health expenditure.  Much of the emotive argument that has been going on is clouding the issue, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes maliciously.  I call on all those involved in the health services to come together in a constructive debate about where we are going.  Let us leave the emotive arguments on side issues and the political posturing to one side and let us continue the process that has begun in the budget of getting our health services on the right road.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe that it is just over 100 days since the change of Government because so much has happened in the meantime.  There is no need to remind the House of how things stood before the change of Government.  There was a complete lack of confidence in the Government.  There was an air of depression, of doom and gloom, and everywhere the Government were seen to procrastinate on every major issue.  In the past 100 days a new confidence has been building up.  Interest rates are falling, money is being repatriated and there is some semblance of confidence returning. I say &ldquo;semblance&rdquo; because I am not naive enough to think things can change overnight.  There is a feeling that at least someone is in charge.  There is a belief that the Government are prepared to take decisions and see them through to the end.  That belief is very strong, and it has given confidence to all sectors.  I do not expect an overnight change but a gradual increase in confidence is all important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have introduced many positive measures, the most recent being the approach in relation to the move to establish an international financial services sector and the initiative on the cross-Border trade which has been going on for the past three to four years and losing £200 million to £300 million from this economy.  Nothing was done <Col N="3967" /> until this Government took over.  Export orientation has been promoted by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The most striking feature of this Dáil session has been the conversion of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government to a whole range of policies which they strongly and often bitterly opposed while in Opposition.  The breadth and diversity of these conversions is nothing short of spectacular.  They apply to all the important themes of economic, budgetary and fiscal policy.  The extent of one of them became very clear to me as I sat in this House listening to the Minister for Finance delivering his Financial Statement on 31 March last.  I could clearly see the signs of shock spreading across the faces of Government back-benchers who had been gullible enough over the past four years to believe the constant stream of facile propaganda coming from the Fianna Fáil front bench. I saw the same thing in the faces of Ministers in the present Government who had allowed themselves to be mesmerised during the last election campaign into believing that there was a better way.  Never have I seen such a rapid or complete transfiguration.  There was a conversion also in relation to the SEA. Once the issue had been raised by the Supreme Court decision, last year's evil became this year's good, a good that could be promoted only half heartedly and diffidently and then only after the foot soldiers in cumainn up and down the country had been inoculated against their <Col N="3968" /> will with an antidote to poison which they had been fed towards the end of last year. That conversion was almost too late.  Had it not been for the energy which Fine Gael put into the referendum there was a clear danger that the people might have made a wrong decision.</P>
      <P>We have had a conversion in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, skirted around the issue with many a nod and a bow in the direction of the Constitution, without ever properly getting to grips with it.  Rather than claiming credit for having played a part in initiating the process which led to the agreement as he should have done, and could respectably have done, he chose instead to stand back, lacking the courage to embrace it and lacking the conviction to put his alleged constitutional doubt to the test.  All of that changed when he found himself in Government.  The Taoiseach made a very brief reference to Northern Ireland in his speech yesterday.  I wonder if there is any significance in the fact that the only document to which he referred was the report of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A picture came into my mind of the Taoiseach, then the Leader of the Opposition, speaking to the news media after the final meeting of the New Ireland Forum and I hope that is not a picture I should have to dwell on now, or that we in this House should have to remember in the months to come.  The Taoiseach has been reticent in this House in the past two weeks in dealing with questions raised and issues posed in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I can understand that in some circumstances there might be reason for the Taoiseach to be reserved and a little circumspect in what he might say in this House.  So I will content myself and limit myself to saying just that I hope the Taoiseach will press ahead with full commitment and full energy with the process that has been set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I can assure the Taoiseach that if he does that, if he presses ahead committedly with the process and the procedures set up in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he will have my <Col N="3969" /> complete co-operation and the full support of my party.</P>
    <P>I understand that there may be reason why the Taoiseach would be reticent or circumspect in what he says about that.  I do not intend to go into the issue in depth but I will make it clear that the Fine Gael Party are and will remain totally committed to the achievement and the objectives of that agreement.  We will fully support all action taken to achieve these objectives and we will be extremely worried by any departure from that.  It would be comforting to people to know that all of those conversions to which I have referred were brought about by a sudden access of wisdom but there is more than enough room to doubt even that.  I supect a major part of the reason lies in the simple fact that after four years of Opposition for the sake of opposition and after a general election campaign in which the Fianna Fáil Party contrived to say little more than the banal, that party found themselves totally unprepared for Government.  Without the slightest idea of where they were going they plunged off in a direction which had been carefully and assiduously marked out by the previous Government.  They proceeded on their way slashing all about them cutting flowers and weeds alike, and leaving in their wake only an ugly scar rather than a properly cleared path.</P>
    <P>To the Fianna Fáil eye observing the scene last February the history of economic, budgetary and fiscal policy of the previous six years seemed to appear as one of unprecedented restrictions.  The Fianna Fáil believer last February seemed to think that there was a better way of achieving economic, budgetary and fiscal objectives by means of a very different set of policies &mdash; policies which the non-believer could only regard as inconsistent and contradictory.  Admittedly during the last general election campaign there was the occasional chink of light with tentative references by the Taoiseach first to relative real expenditure and then to real expenditure at 1986 levels.</P>
    <P>What a transformation we have had since then.  The history of the past six <Col N="3970" /> years has, of course, been one of consistent and determined attempts to reduce the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement by restricting both current and capital expenditure, a process interrupted for only a brief spell by a period of alleged boom and bloom which turned to ashes. It is a history also of measures which were opposed vigorously all the way by the Fianna Fáil Party even though they paid lip service to the objectives.  It was clear throughout that period that the fallacious doctrine that the solution to every problem lies in throwing money at it and expecting such remedies to stimulate economic growth thereby financing the cost was still deeply rooted and virulent. Its very virulence is testified to by the fact that it has survived so long &mdash; long after it had become abundantly clear that that doctrine impedes the proper consideration of the underlying realities and serves to increase the problems rather than to resolve them.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Fianna Fáil view back in February this year.  That party looking back over the previous six years saw a picture of high taxation and restrictive expenditure policies and both, of course, were ritually deplored by Fianna Fáil. What was the real picture?  Between 1981 and 1986 tax revenue increased from just over 30 per cent of GNP to 37 per cent. The Fianna Fáil Party of course saw that clearly and deplored it.  What they simply ingnored was had the Fianna Fáil expenditure policies up to the middle of 1981 been continued taxation would have had to increase much more rapidly and to a much higher level.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side Fianna Fáil noted the continuing increase in current expenditure as a proportion of GNP over that period.  Leaving aside interest payments, there was a marked deceleration in the rate of increase of the proportion of GNP from 1983 onward.  This trend and its various effects and manifestations on the economy were also deplored by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>On the capital side expenditure on the public capital programme fell by almost 25 per cent in real terms during that <Col N="3971" /> period.  Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes fell from 8½ per cent of GNP in 1981 to 4½ per cent of GNP in 1986.  The Fianna Fáil Party were not content simply to deplore those trends.  They denounced them in the strongest possible terms and those who were responsible for them were pilloried and described in every possible term of abuse allowed in this House and a few which are not.</P>
    <P>The same Fianna Fáil Party who deplored the growth in the level of taxation, who bemoaned the fact that expenditure had not increased more rapidly in current terms and who became irate when talking about the real reductions in expenditure on the public capital programme, deplored also that the current budget deficit had not been further reduced and that the Exchequer borrowing requirement was still too high.</P>
    <P>What is the rest of the picture over that period?  During that time the national debt grew from £9 billion to £21 billion and interest payments grew from £800 million to £1.8 billion.  There is an even more interesting feature behind all of this.  When interest payments are excluded, the current budget deficit was less than a ½ per cent of GNP in 1981 and in 1986 there was a surplus of over 2½ per cent of GNP on that current account. These figures very dramatically underline the effect of increasing debt on our resources and the problem of pre-emption of resources which we face and will face on an increasing scale unless and until we all take to heart very seriously the lessons which have become obvious in relation to our financial situation since 1977.</P>
    <P>Much of the mythology about economic policy during the past ten years has had the effect of obscuring the reality of that from the view of the electorate.  For all of that period until March this year that mythology was all that was seen by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It now appears the veil has been taken away.  I sincerely hope that that veil stays drawn aside so far as that party are concerned because the matter is one of urgent, immediate and fundamental concern to all the people of <Col N="3972" /> this country.  Fine Gael have always taken that lesson very seriously.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for all other parties.  I sincerely hope that the Government will take the problem seriously and I urge them to do so.</P>
    <P>Even that will not be enough.  It is essential that the other parties and groups in the House take that message to heart also and that those who understand it &mdash; and it is not at all difficult to understand &mdash; will drop the pretence that there is a softer, more palatable option either for all of us or for some restricted groups among our people.  Without that acceptance we are heading for deception, division and disaster and it must surely be the duty of this House to avoid that.</P>
    <P>It must just as surely be the duty of this House to first of all understand and then to make plain to the electorate the scope of the task that lies before us.  There is in existence a clear and comprehensive statement on the major elements of an integrated strategy and on the general policy for the major sectors of the economy, a statement which has the agreement of all the interests represented on the National Economic and Social Council. In their report, <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>, Report No. 83 of November 1986, the NESC set out at Chapter 7 a strategy for economic and social development.  That report makes very sobering reading indeed.  The strategy set out in Chapter 7 and developed in other chapters shows very clearly the qualities that are needed if those of us who are charged with the process of government, and in that I include every Member of this House, are properly to fulfil our responsibilities.  These are, first, a willingness to confront the reality of our problems without retreating behind ideological binoculars that distort our vision of the world; secondly, the commitment and the will to identify the policy priorities for our people without retreating behind the pretence that everything can be done at the one time and, finally, the courage and the tenacity to act in accordance with the realities which face us, in line with the priorities we set, and to maintain a perspective on the totality <Col N="3973" /> of our action which rises above short term discomfort or short term gain.</P>
    <P>It is only if all of us in this House show those qualities that we will succeed in bringing about the cohesion that is required among the people we represent and that will make it possible to achieve our objectives.  If we fail to do this we will have failed the people we represent.  I should like with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to indicate just a few of the thoughts put before us as policy makers in this House by the NESC in that report.  On page 145 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The postponement of corrective measures is not a viable option.  The question arises as to whether there is an inescapable trade-off between employment and fiscal policy objectives, that is, whether progress towards one must inevitably retard progress towards the other.</P>
    <P>In the short-term this might be true. Cutbacks in government expenditure in themselves imply a reduction in domestic demand and, if unaccompanied by other measures, could be expected to reduce employment in the short-term.  However considerations about the medium-term must be set against this, namely the stimulus which would be imparted to output and employment in the internationally trading sectors of the economy because of the impact on interest rates of reduced Government borrowing. </P>
    <P>That, Sir, is in my view something that should be required reading.  Certainly the thought is something we all should bear in mind in economic debates in this House. There is a further piece of what I would call very valuable wisdom on page 146 where the report states:</P>
    <P>It is the level of national output which determines the level of sustainable employment.  It is also the level of national output which determines the level of public expenditure which can be sustained by acceptable levels of taxation and prudent levels of <Col N="3974" /> borrowing.  In large measure, therefore, the existing problems of high unemployment and chronic fiscal imbalance derive from the same source. </P>
    <P>There is a great deal more about the influence of domestic demand, management and so on but I think those two brief passages will show that in that report there is, if not all the solutions we need, certainly a line of thinking which brings out clearly the factors to which we must give attention and indeed the basic realities from which any debate on economic issues in this House must start.</P>
    <P>Power is vested in this House by the people through the Constitution.  With that power goes responsibility and the duties that are imposed by responsibility. It is up to each one of us, both in our manner of seeking election to this House and in the discharge of our functions in this House, to keep that essential link between power and responsibility.  Those who seek to ignore that link do a serious wrong to our community as we have seen from events in recent years.  A very brief history will show that clearly.</P>
    <P>In the summer of 1981 a Fine Gael and Labour Coalition Government came into office.  We immediately brought in corrective measures to prevent the economy running out of control.  These were vigorously opposed by the then Opposition as they were in the subsequent election of 1982.  By that time there was a growing public awareness that something had gone seriously wrong with the way this country is run, but those of us who put this case squarely before the people were derided by the Opposition at the time. The new Fianna Fáil Government elected in February 1982 then began a period of so called boom and bloom but then as now cold reality found its way through the rhetoric.  The then Government found themselves unable, because of their lack of preparation, to bring in a planned approach to expenditure.  They were trying to lead the people having deliberately misled them in an election.  The people of Ireland felt then, as many of <Col N="3975" /> them do now, that they had a Government who had attained office under false pretences.</P>
    <P>When we came back into Government at the end of 1982 we headed straight into the wind.  We spent over four years rooting out waste, rationalising and controlling public expenditure with the kinds of policies that are required in those circumstances. It is difficult to bring the people with you.  It is well nigh impossible if almost half of the members of this House argue that the problem is different and that the difficult action is unnecessary. Despite this we persevered.  Last January we fought an election putting all our cards on the table.  We said then, and we still believe, that a Government could bring the people with them in this crucial endeavour of correcting our finances only if they had a specific mandate to do so. That is why we went before the electorate with all our policies, difficult as they were, clearly specified.</P>
    <P>In the days following the general election it became clear that no single party in this House could form a majority Government.  So on 6 March the Fine Gael Party decided to set out explicitly the guidelines along which the economy should be run and we chose to use our parliamentary strength, representing the votes of almost 500,000 people to bring some order into the public finances.  I repeat our statement at that time:</P>
    <P>It is Fine Gael's objective to use its parliamentary strength in the national interest to achieve a position in the public finances which will create conditions for increased employment and for a lasting cut in the tax burden without adding to debt service costs in future years.</P>
    <P>In so far as the incoming Government introduces a Budget which corresponds with the above objective, Fine Gael will not oppose it or legislative measures required to implement it. </P>
    <P>We did this because we believe that it is not just the Government who have a responsibility.  Each of the 166 Members <Col N="3976" /> of this House has that responsibility and we have consistently stuck to that line.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech in this House yesterday the Taoiseach reminded us of the fact that he had criticised in Opposition the economic policies of the last Government.  I found that a very modest reference, even for a man who is, like the Taoiseach, sometimes given to understatement.  He said:</P>
    <P>We also criticised the one-sided emphasis on the public finances which was not accompanied by any serious effort to promote economic development. </P>
    <P>That I believe is a very facile point and a very dangerous one.  The emphasis on public finance targets is central to the whole economic process.  I must warn the Taoiseach and the Government against the gross error involved in thinking that in some way the promotion of economic development can proceed separately or apart from the proper management of the public finances.  If the Taoiseach wants any other authority for that warning I suggest that he reread the NESC Report to which I have referred, or, if he is very short of time, that he re-read page 146, chapter 7, which I have quoted from.</P>
    <P>There is an absolutely indissoluble link, and we know that the Taoiseach is a man who believes in indissoluble links, between the public finance function particularly in our circumstances and the promotion of economic growth.  I set out my view in relation to overall economic management.  That will be the basis of everything we say and do in this House on economic and public finance matters. Wherever that view is shared in this House, those who hold it will have the agreement and support of my party. Where it is not shared, on whatever side of the House, we will oppose what we believe to be wrong.</P>
    <P>Speaking yesterday on the social services, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the access and opportunity these services provide must have full regard to the needs of <Col N="3977" /> those served.  In particular, the needs and requirements of the disadvantaged economically and socially must have priority... It is clear that there are inequities in the application of and access to these services... By remedying these deficiencies we can contribute to the general acceptance of the adjustments that may be necessary in these and other areas of public expenditure. </P>
    <P>I am sure we can all agree to that.  But I am equally sure that the Taoiseach and the Government will fail to achieve those laudable objectives if they take the line recently taken by the Minister for Health who, because he had stated in reply to a parliamentary question that he had nothing more to say on a particular issue, refused to answer a whole series of legitimate questions about the operation of the services under his care.  Equally, they will fail to achieve that objective if they continue with the nonsense of refusing to deal with detailed questions on the operation of our educational system on the grounds that the matter can be dealt with in the context of the budget debate.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach defined the Government's first policy objective as being:</P>
    <P>To restore the public finances by reducing overall Government expenditure. </P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>With regard to the first objective, the Government in formulating and implementing this year's budget had by force of circumstances to resort to the process of reducing Government expenditure right across the board, coming down more heavily on those areas which accounted for greatest level of expenditure.  There was no alternative to that approach. </P>
    <P>I wonder if in the Taoiseach's mind there is the same connotation to the phrase &ldquo;there is no alternative&rdquo; as the one that is in my mind.  That statement by the Taoiseach yesterday sounds very much <Col N="3978" /> like a plea for understanding from somebody who knows that he has been undiscriminating in his approach.  It is not a plea that I would be prepared to grant. The Taoiseach must know perfectly well that the information required to take a more discriminating and selective approach is available.  It is available after any period of budgetary preparation, and it is most certainly available after all of the budgetary analysis of the past four years.</P>
    <P>At the very least, the Government should have given clear guidelines and policy directions to the health agencies and to agencies in the field of education. To plead, as the Taoiseach seems to have done, that the Government did not have enough time for this kind of analysis is to ignore the constant process of analysis that goes on in Departments, and especially in the Department of Finance. To make this plea is to admit what we all know to be true: that the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition failed to prepare themselves for Government.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned a number of Bills which he proposes to initiate in the Seanad during the summer, so that they will be ready for debate in the Dáil in the autumn session.  One of them, the Adoption Bill, could now be law if the Government had taken the sensible course of taking up the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, and amending it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>From statements made yesterday, apparently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it now appears that one of the Bills the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday will not be ready before Christmas.  But I welcome the Government's intention to bring forward that Bill and other Bills mentioned by the Taoiseach, and I am quite sure they will get fair consideration in this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made no reference to another wide area of family law.  I refer to the establishment of family courts, legal provisions enabling family courts to make various financial orders in the case of judicial separation, legal provisions for family courts to make orders in relation <Col N="3979" /> to the family home in the event of judicial separation and changes in the law in relation to matrimonial property.  I know, and I am sure the Taoiseach knows, that a great deal of preparatory work has already been done in all of those areas and that in relation to matrimonial property in particular it would be a matter of very little extra work to have a Bill prepared, published and debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Those are all areas where the debate on the divorce referendum showed there is a very wide consensus in favour of change and, indeed, a wide consensus as to the nature of the changes required. I call on the Fianna Fáil Party now in Government to live up to the commitments they made during the course of that debate.  As far as the main question was concerned Fianna Fáil claimed they sat on the fence but in relation to these other areas they gave very clear and specific commitments.  I know the Minister for Social Welfare, now sitting here, will remember those commitments he gave both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>The announcement last Wednesday by the Minister for Justice that he is having a certain number of these areas examined is, to say the least, unsatisfactory.  I urge on him the view that it is time he put a little more energy into the examination. The Minister for Justice also announced that he would bring forward proposals to amend the law concerning the grounds for judicial separation.  I welcome that intention and await the proposals with interest, but I hope we do not have to wait very much longer.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech yesterday the Taoiseach announced the abolition of the Irish Film Board.  In my view that is a blow to the steady progress being made in recent years towards the establishment of an indigenous Irish film industry.  Since the establishment of the Irish Film Board in 1981, with a very limited budget, eight feature length Irish films have been made and two more are currently in production. That marks a very stark contrast with the previous situation, where only one Irish feature film was made from <Col N="3980" /> the foundation of the State up to the establishment of the board &mdash; and that film was made in 1936.</P>
    <P>The most important role of the board was to provide the development money for research and scripting.  Without this development money the very welcome incentives to corporate investors in the business provided for in the recent Finance Bill are likely to be stillborn.  The reality of film production in Ireland is that these kinds of incentives are, to a large extent, useless without development money.  Over the past six years investment by the board has attracted other funding on a four to one basis from the private sector, from broadcasting organisations here and in other countries and, more recently, from a United States cinema company which is now in the seventh week of film production in Connemara. It is a retrograde step to interrupt that process in the way which has been done by the Taoiseach just when we are beginning to make our mark internationally. Of course, we must all accept that there is a difficulty in the Exchequer and I am quite sure that, were the positions reversed, the Taoiseach would be making the same points.  Perhaps he would be invoking even more names on this side, but I do not believe in that kind of rhetoric.  At least I can say now, following the foresight of the last Government, that the activities of the Irish Film Board would have been very proper for funding by moneys for the arts from the national lottery.  I do not see that there was any need to take the step that the Taoiseach has taken.  It is a matter of considerable disappointment to me, to my colleagues in this party and to a great many people in the arts to find that the Government are now rowing back on the provision envisaged for the arts from the proceeds of the national lottery right from the beginning.  We regarded that as a major new source not of huge amounts of money but of useful amounts of funding for projects that will continue the kind of development, the rebirth of life that we have seen in so many areas of the arts in recent years.  I urge the Government to reconsider the steps they have <Col N="3981" /> taken in relation to the distribution of funds from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion recently, even this morning, about the length of the summer recess of this House.  A number of Deputies in the House are anxious to see it reconvened very early in September.  To me it seems disingenuous and highly misleading on the part of such Deputies to suggest that the recess is all holiday.  The summer recess has always been a time when certainly the major parties take stock of their situation and have an opportunity to work on policy development.  For individual Deputies it is also a time when they can prepare their own plans in relation to projects or topics in which they have an interest and it is a time for contact and discussions with groups which could not be fitted in during the business of a Dáil session.  It is a time when certain kinds of constituency work can be carried out with the attention that they deserve.</P>
    <P>I know that there are different views about constituency work even among Members of this House.  I remember one Deputy in the PD Party who, being interviewed by a very skilled gentleman on RTE just after the election, almost went as far as to say that he would do no work at all in his constituency, but stopped short at the last moment before he tripped over the obstacle.  He seemed to have had a change of heart since because I am reliably informed by my colleagues in that constituency that he does a fairly respectable business at constituency work.  I wonder if he had much of an input into the statements that were made up to and including this morning.</P>

      <P>Yorick got skint, and that is what is going to happen to the Deputy. For my own part I have a fairly full diary for both July and September both as leader of my party and as a Deputy, so that in this House I would call for a more realistic and less sanctimonious approach to this matter.  For this reason earlier this week I suggested that the Dáil should resume in September, having in mind the latter part of the month.  I urge the Taoiseach strongly to have consultations with the leaders of the other parties in this House to reach agreement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the referendum about the Single European Act one of the questions which arose most frequently was whether the provisions of the Single European Act in relation to European political co-operation would affect Irish neutrality.  The proponents of ratification argued, correctly, that the issue did not arise and that the matter of neutrality was, is and will continue to be one for Ireland to decide for itself, and fortunately that view prevailed and we got the agreement of the people to proceed with the ratification of the Single European Act.  However, the debate showed a number of things very clearly. It showed that there is not a single, universally held definition of what neutrality is.  Next, there is no clear, common idea as to why we are neutral nor is there any commonly held concept of what we want to do with our neutrality.  Therefore, we need to examine it to clarify what we mean by it, to decide why we want to be neutral and to lay out a plan for achieving <Col N="3983" /> the objective that we set.  Deputy O'Malley last evening made some comments in this connection which seemed to indicate at least a certain openness of mind.  I welcome that, although I am not at all sure that I would agree with what seems to be the general drift of his remarks. However, there is a commonly held view that we are not politically neutral.  Ireland is one of the Western family of Nations, strongly attached to parliamentary democracy with a real and free choice for voters as between parties.  We reject systems of totalitarian autocracy and we prefer not to see such systems spreading through the world.  We reject the use of arms to spread any doctrine or form of government.  Our Constitution in Article 29.2 states our adherence and our attachment to the peaceful solution of international disputes, but in common with every other country in the world, we live under a nuclear threat.  In common with most other countries in the world, we would like to see this threat removed or, if it cannot be removed in the short term, reduced in stages and at the most rapid possible pace.</P>
    <P>As a member of the UNO, Ireland has been involved in discussions on nuclear disarmament.  We have been involved in discussions in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  It is right that the Irish Government be involved in talks about disarmament since they have a clear obligation, like any other Government, to seek and secure the best interests of their people.  Our involvement in talks on disarmament has not brought us into the military arena.  We have not been involved in the strategy or tactics of deployment.  We have made no input into the strategy or tactics underlying the choices of delivery systems or warhead types, but we must look at what is going on in the world around us.  Currently the US and the Soviet Union are discussing zero options.  They are discussing matters which will have an important implication not only for the Atlantic Alliance and the USSR but for the rest of the world.  They are talking about the future level of the <Col N="3984" /> nuclear threat to us, and we hope that they will talk meaningfully and purposefully about reducing it.</P>
    <P>We have a real interest in all of that and I believe that we have an obligation to make our interest known.  Surely it will be in the interests of our people and those of our neighbours that we seek directly to encourage both of the main proponents to proceed rapidly on designing an agreement on nuclear disarmament but since the foundation of this State we have stayed away from involvement in any military alliance.  We have no military ambitions, nor have we any military axe to grind.  However, we have a perfectly legitimate concern with all safety and security and with the safety and security of the Continent of which we are a part. Since we are neutral and not aligned to any military grouping, we could have a particular part to play in the policing of any reduction arrangements that might be agreed.  Monitoring and inspection will have to be part of any workable agreement, and to be effective those procedures would need an input from people who are not involved directly on either side of the main argument.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity for us to make a creative and constructive use of our neutrality and to make it a force for increasing the safety and security of our own people and of our neighbours.  I hope that during the course of the autumn session &mdash; we should not wait any longer than that &mdash; we will find a means in this House of discussing specifically what this House believes should be our role in that process on behalf of our people and of our neighbours.  It is a matter that could be discussed in the context of a committee on foreign affairs which I hope will be set up during the autumn when this House resumes.  It is an area in which perhaps this House has been a wee bit lax for many years in the past, but one to which our obligation to those who have elected us should lead us to give our very close consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to repeat the main thrust of my earlier remarks about the task which faces us in relation to the <Col N="3985" /> economy.  There is no doubt that the situation in which we find ourselves is an extremely difficult one and it will require the energy and the imagination of all those involved in the process of Government to find our way through it.  There is a particular obligation on the people in this House to throw away the old mythologies we have about economic policy, to throw away the old saws by which many of us have lived and argued in the past and to look at the reality.  It is a difficult thing to do but if this House does not do it, it will never be done.  I commit my party to looking at those realities, to examining them and to participating in the process of identifying priorities for our people.  Whatever path we may choose to set out on, we have to accept and realise at the beginning that there is a series of steps and they must be in order.  We must, in this House, get rid of the pretension that everything can be done at the same time and then we can really fulfil the obligation we were elected to this House to carry out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leader of the main Opposition party said, this is the end of the first legislative session of this minority Fianna Fáil Government.  In little more than three months we have dramatically changed the course of the nation, restored confidence in our financial control and worthiness and given new hope and encouragement to investors.  There is, throughout the land, a new sense of reality and the Taoiseach and his Government have been quick to build on it and to give it a sense of direction through urgent and well-planned action.  The exhilarating pace and the sheer commitment of the Taoiseach have been an inspiration to his followers and a source of frustration and confusion to his opponents.  The Opposition see snags and they have doubts.  They question our speed of action and they look for ulterior motives where none is to be found.  If you want to find the key to the thinking and the motivation of the Fianna Fáil Government then you must look to the demands of the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3986" /> It is the national interest above all else which motivates us in the difficult decisions and urgent actions which we are now taking.  We will not be deflected from our commitment.  The way is now clearer than ever before.  We will vigorously pursue the policies which can bring employment, hope and new prosperity to our people.  Having achieved so much in such a short time, think of what we as a nation can achieve if Fianna Fáil continue to lead the country back to recovery.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have often been regarded as a pragmatic party.  We do what we believe to be necessary in the best interests of the people of Ireland at a particular time.  This is what we are now doing midway through 1987.  The Leader of the main Opposition party seems to forget that in 1982 Fianna Fáil brought the economy and the national finances under control.  The present Minister for Finance, who was Minister for Finance then, Deputy Ray MacSharry, brought the financial situation under control in 1982.  It was the Coalition who let that control slip, leading to a runaway debt build-up and widespread loss of confidence. That is the reality of the past four years.  At the end of 1982, irrespective of what happened in 1981 and in previous years, we brought the national financial situation under control.  We were very proud of that fact at the time because it was a difficult task.  Having done that, it was sad to see the way the Coalition let it slip away in the years that followed.</P>
    <P>There is no better example of this than the health services to which the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, referred. In 1982 the health services were brought under control.  At the end of the year the financial targets were met, the budgetary requirements were met and the health expenditure was in line with the budget predictions.  In fairness to the Coalition, in 1983 and 1984 they also maintained the position established by Fianna Fáil in 1982 but in 1985 and 1986 they let go. Perhaps they just could not control the position or perhaps the Taoiseach could not control his then Minister for Health. There were public manifestations of the reality that neither the Taoiseach nor the <Col N="3987" /> Minister for Finance could control the Minister for Health at the time.  This was a feature of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I know the former Taoiseach had difficulty in that area.  During 1985 and 1986 unapproved overruns, above the normal overdrafts of approximately £22 million a year, of an additional £55 million were allowed to run up.  That is the principal problem for the health service at present because this has to be brought under control. If we continued in the budgetary arrangements for this year with that level of overrun we would have an overrun of about £110 million.  That situation has to be brought under control yet again and Fianna Fáil are tackling that urgent task. Fine Gael recognise the reality of that task.  I am sure they would have preferred, when they were in Government with the Labour Party, to have been able to keep it under control but the fact that they could not shows the kind of Coalition they had and now we are left with this problem.</P>
    <P>We have now been in office for three months and I know I speak for every member of the Government when I say the enormity of the task of putting the country back on the path to growth and prosperity is brought home to each one of us in our daily work.  We have made a good start.  There is now a general acceptance that the problems which we face require firm handling and tough decisions.  What distinguishes this Government's approach is our commitment and our ability to match measures to contain public expenditure with a major development programme designed to sitmulate growth in the economy.  This will result in the creation of significant numbers of new jobs and in increased prosperity.  At the same time, we are deeply committed to safeguarding those who are most vulnerable in our society. Indeed, the leader of the main Opposition party called for such energy and imagination in the tackling of our economic problems.  That is the approach being adopted by the Government.  We have a direct, immediate, active, energetic and imaginative approach to our <Col N="3988" /> problems.  Our task is not easy but that is what the Government are prepared to do to find a solution to our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>One of the sectors in the economy which we have singled out for particular attention is the tourism industry.  Among the measures taken to boost this labour intensive industry and major earner of foreign currency are the slashing of air fares from London, the reduction of hotel prices and the distribution of petrol vouchers to visitors.  Already there is evidence of an upturn in the numbers of visitors coming to Ireland this summer and I hold out great hopes for this sector of the economy which has so much to contribute to the country and whose employment potential is not, as yet, fully realised.  Members of the Opposition, and others, have criticised us for taking such urgent action in the area of tourism. We could sit back and deliberate for months; we could let this drag on until October or November and plan the action for next year but that would not bring us any benefit in 1987.  We have taken urgent action to get things moving this year. We are anxious to attract an additional 400,000 visitors and there are signs that we will achieve that target.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that an increase in the number of tourists will result in more employment being created in that industry. It is not hard to realise how much more we can do for next year when we have had such great success this year. Our attitude to the tourist industry is an example of how the Government are tackling the country's problems.  We are not sitting around and deliberating. Everybody anxious to make an input will be given an opportunity whether it is the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce or any Department.  Our plans will have to be prepared with efficiency and speed so that the Government can move quickly.</P>
    <P>The agriculture and food sector is of fundamental importance to our society and to the Irish economy.  This is an area in which we are planning to make great <Col N="3989" /> strides.  Our food processing and horticultural industries are seriously underdeveloped. This Government have given priority to exploiting the potential of these sectors for job creation, added value and import substitution.  I should like to emphasise that in bringing forward projects and developments we will be analysing them and making available all the expertise necessary.  We will make decisions and accept the consequences. All decisions cannot be 100 per cent correct in the long term but we will make the best use of the advice available to us. It is pleasing to note that there has been a great response from the community to our approach.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to the development of the sea is now being undertaken by the new Department of the Marine.  We will develop the natural resources which surround us, paying particular attention to fish processing, fish farming and mariculture. The Government intend to encourage private investment in afforestation and to promote joint ventures involving farmers, private investors and the State.  There is no reason why the management and the development of our forests should not operate on a commercial basis and a commercial semi-State board is being set up to do this.  The proposed construction of a gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk, the elimination of the cross-Border shopping trips, which stemmed the flow of an estimated £300 million out of the country and the decision to apply the special rate of 10 per cent corporation tax to the new financial and ancilliary services which will be located in the Custom House Docks site are all evidence of this Government's commitment not only to put our finances in order but to achieve at the same time the goal of sustained economic growth and expansion.  All of these measures will create employment and wealth and in so doing will facilitate our task in providing the resources needed to maintain and develop our social services.</P>
    <P>It is a common enough occurrence and, perhaps, an understandable response that any downturn in the economy is <Col N="3990" /> accompanied by demands for cost containment in our welfare services.  Our social welfare system has been built up over the years and it reflects the need for people to provide for themselves and their dependants in times of hardship caused by illness, unemployment or the death of the breadwinner.  The system of social insurance in which the employer, the employee and the State contribute to a fund out of which payments are made is an expression of social solidarity in which each party accepts that he or she has a responsibility towards those who fall on hard times.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the social insurance or funded aspect of welfare there are those outside the insurance net who are also vulnerable and who need income maintenance in similar circumstances.  Social assistance schemes, which are wholly State funded, are designed to cater for them.  The social insurance fund amounts to £1,368 million this year, to which the State contributes £417 million.  Expenditure on social assistance, which is financed by general taxation, amounts to £1,200 million this year.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system has developed and expanded over the years. The late sixties and early seventies were times of prosperity in Ireland and these years saw great improvements in the range and quality of services for those dependent on social welfare.  The bedrock of our social welfare system has always been the acceptance by all the parties in the community of their responsibility for the more vulnerable sections of society.  There is no conflict in having a fair and comprehensive social welfare system and at the same time getting the economy right.  The whole purpose of sound economic policy is to produce wealth and thereby improve the well being of our people.  The present economic circumstances call for realistic assessment of the components of the social welfare system to ensure that resources are used effectively and that services are provided for those who need them most.  This is the challenge we face. I want to assure the House that we are determined that the needs of the most <Col N="3991" /> vulnerable sections in the community will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>One particular area about which there has been much publicity recently has been the Government's Jobsearch programme. In general in most European countries employment and social security systems are not adequately geared to giving support or incentives for the employment of the long-term unemployed. This can also be said of the Irish system.  There is a responsibility on us to assist and improve the competitive position of the long-term unemployed in the labour market.  They are suffering an unfair share of the burden of the economic recession and there is a serious risk that a significant proportion of the labour force will suffer a lasting loss of capacity to work effectively.  Much greater emphasis needs to be given to providing support and incentives to the long-term unemployed to assist their efforts to get back to work.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission have recently suggested that it should be a target for member states that all those registered as unemployed for 12 months or more should be guaranteed a minimum level of counselling and assessment through a personal interview, ideally followed up by assistance in pursuing available jobs or a place on a training or employment programme.  Against this background, Deputies will appreciate that the Jobsearch programme is a positive measure. Within Europe similar schemes have been introduced in France, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme goes beyond the provision of income maintenance payment by providing positive help to people in their search for work by way of advice and, in many cases, placement in a Manpower scheme, AnCO training scheme or Jobsearch course.  This is the first time that the agencies dealing with the unemployed have been directed to take an active role in helping those long-term on the live register in their attempts to find work. The links between my Department, the National Manpower Service and AnCO <Col N="3992" /> have now been strengthened to ensure that provision by the State for these people is more effectively co-ordinated. I am sure that this programme, which focusses on those who have been most deeply affected by the recession, will be of real value to most of those who participate in it.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, all the long-term unemployed on the live register will be interviewed by the end of the year by the National Manpower Service.  Some 40,000 Manpower scheme opportunities are being provided as a priority for them and 12,000 places in Jobsearch courses.</P>
    <P>The latest figures just now available show that 7,415 people have already been referred to Manpower schemes and programmes and 2,615 to job vacancies making a total of just over 10,000.  Of these, we know that some 4,000 have been placed in schemes and programmes and about 650 have accepted job vacancies. In addition, over 2,000 people have participated in Jobsearch courses.</P>
    <P>As an indirect consequence of the programme, we also know that, apart from the 650 who got jobs, a further 923 have signed off the register and stopped claiming unemployment payment and a further 240 have been disallowed.  Over half of those 923 who stopped signing failed even to attend the Jobsearch interview.  This, as I pointed out recently, is one of the indirect effects of the Jobsearch programme. To date, between those who have been disallowed and those who signed off, the figure is 1,163, apart from those who got jobs.</P>
    <P>Further information on the operation of the scheme will become available as the year goes on.  These are only preliminary indications and there is a time lag between the offering of job vacancies and acceptance, and between acceptance and notification through channels to the Department of the new positions or the acceptances.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch course forms only one part of the overall programme, and more than three times the number who will attend Jobsearch courses will be referred to other courses and schemes run either by Manpower or AnCO.  These schemes, <Col N="3993" /> which are an important feature of the Jobsearch programme, include the social employment scheme, the work experience programme and the enterprise allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Critics have implied that the purpose of Jobsearch is to deprive recipients of what they are legally entitled to.  This is absurd.  There is no way in which anyone can deprive a person from what he or she is statutorily entitled to under the Social Welfare Acts.  Those whose entitlements are questioned as a result of Jobsearch are not simply those who have failed, in some sense, to meet the criteria of the programme.  The issue of entitlement is a much more fundamental one than that and the essential statutory requirements governing entitlement stand independently of the Jobsearch programme. Reviews of entitlement under the Acts are common practice in my Department and the procedures followed have not been altered in any way.  Where a claimant is dissatisfied with a decision, he or she has the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>As regards voluntary work and the unemployed, quite apart from the measures in the Jobsearch programme which I have spoken about, there is considerable scope within the unemployment payments system to allow an unemployed person to keep active and encourage him to have a positive approach.</P>
    <P>A facility which has had very little attention since it was introduced, but which I feel deserves recognition, is the facility which allows an unemployed person to carry out voluntary work without infringing the &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; conditions and thereby continue to receive his or her unemployment payments. The objectives of this are twofold. First, it is intended to allow an unemployed person some freedom to get involved in voluntary work and to provide encouragement to do so.  Secondly, it is intended to encourage organisations involved in voluntary work in the community to involve the unemployed, to the greatest extent possible, in their activities and to encourage them to create new opportunities for voluntary work.</P>
    <P>So far the numbers of persons availing <Col N="3994" /> of the facility have been disappointing, only a handful of unemployed persons are involved in this work at present.  I would like to place on record my support for the scheme.  I believe that it has great potential for the self-development of those involved.  Furthermore, the development of the social skills required for this work must surely enhance a person's chances of re-integration in the labour force.  I would also like to mention in relation to the scheme that it is important that an unemployed person considering this option should check with his local employment exchange first, to make sure that the work he proposes to undertake and the organisation involved are approved.  This procedure is necessary to ensure that the unemployed person is not being asked to do work which would normally be undertaken by a paid employee.</P>
    <P>I would urge those unemployed who may have thought about voluntary work, but have not done anything about it, to think about it again seriously.  I am confident that they have an enormous contribution to make to the community and I know that many hard-pressed voluntary organisations would be grateful for their support.</P>
    <P>A further initiative, with the objective of introducing some flexibility into the unemployment payments system, is the part-time job allowance scheme.  This is one of three schemes for the long-term unemployed introduced on a pilot basis last year.  The other schemes are the Jobsearch programme, which I have already spoken about, and the educational opportunities scheme, the results of which are currently being evaluated.  The part-time job allowance is an attempt to make it more attractive for persons who have been unemployed for more than one year to take up part-time work by allowing them more flexibility in retaining a basic income maintenance payment from my Department.  Under the scheme an unemployed person who can secure regular part time work of up to 24 hours a week may take up that job and receive a basic flat rate allowance of £25 a week if he is single or £40 if he is married. <Col N="3995" /> Earnings from the employment do not affect payment of the allowance.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally introduced in five locations, Letterkenny, Limerick, Tallaght and the catchment areas of Gardiner Street and Cork employment exchanges.  Following encouraging results the scheme was extended last December to 12 further locations around the country.  Deputies may remember that I made provision in the 1987 Social Welfare Act for participants to resume entitlement to their unemployment payments without serving the usual &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; if the part-time job did not work out.  So far I am happy to say there has been little evidence of this.  There are now over 100 participants in the scheme and a small number of the earlier participants have managed to get full-time jobs and are no longer dependent on the State.  I am convinced that with the growth in the extent of part-time working there is a place for this type of scheme in our services for the unemployed and I am sure that as the potential of the scheme is recognised the numbers of participants will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>The third programme which has been operating on a pilot basis is the educational opportunities scheme.  This scheme gives unemployed persons aged over 25 the opportunity to attend a leaving certificate type course at their local VEC and receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments while doing so.  So far the results are very encouraging.  Three classes have been set up, two in Limerick with 21 and 14 participants and one in Tallaght, County Dublin, with 11 participants.  About 30 hours tuition a week is provided and subjects offered include; English, Maths, Home Economics and computing and part courses in woodwork, art, Irish, computer studies and personal development. Reports to me indicate that the participants are highly motivated and very enthusiastic about the courses.  Over half the participants sat their leaving certificate this month.  I would like to pay tribute to these people, many of whom had been unemployed for some time <Col N="3996" /> before they embarked on the course.  To come from a situation where you have been inactive for so long and participate in a course which is demanding requires self-discipline and dedication.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring Deputies up to date on developments in relation to the report of the National Pensions Board which were launched last April.  The report contains wideranging proposals for the regulation of pension schemes in the areas of funding and financial security and the transferability of pension rights and in such areas as disclosure of information to scheme members, standards of administration and the general monitoring of performance.</P>
    <P>The report, in its main recommendation, calls for the enactment of a Pensions Act to deal with the many problems in this area and to establish a regulatory framework for the future supervision of such schemes.  A specific commitment was made in our election programme to regulate the operation of occupational pension schemes.  I am giving full consideration to the recommendations made in this report.  I have already begun the process of consultation with all interested parties with a view to bringing forward definitive proposals in this whole area.  I have written to the various organisations concerned seeking their views on the report and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals for legislation before the Government in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the introduction of a statutory minimum funding standard to provide for the financial security and safety of members' pension rights and especially to safeguard employees whose companies go into liquidation.  Recommendations for new requirements in relation to the disclosure of information to scheme members are also outlined in the report.  The board are now considering other areas of their terms of reference, which include such matters as the tax treatment of occupational pension schemes, and the equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas <Col N="3997" /> where I expect to make progress over the coming months.  Our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> referred specifically to the need to review the appeals system with special emphasis on ensuring that it operates impartially.  Proposals in relation to this are being finalised and I will be submitting them to Government shortly for approval.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I will be devoting attention over the coming weeks is the rationalisation of the existing free fuel schemes.  This is a complex issue because of the anomalies that exist whereby different categories of welfare recipients can qualify for free fuel under the two schemes.  It is further complicated by virtue of last year's court decision.</P>
    <P>I am also examining the question of extending the social insurance base to bring about a greater degree of equity in the financing of social security.  Self-employed persons are at present outside the scope of the social insurance system and must rely solely on means tested social assistance schemes.  There are practical difficulties in extending the base of social insurance and I am examining how best these might be overcome.  I also propose to finalise my plans for the regionalisation of social welfare services with a view to giving a more localised service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the Government have made significant progress over the past few months in restoring order to the public finances and to improving confidence in the economy and that the measures we have taken will enable us to achieve our objectives for national recovery.  In relation to social welfare, my objective will be to maintain and protect the position of the more vulnerable people in our community and to improve it where possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In his maiden speech to Dáil Éireann in 1927 Seán Lemass asked Deputies in this House to co-operate in abolishing the memory of past dissension in wiping out the recollection of the hatred, the bitterness and the jealousies created in this country after the Civil War.  We have still some distance to go <Col N="3998" /> to fulfil what we all accept is a desirable prescription for a new age in political life.</P>
      <P>The Adjournment debate affords us an opportunity and compels us not so much to contrast the points scored by all of us during the past couple of months but to stand back a little from what we have been engaged in and address more fundamental questions as to whether, collectively, we are doing the job of leading the people who look to this House and its representatives for that guidance.</P>
      <P>I am struck by one feature of the speeches in the debate up to now.  Their theme is economic, they are cluttered with statistics that mean very little to ordinary people and their formulation is designed to assert political superiority by one viewpoint or one political party over another.  That narrow economic view of our political process misses the fundamental challenge of what this House was established to achieve and the hunger in our people for some fresh political thinking, new vision and sense of purpose and new direction enamating from Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Our economic malaise is a symptom which tells us very graphically how we decided, voluntarily, to order our affairs in pursuit of various political ends or in the fear of taking political stances.  I am not very interested &mdash; nor are the people &mdash; in who achieved most in bringing us to this point.  With my colleagues, I appeal to Deputies to use this debate and the recess for fundamental rethinking in our priorities and our approaches and, above all, in the absolute need for us to address the task of building a new consensus which will clearly identify the economic strategies we need to use to achieve social &mdash; perhaps even philisophic &mdash; targets, in other words, to achieve the potential and purpose of the country.  That is what economics are about, they are a means to a greater end.  In themselves they are no more than statistics but they carry implicitly in them volumes about our behaviour, our purpose, our vision of ourselves and what we believe this country can achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3999" /> That narrow economic debate dominates not just this Adjournment debate, it has dominated recent political discussion. It dominates invariably the party political programmes and may very well mask a more fundamental and serious vacuum.  Those serious questions are there, they are about such things as the quality of our lives, what that should be like, what its texture should be like for all our people, not just the favoured. They are about the need for social justice for many people who are still hurt, wounded and impoverished, for old people without enough to live on, for young people whose hearts are broken from joblessness.  Even our obligations to others around the world and our modest attempt to make a contribution to international aid, have to be sacrificed in the face of a desperate attempt to deal with the economics.  Other serious questions are our relationship with our environment, how we treat it, how we understand it and how we emphasise and relate to it.  Manifestly this is an area which needs attention.  In addition there is a whole range of other issues; in short, the vision we collectively share of what the future of this country is about.  It is a question not of how we do things but of why; to what end is the attempt to get the economics right?  What kind of future do we envisage for our children?</P>
    <P>Despite the undoubted integrity of the overwhelming majority on every side of this House somehow we are failing.  We appear in this Chamber to be demented, frantic, vicious and nasty.  That includes all sides.  Somehow, we have not managed to so organise our structures as to facilitate legitimate, concerned, rational expression by all people in this House.  I submit that the reason for that is the problem that we have not defined that towards which those structures should work.  It seems that once we have answered the fundamental questions, our systems can then respond.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all economic planning or debate should be suspended while we indulge in philosophy.  I am not saying that.  I am saying that when one <Col N="4000" /> looks at, say, the work of the last session &mdash; I have a list of every item with which we have dealt &mdash; one somehow feels that we are busy but that we are not very effective and there is a vast difference between being busy and being effective. Our targets should be effectiveness and effectiveness is about the rational achievement of clear-cut goals.  Those goals are not clear-cut.  So the structures have not worked because they are largely purposeless.  Happy are people who know towards which direction their faces are set, towards which their work orientates.</P>
    <P>In Professor Schumacher's work, <i>Small is Beautiful</i>, he sums up this point well when he says:</P>
    <P>The task of our generation, I have no doubt, is one of metaphysical reconstruction. It is not as if we had to invent anything new; at the same time, it is not good enough merely to revert to the old formulations.  Our task... is to understand the present world, the world in which we live and make our choices.</P>
    <P>The problems...cannot be solved by organisation, administration, or the expenditure of money, even though the importance of all these is not denied.  We are suffering from a metaphysical disease, and the cure must therefore be metaphysical.... For it is our central convictions that are in disorder, and, as long as the present anti-metaphysical temper persists, the disorder will grow worse. </P>
    <P>Emerson, too, who was a fount of wisdom on a variety of matters, said: &ldquo;Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world&rdquo;.  What I am appealing for today is just that we think afresh about the thoughts that should permeate this Chamber and the party rooms where we all work.  What is it all about? If we had at some stage a discussion as to a statement of target for this country and some degree of standing back from the structures in which we are almost inextricably enmeshed, it might help us all.</P>
    <P>We cannot plan our economy unless <Col N="4001" /> we know in what direction we intend to go.  We have a whole agricultural sector, for example, totally unplanned.  Our health services are not really a health service, they are a sickness service, they are about treating people when the machine breaks down.  The financial structures permeating them rely for their efficacy on the amount of sickness.  We do not actually reward the achievement of health.  We do not seek to prevent sickness in our schools or in our educational processes generally, or even in the context of what we call a health service. Perhaps we should be looking at a new definition of work.  Maybe, consciously or otherwise, we are misleading the people by pretending, talking about the Jobsearch programme as some kind of panacea, saying that there are finite and absolute answers but deep down in the well of our souls we are afraid to ask the question, are there?  Perhaps a new definition of work is required which recognises legitimate contribution to our social structure provided it works towards the common good as being purposeful, useful work, open to recognition for the purpose of economic reward.  But that is not what we have.</P>
    <P>In the area of industry and commerce our whole approach is essentially seductive of the passing trade.  We spend large sums of taxpayers' money appealing in the hope that somehow sufficient people will be attracted to fill the vacuum and hope that the energy and activity that they create will meet the needs of people for work, the fundamental need for self-meaning. It has not done so and it will not do so.  Maybe, therefore, the questions were are asking are wrong.</P>
    <P>Our education system is still intrinsically irrelevant in terms of its content, judgment is by way of a badge of achievement, the standard of a certificate, from groups of people who organise the education system and who have themselves a vested interest in making sure that education in the literal sense of the word is not necessarily recognised but that examination results, which one can control and monitor, are seen as synonymous with education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="4002" /> Look at our justice system.  It is impenetrable, not open to review by anyone; dare raise a question and this incestuous area falls in on the question.  This is surely the sacred cow of all sacred cows, the unwritten law that says you can question anybody but you cannot question too much in this area because somehow you do something ephemeral, indefinable, unquantifiable, an injury.  Yet my constituents do not understand the system. They feel that it is oppressive, alien to them, that it is designed by &ldquo;them&rdquo; to repress and oppress those people.  That is how it is perceived.  For the vast majority it is not seen as a mainstay of order and justice in our society but as a repressive area operated by rules drawn up in private, not reviewable, not accountable and which essentially operate on the basis of a society that is class ridden.</P>
    <P>In the area of the environment in relation to our economic system, is it rational that we should continue open-endedly to develop an economic system that by its development abuses the ecosphere? In <i>A Blueprint for Survival</i>, a book which talks about the relationship of economics and ecology it is stated that since economics is the science of the distribution of resources all of which are derived from the ecosphere it is foolish to perpetuate an economic system which destroys it.  That is an interesting statement. I do not have absolute conviction or certain answers on all of these things but some of those fundamental questions have to be answered.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach talks about the national debt having risen to £25 billion and continuing to rise steadily, and when he tells us that we are heading for an addition of £2 billion to the debt in 1987, what he is essentially saying is that we have decided by omission or commission to organise our affairs so that that is the economic result.  That does not point to the heart of the matter.  The structure is wrong.  Not one of us in this House believes that this Adjournment debate will change a thing.  It is particularly saddening for the new Deputies who may have had a vision and a dream that in <Col N="4003" /> this Chamber there was the capacity to influence policy and to change structure and direction.  Without a major fundamental review it is impossible for us to organise our affairs and do a far superior job.</P>
    <P>Is it reasonable to use this forum for Committee Stages of Bills?  What would be wrong with meeting in a room to which anybody could have access, sitting around a table like sensible caring men and women and discussing things in a non party, non partisan way and letting this Chamber get on with the Second Stage debates?  What would be wrong with allowing a system of Question Time at least during the recess?  As and from today the rights of every Member of this House are suspended in terms of their capacity to evaluate Government performance. From today on we will communicate only by script.  What a pathetic abysmally deficient way to have political dialogue and communication.  We can write letters to Departments and get standard replies.  I have used that system. That is not the way to do it.  This Chamber should be the fulcrum of our efforts.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the quality of democratic participation has been damaged significantly in the past number of months.  It is undeniable that this Chamber is now less democratic than it was four months ago. That initiative came about as a result of discussion between the two main parties in this House.  They apparently believe that theirs is the right to hold power between them.  This time it is Fianna Fáil's turn and the next time it will be Fine Gael's turn and so on.  The scene is changing.  The people are ahead of all of this.  If we do not respond and extend some form of respect for people's rights in this House we will discredit ourselves and diminish our capacity for doing our job.  Where there should be a welcome and encouragement for a healthy exciting clash of ideas there is a whispered agreement behind closed doors on how this House should be run.  Where there should be lively, honest, efficient debate there is the clinical regimentation of business rammed through this House in defiance <Col N="4004" /> not of outlandish demands but of the right to sit down and talk about how we can better organise our affairs.</P>
    <P>There are 166 Deputies in this House and everyone has the right to participate in this discussion, and in the formulation and development of Bills.  That right is now being denied to the overwhelming majority of all Deputies not just the Members of these benches.  The back-bench Members of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have an obligation to be involved.  I want to hear what they have to say.  I want to know what widsom they can bring to our way of doing things because those of us who have been here for some time have not been doing a great job.  Instead, we get jeering and mocking if one raises these points as rationally as one can in the only forum that one has. That laughter will cease, because when these Members are told they cannot take part either, they will realise that we are not talking about fancy political footwork between two main parties for the purpose of temporary political expediency but about fundamental change in the way this House is run.</P>
    <P>I can recall Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, who was a respected Member of this House, making a point which I thought was abstruse.  I thought about it subsequently and agreed with him.  He fought for the right of Members to put down Dáil Questions.  It did not seem like a big issue but when we talked about it over a cup of tea, and he was a wonderful raconteur, he said: &ldquo;Look son, you are in this place a wet day.  This is Parliament. This is where the rights of people have to be seen to be vindicated, expressed and discussed and anything that brings us from that or injures that process, is not right as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;  He was right.  It is in that spirit that we have raised our voices in recent weeks.  It is not a question of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael <i>versus</i> the rest of us.  That is the way certain people in those parties think it is, but it is not, it is much more fundamental.</P>
    <P>I hope the recess will allow a certain degree of mellowness and moderation to permeate what has become unpleasant and nasty.  What we are witnessing here <Col N="4005" /> is unnecessary, unprecedented and undemocratic.  It is happening because of fear.  People who have been able to lock power to themselves are worried and asking themselves is it really changing? The principal reason that question is now being asked is the emergence against all the odds of 14 people, many of whom were never heard of before, as a legitimate expression of people's right to say, &ldquo;we choose a new way&rdquo;.  We do not claim to be perfect or to have all the answers. We claim simply to be genuine voyagers in pursuit of truth and a new way.  I have no doubt that we will be wrong on occasions.  All we insist on in this House is that those who voted for us have the right to have their views expressed in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Instead of being concerned about people queuing for passports to leave the country, we are afraid of people clutching membership cards of a new party.  That is staggering and it speaks volumes about the lack of vision at leadership level, those whose first thoughts are not about the wonderful opportunities which leadership offers to bring a new sense of purpose to this country, but first thoughts are about turning bully-boy like on the party they think have cheated in some way, have somehow robbed seats that were &ldquo;ours&rdquo;.  All seats, all political responsibility, ultimately rest with the people.  They have a right to exercise that responsibility.</P>

      <P>At the moment on both sides, many boys are attempting to do men's jobs.  I hope the recess will allow rapid maturation so that we can work together to form a new consensus and create structures in this House which have the capacity to afford respect for each other.  We are not the enemy and neither are Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil. The enemy is our fear and unwillingness to face up to a common challenge and to ask the fundamental questions I have spoken about.  I want to reiterate that we will not be blackballed, browbeaten or <Col N="4006" /> bullied and we believe that we have been. A consensus has to be developed and we have to create those structures.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Government in that respect.  It is fundamentally stupid for a minority Administration to believe they can govern by the same rules as if they had absolute power.  They cannot &mdash; they must look to people outside their ranks for support. If the lofty targets which the Taoiseach enunciated yesterday are to be even attempted then the only way this can be done is with some modicum of support from non-Fianna Fáil Deputies.  That support cannot reasonably be expected to be forthcoming unless there is a change from what I would call the sleight-of-hand approach to handling affairs in this House.  The attitude is: &ldquo;Let us see who will go into which lobby this time and maybe we can squeak through.&rdquo; Squeaking through is not good enough, it will get us nowhere.  That lack of vision and the lack of leadership has to be addressed.</P>
      <P>At the centre of the concerns of the people there is a question mark because they have no trust and confidence in this Chamber.  They believe we are all similar, uncaring and not interested in our country. I am not surprised they believe this because during the past few months we have been debating Estimates, sometimes long after the money has been spent.  On Thursday morning last we went through the farce of approving an Estimate in respect of which we had taken a decision days before to approve it without debate.  I do not care if there are a million precedents for it: we cannot accept that type of procedure.  We want a new way of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have pointed in policy documents to fresh thinking.  We have talked about fundamental questions such as the role of the individual <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State, and the need wherever possible to roll back State involvement.  We believe in the freedom of the individual and not the strangulation by regulation of every commercial or other activity.  It is a fundamental question whether it is right and proper for this country &mdash; out of all the countries in the <Col N="4007" /> free world &mdash; to spend the best part of 70p in every £ through the medium of the State.  That is preposterous, there is no mandate for it.  Those who framed our Constitution, those who fought for our freedom, the great names on the Fine Gael side, men who engendered automatic respect and who understood loftier ideals than mere parliamentary games, and the men on the Fianna Fáil side like Lemass whom I quoted at the outset, never sought to bring about a situation where in effect we would have strangulation by bureaucracy.  That is not in anyone's interest, particularly in a small country.</P>
    <P>We have to address these issues.  I know there are parties in the House who will not agree but that is democracy.  I am not looking for unanimity: I am saying we should discuss both fundamental issues. The word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; was used and it is one I am not particularly keen on.  We have talked about the need to show light at the end of the tunnel by reducing tax rates and taking the necessary expenditure cuts to do that.  If the Government want to succeed during the next few months they will not achieve it by coming into the House and, by diktat, announcing what they hope will happen.  The only way they will succeed is by seeking a new way forward and creating the structures which allow us all to be participants to some extent in the process of giving priority to what the Government should be doing.  We have seen the end of majority Governments.   Unless we address the new need we will fail and none of us wants that.</P>

Tá na nithe ar ghá iad a dhéanamh déanta againne, go nuige seo ar aon chaoi, cé <Col N="4008" /> nach ró-mhaith a thaitin an méid sin le cuid mhaith des na daoine gur ghoill siad orthu.

      <P>Táimid ar bhóthar ár leasa.  Tá mise ag taisteal go ciúin ar an mbóthar sin, agus is dóigh liom go bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh thar mar a ceapadh duine a bheadh indéanta cúpla mí ó shin.

      <P>This Government had to face extremely grave economic and financial problems on coming into office.  There were record levels of debt and unemployment and a declining economy.  Over five years the national debt had more than doubled from £12 billion to £25 billion.  The numbers on the live register had virtually doubled, from 126,300 to 252,500, between February 1981 and February of this year. Over the same period the economy had performed considerably below its true potential, as evidenced by the fact that the level of national output in 1986 was actually below the level of output achieved in 1981.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell on the harsh and negative realities of the past five years. Instead, I wish to confirm for the House how the Government have set about restoring confidence in the economy and stimulating growth in investment and output.  It is only through growth that our economic problems can be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The March budget signalled our commitment to get the economy moving again.  It involved very necessary measures which some sections of the community found unpalatable.  The budget contained two key elements &mdash; to improve the public finances and to strengthen the economy.  As regards the first, it was vital for the Government to set about getting the national finances in order. <Col N="4009" /> The budget had to be severe in terms of taxation and expenditure.  There is now explicit evidence of our ability to take difficult but necessary decisions.  It is clear that the Government are adhering to their budgetary targets for 1987 and that work is well under way to make further progress in restoring order to the public finances in 1988.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second key element in the budget strategy &mdash; the strengthening of the economy.  For all too long a mood of despondency had pervaded many sections of our community.  We have set about dispelling this despondency by being positive in our thinking and creative in our actions.  In this way we can ensure that better use is made of our resources, in particular our human resources.  For growth to occur, confidence has to be restored and the conditions conducive to increasing investment have to be created.</P>
    <P>We have recognised the importance of creating a positive business environment to encourage efficiency and to increase competition in the productive sectors of the economy.  The Government are playing and will continue to play their role in removing impediments to sectoral development where they exist.  Equally they will refrain from any excessive intervention in the day-to-day activities of productive enterprises.</P>
    <P>In today's fast-changing environment, we have to respond quickly and effectively to change.  We also need to pay close attention to international developments &mdash; as a small economy we cannot escape their effects economically.  As the National Economic and Social Council commented: &ldquo;It is not possible to stop the world and let Ireland off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The international economic situation has deteriorated in recent months.  The OECD projections, published last week, point to little improvement to the end of 1988.  Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist according to the OECD. Recent downward movements in the dollar have led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the United States.  These developments &mdash;<Col N="4010" /> they are not without some benefit to us in the weakening of the dollar &mdash; together with growing tensions in international trade relations and continuing debt problems, have increased the risks of a worsening world economic situation and we are not insulated from this.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out, however, that despite these trends, many of the conditions for faster growth still remain favourable: inflation is under control in most countries; corporate financial positions are generally good; interest rates have declined markedly, budget positions have improved in a number of countries; and labour markets show signs of increased flexibility.  The fact that the outlook is not better is due in large measure to an apparent weakening of private sector confidence related in particular to recent wide swings in exchange rates and uncertainty about their future evolution.</P>
    <P>Despite these developments in the international economy we can make substantial progress in developing our own economy provided we devise and implement appropriate policies.  This we have done and already results are encouraging. The recently published Consumer Price Index confirms the downward trend in the rate of price increases.  In the three months to mid-May, the CPI rose by 0.6 per cent, bringing the year-to-year inflation rate to 2.8 per cent in mid-May, compared to 3.4 per cent in mid-February.</P>
    <P>The reduction in inflation is not the only encouraging sign on the economic horizon.  The latest batch of external trade figures were particularly encouraging. Exports in May rose to £1,037 million &mdash; the first time the £1,000 million mark was exceeded.  With imports at £790 million, there was a healthy trade surplus of close on £250 million.  In the 12 months ended May 1987, the trade surplus exceeded £990 million.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the March budget was to lay the groundwork for a reduction in interest rates.  There had been much criticism about the negative impact high interest rates was having on the performance of the Irish economy.  It is certainly true that when Irish interest <Col N="4011" /> rates are higher than those of our main trading partners our competitiveness is adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The importance of low interest rates for investment and growth was stressed by the distinguished American economist, Professor John Kenneth Galbraith in his lecture to the Chartered Institute of Transport in Dublin earlier this month. I was interested to hear Professor Galbraith conclude that: &ldquo;Far better that all countries restrain demand by high taxes, by responsible fiscal policy, than by high interest rates with their direct, inescapable, immutable effect on capital investment, the very expenditure that is most needed for growth and competitive competence.&rdquo; Coming as it does from Professor John Kenneth Galbraith who is well known for the humanitarian aspects of his particular economic philosophy, that is an important thought for us to keep in mind.</P>
    <P>Of course, we can only tackle the domestic causes of high interest rates.  This we did in the budget by tackling the management of the public finances.  It would have been defeatist not to have taken that action in the mistaken belief that the future course of our economy is dictated solely by international development.  We took the right action and the benefits are now beginning to work through.</P>
    <P>Since the budget, domestic interest rates have been falling and are set to ease even further in the coming months.  In fact everybody one meets who has a mortgage nowadays inquires when will the next drop in interest rates come because it is money in their pockets. Lower interest rates will help our exports to become more competitive.  That is on the export side of the business.  I mentioned the other which is a domestic matter.  Lower interest rates will also help to give a much needed boost to personal consumer expenditure, which has lacked buoyancy in recent years.  An examination of the retail sales figures will indicate that to any Member of the House.</P>
    <P>There is some irony in the fact that, while interest rates had been high until recently, there had been a drain of capital <Col N="4012" /> out of the country.  We have suffered badly from the flows of money out of the country.  The flows represent lost opportunities and, of course, lost opportunities for investment meant lost job opportunities as well and that is the one fundamental objective of what is going on regarding the management of finances. By instilling new confidence into the economy, we are now striving to reverse the adverse trend.</P>
    <P>The budget clearly signalled the determination of this Government to put the economy on the right tracks by improving the public finances and exploring new opportunities for growth.  In this regard I need only refer Deputies to the development measures for the economy announced by Government last April. These measures, which are being undertaken within the public expenditure allocations of the budget, are oriented towards creating wealth by our latent talents and resources.</P>
    <P>The development measures relate to a wide range of economic activities, embracing financial services, extension of the national gas grid, horticulture, forestry, urban renewal, export promotion and my own area of responsibility tourism. I will just emphasise the importance of producing a good quality tourism product, at the right price, and marketing it professionally so as to increase our share of what is a rapidly growing international market.</P>
    <P>Both at Question Time during the week and in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department I covered the areas of tourism and transport fairly widely and my views were widely reported.  I should like to mention that on taking office the problem for tourism of steep access fares, both by air and sea, was the first problem we addressed. I might just mention the results of the meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers which took place this week.  The results have been widely reported.  I reminded the House that 11 out of the 12 Council Ministers agreed on routes between hub and regional airports throughout the Community being open to the inauguration of third and fourth <Col N="4013" /> scheduled air services.  The combination of points, that is, the facility to travel from Dublin to Milan via Brussels and to drop people at Brussels and Milan, to pick up people at Milan without any rights in the intervening Brussels Airport has been accepted by 11 of the Council of Transport Ministers.</P>
    <P>The most important one I should like to mention is the question of fifth freedom rights between all inter regional airports and all hub to region airports and our carriers were particularly interested in that.  There were some exceptions to the final agreement but I have not the time to go into all of those or to go into all the details but I will give a general outline of what happened.  For example, our national carrier, Aer Lingus had fifth freedom rights out of Manchester and Birmingham at one stage but lost them in 1974.  When this decision of the Council is finalised it will allow them to resume those services and will also allow Ryanair, the other Irish carrier to avail of this breakthrough.  However, there are various other qualifications and so on, but I wanted to mention the outlines of what has been achieved.  Unfortunately, the Council finally collided with the Treaty of Utrecht.  A problem arose between Spain and the United Kingdom, political as much as commercial.  It is not really a problem for the Council of Ministers.  The Spaniards claim that the airport at Gibraltar was not part of the territory ceded to Spain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.  The UK representative is taking the matter in a very low key fashion and it is our hope that that problem will be resolved.  Eleven of the Twelve Ministers agreed to the total package.  When clearance comes from Spain it will be the blueprint for great development in aviation in Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the CIE finances that are causing me concern.  The results for 1985 and 1986 were very pleasing.  I approved in this House, and I reiterate it now, the Minister's decision to have above the line financing in making payments authorised by this House to CIE but I must say that I found a little nest egg in the finances of CIE which are <Col N="4014" /> very upsetting and which are creating problems which will have to be faced in the future.  Financial commitments were made by my predecessors in office in respect of subvention payments to CIE and they have not been implemented in full.  The last Government did not honour their commitments and as a result CIE had to borrow to meet their financial commitments.  The consequential interest charges are reflected in the board's results.  The shortfall related first to interest payments on the capital costs of DART to which the last Government committed themselves in 1984.  The Government decided, however, on a number of occasions to defer payments to CIE instead of making the payments as they fell due.  I found when I came into office that payments totalling over £30 million relating to 1985, 1986, and 1987 had been deferred to 1988.  If account is taken of interest on borrowings which CIE have had to undertake to cover the delays in payments the shortfall exceeds £34 million.  I think the House should know about that.</P>
    <P>The second shortfall relates to the subvention for CIE's general operations. The last Government decided in late 1985 to defer until January 1987 a subvention of £9.2 million which was due for payment in 1986.  A similar decision was taken with regard to the 1987 subvention, except that the amount deferred to next year amounted to £11.2 million.  In all the shortfall in payments to CIE, arising from the non-fulfilment of the last Government's commitments exceeds £40 million. Indeed, it totals approximately £45 million if interest on consequential borrowings undertaken by CIE is taken into the reckoning.  The shortfall is a major problem and the present Government are clearly not in a position to make good the shortfall or any part of it.  There is an obligation on me to review the position and I will be doing that in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I again emphasise that this Government have shown their determination and willingness to face up to the problems of our economy.  We are now laying the groundwork for a sustainable <Col N="4015" /> recovery in the economy.  In particular, we are striving to ensure conditions in which investment will take place and flourish.  A resumption of investment, and in particular investment by the private sector, is a necessary prerequisite for achieving more growth and more sustainable jobs in the future.  The omens seem to be good.  Business people, and people with money to invest seem to be gathering confidence in the future.  The outflows of money seem to have been staunched.  There is some outflow but it is only minimal compared with what was happening.  This money should be available for the development of our economy and its effect when repatriated should be to push down interest rates and encourage investment, for the future.  The most important single objective is to increase the number of jobs but this will not be achieved without a substantial increase in investment.  We know that the measures the Government have taken are geared to that objective and we hope that objective will be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by saying a few words about the events of this week and in particular in regard to the Health Estimate which was voted on here on Wednesday evening.  There was a reaction, which of course was predictable, to the performance of the party to which I belong but it is a reaction which I personally discount 100 per cent.  So far as the reaction consisted of unfavourable or cynical comment in the media, it reflects only journalists' very natural and understandable disappointment at being deprived of the sight of some political blood being spilled.  Naturally like everybody else &mdash; and perhaps I am even more like them in this respect than many other people are &mdash; they have a low boredom threshold.  They get fed up with the day to day routine of things which do not seem to differ much from week to week in their colour or texture as Deputy Keating would say.  They like spills and thrills and they would have wished to see the excitement of a dissolution, of the Taoiseach charging off to the Park.  They were <Col N="4016" /> looking forward to three or four weeks of speculation, opinion polls, tables, constituency profiles, interviews, all the Beecher's Brook events of a modern political contest.  I am afraid we did them out of that and naturally I have to show understanding for the degree of crossness they showed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other Opposition parties are in a different category.  Their resentment was more than a mere expression of disappointment at being cheated of a treat. Their resentment was entirely affected. They are small enough, Sir, to be able to strike postures without doing any real damage to themselves or anybody else. They are small enough when put together to be able to square up threateningly from a distance to something, without anyone having any real fear that they are going to pull the House down.  I have seen <i>The Plough and the Stars</i> both in film form and frequently since then on stage.  In the old film version in which Barry Fitzgerald starred, the role of Fluter Good was more or less canonised for later actors.  It showed him at a particular juncture in a bar, his coat off and his sleeves rolled up, circling the bar with his fists raised and also weaving but taking very good care to keep a woman with a child in her arms between himself and his adversary, taking good care to keep a more responsible patron and a larger patron between himself and all harm. That is how I would view the indignation expressed here and outside in the last few days by what a menagerie, as the former Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello used to say in describing the multiplicity of his own supporters in the first inter-party Government.  They are a menagerie consisting of newborn right wing radicals on the one side, right over to the rookeries of The Workers' Party and Deputy Gregory on the other.  They were all set up with Fine Gael.  We had not let them at it.  We had not let them spill blood.  They were like a little tailor who killed 40 flies with one swipe of his belt and put an inscription round his middle saying &ldquo;40 at one blow&rdquo; and went round the world hoping to terrify people with this inscription.  I discount all of that for the reasons I have <Col N="4017" /> given.  However, I will concede that it could be said with some justice that this party should not have intimated &mdash; they did not intimate but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my own speech and the Deputy will have a chance to make his.  He has been running to the papers for the past three or four days with his opinions about this matter but luckily no one is ever going to expect him to carry any responsibility for these matters.  It could be said with some justice that the party should not have taken up at Front Bench or whatever level it was &mdash; I was not privy to it &mdash; a position which if it got out could be intimated as promising an Opposition which the party were not intending to carry through to the kill.  That could be said with truth, but since when did an inconsistency on this scale rank anywhere in the world of Irish political inconsistency?  Where does this wobble figure on the Richter scale of political inconsistency compare with what we have been witnessing &mdash; not only witnessing but swallowing and not only swallowing but, in my case, welcoming &mdash; from the Government side in the past three or four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had been able to rely on what Fianna Fáil were saying &mdash; not only saying but making a meal of and building into major propaganda &mdash; up to a few short months ago and spending tens of thousands of pounds in plastering all over gable ends, we would now be looking at the repudiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the rejection of the Single European Act, two pernicious measures which threatened our independence in all sorts of ways and were unconstitutional in various ways which were not the ones that the Supreme Court subsequently discovered. We would be looking at the repeal of DIRT and residential property tax and, above all, the cancellation of the health cuts.  If we had been able to rely &mdash; taking a stand on the level of consistency you might have got in some country like Denmark or Norway &mdash; on those kinds of noises from that party over there, these <Col N="4018" /> are the kind of measures we would now be seeing.  The cancellation of the health cuts amuses me because that was the issue on which the last Coalition Government broke up.  That above all issues was the one on which we nailed our colours to the mast and the Opposition did the same.  If we are to judge people on their consistency I can think of no more damning criterion than the application of that one in deciding which of us has most to apologise for.</P>
    <P>Over and above the details of DIRT tax, residential property tax and health cuts, if there was one cry more than any other coming from Deputy Haughey and his footmen in the past five years it was that the Government sitting on that side of the House in those days led by Deputy FitzGerald was heartless, Thatcherite, going about privatisation, taking their lessons from London.  Their foremost publicist &mdash; who is keeping a very quiet little profile now &mdash; was sneering at Deputy FitzGerald and his party for being interested only in running an economy and not interested in running a country at all.  There is not much noise out of him now when he sees the little local hospitals being closed down and Knock airport holding out their hat waiting for the Government to put something in it. It is like what Hamlet said after running a sword through the arras and destroying Polonius, when he drew back the curtain and discovered the devastation he had committed on the Lord Chamberlain: &ldquo;I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.&rdquo; Then he looked at the body and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed, this counsellor Is now most still, most secret and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have to say that about the publicists and about one in particular who remorselessly and relentlessly and in many cases unfairly &mdash; though I think his heart is in the right place in many respects &mdash; hounded the outgoing Government for the very things I am talking about. Now he sees them being put into operation by his Government and there is not <Col N="4019" /> a peep out of him.  He is right about porbeagle sharks and such things but there is not a word out of him about this Government's efforts at running the country.</P>
    <P>The lesson has at last got through to the parties on all sides of the House that there is no difference between the economy and the country as far as the Government are concerned.  Subtract the economy from the country and what is left will not interest many people.  Subtract from the country everything connected with the economy and what is left will not bring out many votes in Galway or anywhere else.  If a Government are not able to manage the economy so far as they have any control over it, they are of no use to the country.  The kind of glib phrase which Irish people run after like children after the Pied Piper has ruined us.  If the day of the glib phrase and the attachment to it are coming to an end it will be all the better for us.</P>
    <P>What is significant is the difference in scale between the inconsistencies I have been talking about in this party and the one on the far side.  It is the difference in their attitude to Opposition.  The present Government, when they were in Opposition shouted blue murder about measures which they now find not only acceptable but absolutely indispensable. The ones which they find acceptable and indispensable do not go far enough.  They deliberately sabotaged at health board level whatever chance the last Government might have had of controlling the expenditure the explosion of which has led us to the present juncture.  They deliberately set out to make difficulties for the Government in the very sphere where they are now stuck with the job of repairing the damage.</P>
    <P>I know that anyone boasting about his own party runs the risk of sounding sanctimonous and I would like to avoid that, and I do not think we are entirely blameless in this regard, but I can say that as a rule this party try not to conduct themselves with that degree of recklessness. They could, of course, indulge in it.  We could oppose everything tooth <Col N="4020" /> and nail and go into the lobby, as on last Wednesday night and many other times, and could do it in the future, and no doubt we could curry favour with all kinds of groups.  We could get disorderly applause from the public gallery as I have seen Fianna Fáil members get, including Deputy O'Malley on one occasion when he had an easy target.  We could in the process have the bonus of avoiding the charge of conducting a feeble Opposition, but we do not do it.</P>
    <P>Why do we not do it?  We do not do it for any fear of our own seats.  In advising my party &mdash; as I would have done had I been asked &mdash; not to oppose the Health Estimate, it is not because I am afraid that if there is an election next week I am going to lose a seat.  It is not for that reason that people in my party who are not in the Dáil at all rang me in a day or two before and said that, if Fine Gael caused an election by bringing down the Government just for the sake of being able to say we have our foot on their neck, they would never again darken the door of a Fine Gael meeting.  These are not just minor rank and file members. Both the people I am talking about are fairly important people at constituency level &mdash; not in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Suppose we had done what the Fluther Goods over there would have liked us to do.  Suppose we had stood aside.  Suppose we had joined them and raised our fists and knocked out the adversary the other night and caused an election.  What would have been the effect?  Naturally, it is difficult to predict the result of an election that has not taken place, but I am inclined to think that, with the degree of unpopularity which the Government's conduct has caused, they probably would leak enough votes to cost them a few seats.  It would not be a landslide but they would probably lose a few seats.  The ones which they got by the skin of their teeth, and there are a few, would be lost, particularly in areas where there have been closures.  This party would possibly have picked up those seats or maybe the Fluthers over there would have picked up one or two of them but where would <Col N="4021" /> we find a Government from the resulting Dáil?  Where would we find a packet of parties sufficiently in tune with one another on economic issues to put together a credible Government?  I cannot see it.  If Fianna Fáil had 75 seats and we had 55 and we threw a couple of seats to the Fluther Goods it might add up to 166 but where would we get a Government out of that?  What is the point, therefore, of putting the country through this exercise?  It is great meat for the media but the beast from whose bones that meat is being licked is the unfortunate country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil at present offers the superficial appearance of the old realities but there is a new reality underlying it.  In speaking like this, I am speaking only for myself and not for any significant section of my own party, not to talk of any other party, but beneath that surface there is a political reality in operation and even though the principal actors do not realise or desire it it is going on in spite of them. The party opposite have been evidently converted to the view which we expressed, but unfortunately were prevented from effectuating, that economy in State spending is the only way back to prosperity.  Perhaps it is no harm to say to a Deputy who has just recently arrived in the House that for the first time since I have been in politics Fianna Fáil are showing resolution in doing unpopular things.  They are showing something other than a cheap populist calculation at every turn.  Since the days of Mr. de Valera or the very early days of Mr. Lemass that kind of note has not come from the other side of the House but whether they will maintain it remains to be seen.  If they are showing it and if they do maintain it, it is only because they know they can rely on this party to behave responsibly and not to handtrip them as long as their course is maintained in more or less the right direction.  This means that in practice, even if not in form, Government is at last in the hands of a composite force representing a broad national centrist consensus.  I am sure Deputy Roche, who is as much entitled to the attribution of intellectual as I am, <Col N="4022" /> will have enough detachment to recognise this.</P>
    <P>The problem now must be to try to find a way of giving stability to that force and of giving a share in the conduct of Government to the party which in practice must carry some of the responsibility for it.  I know there are people in Fianna Fáil, as there also would be on this side of the House if they were in the same situation, who will say: &ldquo;To hell with that. We will strike out for ourselves when the moment is right.  We will get an overall majority and we will not require anybody else's support, forbearance or acquiescence; they can behave like monkeys if they wish but we will still keep the ship on the course we think is right.&rdquo;  There are many people on the other side of the House who will think like that but that is a short-sighted view.  It may work once but it will not work the next time or the time after that.</P>
    <P>There is now an opportunity, if the two main parties have enough generosity and enough imagination to grasp it, to do something revolutionary.  Between this perception, which I have been trying to articulate for several years and the emergence of a stable union of a kind which the CDU and the CSU offer in Germany &mdash; they are two separate parties but they have a stable companionship which is rarely rocked &mdash; there is a very large gap.  The measure of the talent in either party will be the qualities which they bring to bear on accepting that destiny for themselves and for the country. In doing that they will bring to an end the 65 years of destructive competition, of the mean begrudgery and of the spite with which everybody is heartily sick.</P>
    <P>Partisan spirit is hard to put behind one.  I have often been victim to it but as I get older I find my temper rises less easily.  One is very quickly led astray by the appearance of a crowd at an Árd Fheis.  It can be a Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis or a Fine Gael Árd Fheis packed with 7,000 or 8,000 heaving, sweating, shouting supporters wild with enthusiasm for the leader addressing them on the podium.  Perhaps there is another 8,000 or even 16,000 just as rabid activists who <Col N="4023" /> have stayed at home because they were not in a position to get away for the weekend, because they had to work on the farm, in their business or for whatever reason.  We should compare that number with the number of people who vote for a party.  Voting for a party does not mean fanaticism or commitment; it just means that the citizen concerned is doing, through the ballot box, what he thinks is best for the country and perhaps for himself.  The kind of fanaticism and spirit which drives a party into saying: &ldquo;We will take them on and beat them, we have the right message and the people who contest our position can lump it&rdquo; is not shared by the people and one can be led very far astray by relying on a cheering crowd into thinking that it is.  There would be a cheer from the people that you could hear from one end of the country to the other if the union I am talking about were effectuated and I do not care if I leave this House at the end of my life in politics still saying that alone.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the life of this Dáil will be long or short but we have a new situation.  We owe it to ourselves to sit back with a bit of detachment and see whether something better can emerge from it, something stable and institutionalised, of a sort that we will not have to apologise for so frequently to the people in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always very conscious of the inadequacies of a new speaker when I follow a speaker such as Deputy Kelly.  At the outset of this debate the Taoiseach listed for the House the very considerable progress that has been made by this Government in spite of the fact that they lack a parliamentary majority in the House and in spite of the doubts voiced by do many of the professional Jeremiahs in the past 100 days or so.  In addition to gauging the performance of Government, it is appropriate at this time to examine also the performance of those who sit opposite the Government.  The old weak view of the duties of Opposition was a simple one.  The duties of those who sit opposite Government were, according <Col N="4024" /> to Lord Derby, to oppose everything and to propose nothing.  Lord Derby's spirit and his restricted view of the responsibilities of Members of Parliament is alive and well and stalking the benches opposite.</P>
      <P>At the outset of this session, and indeed in the past few hours, it seemed Fine Gael were set fair to strike a new mould in Irish parliamentary Opposition but in recent times they seem to have departed from that constructive course. So much has been said and written about the main party's performance of late that it seems positively indecent of me to intrude on their all too obvious grief and confusion at this point.  The embodiment of that party is disarrayed.  Last night Deputy Michael Noonan, in his response to the Taoiseach's contribution, illustrated how bereft his party are of ideas and direction and how niggardly they can be when they face real achievement.</P>
      <P>A graphic illustration of that party's confusion is to be found in Deputy Noonan's contribution.  While he proposes the not implausible suggestion of a fixed term Dáil &mdash; and Deputy Kelly made some suggestions in that area &mdash; his Front Bench colleague, Deputy Allen, embarked on a single-handed Rambo-style campaign to march this House into yet another election. That is probably an example of the type of codology to which Deputy Michael Noonan was alluding in his speech.  However, we will leave the problems in that party to be sorted out in the privacy of Fine Gael party rooms.  No doubt with the passage of time Deputy Dukes will find some constructive use for the energies and talents of Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the behaviour of Fine Gael in the last week can, we hope, be regarded as an aberration, the same cannot be said of the Progressive Democrats.  Born of bitterness, nurtured on spite, how predictable it is now that that party, frustrated by their parliamentary impotence, should be progressively poisoning themselves on their own venom.  At the time of their foundation, and throughout the recent election campaign, the Progressive Democrats heckled all and <Col N="4025" /> sundry on the need to break new moulds. The party, founded on fiscal rectitude, promised massive tax cuts funded by major reductions in current expenditure and by a ruthless cutback on the Public Capital Programme.  Health, education, welfare, housing and roads were all to receive the attention of the PD pruning knife.  Of course, the object of the pruning knife's attention depended on the audience involved.  I should like to remind the House of Deputy O'Malley's sure footed approach in Wexford during the course of the election campaign when he had to make specific concessions. Even during the heady days of the party's formation vacillation was the hallmark of PD performance.  Since the election that party have at the same time plumbed the depths of parliamentary dishonesty while shrilly claiming to be the sole holders of the high moral ground.</P>
    <P>As a party PD performance in the Chamber has been nothing short of disgraceful. Behind a smokescreen of self-righteous indignation Deputy O'Malley and his cohorts have impeded the progress of the Dáil in a manner which is unparalleled in the annals of Irish parliamentary democracy.  The 25th Dáil has sat for something more than 300 hours and in that short time there has been a record 55 divisions bringing an unprecedented level of disruption to the House.  By way of contrast there were 79 divisions in the entire Dáil year of 1985 and 67 in 1984.  In just two days, 16 and 17 June, the Dáil divided on no fewer than 18 occasions swallowing up between nine and 10 hours of valuable parliamentary time when the Finance Bill was supposed to be under consideration. The Dáil has divided in all on 29 occasions since 16 June.  More than half of those divisions have been called by the PDs, occasionally supported by the other minority parties.  Those divisions have not been on points of high policy.  All too frequently they have been the products of truculence and pique on the part of the PD leadership.  The fact that Deputy O'Malley's truculence and pique has been tarted up in the clothes of moral indignation does not make it anything <Col N="4026" /> more than truculence and pique.  We had an extraordinary example this morning of that party's hypocrisy.  On <i>Morning Ireland</i> Deputy Colley was proclaiming her hurt, her indignation at the way the House is run but, evidently, she got lost between the hospitality rooms of RTE and the division lobby in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>While Deputy O'Malley, and his new found friend Deputy Spring, sought to portray their antics as a rejection of shabby treatment a perusal of the Official Report of the Dáil produces ample precedence for the arrangement they are now so vehemently objecting to.  If one examines the Official Report for November 1969 one finds a precedent by Deputy O'Malley.  The same precedent was gladly followed in December 1981 by Deputy Spring.  Their protests at this stage ring hollow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The shining example of the PD shallowness is to be found in their response to the Health Estimate.  As far back as October 1986, in one of the small libraries of so-called policy documents produced by that party, they promised to finance massive tax cuts by lopping off £330 million from current services but when PD sincerity as to containing public expenditure was tested on the Health Estimate it went out the window.  In the last week they proved themselves to be nothing more than a shrewd bunch of dishonest political opportunists whose purpose in life is essentially destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset that that party were founded on bitterness and on envy.  They have proven themselves time and again to be the most ill-begotten group of political opportunists to ever stalk the corridors of this or any other parliamentary assembly. Charity dictates a degree of restraint when appraising the Labour Party's performance. Deputy Spring and his colleagues are clearly in some trauma in their quest for the Left but what an extraordinary vision of the Left they produce marching time and again into the division with the parvenus from the PDs when they could clearly have nothing in <Col N="4027" /> common other than some form of mad destructive urge.</P>
    <P>Disraeli once said that no Government can be long secure without a formidable Opposition.  All that we can hope for is that the vaudeville act opposite will show a little more concern for the very real problems of the nation in the next session. In that regard I would welcome the restraint in the contribution just made by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>So much for the Opposition but this is a time for appraisal of both sides of the House.  The period of three short months since the Government assumed office has been one of sparkling performance.  In this Dáil session 18 Bills have been steered through a fracas assembly.  The real achievements of Government, however, have been in the economy and outside the House.  Major progress has been achieved on the nation's finances, in the restoration of economic confidence, in sectoral policies and in institutional reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Name them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Progress on the nation's finances are evident.  On assuming office we inherited a national debt of £25 billion, a debt that had doubled in the life of the last Government and a debt that was and continues to sap the life energy of the nation.  The first major achievement of the Government has been to contain runaway public expenditure.  Undoubtedly, the decisions that have been taken have not always been popular.  There is, however, more realism among the Irish people than is sometimes reflected in the House.  They will see that curbing national expenditure is the first step to national recovery towards tax equity and the creation of jobs for the 250,000 of our people who now rot on the unemployment lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The restoration of the national economic confidence has been the second major achievement of the Government.  Bringing public expenditure under control is fundamental to limiting the nation's borrowing requirements. Limiting our borrowing requirements is, in turn, fundamental to curbing interest rates.  Interest rates, in turn, are the key catalyst in creating investment, jobs and the growth we need.  Our interest rates are still far too high.  They are, however, responding to the Government's policies and further improvements can be anticipated in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>A second measure of the reawakening of national ecomomic confidence is the growing signs of a return to stability in the money market which is evidenced in the reversal of last year's outflow of funds.  A third measure is the continued decline in inflation now at its lowest level for 20 years.  The victory which is being recorded in the war on inflation by the last and the present Administration will mean a growth in our competitiveness, a return of economic justice for those who live on fixed incomes and real increases for the people who must depend on social welfare for their living.</P>
      <P>Another area of progress is in sectoral policies.  The Government have initiated a quiet revolution in Irish industrial policy.  Based on the development of indigenous manufacturing and new growth sectors the aim of the new orientation it to build on the skills of our people, to build on the native capacities of our people and on the limited material resources we possess.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that.  Had we followed the proposal to cut back £330 <Col N="4029" /> million, had we cut back on housing, done away with mortgage interest subsidy, I wonder what the Irish building industry would be like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish building and construction industry will be the very first to benefit from the cutbacks in interest rates and from the vigour that is returning to our economy and, again, no thanks to the party Deputy Quill represents.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the changes that are taking place on the sectoral side.  However, there are a number of elements on which I should like to touch.  The emphasis in Government policy on the food sector, and, in particular, on food processing, is most welcome.  Up to now our concentration has been on production, allowing valueadded and the jobs to slip to other economies. In the run-up to the election Fianna Fáil emphasised the importance of food processing and horticulture.  The first fruits of changed emphasis are visible in the Goodman Group venture in meat processing.  It is very sad that this major national initiative being taken by an indigenous firm should find carping criticism from the benches opposite.</P>
      <P>Another specific sector emphasised by Fianna Fáil prior to the election was the vast potential of Ireland's marine resources.  The action has been swift here.  A new Department of the Marine has been established replacing no fewer than 14 other agencies which dealt with, and I would suggest stifled, marine development.  Another welcome change already effected by the Government has been the extension of the business enterprise scheme and the 10 per cent corporation profits tax to the shipping industry.  As Arklow Shipping is now the largest Irish shipping company, I see these initiatives as particularly welcome and I wish the Minister all speed with the anticipated shipping investment legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4030" /> In horticulture, science policy and forestry the Government have also been quick to act.  The establishment of an interim Bord Glas and the decision to extend the gas pipeline to service the horticultural areas will help to achieve this Government's twin objectives of replacing food imports with native produce and winning export markets for the same produce.  The Government's determination to implement a full scale science and technology policy is particularly welcome.  Because of lack of any direction in the last Government, the biotechnology proposals which were put forward by the NBST and the IDA were allowed to gather dust on the shelves in Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>In the science budget the Government have, for the first time, elevated science and technology to a meaningful place in economic development.  I believe this is an area where this nation will progress. In the universities, in our third level institutions and in industry there is the capacity to create employment in the biotechnology area.  This is one area where we lead the world and we should be rightly proud of this.  The Government should be congratulated on elevating that important area to the position of having a specific science budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we should reverse the 3 per cent cuts for the universities for the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was in favour of a different type of progress in education.  On the Estimates, I already welcomed the Government's initiative in forestry.  The decision to establish a commercial State body dedicated to forestry is a major step forward which has rightly been welcomed by all sides of the House. Ireland has enormous potential in forestry. Europe is hungry for forest products. The potential has never been realised, and could never be realised, within the Civil Service structure.  In congratulating the Minister of State with responsibility for the State body dealing with forestry, I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his swift action <Col N="4031" /> on Coolattin and to give him a timely reminder of Wicklow's claim for the siting of the new forest body's headquarters.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Government on the initiative taken on the Dublin financial services sector.  In spite of carping criticism, this is a major move forward but it is a step that should have been taken five or even ten years ago.  Other cities in Europe which have taken similar steps have seen progress as a result in the medium and longer term. I believe this decision may well prove to be one of the most inspired taken by any Government in this State.  We have undoubted capacity in this area.  We have a young population which is highly computer-literate, highly literate in accountancy and in other financial management skills.  Our third level institutions contribute magnificently in this regard.  It is a tragedy for this nation that these young people are at present applying their skills elsewhere but hopefully when the financial services centre is under way we will see a reversal in the emigration trend and some of those who have enhanced their skills abroad will return to enhance the wealth and well being of this nation.</P>
      <P>The final area is institutional reform. The Government have made some major steps forward in the institutional area which have not been properly recognised. The Department of the Public Service have been rolled back into the Department of Finance and I see that as a major improvement.  As far back as 1979 I pointed out that the Department of the Public Service could achieve none of their objectives because of their structure and the fact that they were dedicated to control rather than to moving ahead and progressing with public service reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not much control in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Public Service have had a good run at the experiment but they have failed, and therefore it is right and appropriate that they should be wound back into Finance. <Col N="4032" /> However, I hope progress in the general area of public service reform would not take a back seat in Finance but that it would receive the attention it deserves.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned the creation of the Department of the Marine.  This is one of the most important departmental innovations made since the foundation of the State.  Our marine resources are infinitely vaster than our land resources and it is very difficult to understand why all the Administrations to date have failed to appreciate that.  It is good that that oversight has been redressed.</P>
      <P>Tourism has wandered in the last ten or 15 years from Department to Department like one of the lost tribes and it is good that it has now found a departmental home and a strong Cabinet voice.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the new role that has been found for Ministers of State.  This is progress.  The dedication of Ministers of State as a task force with responsibility for individual sectors of the community is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The re-establishment of decentralisation as Government policy is also to be welcomed.  As I said before inside and outside this House, we have one of the most extraordinarily centralised Administrations in any of the 24 developed nations in the OECD.  I hope this decentralisation will not simply concentrate on moving part of a Department here and an office there, but that we will be looking at the beginning of real decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last two weeks, wearing another hat, I have been passing judgment on the performance of students and classes.  Were I to look at this House I would see some hope and a lot of despair.  I see despair in the performance of the minor parties.  I feel some sadness at the departure in recent days of Fine Gael from the very constructive view of Opposition which they were taking.  I see hope in the contributions which have been made here in the last 24 hours by the Leader of the Opposition, and more recently by Deputy Kelly.  I do not share Deputy Kelly's view on the concept of a CDU/CSU type union between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and I doubt if there <Col N="4033" /> are many people in Fine Gael who share this view.  The reality of this House is that the only course which can prevent this Government from continuing to re-establish the wealth and wellbeing of this nation is irresponsible Opposition.  I would suggest to Members of this House that we have wasted more than enough time in this session in irresponsible Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not nonsense when you see the time we have wasted walking into the division lobbies to decide petty points.  There is a better way and that is to have a constructive type of Opposition from the benches opposite. This Government have made very real progress in a very short time.  It is up to the Members of the House to support the Government in the continuation of that progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a problem in regard to time and I will be as brief as possible.  It is extraordinary that Deputy Roche could make that speech while keeping a straight face.  It was a remarkable performance and deserves an Oscar. He seemed to have a very big hang up about the Progressive Democrats and what he called their library of policy documents.  It ill behoves Deputy Roche or any one in Fianna Fáil to criticise any party for producing policy documents. On reflection, perhaps it does not come ill from them because Fianna Fáil obviously have an allergy to anything resembling a policy document and seemed incapable in Opposition of formulating any policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take him up on the wonderful things that Fianna Fáil are about to do for science and technology. In the presence of the Minister of State for that area, I should like to say that the imposition of the extraordinarily crude <Col N="4034" /> cuts in the pay and non-pay areas of the RTCs, NIHEs and the universities, suddenly landed with enormous cuts in their budgets at a time when student numbers are rising by 4 per cent to 5 per cent, makes me wonder how Fianna Fáil can talk about science and technology when they left the third level area breathless.</P>
    <P>I tried very hard to dig out any vestige of Fianna Fáil policy on education when they were in Opposition, any vestige of preparedness for taking up Government, but all I could find was one slim pamphlet on primary education which was launched by the Taoiseach and the then spokesperson on education, Deputy O'Rourke.  The whole thing deservedly sank without trace because there was nothing in it.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare &mdash; the Minister of State knows what I am talking about &mdash; nothing of any originality was heard from Fianna Fáil in Opposition except constant demands for more spending. I note that the Minister for Social Welfare has been trumpeting about the Jobsearch programme.  However, that whole concept was launched by me as Minister.  It was piloted by the last Government and has no trace of Fianna Fáil input.  There has also been a deafening silence on the very important work of establishing, definitively, the extent of abuse of the system.  When I was Minister I was extremely concerned about the allegations of abuse and the difficulties there were in detailing its extent.  Independent experts were appointed from Craig Gardner to report on the abuse but we have heard no more about it.  I promised that it would receive a full, public disclosure when it was completed but, as I said, we have not heard anything about it, which shows the extraordinary vacuum existing in Fianna Fáil as they do not seem to be able to address their minds to formulating policies or to be ready for Government when they are in office.  That is one of the main reasons &mdash; apart from hypocrisy &mdash; for Fianna Fáil on coming to office talking calamitious decisions in a very hamfisted way because they have not studied the areas in advance.</P>
    <P>There is now an extraordinary situation <Col N="4035" /> in the Dáil and many Members are reeling from the shocks of recent months where a minority Government struggled to overcome genuinely severe economic problems, interestingly enough, largely caused by themselves.  When they were in Government previously and then in Opposition, Fianna Fáil refused to acknowledge those economic problems. Indeed, in Government, they actively exacerbated those problems by increasing expenditure in every area, and in Opposition, called for increased expenditure by votes at every possible opportunity in the Dáil.  In other days, when the situation was less serious, those tactics might have been described as the normal political antics of an Opposition but Fianna Fáil did not behave normally. They were grossly irresponsible in their four years in Opposition as the Taoiseach and his Front Bench knew exactly and in detail our dire financial circumstances. Their behaviour, therefore, can only be interpreted as a cynical manipulation of different interest groups with only one aim in mind &mdash; power.  Anybody looking at this country from different parts of Europe must consider us extraordinarily immature because in other countries, when there is a financial crisis, politicians and parties co-operate in the national interest.  That is a concept which Fianna Fáil in Opposition cannot take on board as they do not know what it means.</P>
    <P>For example, it seems only like yesterday that Fianna Fáil were in full cry in this House from these benches &mdash; February 1986 &mdash; baying for full payment of £75 million to teachers.  The gallery was packed with their supporters who listened to wonderful speeches appealing to all sides of the House to recognise the arbitrator's award.  I remember Deputy Wilson saying that Fianna Fáil would pay the award in full.  Recently I inquired in the Dáil what had become of that assurance to teachers and I was told that, as the teachers had not asked for a meeting to discuss it, it did not arise.  Anybody listening to the full scale Opposition to the Government motion that day in the Dáil could be forgiven for expecting <Col N="4036" /> Deputy O'Rourke on coming to office to have rushed to the unions immediately clutching the cheque in her hand as Deputy Wilson did in 1980 under direct instructions from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>At that time, when the Taoiseach instructed the then Minister for Education to give in fully to all the teachers' demands without any productivity arrangements it became known as the night of the £60 million.  That was the sort of action taken by the Government party which laid the foundation for so many of the problems with which the country is trying to deal.  I distinctly remember at that time &mdash; and hearing it confirmed subsequently &mdash; that the teacher unions were astonished at being given the sudden bonanza.  School managements were dumbfounded because £60 million had been given out without any agreement in the form of productivity or changes in teaching practice.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and Fianna Fáil have only one reason for being able to govern even remotely responsibly, that is, the different attitude taken by Fine Gael as the major Opposition party.  Our motive now, as it was when we were in Government, is in the national interest. That is a difficult concept for Fianna Fáil to grasp and a hard role politically for our party but one which we see as necessary for the future of the country.  How much anguish and how many billions could have been saved if Fianna Fáil had taken the same attitude in Opposition for the last four years?  It is a pity that that kind of responsibility is so far removed from the Fianna Fáil philosophy.</P>
    <P>As a Minister in the previous Government I am very proud at having played a part in forcing Fianna Fáil to the point where they are beginning to govern responsibly.  I am proud to have been part of the team which set an agenda which dominates economic thinking now and proud that in doing so we may at last see the country breaking through to some stability, to some progress and a common sense of purpose for all the Irish people. Our support, of course, is qualified by our decision, made clear by our Finance spokesperson, Deputy Noonan, on 21 <Col N="4037" /> March, to monitor carefully the actions and decisions of the Government.  We have shown our disagreement with many of the changes made in our budget of January 31 and will continue to press for changes in those areas.  We also intend to keep Fianna Fáil's nose to the grindstone to make sure that their Leader does not revert to the lamentable lack of courage he has shown on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>As Opposition spokesperson on Education, I see it as my role to continue to expose inadequacies where I find them and particularly to expose the attempt of the Government and the Minister for Education to hide the cuts they have carried out, cuts made right across the board.  I shall encourage the Minister to tackle the great areas needing reform urgently &mdash; the post primary curriculum, the jumble of conflict between second level schools, the need to give autonomy to RTCs, the drive forward needed in modern continental language teaching and that of other languages.  In addition there is a range of other areas where the Department of Education need to break through to new thinking and where the groundwork has been well and truly done by the previous Government.  We have had a lamentable attempt to hide cuts that have been made in Education, cuts which are obviously made, as I said earlier, because of the appalling lack of preparation for Government by Fianna Fáil in opposition.</P>
    <P>In a parliamentary question I tried to get the Minister to tell us exactly how many traveller centres had been cut in their budget.  The answer that I got was that the Minister was not aware of any such cut.</P>
    <P>I had to point out in a recent statement that the following traveller centres have had the following cuts: Offaly, 100 per cent gone from the support of the State to the travellers' training centre; St. Kieran's in Bray, 40 per cent gone; Navan traveller centre, 60 per cent gone; Carlow traveller centre, 10 per cent gone and Mayo traveller centre, 10 per cent gone. There is a threat hanging over the City and County of Dublin VEC areas for travelling children and some of these <Col N="4038" /> areas are the only areas where travelling children get any post-primary opportunity at all.  I found it extraordinary that I was told in answer to a parliamentary question that the Minister was unaware of any of these cuts.  I find it even more extraordinary that on 21 June the Minister for Education should say on the radio that no disadvantaged student would suffer as a result of cutbacks.  That sort of hasty statement, I have to say, is a dishonest attempt to conceal what is going on.  It is not acceptable and should not be acceptable from any Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto there is a section on Education which is entitled &ldquo;Planning for Education&rdquo;.  It has already emerged that no planning whatsoever has been done, or, sadly, appears about to be done.  The promise in the manifesto was:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will put back into education a clear sense of direction based on sound long term planning. </P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister and the Government seem to be unaware that the long term planning which was done in the term of the previous Government is there waiting for them to use.  It is well documented in the programme for action published in January 1984 and scrupulously reported on each year as to its progress, something that very few Governments have ever done. The programme was written after exhaustive and repeated discussions with every single group in education and, much further afield, with the social partners.  It resulted in a step by step implementation of the recommendations of that action group, for example, ages for learning and, that most important feature which has now been scrapped by this Government, the transition year.  The Green Paper <i>Partners in Education</i> was quite offensively dismissed by Fianna Fáil last week in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The introduction of full oral examinations in modern languages as an essential pre-requisite to expanding our young people's knowledge of these languages is <Col N="4039" /> an area where an initiative needs to be taken and taken rapidly.  The Minister for Education should, as a matter or urgency, go to Europe with her colleagues to see how help can be got for the setting up of these excellent training centres in modern continental languages. It is quite clear with the cut back in teaching allocations the Minister is engaged in at the moment that the phrase she has used about expanding the teaching of modern continental languages is empty. Therefore it is going to need some other resources and it seems that if we really got down to using the European resources that are there for us, we could establish across this country excellent modern continental language training centres.  It is the least we could do for the young people.</P>
    <P>I would support most strongly the concept of using the facilities of Carysfort College for modern continental teaching, for the training not only of students but of teachers.  I regret that after more than 100 days there is a deafening silence from the Minister, who promised to reinstate Carysfort College.  These advances in modern continental language teaching are vital and urgent.  It is scandalous that only under 4 per cent of our young people at second level are learning German.  I thought it was scandalous when I was Minister for Education and still think so. The oral examinations have improved matters slightly.  Now we have a problem where the Government have decided to cut down so much on teaching numbers that we cannot possibly embark on a programme of expansion.</P>
    <P>Most serious of all is the Minister's refusal to consider establishing a Curriculum Examinations Board on a statutory basis, despite the categoric assurance in the Fianna Fáil policy manifesto before the election in this regard.  I find the Minister's reluctance to embark on that initiative quite extraordinary.  The work of that board has already set in place an agenda for the Minister and that is ready for implementation.  Most urgent is the change to the new junior cycle <Col N="4040" /> curriculum and the accompanying assessment system which would replace the intermediate and group certificate examinations. These have long since outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an extraordinary fear of progress in the education area on the part of this Government.  Quite clearly, the reason Fine Gael planned step by step progress in education, the reason the last Government designed and printed the action programme was that we knew of the crisis in finances.  We were aware of the demographic pressures in education.  We were also aware that because of the demographic pressures and the financial crisis we would have to make careful plans to be able to improve and revitalise the system.  That cannot be delayed.  It must be done and can be done by a Minister who cares enough about our young people and who can motivate people working in education to come with her so that changes can be made without great additional expenditure.  It seems that we are now facing a serious crisis in education because of the <i>ad hoc</i> crude nature of the cuts, cuts which people fear will be greatly increased, cuts which are going on in a vacuum of policy because of the Government's failure to study, to plan and to fill in the blanks in their minds in this area.  I will conclude because I appreciate that people are waiting to speak.</P>
    <P>I will echo the words of the leader of my party by asking the Government to use the proceeds of the national lottery wisely and to make good the funding to the arts which we had outlined in our White Paper on the Arts produced before the election.  The arts need a great deal more funding.  We had planned that the national lottery would solve the problem of the underfunding of the arts.  There is an explosion of talented young people in every area, in music, singing, dancing, the visual arts and in acting.  The Taoiseach, so proud of his status as patron of the arts, could do something for the arts by steering a great deal of funding in that direction.  I add my voice to that of Deputy Dukes in this request.</P>

      <P>I will oblige.  I am anxious to allow as many people to contribute as possible.  The Adjournment Debate has opened up quite a hypocritical argument for many people in relation to holidays and in relation to the amount of business still to be done. Only this morning on the Order of Business the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance wanted to know about the confirmation Bill in relation to the banning of below cost selling and the bad practice in relation to hello money.  That order was signed and placed before the Oireachtas on 29 May.  There is a debate as to whether or not a confirmation Bill is necessary.  To ensure that no loopholes are left that Bill will be introduced here early in the next session.  The Bill is retrospective to the date on which that order was signed.</P>
      <P>That is just one example of what could have been done had all the disputes that went on here last week not taken place. Time and time again we had to come into this House to vote on wrangles.  I can best describe it as progressive disturbance of the House.  When I hear the hypocritical calls from the party who are supposed to be straightening out our finances I am angered.  If one were to accept their policies as expounded during the general election campaign, their cuts would be so draconian that they would probably provoke a social revolution.  Yet they are taking up a hypocritical stance in opposing cuts.  It is time the House discarded the veil of hypocrisy that some people have taken on.  I will not even comment on the Fine Gael position.  They obviously miscalculated.  They thought they could have the best of both worlds and it did not turn out that way.  I will leave them to sort it out for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time since we came to <Col N="4042" /> office we have demonstrated our determination to revitalise the economy and reverse the uncertainty and lack of direction evidenced under the previous Administration. In effect, we are taking up where we left off in 1982.  The short term Fianna Fáil Government of 1982 were really the first Government to confront expenditure over-runs.  We succeeded for the first time in many years.  At the end of 1982 we had not alone contained expenditure within budgetary limits but we spent £50 million less than had been budgeted for.  No Government since then have got anywhere near it.  We took tough decisions again in the recent budget.  We are on a firm corrective course and we intend to stay on that course.  Should the ship steer slightly off course during the latter part of this year, appropriate action will be taken.  We proved that we could do it in 1982 and we intend to prove it again.</P>
    <P>It amazes me to hear Opposition speakers infer that the jury is still out, that there are doubts as to whether or not we have the ability.  The people making those accusations should know that it is impossible to manage a Government Department when, because we are a Minority Government every Minister has to keep running in and out of the House attending to one vote after another.  After three short months in office we need time to stay in the Department and take action on the priorities we have set ourselves. That is the only way in which we can get time to think out new policies and pursue the developmental objectives we have set ourselves.  We cannot do that while being hauled in here eight, nine or ten times a day to vote on petty wrangles on the Order of Business such as happened last week.   Progressive disturbance has ensured that some of the things that could have been done have not materialised in this session and the blame can rest where it belongs.</P>
    <P>In our budget strategy we have started to do the things that everybody knows must be done.  We made unpopular, difficult decisions but they were necessary for the revitalisation of this economy. Much of the opposition to the health cuts <Col N="4043" /> was orchestrated by fringe elements. Inevitably there will be some hardship but we must realise that the savings to be made this year have to be made in a seven month period when they would normally be spread over 12 months.  The people in the House know that.  It does not matter what type of opposition they put up to our strategy, we will continue to rectify the imbalances in the economy.  We will stay on course.  Our course was tested a few times since we came in and people are free to do that, but if they want to pull down this Government they will be pulling down a Government on a corrective course starting to restore hope and confidence in this economy and getting rid of the despair and disillusionment that were rampant when we came into Government.  If they do that they are not interested in the future wellbeing of this country and they are not interested in playing their part in what should be a co-operative effort to put the economy back on a proper footing.</P>

The decision is that the venue should be the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and the ceremonies should take roughly the same form as last year.  The parties are all agreed on that.  Deputy O'Malley felt that the Garden of Remembrance was a suitable venue and he would have preferred that the ceremonies should have been held there again this year.  However, because the other parties <Col N="4044" /> are all in general agreement he does not wish to make any objection.  The ceremonies will go ahead in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on 12 July and will follow generally the same pattern as last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to give details of the Supplementary Estimate which Deputies have asked me to do in the course of my short address to the House.  It is well known and recognised, and is part of our <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i> that we were going to put strong emphasis on research and development.  In regard to the carrying out of that commitment, we <Col N="4045" /> all recognise we need to strengthen and make much better use of R and D structures to enable Irish firms and Irish products to attain an increasing percentage of the keenly competitive world of marketing in both goods and services.  Therefore, it is in that context that I will provide the details of the allocations made under the new subhead Y which has been included for the first time in my departmental Estimate.</P>
      <P>A provision of £1.18 million will be made for essential equipment in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Microelectronics Research Centre.  The provision to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will enable it to acquire much needed test equipment to give Irish industry a range of services needed in today's circumstances.  Some of this equipment will be new to the institute and more of it will replace equipment that is now long out of date.  Some of the equipment with which the IIRS is working today is so far out of date that it takes a day to complete a test which a modern piece of equipment could complete in a few minutes.  This is the area of up-dating our technological infrastructure that is so vital if we are to take on board the new technologies that are available in the world today.</P>
      <P>The programme for technological innovation encompasses a number of new initiatives.  One of these is an expansion of the so-called teaching companies programme. This new programme subsidises the placement in industry of well qualified graduates in engineering and in science. These graduates will maintain links with their parent institution and the programme provides for support from that parent institution to the graduate in respect of research and development matters arising during his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further element under this programme will be the expansion of the higher education-industry co-operation scheme, administered by the NBST.  This programme as its name implies, supports joint research projects in which both industry and universities participate.  My intention is to broaden this programme <Col N="4046" /> and to enable our research institutes such as the IIRS and the Agricultural Research Institute to participate in joint projects with industry.  Under this heading I will also provide funding to the National Microelectronics Research Centre to assist industry in developing ASICS &mdash; application specific integrated circuits.  The trend in the electronics industry worldwide is towards the use of these application specific integrated circuits for the simple reason that when an integrated circuit is designed specifically for one application the result is better performance, less supporting circuitry, and hence a cheaper and more competitive product.</P>
    <P>The third main theme under this new science and technology development programme is the establishment of programmes in biotechnology and in advanced manufacturing technology.  I cannot understand why the previous Government failed to recognise the important role biotechnology can play in new developments.  I was amazed to find there was no provision made for proper adjudication on the corporate tax structure of biotechnological projects.  Many approaches had been made to the previous Government but they did not recognise the significance of these projects. The importance of these projects was made clear to me very shortly before the Finance Bill was printed and circulated and I am glad to say that my colleague, Deputy Ray MacSharry, responded to this approach to give Ireland the opportunity to develop in the biotechnological area.  Anybody who knows anything about the real world will know that companies were not prepared to invest when they did not know what their likely corporate tax would be.  The Minister for Finance put a definition into the Finance Bill so that the 10 per cent corporate tax will apply to biotechnology developments in the area of plants.  The view of the Revenue Commissioners was that plants are not living matter and as such the 50 per cent corporate tax would apply.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national biotechnological programme in particular <Col N="4047" /> has been awaited for some time.  We lost three good biotechnological projects to another European country simply and solely because there was no biotechnological infrastructure in place in any of our institutes of education.</P>
    <P>The Government have now established phase I of a national programme and funding will be provided in 1987 to three university centres &mdash; University College, Cork, for food biotechnology and to UCG and NIHE, Dublin, for work in the diagnostics-cell-culture fields.  These particular disciplines within biotechnology have been selected for funding under phase I of the programme because they are the most promising areas for rapid product development.  A director of the biotechnology programme will be appointed in the near future and will be mandated to prepare a programme of action for 1988.  I should also add that the advanced manufacturing technology programme is being initiated in four university centres this year, in UCD, in TCD, in NIHE, Limerick, and in UCG.  There will be a number of appointments under both of these programmes in the centres in question.  All the appointments made will be on a contractual basis and will focus on securing the appointment of individuals who can liaise between the industrial world on the one hand and the third level institutions on the other.</P>
    <P>If there is one unifying theme running through the various schemes which I have just outlined it is the identification of ways and means of improving the scientific and technological skills in industry in this country which have been badly lacking for many years.  Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Irish manufacturing industry today is to take advantage of the new technologies available &mdash; information technology; biotechnology; advanced manufacturing technology and developments in new materials.  These new developments are bringing about a revolution in product development and in the practice of manufacture world wide.  I see this new programme as an essential <Col N="4048" /> step in insuring that Ireland keeps pace with these developments.</P>
    <P>The National Software Centre was established by the Industrial Development Authority in 1984.  I have provided £600,000 out of the reallocated funds in the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote to this centre and I would like to assure the House that this is purely a reallocation of funds and entails no extra money on the Exchequer.  It is another demonstration of the Government's commitment and conviction that we have to seek better value for money in the areas in which we are spending it and we have to spend our scarce resources in the areas which will complement the type of development we have specified as not alone necessary and essential but offering the best hope for the development of indigenous Irish industry.</P>
    <P>My duty and priority in the Department of Industry and Commerce is to take the opportunity when the Dáil is in recess to set down and rewrite certain aspects of our strategy for industrial development.  We can always learn lessons from failures or mistakes that have been made in the past.  The failure of Hyster has focused in on what can happen and the high risk that is involved in international investment.  By its very nature industrial development and investment is a risky business but we should not think that because we have had failures now and again the area should be abandoned.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the success rate as against the failure rate.  The success rate of US investment coming to Ireland for the past five to six years is shown in the region of a 4 per cent to 5 per cent failure rate as against a 5.9 per cent failure rate in indigenous industry.  Let us balance the debate.  It was despicable to see a former Minister for Industry and Commerce and a former Minister for Finance try to raise this question, out of total hypocrisy, because I could not label it as anything else.  Four and a half years after the event he said he knew that the project was wrong in the first place, he knew that the wrong decisions had been made.  He sat in Government for four and a half years <Col N="4049" /> as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Finance and he expects the people to believe that he could sit there on a decision which was made prior to his taking office, when one could reasonably argue as to whether it was legally in place at the time he took office, but not a word was uttered.  He opened the factory and gave it all the praise in the world and four and a half years later when something goes wrong he says &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  That is poor form for any Irish politician.</P>
    <P>Hyster was a setback but the House should remember that it was recommended in the Telesis report for industrial strategy and industrial development as a company coming in with all its key functions.  It is for the company itself to explain why it failed.  Quite clearly from what I saw at the end, and from what I knew at the beginning, there was a complete shift in the development of marketing strategy.  Instead of developing a whole marketing structure in Ireland to sell what would be a new product for the nineties in robotics and high racking storage.  it was left to agents around the world who were normal sellers of conventional forklift trucks. That was a weakness.  There was also a leverage management buy-out in 1984 and I have little doubt that that contributed in its own way towards the financial pressures which could come in any company in the earlier years after a leverage management buy-out.  We all know that if we could build a stronger indigenous industrial development structure that would be the best long term development.  We cannot ignore the fact that we need international investment but we need to be more selective about it.  The areas I should like to point to for priority in the future will be those of data processing and software development. The recent Government decision to establish a financial services centre in the Custom House Dock site in Dublin is a clear indication of where our priorities lie and marched side by side with every possible development in indigenous Irish industry, and the food sector was the obvious one to start with.</P>
    <P>The questions which were raised by a <Col N="4050" /> former Minister for Industry and Commerce were despicable to say the least. A man who had a proven track record for many years, who has penetrated the export markets of the world, was begrudged the smallest grant ever given to anybody in the food sector, because he was so successful.  We are very flaithiúl in approving grants for foreign multinationals coming into this country but we despise and begrudge our own.  That is part of the problems of this society, that success is despised.</P>
    <P>I hope in the term of this Government we will create a better atmosphere for investment.  The decisions we are taking are tough and they point in the right direction.  Interest rates have come down but not as fast as we would wish to see them come down.  The report of the Central Bank augurs well for the future and we can hope to see more reductions in interest rates over the coming six or seven months.  Not alone would that encourage more investment and set the climate for more investment but it would also have its own spin-off for people who have mortgages.</P>
    <P>I heard people with bleeding hearts and politicians from the other side of the House referring to taking 10 per cent off the mortgage interest relief.  They know full well that when you reduce interest rates by 1 per cent or 1¼ per cent you give back the same benefit that was taken. Are we ever going to wake up and realise that the world does not owe us a living, that the Government cannot provide the services which were available in the past until, in the first instance, we get the finances of this State into order and at the same time get economic growth going in this country?  There is no other way forward.  The road to success is export led growth and import substitution.  In that regard we have taken another innovative decision in setting up export trading houses to correct an acute weakness that is part and parcel of the failure of Irish indigenous industry to get into the export markets.  I hope that innovation will be taken up.</P>
    <P>I have instituted and, only two weeks ago, opened the first office abroad in <Col N="4051" /> Lexington, Boston, for group marketing for small Irish companies.  Five Irish companies now come together, share the office, the overheads and they have a share in the marketplace.  That is the type of innovation seen from this Government, more can be expected and more will be heard from us during the summer holidays than has been heard in the past three months.  We will take advantage of that time to do the job that some parties in this House tried to ensure we could not do as Ministers during the last four to six weeks.  They were more interested in petty politicking than letting us get on with the business of managing the economy.</P>

      <P>Like the Chair I want to thank the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Hussey for their considerate sharing of time, which indeed is limited, but I can assure you that that will not restrain me.</P>
      <P>The performance of the Minister and many of his colleagues strikes me as the type of performance we get from &ldquo;born again Christians&rdquo;.  I have sat through the past four years and defended myself against attacks and assaults both inside and outside the House.  The consistency of the Opposition was that nothing was right, it was monetarist, it was Thatcherite &mdash; those words seems to have lost meaning during the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology to anybody for my conduct in this House.  I respect the office of Ceann Comhairle and the incumbents at any particular time and the way business has to be conducted in this House. The shenanigans &mdash; as it has been described by the Minister and other speakers today &mdash; the performance of the Labour Party and other parties has been unavoidable because of the failure of the Whips of the two major parties to structure the business of this House in a fair manner.  I have written to the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle in the last 24 <Col N="4052" /> hours pointing this out.  I believe that unless we come to grips with the ordering of business the situation will be chaotic in the autumn.  I hope this House will resume in September because there are many serious issues facing us and I hope we can order our business better.  The Minister and many speakers from his party were talking about the bounce, excitement and the confidence which is on the streets.  I wonder if, during the last four months, they realised what they were doing and what the effects will be. They have increased the PAYE burden by 15 per cent and abolished the farm tax.  They are in the process of sacking almost 4,000 health workers.  They have doubled the waiting list for health care. They make the poor pay for getting sick. They have cut many workers' rights in half.  They have frozen children's allowances. They have abolished home purchase and improvement grants.  They have increased council rents and charges. They have broken pay agreements which they were going to honour in full &mdash; in fact they were going to double them last year.  They have abolished local services, sacked workers and done many more things besides.</P>
    <P>Is this the better way which the posters around the country last year indicated?  Is that the better way Fianna Fáil were talking about, the better way they promised the electorate?  Many thousands of people who voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election were perhaps expecting, in their naivety, a better way as has been referred to by the Taoiseach. They were voting for a party who said they cared, who were going to make the economy grow.  They wanted a party who would put people back to work and not out of work as is happening.</P>
    <P>The U-turns on policy form quite a litany at this stage.  There were U-turns on the economy, on PAYE reform, on growth, on the building industry.  We could not count on one or two hands the number of bricks thrown at us in this House in relation to the poor building industry for the past four years; it seems to have been forgotten completely in the last four months.  We have had U-turns <Col N="4053" /> on the cuts in public expenditure, on the Single European Act, on the Anglo-Irish Agreement and indeed on constitutional reform.  The Taoiseach proudly has led his gallant band across the ploughed fields of Ireland in the last four months.  Of course Fianna Fáil were in Opposition then and they are now looking for responsible Opposition.  Just like Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats Fianna Fáil in office believe they can only recover by attacking the weaker sections of our society and by cutting the worker's rights in half, as they have done.  This is what we have seen in the last four months of the Fianna Fáil Party's actions in Government but it hardly does justice to the despicably unfair nature of their approach.  What is most unfair about it, more unfair even than the individual components of the savage attack enshrined in Fianna Fáil's series of U-turns is that the Government who are putting it forward do not believe in the approach they are taking.  If it even reflected some hint of Fianna Fáil Party ideology, I would say it had some hint or shade of integrity, but ideology appears to be an alien word in the Fianna Fáil language.  This package has only one purpose &mdash; to capture the arrogant and unfeeling philosophy of the plastic alliance of the Right wing parties.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil knew when they were preparing their budget that the more savage the attack they mounted on the rights of working people, the more support they would have from Fine Gael and the PDs. Their calculation is proving to be correct, but that was not difficult, since the Right wing parties have never made any secret of their callous philosphy.  They can see now that they had been caught somewhat with their pants down &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; and it is interesting, if unedifying, to watch them at constituency level trying to put distance between themselves and the policies they support in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>The sad spectacle of the last days in this House, when the conspiracy between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil reached new depths, has reduced the practice of parliamentary opposition to meaningless <Col N="4054" /> proportions.  We in this House will have only ourselves to blame if people take to the streets in ever increasing numbers over the coming months, as the destruction of the health services is accompanied by the dismantling of equality of opportunity in education and by the disappearance of many local services which are an essential part of the fabric of community life.  If people cannot look to the Opposition to provide meaningful and rational alternatives to the mindless cutters and destroyers on the Government side they will have to look to their own resources.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may well exult in the fractures he has caused among the Opposition parties, with the naive assistance of Fine Gael.  But he should not be deluded &mdash; the political parties on this side of the House may be divided but there is a growing anger and resentment among the huge community of ordinary families who are outside this House.  The Taoiseach's financial backers may be pleased at his performance, but the pain and suffering he is causing will not easily be forgotten by the great mass of people who believed they were voting for something worthwhile &mdash; for hope and maybe for some imagination &mdash; when they voted for him.  One should take stock of what happened on the streets of Dublin and of most of the larger towns during the past few days and on Wednesday of this week. The scale of the numbers on the streets in opposition to the Government's health policy speaks for itself.  The Government would need to take note of what is happening. The nursing staffs, the people working in hospitals and their union &mdash; in a very orderly manner &mdash; were portraying their disgust and their fears about what the Government are doing in relation to the provision of an adequate health service.</P>
    <P>As the effects and consequences of Fianna Fáil's 1987 budget unfold, it is becoming clearer that it is a savage and merciless document.  It has been said that one of the first marks of a civilised society is that it affords to the sick and the disadvantaged the basic human right of a measure of dignity.  By that standard, a <Col N="4055" /> society run by Fianna Fáil, with the support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats will not be civilised.</P>
    <P>In one fell swoop the budget began the process of dismantling the fabric of a society that was moving slowly and painfully towards being a progressive one. The cuts in social welfare, health and education, will result in a divided society, in greater poverty, and in the resurrection of inequality even in areas where it had begun to disappear.</P>
    <P>There are no saving graces in the 1987 budget.  It does not attempt to address in any way the massive problem of inequity in our taxation system.  It ignores &mdash; indeed, it will make worse &mdash; the growing scandal of emigration.  Not only does it lack basic compassion, it also lacks imagination and is totally devoid of courage.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech, I tried to make the point that one of the illusions this Government have tried to foster is that they are attempting to pursue economic growth and are using the National Economic and Social Council's recent report on this subject as a guide.  I believe strongly that it is necesary to explode this illusion, because it is not possible to build the consensus necessary for a concerted surge of economic growth without a basic commitment to fairness that would sustain that consensus.</P>
    <P>As I said, you can search the financial programme of this Government from top to bottom, without finding anywhere within it a shred of fairness.  That is a sad reflection on the present Government.</P>
    <P>It might well transpire that the Government are able to cobble together some kind of an agreement with unions, farmers and employers.  Indeed, I had high hopes that such a social contract might be possible but as things stand it will be a meaningless, short-term document, unable to sustain itself in the face of the inevitable pressures that will build up as the impact of the budget and of the Government's general approach begins to eat into the living standards of ordinary people, and to tear away at the rights to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="4056" /> Where is the fairness in the health charges, for instance?  How does any Government with even a shred of social conscience seek to justify a situation where all but the very poorest members of our society are expected to pay for a basic right, a right that has almost been enshrined as a guarantee for a generation? How can this be justified, while at the other end of the scale the Government are still giving full tax relief for the most expensive VHI plans to the wealthiest people in our community?</P>
    <P>Where is the fairness in closing down public hospitals, depriving women of vitally needed service, doubling waiting lists, sacking health workers in their thousands? How can this be regarded as fair, when private, luxury medicine is being encouraged to boom on the back of a massive State subsidy?</P>
    <P>Where is the fairness in the obscenity of women having to queue, in clinics intended for the treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases, for routine tests that can help to avoid cancer?</P>
    <P>And where is the fairness in the education cuts?  Despite the recent denials by the Minister for Education, it is abundantly clear that she intends to target the most disadvantaged sectors for her cuts, in order to avoid, as much as possible, taking any heat from the better organised pressure groups.  The children of travelling people, working class people who were availing of second-chance education are now the groups who must subsidise the children of wealthy parents as they attend their private schools.</P>
    <P>And it is clear now also that under the approach of this Government, access to third level education is going to become increasingly the preserve of the rich.  The thousands of students who are just completing their leaving certificate examinations in the fond belief that they may be able to go on to some form of third level education, are in for a rude awakening. They will discover in the very near future that the points they are aiming for in their examinations are hopelessly inadequate, because of the tremendous squeeze on places that will result from staffing cuts in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="4057" /> Where is the fairness in the abolition of the land tax?  That particular decision was a slap in the face for the thousands of PAYE workers who voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election; who voted for them because they believed the fine words and the promises about tax reform and about a reduction in the PAYE burden.  They have their answer now. The first consequence of the budget for PAYE workers was to increase the burden on them by perhaps 14 or 15 per cent.  And the second consequence will be to reduce even further the small contribution made by farmers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are consistent.  It is very much the same actions and axe they took in 1977 when they abolished the wealth tax.  This is more than unfair.  It is also absurd.  There is a very substantial number of farmers in this country who believe that the land tax was a fair way of dealing with the whole issue of farm taxation.  I believe that they are probably the majority of farmers.  But they are in the main small farmers, not the ranchers who have led the campaign against the land tax and who previously led a campaign against the rates on farming and who will continue to use their very considerable muscle to frustrate any attempt to extract any kind of contribution from them towards the solving of this country's financial problems.</P>
    <P>Where is the fairness in the cuts that have been made in social welfare?  Rights that people have paid for for all of their working lives are cut in half at the stroke of a pen or in some cases removed altogether. The worst crime in Ireland in the future will be to become unemployed.  If you lose your job in the society we are creating now, you will be doubly penalised &mdash; the loss of meaningful work in itself is not enough; you must now be regarded as a waster, as one who did not deserve the job you had.</P>
    <P>The Government have now set up a scheme which is closely modelled on schemes operating in some of the most backward and anti-social States in the United States of America.  There, it is known as Workfare but the public relations experts employed by this <Col N="4058" /> Government decided that was not a catchy enough title.  It did not cover up the real intent.  Therefore, they decided on the name Jobsearch.  It is difficult to imagine how anything could be less appropriate.  They also took a lead from the genius who decided that the way to deal with the huge problems caused by Windscale was to call it Sellafield.  Jobsearch has nothing to do with searching for jobs; in fact, it is quite the opposite. It is a search for the jobless, a programme designed to intimidate them into deciding not to claim the benefit to which they are entitled.  It ought to be a matter of shame to all of us that we are allowing this workhouse mentality to creep back into being.</P>

Let me say in conclusion that the Government are surviving by the least of margins and I can assure them that the intensity of the opposition which this party have exerted on them in the past few months will be continued.  Every action and every policy which this Government bring to the House will be examined in a very critical manner and we will continue to provide critical opposition.  I do not believe that what they are doing is in the best interests of our society.  In the short term, not to mention the long term, it will prove to be far more divisive than successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on a matter which, in my view, brought credit to this House and all parties in this House, that is, the whole matter of European affairs and the Single European Act on which a broad consensus emerged among a great majority in the House and eventually among the public, the national and international economic situation relevant to that and the measures taken today by the Government to achieve economic recovery within the ambit of our European membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4059" /> On Wednesday morning I met the Italian Foreign Minister and I lodged with the Italian Government our Instrument of Ratification of the Single European Act.  With that I deposited the Declaration by the Government on Article 13 and Title III of the Act which sets out the Government's position on economic and social cohesion and in regard to Ireland's policy of military neutrality, both areas that have a broad consensus of agreement here in the House.  I have written also to the Foreign Ministers of all our Community partners and to the President of the Commission informing them that we have deposited the Instrument of Ratification and transmitting to them the text of the Government Declaration.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act will come into effect throughout the Community on 1 July 1987, very shortly.  I am pleased that the matter has now been resolved following the prompt action of the Government in proposing a constitutional amendment to permit ratification of the Act and following on that the clear reaffirmation by the Irish people of their commitment to Ireland's membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act represents a challenge and an opportunity for Ireland and, indeed, for the Community as a whole in the years ahead.  Commitment and determination will be required to face that challenge and to seize that opportunity.  This Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are fully protected and promoted in the implementation of the Single European Act and in the development of the Community of which we remain a fully committed member.</P>
    <P>A number of discussions will now arise within the Community on basic issues such as the achievement of economic and social cohesion, the financing of the Community and the future of the CAP.  These are all matters of concern to Ireland. Having ratified the Act, we will remain as equals at the negotiating table within the Community, representing Ireland's <Col N="4060" /> interest and making, as Ireland always has done, a constructive contribution to the resolutions of the various important issues under discussion.</P>
    <P>The result of the referendum demonstrated that the Irish people remain fully committed to membership of the European Community and to our full participation in its future development.  The public debate on the issues provided an opportunity to examine and reflect on our position in the Community and in that respect was a positive aspect of the matter.  Seventy per cent of the voters decided that our continued full participation in the Community is in our best interests.  It is now up to the Government and the Irish people &mdash; whether, as politicians or farmers, as employers or trade unionists &mdash; to make the most of the opportunities of Community membership which have been enhanced by the Single European Act.  No one believes that membership of the Community can of itself provide a simple solution to all of the problems we face as a nation.  It is, however, clear &mdash; and the Irish people recognised this in the referendum &mdash; that it is only as a full and equal member of the European Community that we can best overcome those problems that face us in the social and economic spheres.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to some economic matters both on the national and international scene.  In considering the economic problems of the country, the perspective adopted by this Government is straightforward.  We are not just running an economy; we are governing a country.  There has been in recent years a corrosive and debilitating loss of confidence on the part of many Irish people in their own country and their own future generally and individually.  Much of the damage has been self-inflicted.  There would sometimes, it appears to me, seem to be in some quarters a peculiar vice which consists in a tendency to believe that everything will always work out for the worst of all possible worlds and that, if the other fellow thinks otherwise and wishes to do something about it, he is a fool to do so.  An important part of our task in Government is to change that <Col N="4061" /> attitude, overcome these self-defeating approaches to create a climate where imagination, incentive and optimism are encouraged and rewarded.  It is time to put an end to the sway which the begrudger and knocker holds over large parts of the public imagination.  In concrete terms, the Government have in a few short months taken a number of steps.  Our strategy, includes the following: (i) to encourage a shift in resources to the private sector and the wealth creating sector of the economy; (ii) to provide the best conditions for the inflow of capital into the country, for lower interest rates, and for higher investment; and (iii) to enable people to plan in the certainty that there will be no change of direction by the Government.</P>
    <P>Turning to the first point, it cannot be over-emphasized that the potential for economic growth in the country and for the creation of gainful employment for all will never be realised as long as the country is saddled with an ever-increasing public debt.  There is no option about this: the public debt cannot simply be contained; it must be drastically reduced. At the moment, a substantial amount of the revenue collected by the State is not being spent on job creation, on the provision of social services or on the development of housing, roads and other essential amenities.  It is being spent on debt repayment.  To continue to do this would be to mortgage our own future and that of our children, to discourage external investment, to perpetuate high unemployment and to push the country gradually but inexorably towards bankruptcy. Such a scenario is intolerable. The Government have not proposed and do not propose to cut public expenditure blindly across the board.  Rather, they seek to achieve judicious and necessary reductions while preserving the core infrastructures of the essential services. This inevitably means that a lot of heart searching is necessary.  It requires a fundamental and sometimes painful analysis of Government policies and the manner in which they are carried out.  It then requires the implementation of those policies and consequent changes which <Col N="4062" /> some people may naturally find difficult to accept.  We have become used to a certain standard of services.  Bluntly, in many cases it is a standard which we now cannot afford.</P>
    <P>What the Government can do, while moving to bring about the essential reduction in public expenditure of which I have spoken, is to ensure that sacrifices to be made are broadly spread across all groups in society and that, at the same time, those most in need will be protected. We can neither show favour to any sectional interest in society, nor can we allow the conditions of those who are worst off to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>This policy of bringing about a reduction in public expenditure is perhaps the hardest part of our task in Government and it would be idle to pretend that our work is anywhere near being completed.  I am happy to note, however, that it is already bearing fruit in a number of tangible ways.  Inflation is at its lowest rate for 20 years and may well fall even further.  Interest rates have already fallen in a few brief months due to our policies.  The trend appears to be that they will continue to fall further before the end of the year.  This is one of the objectives to which I referred earlier and I need hardly stress its importance in the economic, financial and social senses. It was universally recognised that the cost of borrowing money, in real terms, was prohibitively high and acted as a powerful brake and blockage on the economy, especially on the further development of indigenous industry.  The fall in interest rates which we have already witnessed in a short period is dramatic evidence of the confidence of the financial community in the new Government and their policies.</P>
    <P>Another problem which bedevilled the economy in recent years has been the existence of the so-called &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, the unexplained financial outflows which last year reached the staggering amount of £1,516 million.  There can be little doubt that lack of confidence in our economy as well as lack of confidence in the policy and the stability of the previous Government played a major role in these <Col N="4063" /> enormous and damaging outflows of capital from the Irish economy last year.  I am confident that the latest figures, which will soon be available, will show a dramatic return of capital into the economy. Those who may have expected a further devaluation of the Irish pound will continue to be disappointed.  The Government remain firmly committed to a policy of monetary stability through the EMS and no adjustment is envisaged.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the issue of exchange rate stability is of great importance to a small export dependent economy like our own. Recent fluctuations in the rates of major world currencies were a matter of concern to us and, in common with our partners in the European Community, we welcomed arrangements made under the Louvre Agreement last February to bring some stability into currency markets, particularly with regard to the dollar.  It would be appropriate for me, while on the subject of exchange rate stability, to say again how much we would hope to see our most important trading partner and nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, in the EMS.</P>
    <P>That would be a major stimulation to our economy in obvious terms but particularly to the United Kingdom economy. It is in the broad interest of the two islands, of Europe as a whole and of international trade generally that this should happen.</P>
    <P>Such a move would lend new authority to the EMS and further enhance the emerging role of the ECU as a tradeable currency in international dealings.  It would be particularly to Ireland's benefit in reducing the exchange rates risks associated with trading between our two countries and that is of very great importance to us.</P>
    <P>I believe that the reductions in public expenditure, the reductions in interest rates, low inflation, the return of capital which has left the economy and an increasingly attractive climate for investment make possible the third strategy to which I already referred &mdash; that people should be able to plan in the certainty <Col N="4064" /> that there will be no change of direction by the Government.</P>
    <P>The steps taken so far are painful but necessary and, as I have shown, have already led to beneficial results.  They are steps designed, <i>in toto</i> to make possible the rejuvenation of the Irish economy.  In a sense, however, these steps alone would do no more than create the necessary preconditions: in fact, the Government's role goes much further.  The Government are not omnipotent in the economic area and there are no miracle solutions, but they have nonetheless a role of fundamental importance to play in the promotion of that careful and sustained growth which alone can take the economy out of its present difficulties and offer hope and a gainfully employed future to our people.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which cannot be ignored by any Government in dealing with a country's economy is the state of the international environment.  This is particularly true in the case of Ireland because of the exceptionally open nature of our export dependent economy which is very much affected by developments beyond our shores.  The OECD's latest economic outlook which has just appeared makes interesting reading. Under the title &ldquo;Co-operative Policy Action to Restore Satisfactory Growth&rdquo;, the introductory chapter of OECD Economic Outlook No. 41 opens with the following assessment:</P>
    <P>The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months and OECD projections to the end of 1988 point to little improvement.  Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist.  Recent downward movements in the dollar, which occurred despite unprecedented interventions in exchange markets, have led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the United States.  These developments together with growing tensions in international trade relations and continuing debt problems, have increased the risks of a worsening world economic situation. </P>
    <P>This gloomy scenario is a matter for <Col N="4065" /> concern.  Growth is threatening to stagnate and imbalances have arisen at international level through the existence of enormous trading surpluses, on the one hand, and a high budgetary deficit and large foreign debts, on the other, while international trade disputes, persistent unemployment and technological changes in developed countries have increased the pressure for the adoption of protectionist policies, with the accompanying slow down in trade which this would undoubtedly entail.</P>
    <P>Ireland has responded to these difficult international developments in several ways.  In common with others, we strongly favour the encouragement of stability in international currency markets. I have already referred to the important role of the EMS in this regard. We are also concerned about the danger of protectionism, which is a superficially attractive option for any country which experiences rising unemployment.  It is dangerous in the sense that it harms trade and we are a trading country.  It must be obvious that protectionism would be disastrous to an export dependent economy such as our own.  Ireland has consistently worked through the GATT to promote the maximum liberalisation of trade.  At the same time, we do not favour sudden and disruptive changes in markets such as agriculture.  In our approach to the international economic scene, change at a moderate pace is the keynote.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the lesson to be learned from the current international situation is that a small country may find it difficult to improve its position in the short term through adjustments in macroeconomic policy.  The sixties were a period of general growth on the world economy and in those days it was, indeed, largely true that a rising tide carried all boats.  The present situation is different.  Ireland, through its membership of the European Economic Community, has a safeguard in that we can promote growth within the Community and therefore we do not have to face these problems in isolation which would be a disastrous position for us.  As I have pointed out, the Government for their part are taking major steps in the <Col N="4066" /> right direction.  When the up-turn in the world economy comes, as it must, Ireland will be better placed to benefit from the change.</P>
    <P>The Government, in accordance with the policies outlined in the chapter on growth in their programme, have also already taken a number of major steps to develop new and additional sources of employment based on the exploitation of existing and in some cases hitherto underdeveloped national resources, particularly in the services area.</P>
    <P>Services are an area of major importance already, employing as they do twice as many people as manufacturing industry but they clearly possess enormous potential for further development both at home and for the generation of export earnings abroad.</P>
    <P>The financial services sector is one striking example being as it is a significant part of all modern economies.  The changing shape of the financial industry worldwide offers an opportunity for a major expansion of economic activity here and, of crucial importance to us, the creation of new highly professional and technical jobs.  We have in the past experienced employment growth in this area but we are far from exhausting the potential and we are determined to go for growth in that area because it is one that is particularly appropriate for our young people who are emerging from education establishments or who are still training in them.</P>
    <P>The jobs that will be provided will go a long way to reducing our unacceptably high level of unemployment and they will be of the type sought after by our high quality business and economic graduates who in recent years have seen their only prospect as emigration, a very sad factor.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to establish an international financial services centre in Dublin, together with the creation of a high-powered committee to advise on setting up this centre, is evidence of our commitment to developing the financial services sector in Ireland. We believe we have already inbuilt advantages in terms of language, time <Col N="4067" /> zones and the calibre of our young well-educated workforce.  It is also Government policy to ensure the best available facilities in terms of infrastructure, accommodation and communications all of which will be indispensable to the success of the project.</P>
    <P>Already some of my ministerial colleagues have been bringing news of this important new development to potential participants from abroad.  In the course of my forthcoming visit to the Federal Republic of Germany, I will be adding my own voice to the promotional effort.</P>
    <P>The second services sector to which I wish to refer is that of tourism.  Once again this is an area which the Government have lost no time in revitalising. Our programme laid particular stress on the tourism sector precisely because of the multiple positive effects it can have for the economy, through the creation of employment and the use of native raw materials in increasing our foreign earnings potential.  In May the Minister for Tourism and Transport announced a programme of measures including low air fares and reductions in hotel prices. These measures combined with the provisions in the Finance Bill to encourage greater investment in tourism facilities through the business expansion scheme, are designed to have an immediate impact and to assist the tourism industry to recover from recent setbacks.  An inter-departmental tourism policy coordination committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, is currently engaged in co-ordinating all public sector activities in the tourism field and in examining ways in which exisiting contributions might be enhanced.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a need to wait until the end of the season before we will be in a position to assess the full impact of the measures we have undertaken, but we are encouraged by what we have seen to date.  Figures for January to April 1987 show that business from Britain is up by 17 per cent, from mainland Europe by 16 per cent and from the US by 20 per cent. Such increases are good news for the <Col N="4068" /> economy and good news from a sector which suffered so badly last year.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a further reason for continuing our efforts since in recent years the amount of money spent by Irish people abroad has been greater than our receipts from foreign visitors here.  It would be our hope that not only greater numbers of foreign visitors continue to come here but that more of our own citizens would holiday in Ireland.  I appeal to all Deputies to take that to heart.</P>
    <P>The Government have also, and I shall only refer to these in passing, placed a new emphasis and significant thought and resources into the development of new opportunities in agriculture and horticulture. The importance of the sea as a resource has been highlighted by the creation of a Government Department to deal with marine affairs for the first time in the history of the State.  Science and technology is a priority area with increased Government assistance and a co-ordinated approach to research and development and manufacturing.  Appropriate administrative packages are being put in place to facilitate all of the above developments.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficult international economic situation I described earlier there has been further good news on the economic front as far as we are concerned.  I refer to the figures for our exports in the period January to May of this year, and particularly in May itself, which showed strong export growth against reduced imports.  I need hardly remind Deputies of the critical importance to the economy of exports, a sector which contributes over 50 per cent of our national income and secures two out of every three Irish jobs.  Last month total exports reached £1,037 million, the highest figure ever recorded for a single month and producing a record monthly trade surplus of £189 million.  The surplus of £408 million so far this year is over twice as large as that for the same period last year.  Deputies will be pleased to hear that this Government do not intend to take exclusive credit for this very impressive performance.  This is a Government who mean business, but I <Col N="4069" /> take this opportunity to salute the Irish exporters who in difficult conditions and against strenuous competition in their overseas markets have done so much in recent years to alleviate the worst effect of our economic difficulties.  I would further like to take this opportunity to assure exporters of my full support and that of my Department both in Dublin and through our diplomatic missions abroad in their efforts.</P>
    <P>Good government involves more than a correct analysis of the problems faced by the country and the policies most likely to solve them, important as these are. It is also about inspiration, credibility, determination and consistency.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the policies which this Government have designed and started to implement are intended to put right the serious difficulties of the public finances, to preserve and use more rationally the range of essential social services provided by the Government, to protect the position of the underprivileged and to take direct and indirect measures towards the creation of a climate where economic development and employment may prosper.</P>
    <P>In undertaking this task the Government are fully conscious of the fact that Ireland is a society in transition in a quickly changing world.  We have moved from being a predominantly agricultural society to a modern industrialised State which, while retaining agriculture as one of its most important activities, now has a highly diversified, technologically sophisticated export led economy with a young and skilled workforce.  Our education system is second to none.  Our telecommunications system is one of the most advanced anywhere.  The process of transition is necessarily painful, the more so as it coincides in our case with a period when technological changes are making it necessary to redefine our approaches to employment.  In common with other countries we are finding the adjustments to the new conditions to be very difficult. We are further conscious of the fact that these necessary changes are taking place against a highly complex international background which does not allow any <Col N="4070" /> room for complacency or lack of vigilance.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances there is not only a need for precision and clearsightedness about the ends to be achieved and the means to achieve them, but also for the political will, political skill and determination to carry this task through.  I can assure the House that the Government have all of these qualities.  I further believe this is what the Irish people and all concerned sectors of the economy are seeking and ready to support at this time. We have laid the foundation needed to sustain the country and we are proud this is being done by Fianna Fáil.  As I said, we have already laid the foundation needed to sustain the country and to carry it and its people forward into the nineties when the full flowering of our present policies should see a strong and resurgent economy operating to its fullest potential both at home and abroad.</P>
