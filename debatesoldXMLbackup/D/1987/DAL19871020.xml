      <P>Proposals for the re-opening of the yard are a matter for the receiver who is responsible for disposal of the assets of the Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd.  Since the transfer of responsibility for ship and boat building functions from the Department of Industry and Commerce this year no proposal has been received in my Department for the re-opening of Verolme Cork dockyards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the total cost of the <Col N="522" /> removal of oil and cargo from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>; if all of the iron ore has been removed from the vessel; the total cost of the clean-up operation arising from the incident; the amount of the total cost which has been recovered from the owners of the vessel; the steps, if any, which are being taken to recover outstanding money from the owners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the action, if any, which has been taken against the legal owners of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> with a view to obtaining compensation for the environmental damage inflicted on the Irish environment as a result of the abandonment and subsequent sinking of the vessel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the total cost to the State of the repair and cleaning work which has been carried out at both national and local level as a result of the environmental damage caused by the sinking of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take oral Questions Nos. 2, 10, 15, and also written Question No. 67 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost to my Department of the oil and paint removal operation and incidental expenditure amounted to approximately £564,000.  The cargo of iron ore was not removed from the wreck as analysis of these samples confirmed that the cargo did not pose a threat to the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost to the Department of the Environment, which includes local authority expenditure, of the beach clean-up operation and incidental expenditure amounted to approximately £991,000.  Costs of other Government Departments involved in the State's response to the environmental threat from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> amounted to approximately £188,000.  A total compensation claim of £1.743 million has been presented to the insurers and I would hope that the insurers will agree <Col N="523" /> to pay this sum at an early date.  If they do not, court proceedings will be commenced against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether Cork County Council have been compensated for any loss incurred as a result of the clean-up operation?  The Taoiseach visited west Cork on 23 March 1987 and said that there would be no loss to the State.  Why has it taken this length of time to recover this very substantial loss to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I gave for the Department of the Environment includes the costs incurred by Cork County Council. The total claim has been sent to the insurers and there will be no undue delay in pressing ahead with the settlement of this claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any lasting environmental or other damage been done, in the view of the Minister or the Department?  Would the Minister like to comment on some of the press statements made at the time of the disaster and in the immediate aftermath to the effect that more could have been done by the Department?  Have the Department concluded that more could have been done at the time and are there any procedures in place to deal with a similar situation in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if there has been any permanent damage resulting from the incident, but it highlights the need for adequate legislative arrangements to deal with incidents of this nature.  Further questions will be dealt with this afternoon and it will be indicated that the overall legislative and physical arrangements for dealing with an emergency of this sort are certainly not adequate and must be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Question No. 15 is being taken with Question No. 2, may I ask if the Minister is satisfied that the presentation of the bill to the insurers of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> will be a sufficient <Col N="524" /> response?  Question No. 15 asks if the cost has been presented against the legal owners.  I am interested in the distinction between the insurers and the legal owners.  The presentation of the bill to the insurers could allow conditions to be brought into the response which would not accrue if the claim were made against the legal owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurers have stated that the owners' legal liability will be met. They have indicated that the costs arising from those legal liabilities will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that there will be no mitigation of the owners' liability, that the liability being accepted by the insurers, as has been communicated to the Minister, involves no mitigation of the owners' liability as legal owners of the vessel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the total claim which we have lodged with the insurers will be adequate to meet the expenses incurred and the damage arising from this incident.  It is our intention to press ahead with a settlement of the claim without recourse to legal proceedings, but in the event of legal proceedings being required, the necessary steps will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the iron ore on board, on whose advice did the Minister base his decision that it was not dangerous to the environment and did he seek a second opinion?  Did he get any contrary advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information here but I will communicate with the Deputy.  We took samples from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, had them analysed and were satisfied that the iron ore would not be injurious to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is very disturbing for him to come in here to answer a series of questions on the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and not be able to assure the House that there has been no lasting damage to the <Col N="525" /> environment?  I want to ask him again if he is aware of any lasting environmental damage?  Can he categorically assure the House that there has not been any such damage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is getting at.  Has he something specific in mind?  The information we got as a result of an analysis and of work done on the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> indicates that there is no permanent damage to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only asking the Minister to assure the House that there is no lasting damage to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Doyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a final supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will facilitate the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has pointed out he is satisfied that the amount of the claim will meet the cost of all the damages and of the expenses incurred, could he confirm that this would include the considerable expenses incurred by various environmental groups who carried out a great deal of rehabilitation work along the coastline, particularly with sea birds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in reply to previous questions that private individuals will have to make private claims and that we would help in claims of that nature, but we do not have any such claims from environmental groups included in the figure we have claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My query deals with <Col N="526" /> the claims being made against the legal owners.  Is there a sum included to cover loss of profits as a result of this disaster, the effect it had on the region in terms of tourism and so on?  I do not think it should be left to each individual guesthouse owner or hotelier to lodge a separate claim.  Surely the Government should make a claim on behalf of the economy which has suffered a loss because of this disaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim we have lodged is for the total cost to the various Government Departments involved in this operation. As regards the matter referred to by the Deputy, it is for private individuals to pursue such claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that while we may claim for the actual damage caused, there is a consequential loss to the State as a result of this disaster. Surely it is reasonable that any insurance claim should include an amount for the loss of profits to the State because of the damage to the environment and our tourist industry.  Surely, it is better that one Government Department should make this claim on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs and compensation claim for environmental damage and protection of the environment include the beach clean up measures, the monitoring of wild life and the protection of Lough Inagh with a boom.  Compensation has not been sought for any other environmental damage as compensation for such damage, other than loss of profits, is normally limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually taken or to be taken.  The State has not undertaken any measures of this nature, and none is planned at this stage.  Neither has any damage come to light which would warrant such action.  Individuals and private organisations will have to make their own claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy but we have spent a long time on <Col N="527" /> these questions for obvious reasons.  I am now calling on Deputy Sherlock for a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inform the House if the major survey of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident&mdash;for which the Minister promised EC funding &mdash; has taken place, and, if so, what are the details?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That survey was undertaken before the work commenced and application for funding was made to the Community. I do not have the information here but if the Deputy puts down a separate question, I will have the information for him.  As I said, the survey for the removal of oil was undertaken by divers in the west Cork area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the number of pollution officers employed by the central and regional fisheries boards; if he will outline the functions and responsibilities of the officers; the measures, if any, which are being taken to ensure that the officers have sufficient back-up resources, especially in relation to transport, to allow them to do their jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The central and regional fisheries boards employ a total of ten water pollution officers.  The duties and responsibilities of these staff is set out in the staff scheme for field grades in the boards and I will arrange for a copy of the staff scheme to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should mention that, in addition to the water pollution officers, the boards employ a further 199 people in the grades of inspector, assistant inspector and fishery officers whose duties also include pollution detection, water sampling and the gathering of other relevant evidence on water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resources are allocated by my Department to the fishery boards to meet the cost of their overall functions.  It is a <Col N="528" /> matter for the individual board to allocate funds for individual functions such as water pollution control in their regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that it has been estimated that 115 rivers have been polluted in recent times, and that only 130 prosecutions have arisen out of 6,000 investigations of pollution problems.  Can the Minister indicate if he intends to provide stronger powers and more resources to the staff in order to ensure that polluters do not get away with polluting, because unless we do that, we will be on the road to wiping out any possibility of having an inland fishing industry for tourism or home use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the Deputy's views in relation to the very high incidence of water pollution and the fish kills we have seen this summer.  I have indicated already that it is my intention to bring before the Government at an early stage, and before this House, legislation which, as far as the fishery boards are concerned, will provide increased penalties, longer prison sentences and power for the boards to seek compensation through the courts where pollution has taken place and fish have been killed, and to rehabilitate the fisheries in respect of such damage.  It is my intention to press ahead with this legislation and to have it in operation for the 1988 season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate which fisheries boards have communicated to him the lack of resources, particularly in relation to transport and scientific back-up, which resources they feel they need to execute their tasks properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for water pollution rests with the Minister for the Environment.  Deputies will be aware that a sub-committee of Ministers including myself, the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Environment, have been looking at a number <Col N="529" /> of initiatives which it is proposed to take to deal with the situation.  There have always been complaints from fisheries boards about lack of finances to deal with various problems but each and every Deputy knows that there is a limit on finances at present.  In addition to lack of finance, the boards are hampered by the lack of other resources and a response is required in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's response, I would like his view on whether ten such officers are sufficient given the high emphasis we place on the environment and the future of this country, not only in relation to the quality of life but from a job investment point of view.  Will the Minister also comment on the media reports over the weekend in relation to the National Fisheries Board <i>vis-á-vis</i> his answer to the original question? In view of the few protection officers who were patrolling our rivers over the summer, instead of giving them a 2½ per cent pay increase would it not be preferable to put petrol in their cars and pay their expenses to do the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is stepping outside the scope of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stick within it.  Could the Minister confirm that the number of official reports and the miles of rivers that were polluted and which were documented in a parliamentary question last week represents but the tip of the iceberg because of our inability to get on top of the situation?  What proportion of pollution incidence is reported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the matters raised by the Deputy do not relate to the question. However, I am satisfied that within the resources available to the fisheries boards and the Department of the Environment and with the help and support of many voluntary organisations and associations interested in this area, it is possible to deal effectively with the situation.  To give an indication of our determination to deal with it, I have indicated that we <Col N="530" /> propose to introduce new legislation to strengthen the powers proposed in this regard.  It is the intention of the various Ministers who have responsibilities in these areas to introduce new measures and initatives to tighten control in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put petrol in their cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The fish kills in this season did not happen because of a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been fish kills for quite a number of years and when I worked for a fisheries board 25 years ago we had the very same problems.  We propose to deal with it by strengthening the legislation but reorganising the regional boards is a separate issue and should be answered in a separate question. The whole development of inland fisheries must be tackled quickly and we propose to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put petrol in their cars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot entertain questions from Deputies who remain seated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was merely a matter of putting petrol in their cars, it would be very easy to solve the problem.  Unfortunately, it is much more complicated than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the very limited resources available and he is redeploying people and resources to tackle the problem but can anything else be done to alleviate it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will pursue every avenue to resolve the problem satisfactorily. Already in the fisheries area people have been redeployed to deal with pollution when it was obvious we were having major problems in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="531" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that as a result of the financial constraints now imposed on local authorities it is no longer possible for them to enforce the Water Pollution Act?  Will the Minister further agree that enacting legislation is no use if there are not enough officers to enforce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that within the resources available and with the help of the associations and organisations this problem will be tackled and dealt with. However, it will take some time and there is no point in trying to pretend that there will be a solution overnight.  The position has been allowed to deteriorate over a number of years and some of the Deputies on the other side of the House must take responsibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time that officers do not have petrol in their cars or vans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that many incidences of pollution are not reported because fishery officers are confined to their offices.  Is the Minister aware of a looseness in the Planning Act whereby in the agricultural sector the provision of silage pits without silage slabs does not require planning permission and that they can be placed close to water supply sources, streams and lakes?  The perception of pollution arising from such placements has given rise to concern.  Could the Minister, the Minister for the Environment and the relevant authorities launch a campaign to encourage farmers who provide such pits, not requiring planning permission, to use their commonsense and not to place them in places which would cause pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a matter for another Minister but, as I said, a ministerial committee met and that is one of the issues which was raised.  All the shortcomings affecting various Departments which contribute to pollution will be tackled and dealt with effectively, efficiently and speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the plans, if any, he has for co-ordinating a strategy for fish farm development; and the reason for the inordinate delays in processing licence applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption of a coherent structured policy for fish farming is a priority for this Administration.  I am at present finalising my plans for the co-ordination of fish farm development in that context. Preliminary to that has been a process of consultation with the interests involved, and the setting of targets for fish farm development.  These were indicated recently in the national plan.  The licensing applications are being processed and licences will be issued shortly in a manner calculated to achieve those objectives and the orderly development of fish farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate fully the complexity of the problem which the Minister now has to tackle I would appreciate if he would outline what will be involved in his promised aquaculture development programme which he has spoken about publicly?  Does he envisage a single development agency for this most important area which will co-ordinate environmental, tourist and other water-based interests into a particular plan for aquaculture and fish farming generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to bring forward an aquaculture development programme at an early date, coupled with the issuing of licences, with a streamlining of the procedures for this development which to some extent has hampered the devleopment.  As the Department now have responsibility for foreshore applications it is our intention to have a single foreshore aquaculture licensing arrangement which would eliminate some of the delays that have been experienced up to now.  We have had close consultation with the Irish Aquacultural <Col N="533" /> Association.  It is our intention to set up, as part of the development plan, an advisory committee of representatives of the aquaculture industry to advise the Department in the overall policy area. The Deputy will also be aware that in the whole system of policing and protection of this important area very little, if anything, has been done and we are considering that matter in the context of the reorganisation of the fishery boards which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put a time projection on the expected announcements? He must be aware, and I ask him whether he is aware, that there is a great number of applications for licences with his Department at present and for a variety of reasons they cannot be processed.  The developers are getting frustrated and are going elsewhere.  In many cases these applications apply to areas and coastlines that have little else to offer in the line of employment.  Can the Minister tell us when we will have a full package to cater for the applications that are now in the Department, many of which are there for nearly a year and it looks as if they will be there for many more months before we will get an answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ready to proceed with the plan almost immediately.  The Deputy will be aware that there are about 300 applications in the Department, two-thirds of which can be proceeded with forthwith.  The areas have been designated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The remaining applications will be considered in the context of further devleopment bearing in mind that there are other issues constraining development such as the provision of water quality management plans in certain areas.  It would be my intention to proceed almost immediately with the issue of licences.  We have been in discussion with the association about a <Col N="534" /> licensing system, how it will operate and the charges for such a licensing system. As I have said, the whole question of policing, management and the control over that arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to increase, over a a period of time, the output in the aquaculture area from about 12,000 tonnes at present to about 40,000 tonnes and to increase the value of aquaculture output from the present £7 million or £8 million to about £75 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply in which he mentioned that his Department have now taken responsibility for the issue of licences as they affect the foreshore, is he satisfied that the legal obstacles &mdash; indeed constitutional obstacles in the absence of foreshore legislation &mdash; which have prevented the issue of licences can or will be met?  In developing his plan does he propose to change the forms of public hearings so as to allow, for example, greater public access to and knowledge of applications in certain areas?  Is he willing to give special preference to cooperatives which have been democratically organised?  Has he been able to address the issue of the reconciliation of aquaculture with other water activities? At present to become involved in aquaculture one has to get involved with four Government Departments, semi-State agencies and local authorities.  Will this be rectified in time for his plan to be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the main issues that will be covered in the aquaculture development plan.  As the Deputy knows, some of these are fundamental questions and it is not always easy to reconcile some of the conflicting interests in the various areas.  Overall there is a general recognition that there is, within the present arrangement, an opportunity for balanced development in each area. There is no need for the type of conflict <Col N="535" /> that has arisen in some of the areas.  In fact, there may be a contradiction in some of what the Deputy is suggesting.  If we were to give more detailed exposure to some of these applications this might frustrate the prospect of some of the developments ever taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the present system of exhibiting notices of public hearings in relation to the granting of licences in Garda stations in remote areas is not a modern method of displaying a notice to people who may find themselves obstructed in the future by the giving of what might be an irrevocable licence?  I am interested in whether the clear parameters for the granting of licences will be presented to the House before we have a plethora of licences on different criteria around the foreshore granted.  I am anxious to be of assistance to the Minister in this regard.  It is a matter of public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can submit for the Deputy's information a list of the areas which have been designated already and where it is proposed to issue licences.  The matters to which the Deputy refers have delayed us to some extent in proceeding with the development plan.  These will be addressed in the development plan which I propose to publish shortly, indicating not only some of the issues the Deputy is concerned about but also the size of the project which can be undertaken and the distance between individual projects. There are a number of issues in the development plan which we hope to cover and which I think will deal adequately with the situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have introduced a number of measures to develop <Col N="536" /> the national fleet.  The Deputy will be aware of the provisions in the Finance Act and the recent introduction of the Shipping Investment Grants Bill in the Dáil.  These measures have, for example, encouraged the acquisition of ICL by Irish interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard the Bill that he speaks about as the fulfilment of the promise made to the former Irish Shipping workers that a national shipping fleet would be re-established and, if so, how does he expect that to be done on the basis of grants of £7 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter the Deputy raises is the subject of a separate question. It is, as the Deputy knows, early days.  The rationale behind the establishment of a marine Department was that the whole potential of our marine economy would be developed and exploited to the maximum potential.  As part of that overall objective, the legislation which I have mentioned is at present before the House.  The Finance Act made changes in this area, in that the level of corporation tax payable to shipping companies has been reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and shipping activities can also qualify for tax relief under the business expansion scheme.  I have been involved in discussions with a number of interests who are pursuing projects in this whole area and I have nothing further to add at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard the Bill as a fulfilment of the election promise &mdash; a photograph was taken at the time with the Irish Shipping workers in the grounds of Leinster House &mdash; that a national shipping fleet would be re-established?  Could he also indicate when we will see the report of the Committee for Strategic Shipping who, I understand, were established in 1985 and reported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part <Col N="537" /> of the Deputy's question, the strategic shipping committee report has been the subject of some comment already.  It was discussed in the House on the Bill which is at present before the House.  I have no reason for not making that available to the Members of the House other than the fact that the members of the committee acted on that committee on the basis that the report would be confidential.  I have no objection to laying that document before the Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As all the measures the Minister has enunciated in his original and supplementary replies were decided on and announced by the previous Government, has the Minister himself any initiatives in addition to those of the previous Government to set up a national fishing fleet or to reinstate Irish Shipping as his party in Opposition promised so lavishly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Any area of activity in the marine economy where we find a possibility of creating employment opportunities will be pursued and examined very carefully and fully.  Any action that we can take in the commercial development division of the Department of the Marine to encourage or expand shipping or any other activity that has potential for job creation will be followed and pursued vigorously by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if, in view of the lessons learned from the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster, it is intended to introduce legislation which would make it an offence for a car ferry to leave dock with its doors open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping (Load Lines) Act, 1968, and regulations made thereunder, all doors are required to be closed and secured before a ship proceeds to sea.  Similar legislation is in force in the country of registry of all car ferries plying to and from Irish ports.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of certain doubts cast on the effectiveness of similar legislation in the United Kingdom by the Court of Formal Investigation into the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster and in particular the question of whether proceeding to sea with the bow doors opened constitutes an offence, I am urgently considering the need for amending legislation in this area. I am considering also whether additional legislation in relation to general ferry safety is required.  Any such legislation will, of course, apply to foreign flag vessels operating within the territorial seas of the State.</P>
      <P>Discussions are taking place on an ongoing basis with Irish ferry operators in relation to follow-up action, where necessary, on the recommendations of the Court of Formal Investigation into the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster. Furthermore, I am establishing a permanent national ferry safety committee, representative of senior technical officers of the Irish ferry companies and the marine survey office of my Department, under the chairmanship of the Chief Surveyor. The committee will monitor on an ongoing basis safety procedures and standards and consider any measures necessary to improve safety on board Irish registered passenger ferries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish flag vessels are comprehensively surveyed annually before renewal of their <Col N="542" /> passenger certificates and further inspections take place periodically when anything affecting the efficiency of hull, machinery, equipment and manning is reported by the master or owners in accordance with their obligations under the Merchant Shipping Acts.  The survey includes participation in sea trials.  Foreign flag vessels are visited by surveyors to witness muster trials shortly after their first visit to Irish ports.  The position under international law in relation to foreign flag vessels plying to and from Irish ports is that, unless on boarding the vessel there is a clear indication that the vessel is in breach of the relevant international convention my Department's surveyors must accept the evidence of the certificates of compliance with the various international conventions issued by the country of registry.</P>
    <P>I should say, finally, that the International Maritime Organisation, which is the relevant agency of the United Nations, is considering new requirements which might be introduced into the international maritime conventions in order to improve safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister advise as to whether or not his departmental inspectors carry out covert inspections of any ships travelling to and from Irish ports during the process of their investigation?  I appreciate that in his reply to me today and in March of this year the Minister of State indicated that there is an annual formal inspection, but all of this is on notice to the captains and owners of the ships.  Do the Department carry out any covert inspection to ensure that the rules and regulations are adhered to?</P>

We can learn from the findings and recommendations made by the Court of Inquiry.  We have 12 regulations which will be laid before the House before the end of this year.  They were in preparation some time before the disaster in Holland. We will look carefully at the recommendations made by the Court of Inquiry.

If it is purely to disseminate information, a principle which I support, we should have this assurance.  The other spokespeople for the marine were not mentioned at all. Will the Minister assure us that it will not become a political propaganda weapon, that we will get good value for money and will he confirm the 60p. a copy figure?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will resolve the difficulties for fishermen especially in Killybegs, County Donegal, who have virtually exhausted their 1987 quotas for mackerel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the quotas or shares of total allowable catches available to member states are enshrined in the EEC Common Fisheries Policy.  Ireland's mackerel quota for 1987 is 79,350 tonnes, of which over 71,000 tonnes have been <Col N="548" /> caught in the early part of the year.  Fishing of the balance of the quota commenced at the beginning of this week.</P>
      <P>Under exchange arrangements possible under the Common Fisheries Policy it is open to a member state to exchange some of its unused quotas for species in which its quotas fall short of requirements. Negotiations have taken place and indeed are currently ongoing with a number of other member states with a view to securing additional quantities of mackerel for our fishermen.  These negotiations are at a very critical stage and I regret that I am not in a position to give further details at present.  However, I will be only too glad to advise the Deputy of developments when these negotiations have been concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Since there are only about 7,000 tonnes of mackerel left in this year's quota, I would ask the Minister to explain to me how, having reissued licences in the last few days for the remainder of the year, these fishermen, with over 20 boats fitted to fish for mackerel, will be able to fish within the law until Christmas this year, particularly in Donegal?  The Minister also promised to ensure that there would be extra fish for the autumn fishing season.  Is the Minister now going to deliver on that to the fishermen of Donegal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, we still have some fish left for the remainder of this season.  We are in negotiations with our colleagues in the Community with a view to exchanging mackerel for other fish to ensure that we will have adequate fish stocks to enable the fishermen to continue fishing up to the end of the fishing season.  If the Deputy can bear with us for another week or two she will be quite satisfied with the outcome of these discussions. We have also engaged in discussions with the Community with a view to seeking increased allocations for next year in view of the improving stock situation and we are very hopeful that we will be in a position to increase substantially the quota available to Irish fishermen.</P>

      <P>Of the 20 possible boats that are fitted to exploit mackerel fishing, how many of them have received licences over the weekend for the 7,000 tonnes that are available.  Is the Minister aware that in good weather conditions that is only one day's fishing for the type of trawlers we are talking about?  Maybe we could stretch it to a few days, but it is a minimum amount of fish in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>All the boats available for fishing mackerel have been issued with licences.

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the reason for the withdrawal of the interest subsidy on loans for fishing vessels which was introduced for three years from July 1985 to June 1988; and, in view of the undertaking given by the Coalition Government to fishermen, if he will immediately restore the subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the serious budgetary difficulties confronting the State require the imposition of quite significant reductions in public sector expenditure.  In these circumstances it would be totally unrealistic to expect that Exchequer assistance to the fishing industry could be exempted entirely from such measures.  Accordingly, it has been <Col N="550" /> necessary to terminate the interest subsidy scheme some nine months earlier than originally planned.</P>
      <P>While I can appreciate the concerns expressed by fishing interests, I think it is important to stress that the Government, in taking this decision, were mindful of the improved operating climate in the industry generally in recent times arising from the introduction of total remission of excise duty on fuel oil used in commercial sea fishing, further reductions in the market price of oil, the better all round prices obtaining for fishermen's catches and the fall in bank interest rates.  Bearing in mind the financial curtailments of every Government at present, the fishing industry is doing quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, bearing in mind what he has just said, that he is in effect reneging on a commitment of the previous Government given in June 1985 to the fishermen?  Will he also accept that this is not normal convention.  Normally any Government will respect a commitment given by previous Governments.  Will the Minister also indicate whether, in the unlikely event of interest rates increasing again, particularly with the worry about the stock market situation at the moment, he will be in a position to reintroduce this subsidy between now and July which was the time limit envisaged by the previous Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment given was subject to the availability of finances at the time.  Dealing with hypothetical questions such as whether or not interest rates will go up is not a matter for now.  The fishing industry has improved significantly, prices have improved substantially, fuel oil prices have declined and the industry is generally thriving under this administration.</P>

In relation to the quota system and tagging system, this is one which I particularly favour.

      <P>Since under the rules of the House I am allowed only one priority question, I would ask the Chair's indulgence to allow me to ask another supplementary question.  Will the Minister not accept that the tag system he talks about does not get at one of the major problems, the salmon at sea.  They are now being caught at sea and are not being brought to our shores but are being loaded onto foreign trawlers at sea.  No tag system will be able to cater for <Col N="552" /> the big loss of salmon stocks.  The salmon are not even reaching our rivers and we have a serious shortage of spawning salmon in our rivers.  The tag system does not get at the essential problem, the huge loss of stocks at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the type of tag system the Deputy has in mind but the general principle is that licensed fishermen will be issued with tags and that the fish caught will be tagged.  That tag will remain with the fish.  I am not aware of the widespread abuse the Deputy has referred to.  In fact, I do not think there is any evidence of trans-shipment taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to enlighten the Minister on this issue.  Is the Minister aware that fishermen have told me that this is happening at sea?  I am not trying to be contrary but some of our large national trawlers, and international trawlers, are engaged in this, and our fishermen have made statements to that effect.  I am sure they will inform the Minister that this is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any evidence that such a practice is taking place.  The main problem, as everybody is aware, in regard to the salmon industry is a national one and not an international one.  We have communications with member states and if there is evidence of such behaviour we will deal with it at Community level.  There is no significant evidence to substantiate what the Deputy is asserting.  Under the system I have mentioned we will effectively control the marketing and salmon poaching that has been taking place here for a number of years.  I am seeking the co-operation of the industry to ensure that the system works efficiently and effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>The purpose of inviting the Commissioner to visit Ireland was to give him an opportunity to acquaint himself at first hand with the Irish fishing industry by visiting various fishing centres and having discussions with representatives of the industry.  I was not expecting immediate solutions from the Commissioner on the various problems which were raised with him.  However, I am satisfied that as a result of his visit he will have a better understanding of our particular problems and will take them into account when questions of interest to Ireland are being considered by the Commissioner in future.</P>

We took him on a tour of our fishing ports where he had discussions with the various interests, from fishermen to processors and those involved in aquaculture. He had numerous meetings at the different centres.  We brought to his attention some of the important issues that concern our fishing industry.  For example, we raised the issue of the flag of convenience and pointed out to him <Col N="554" /> that that arrangement was damaging our fish stocks.  Already the Commissioner has given us a positive indication of the willingness of the Commission to deal with that issue.  Overall the visit of the Commissioner was worthwhile and will have long term benefits for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was perfectly satisfied with the response of the Commissioner to our call for increased quotas.  The Deputy will be aware that the purpose behind the quota system is to preserve a limited stock and ensure that it is exploited in a rational way which will be fair to all member states.  Arising out of the strict conservation regime which we follow there is now some evidence of an increase in stock which will lead to an increased TAC and quota for us.  The Commissioner was pleased to be able to see at first hand the efforts we are making in regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that he said there will be no increase in quota &mdash; the TAC is a different matter in that it depends on the scientific egg sueveys &mdash; until 1992 and, possibly, not after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner did not say that and no Commissioner could make that statement because the quota will be determined to a large extent by the scientific evidence supporting increased stocks.  As a result of tight conservation measures stock increases, and when that occurs the quota will increase significantly.</P>

Unlike all the other parties, we are not involved in the discussions. Unless we are involved in these discussions we shall have to raise the matter there on each occasion.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1988 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1988 Summary Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that the action taken by this Government since March represents a decisive turning point in our affairs.  The problems of the economy are being tackled, and confidence is returning. We are working our way towards a better future, increased employment and improving living standards.  The 1987 March budget was a decisive first step. Financial targets are being rigidly adhered to, interest rates have come down and both industrial production and exports are rising rapidly.</P>
      <P>In the last ten days we have taken two further major steps to secure recovery. They are the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> agreed with the social partners and the publication of the Book of Estimates for 1988.  Both are integral to the Government's strategy.  The broad financial objectives which we must set ourselves for the next three years were set out and agreed by the social partners in the programme, in particular the requirement that the relationship of the national debt to GNP should be stabilised and that consequently Exchequer borrowing would have to be brought down to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP.  The programme provides for moderation in pay, for income tax relief and a commitment to job creation.  The Book of Estimates for its part provides the basis on which an appropriate budget for 1988 can now be framed in accordance with the overall strategy and the economic realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1987 budget made significant progress towards our objective of reducing dependence on borrowing.  Our work in preparing the 1987 budget showed us that expenditure would have to be reduced further in 1988 to halt the deterioration in the public finances.  Ministers, therefore, <Col N="645" /> initiated an in-depth review of all spending programmes in their Departments immediately after the budget.</P>
    <P>It was clear that the normal Estimates process, by itself, would be inadequate to procure an adjustment on the scale required in the overall level of expenditure in 1988.  That process traditionally secured savings in the levels of expenditure proposed by Departments as a routine exercise but what we had to do in present circumstances was to ensure that every single item of expenditure could be fully justified on its merits.  If it could not be so justified it had to be either eliminated or reduced to a level where it could be.  This involved the most detailed, meticulous and objective review of the whole range of Government expenditure ever undertaken.</P>
    <P>What we sought was a major and significant reduction in Government spending while maintaining services which are essential at the best possible level.  We had to identify schemes and programmes which had outlived their usefulness, or were no longer serving the purpose for which they were originally intended, were duplicating some other service or which were in effect a luxury we can no longer afford.  We sought to identify and protect priority areas where services were of vital importance and curtail expenditure in other &mdash; lower priority &mdash; areas.</P>
    <P>The first notable feature of the 1988 Estimates is that they have been published well in advance of the next financial year so that they can be properly debated and so that Departments and other bodies administering public funds know well in advance their allocation, and are able to plan their expenditure accordingly. In the 1987 budget expenditure reductions had necessarily to be implemented at short notice.  That is not the position in 1988.  There will be no excuse for saying that the Departments and agencies have not time to adapt and adjust to changes and reductions.  The early publication of the Book of Estimates was attempted only once before, by the last Fianna Fáil Government in November 1982.  While the Coalition published a White Paper outlining good <Col N="646" /> intentions some years ago they were not, in fact, able to achieve anything in the four years they were in Government.  The early publication of the Book of Estimates is an important landmark for the future, and a really significant achievement given the number of extremely difficult decisions that had to be taken.  Now that the precedent has been established and we have shown that it can be done, we must ensure that this reform will be adhered to in future.</P>
    <P>The critical situation of the public finances is well known to everyone.  In the last four years the national debt doubled from £12.5 billion to £25 billion.  We are now paying over £2.1 billion or nearly the whole of the revenue collected from PAYE just to service the debt.  The debt is now equivalent to £28,000 per household, the equivalent of a substantial mortgage. And there was very little to show for all that massive borrowing.  The unemployment situation deteriorated, emigration soared and taxation increased to excessive levels.</P>
    <P>It is that millstone, the enormous cost of servicing the national debt, that is at the heart of our economic and financial difficulties.  It is the principal reason for our present high tax rates, rates which involve 44 per cent of income tax payers now paying at more than the standard rate.  The level of Government borrowing and the cost of servicing it are the major cause of our high real interest rates which, despite recent reductions, are still excessive and an impediment to investment. They are also a direct cause of the substantial financial outflows from the economy each year.  They make us a high-cost economy.  They are the single biggest constraint on further growth and development.</P>
    <P>When we came into office we saw clearly that existing policies were not getting on top of the problem.  Last autumn a serious loss of confidence caused a flight of capital and sent interest rates soaring. The situation had been reached where it was no longer possible to make economic progress on any front unless the fundamental financial problems were effectively tackled.  Action had to be taken <Col N="647" /> urgently and, no matter how much irritation or disappointment that action may understandably cause, there is, I believe, a general appreciation of what has to be done.  The recent developments on the financial markets underline for us in a very dramatic way, if that were necessary, the need there is for us to put our own public finances on a secure and sound footing.</P>
    <P>The 1987 budget was a milestone in the recent history of the public finances.  The reduction in borrowing which the budget set out to achieve this year represents the largest reduction achieved in recent memory.  That is no small achievement. Because of this dramatic reversal of the slide to disaster there has been a significant reponse throughout the economy; lower interest rates and reduced capital outflows; substantially increased exports and a greatly improved balance of payments.  Confidence is slowly but surely returning right across the board.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will always seek a great future for this country and her people. We want to place Ireland in the mainstream of European and international development and not be a depressed region on the periphery of Europe subjected from time to time to a large flood of emigration.  In the long term our political independence rests on a viable developing economy.  I know and appreciate that the course we have to follow is a tough one, but it is an absolutely essential one.  The things we all want, good incomes and employment, high quality public services, a caring system of social welfare and health, all depend vitally on our maintaining sound public finances.</P>
    <P>In this small country we must try to resolve our problems together in co-operation and understanding and not at each other's expense.  We can achieve nothing by deeply dividing our society.  It was for this reason that we engaged in consultations with the social partners in order to establish a framework within which further progress could be made towards getting the economy and the public finances back on course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Our approach has been to seek the broadest possible consensus on national objectives, and to invite participation by the social partners in deciding, without prejudice to the Government's responsibility to govern, how the principles agreed by them in the NESC report can best be implemented.  Experience has shown that reductions in expenditure carried out in isolation and not related to an overall strategy which includes measures to promote development, to improve equity and to relieve the tax burden, would not command the degree of acceptance and support which is required for a major improvement in the economy. The nature of our difficulties is such that they must be tackled now, in the short term, with the greatest possible degree of unified national support.</P>
    <P>The expenditure allocations for 1988 involved many difficult but necessary decisions.  They reflect a balanced package of measures arrived at after the most careful consideration of all the options. A wide range of services is affected as the Government has sought to distribute the burden fairly across the board, husbanding scarce resources and protecting the weaker sections to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Estimates represent one side, a very important side, of the budget and of overall economic strategy.  Government expenditure has been increasing steadily for most of the last 30 years.  This trend could not continue even a year longer without a devastating impact on all our future prospects.</P>
    <P>Already in this year 1987 Government expenditure has been reduced from 56.6 per cent of GNP to 55.2 per cent in 1987 and there will be a further substantial fall next year.  This sustained fall is in marked contrast to the long-term upward trend of earlier years.  It is one of the most significant changes in fiscal policy for decades. This is the first year in modern times that the expenditure Estimates are well below, in nominal terms, expenditure in the previous year.  The nominal reduction is £412 million and the underlying reduction is nearer £500 million.  I think it is accepted that the reductions for 1988 <Col N="649" /> are spread across the board and do not fall disproportionately on any one area of activity.</P>
    <P>We have been scrupulously concerned to ensure that the burden of adjustment is borne by those better able to bear it. One of the very few areas to show no appreciable reduction at all, and even a slight nominal increase is the social welfare area.  We have been able to implement one of the important recommendations in the Commission on Social Welfare Report, the extension of the free fuel allowance to the long term unemployed, as well as proceeding with the extension of treatment benefits to the spouses of insured workers.  In agreement with the trade union movement the interests of the low paid and of those on social welfare have been protected in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to the greatest degree possible in the Estimates. The Government have made a commitment in the programme to maintain the overall value of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>A number of the policy measures we are implementing are designed to improve equity in our society and to reduce social divisions by providing more and more equality of opportunity. Greater equity in taxation is being sought by measures like the new withholding tax, the taxation of farmers on the same basis as the self-employed generally, and the extension of PRSI to farmers and self-employed.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise strongly that the Book of Estimates for 1988 as published will ensure that essential services are maintained.  It was to be expected that vested interests affected in different areas would of course react vociferously.  In some cases economies have had to be made which any of us would have wished to avoid and in other cases we have to stretch our limited resources very thin. Contrary however to the impression being created we will still have a sound educational system, an excellent health service with the best specialist care available to the public patient, an extensive social welfare system that provides for old and disadvantaged, and a reasonable <Col N="650" /> provision for the maintenance of essential local authority services.  There is no question of the many social advances of the last 20 years being seriously undermined. On the contrary, the action we are now taking to restore the public finances is absolutely necessary to protect for the future the basic structure of the services we have been able to build up and to ensure that we will be able to keep them financed in future years.  The choice was between providing a level of services that we can afford to pay for or keeping a structure that would soon collapse because it could not be sustained.</P>
    <P>We have identified a clear need for a major rationalisation of State agencies and services.  The structure that has grown up over the years has become far too cumbersome with too much overlapping and duplication.  We were not prepared to accept, without close examination, that all of them are still essential, or that their activities could not be scaled down.  There are simply too many State agencies and authorities, each with their own heavy burden of administrative overheads. In some cases they are carrying out tasks in an elaborate environment that could be much more economically performed as normal functions of their parent Department.  In other cases they were set up for purposes which have long since been accomplished.  In some economic and social areas there are a number of agencies doing basically the same job. We simply have not got the resources to support this elaborate superstructure of agencies.  We therefore examined the functions of all State agencies in a drive to eliminate duplication, overlapping, waste and non-essential activity.  We also looked for areas where those who use a particular sevice should in fairness contribute more directly to the cost of that service.</P>
    <P>It is quite untrue to suggest that we are protecting the administrators at the expense of the services.  In January 1988 Civil Service numbers will have dropped by 6 per cent compared with January 1987.  Over the whole Exchequer-financed public service, the reduction in numbers this year will be 9,000 which is four <Col N="651" /> and a half times the 2,000 achieved in the entire lifetime of the previous Government. What is happening is that the reduction in the cost of pay is proportionately greater than the general reduction in expenditure which indicates that the balance is in favour of the preservation of the services.  We can only have a public administration and a level of services that we can offord to pay for. It is in nobody's interest that we live beyond our means and keep going further into debt.  This has nothing to do with ideology; it is simply a hard fact of economic life and survival.</P>
    <P>There has been inevitable criticism of the job losses in the public service which are necessarily involved in major reductions of Government expenditure. Here the answer is the same.  We cannot continue to employ more people than we can afford to pay.  And we have formulated satisfactory redundancy provisions for those who will leave the public service.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates volume, it is clearly stated that provision for the lump sum payments is not included and will be the subject of subsequent arrangements.  The Government are discussing with the Central Bank appropriate arrangements that might be made to enable the cost of these redundancies to be met exceptionally and over a period.  When these discussions have been concluded the House will be given full details.  For the moment the full cost of redundancy lump sum payments cannot be ascertained and it is not therefore possible to finalise the arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have identified in some detail where the opportunities for job creation are to be found.  I would like to reiterate that the Government are absolutely committed to the creation of employment within the economy, and to achieve and if possible exceed the projected sectoral job targets in employment.  The job projections show what we believe to be attainable on a realistic assessment.  We know what we want to achieve, sector by sector, and in most cases specific policies for this purpose are already in place.  We <Col N="652" /> have succeeded in getting agreement among the social partners to a public service pay agreement which is very moderate and realistic having regard to the general economic situation and the state of the public finances.  Public service pay for 1987, which was already decided before we came into office, was 6 per cent above the figure for the previous year, 1986.  That 1986 figure exceeded the target in the Coalition proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i> by £127 million and was largely responsible for the massive overrun on the current budget deficit in that year.  I totaly reject as nonsensical the criticism which has been made of the present agreement.  It is a sensible and moderate increase and infinitely preferable to the disruption that a unilaterally imposed pay freeze would have caused.</P>
    <P>I do not think that sufficient emphasis has been placed by some commentators on the provisions for pay in the agreed programme, even though it has been widely hailed and endorsed in trade, in industry and in agriculture.  A pay pause of six months after the expiry of the current pay agreements in the public sector will apply.  The Estimates were framed on the basis that no further general increases would apply in 1987 and this position will now be realised when the current agreement expires.</P>
    <P>How can anyone seriously criticise a provision in the programme which imposes a limit of 2.5 per cent on pay increases throughout the economy for the next three years?  This definite limit enables the Government to approach the next three budgets with one of the principal elements satisfactorily settled.  A significant feature is the agreement of the trade unions not to engage in industrial action in pursuit of claims in excess of the pay terms of the programme, which should contribute greatly to industrial peace.</P>
    <P>The pay provisions of the programme contain a clear bias in favour of the lower paid.  This is the first time that this has happened for many years.  As I have already indicated, taking into account the 2.5 per cent agreed, the estimated total cost to the Exchequer of pay and pensions <Col N="653" /> for 1988 will not exceed the estimated outturn for 1987.</P>
    <P>I believe that this provision for moderate pay increases covering both the public and the private sectors for the next three years is one of the most important achievements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Everyone knows that economic and social planning must include a pay policy which for the period involved establishes the level of pay increases.  This aspect of economic and social planning is crucially important because salaries and wages represent 80 per cent of gross national product. Realistic planning therefore must be based on a clear understanding about the development of pay during the period of the programme.  Uncertainty about pay can upset any programme.  A recent study, by one of its chief architects, of the failures of <i>Building on Reality</i> shows that the failure to achieve the pay objectives of the plan was one of the main reasons why its fiscal objectives were never realised.</P>
    <P>Certainty about pay enables the public finances to be coherently planned since pay represents almost half of Exchequer expenditure.  In the private sector which is facing increasingly competitive trading conditions, certainty about the evolution of pay over three years in an atmosphere devoid of industrial disputes and unrest provides the best possible basis for investment in and the development of individual enterprises.  This firm planning basis coupled with lower interest rates now provides the best opportunity in a decade for investment decisions leading to greater output and efficiency and increased employment.  This is why one of our foremost economists considers that the pay agreement in the programme represents &ldquo;a significant change in the economic environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some spokesmen for the Opposition parties seem to favour overcoming our economic and social difficulties and achieving industrial peace by a general pay freeze.  Let them tell the House whether in fact that is their position.  Do they seriously think that that is a sensible approach?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> The approach of this Government, the trade unions and the employers, is far more sensible.  We have agreed on a moderate pay increase over the three years which is related to the position of the Exchequer and the economy as a whole. It is an increase consistent with our objective of stabilising the national debt/GNP ratio and consistent with the objective of the private sector to remain competitive with our international competitors.  It is also consistent, when taken with the tax concessions, with the social objective of helping to protect the living standards of families as much as possible.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the distribution of expenditure reductions as between current and capital.  But we had no alternative to making reductions both on the current side and on the capital side if we were to achieve the overall target we need.  I must point out that in this year's budget we reduced the current budget deficit by 1.7 percentage points and now have the current budget deficit at its lowest level since 1980.  We are in fact therefore concentrating heavily on reducing borrowing for current expenditure as distinct from capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I accept in principle that it is desirable to the greatest extent possible to maintain productive public investment.  But the compelling need to reduce the overall level of Exchequer borrowing dictated that we must have the reductions proposed on both capital and current account.</P>
    <P>There has of course been very substantial capital investment since 1980, which has cleared many of the major infrastructural bottlenecks and deficiencies.  Major investment programmes have been carried through in energy, telecommunications, housing, school-building, hospitals and communications. There is of course a great deal to be done in some areas; to improve our roads network and to reduce environmental pollution, for example, but we have reached a stage where a strong case can be made for scaling down considerably, for the moment, some categories of infrastructural expenditure.  In <Col N="655" /> current circumstances all capital expenditure must be rigorously reviewed against its potential economic return. Important productive investment will as far as possible be maintained.  In particular, we will do everything to support industrial investment and employment. All the promotional agencies will have to make the maximum possible use of their budgets and concentrate their resources where they are most effective.  We do not accept that reduced budgets for an agency necessarily means reduced effectiveness; rather does it ensure that funds are concentrated where they are most effective.  The taxpayer is entitled to full value for money in every area of the public service.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1988 are an essential step towards restoring the country to economic health.  If we fail to take these steps now, the hardship will be much greater in the long run, with reduced employment, exorbitant taxation and heavy reductions in public expenditure that would be bound to affect much more severely the least well off.  High public spending, high taxation and high borrowing are no longer available as policy options.</P>
    <P>As a Government we have had to initiate a major departure in fiscal policy. The situation we found on taking office left us with no alternative.  In fact what we are now doing is consistent with the financial framework set out in our election programme which combined a stringent financial framework with development policies.  The financial policy objectives we set out in that programme, however, have in the event required remedial action on a scale not previously envisaged.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging developments this year has been the increase in the officially forecast growth from 1 per cent to just under 2 per cent.  It shows that the deflationary effects of budgetary policies are being offset by increased economic activity, and indeed it would seem that a strategy based on reduced <Col N="656" /> expenditure rather than increased taxation can have these very positive indirect effects.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates is of course only one side of the Government's financial strategy for 1988.  The Government's strategy for the 1988 budget and the general thrust of economic policy in 1988 will be outlined in the 1988 budget.  The main objective of this budget will be to continue the adjustment process initiated this year and to introduce new selective developmental incentives where possible. Next year's budget will, therefore, take us nearer to stabilising the debt/GNP ratio by 1990.  The recently published Estimates for 1988 are the principal factor in deciding the shape of the next budget.  But the various pay, social welfare and income tax proposals in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will also form an important component of the budgetary arithmetic.  Even when all these known factors are taken into account, we foresee the Exchequer borrowing requirement showing a further significant fall next year.  The 1988 Estimates and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> must be judged in this light and when they are, it becomes clear that they dovetail into an overall strategy aimed realistically at bringing about economic and financial recovery.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represents a major national achievement in tackling our economic and social problems in a realistic and effective way and makes an important contribution to improved confidence.  I would like to congratulate all the social partners involved in the negotiations on their responsible approach at this difficult time and on their ability to agree on a realistic medium-term strategy.  There is now in this country a broad consensus on the extent and nature of our economic and social problems and the approach required to tackle these problems effectively.  This consensus was first articulated towards the end of last year in the very significant National Economic and Social Council study &mdash;<i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990.</i></P>
    <P>NESC put forward an integrated set of <Col N="657" /> recommendations to deal with our current problems in the areas of macro-economic policies including public expenditure control, the reform of the taxation system, the promotion of traded goods and services and the progressive removal of major social inequities.  The council recognised that the achievement of a more rapid and sustainable rate of growth and the correction of the chronic imbalances in the public finances will require a considerable degree of sacrifice from society but they made clear that it is essential that such sacrifices are shared equitably across all sections of society.</P>
    <P>It is significant that when the NESC study was published the previous Government issued a statement welcoming the report saying that &ldquo;NESC's views are broadly in line with the Government's own analysis of both the outlook and the requirements for progress&rdquo;. Some of the major points in the NESC report, in particular the necessity of stabilising the national debt/GNP ratio, were incorporated in the Fianna Fáil election programme, and subsequently on behalf of the incoming Government on 10 March 1987 I endorsed the NESC report in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> builds further on the foundations provided on the one hand by the NESC study and on the other the principles set out in Fianna Fáil's own programme.  It translates the principles and recommendations agreed by all the social partners in the NESC study into the firm action that must now be taken to give effect to those same principles and recommendations.  Consultation by the Government with the social partners ensures the widest possible support for the steps that must now be taken and it also ensures that the sacrifices required in the short-term to restore stability and growth to the economy will be shared equitably across all sections of the community.  Given the very difficult economic situation facing the country the Government are firmly of the view that our success in overcoming these problems will only come about if the talents and abilities of all sections of our community are fully mobilized in a <Col N="658" /> great, unified effort.  We will continue to consult with the social partners in the implementation of the programme for that very purpose.</P>
    <P>The programme provides for the maintenance of the living standards of those on social welfare.  Given the necessity for continuous expenditure restraint this commitment underlines the importance the Government and the social partners attach to the achievement of social equity.</P>
    <P>The moderate increase in public service pay negotiated under the programme, together with the voluntary redundancies envisaged, will make a major contribution to restoring stability to the public finances.  There is, of course, room for debate as to where precisely the reductions needed in public expenditure should fall.  To assist that debate I would like to enunciate the principles by which the Government were guided in deciding on the general pattern of reductions. These were, one, the need to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community when implementing the necessary policies; two, the need to ensure fairness between different sections of the community and, three, the need to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, the incentives for people to engage in the enterprise and undertake the effort needed to restore growth and stability.</P>
    <P>The high rates of income tax that prevail here at relatively low levels of income are a major disincentive factor.  We have agreed, therefore to reduce income tax by £225 million over the period of the programme.  In that context we will also be making significant progress in achieving the Government's objective of bringing two-thirds of income tax payers on to the standard rate.  Farmers will now be taxed on income on the same basis as other self-employed income tax payers. Ultimately the effectiveness and fairness of any tax system will be judged on the operation of the system of tax collection and enforcement.  The Government have already allocated additional resources to improve further this side of our tax system and we will continue to give a high priority to combatting tax evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> An efficient revenue collection system is also an essential element in achieving the Government's aims of bringing about a tax structure suited to our development needs, and closing the gap between revenue and expenditure.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> sets out a series of specific measures to achieve equity in the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are to draw up, as a matter of priority, a programme and timetable for the reduction and elimination of arrears.  The Government are committed to the introduction of a form of self-assessment for corporation tax and income tax for the self-employed; the details of a new system extending tax clearance conditions to the payment of certain grants and introducing a requirement to give tax numbers on application for all grants are close to finalisation.  The Law Reform Commission have been examining the whole area of debt collection and the Government will consider their recommendations immediately on receipt with a view to identifying what additional steps can reasonably be taken to speed up the process of tax collection.</P>
    <P>The economic difficulties which have beset the country have meant a major increase in the numbers dependent on social welfare benefits.  To cope with this increase presents a major difficulty in managing the budget, the extent of which is very often ignored by commentators in this area.  Social welfare recipients are among the most vulnerable in our society and the extent to which those in real need can be protected from the sacrifices now required will be a measure of our sense of responsibility as a community.  The Government are committed to doing this under the national programme.  The overall value of social welfare benefits will be maintained and special provision made, within the resources available, for greater measures for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>Our economic and social prospects ultimately depend on the further development of the productive sectors of <Col N="660" /> the economy, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, manufacturing, tourism and other internationally traded services.  The programme has a strong developmental dimension.  It identifies those areas of the economy which offer the best opportunities for growth and development. These are also the areas with the greatest potential for job creation.  The Government will be concentrating on these over the next three years to see what further initiatives can be taken to accelerate their growth and expansion.</P>
    <P>The measures already taken since the Government took office and those now being put in place under the programme will immeasurably improve the climate for investment in the traded goods and services sector of the economy.  Interest rates have already fallen and this has contributed greatly to an improvement in the operational costs facing Irish enterprises. Confidence in the Government's handling of the economy has already brought forward a significant number of investment projects.</P>
    <P>Tourism is set to break all previous records this year in terms of increased visitors and revenue.  Bord Fáilte predict that visitors this year will be over a quarter of a million up on last year generating over £90 million in increased revenue and over 3,500 additional jobs.  The Government acted quickly and effectively at the start of the season to boost the industry this year through the provision of investment incentives and cheaper access transport costs and we will reap further benefits from these measures in future years.  We will publish a new development programme for the industry in the coming months, building on what has been achieved this year and reviewing policy with a view to recovering market share lost in previous years and making the tourism industry a much stronger instrument of job and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing sector must remain at the centre of any programme for national recovery.  We have now developed in this country a cadre of young, well-qualified, professional managers who can supervise a significant take-off in the development of the <Col N="661" /> indigenous sector of Irish industry &mdash; a sector which has to date, with a few notable exceptions, failed to achieve its full potential or to fully exploit the opportunities for development on home and export markets.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing exports from this country represent only a little over one per cent of the EC market.  In many markets our share has actually fallen in recent years.  Without the contribution of overseas firms located here our export performance would be very disappointing indeed.  As a small nation relying for jobs on our exports we must go all out to change the present unsatisfactory situation. We have, accordingly, outlined in the national programme the steps the Government will take in contributing to this.</P>
    <P>The State industrial promotional agencies have already been looking at new job creating opportunities in a number of specific sectors of Irish industry including the food industry and bio-technology, wood-processing, fish-processing, clothing, electronics and mechanical engineering. Job-creating projects in these and other sectors will be further developed under the programme.</P>
    <P>The location of new overseas investment here will continue to be promoted on a specialised basis.  Over the past three or four months there have been clear signs of a recovery in interest by overseas investors, and &ldquo;site visits&rdquo; by potential investors have increased as the determination of the Government to tackle the fundamental problems of the economy became clear.</P>
    <P>The financial services area is another example of a sector which the Government identified as one of significant employment potential.  Since taking office the Government have moved expeditiously on the development of the Custom House Docks site.  Very great interest has been shown by investors in the development of the site and has resulted in eight substantive submissions for the full development of the site within the parameters set out in the Authority's planning scheme.  The interest expressed in the development of the site and the <Col N="662" /> impressive nature of the submissions received bear testimony to the potential and attractiveness of the site for inner city redevelopment.  The submissions are at present in the final stage of evaluation, and development on the site will proceed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Total construction investment in the site will amount to £250-£300 million. Over the next four years up to 1,500 construction jobs will be provided at peak construction.  Serious discussions are under way with 40 key companies who plan to establish in the financial services sector in which it is expected that some 7,500 jobs will be provided over the next five years with additional employment in support services.  The development of the site will include a range of commercial, residential and recreational facilities of top-class design which will revitalize this part of the city and enhance the role of Dublin as the capital of our country and as an important international centre.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the continuing vital importance of agriculture to the economy and has put a whole new emphasis on quality food production. A notable feature of our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been the involvement of the farming organisations in the negotiations with the social partners.  Lower interest rates, too, will be of particular benefit to farmers.</P>
    <P>The latest available data from the Central Statistics Office in this regard is for July 1987 and it shows agricultural output prices up by over 5 per cent on the same period last year with input prices down by over 2.5 per cent.  This evidence that the cost/price relationship has moved significantly in the farmer's favour is a very welcome development.  The Government have established Roinn na Mara with a view to reversing the systematic neglect of marine matters in previous years.  The main marine concerns, fisheries, shipping, harbours, marine safety, conservation, recreation and amenity aspects have been transferred to the new Department with the purpose of co-ordinating policy and planning, downstream economic development and legislative <Col N="663" /> reform.  A start has been made in all these areas.</P>
    <P>Policy objectives are being set for the fishing and aquaculture industries, and strategies and programmes to achieve these objectives are at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to exploit with greater vigour our natural resources.  Oil exploration has tapered off in recent years, and despite a large number of wells drilled over the past 12 years no oil province has been definitely established.  Despite some revisions in terms by the previous Government, the relative attractiveness of Ireland was not being maintained.  I made it quite clear during the election that our licensing terms would have to be made fully competitive with those offered by other producers in Northwest Europe, and that we have now done.  We need to give a new impetus to oil and mineral exploration. That is the primary national consideration and we believe the nation will derive considerable benefit from these changes which would not have materialised otherwise.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, we promised that we would put science to work.  This Government have implemented a new approach to science and technology aimed at producing rapid results in terms of growth.  In appointing a Minister for Science and Technology we paved the way for the initiation of many new science and technology programmes in 1987.  These programmes, which will be further developed and expanded in 1988 include a national programme in biotechnology, a new national programme in advanced manufacturing technology, a new &ldquo;teaching companies programme&rdquo; and a pilot programme in the south east region to utilise and bring together the human technology skills in the region towards its economic and social development.</P>
    <P>We are looking very closely at the concept of a national science park, which will bring together the talents and facilities available in our third-level institutions <Col N="664" /> with the appropriate advanced technology industries which require or benefit from that sort of interaction.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to exploit the development potential of the commercial State companies.  Where any agency can bring forward projects which have a clear prospect of providing an adequate rate of return the support of the Government will be assured.  Such projects can be financed by the State company itself or the National Development Corporation or involve joint ventures with private sector enterprises, which can bring financial or business resources to the project which would not otherwise be available.  Such joint ventures can be extremely useful in bringing forward the development of infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we asked the State companies to submit proposals for new development projects which would create employment and be commercially viable.  A list of the projects received are included as an appendix to the programme, some of which show considerable potential.  At present the projects are being evaluated with a view to supporting those which satisfy normal criteria of economic viability.</P>
    <P>We will be making every effort to ensure that the Government's approach to national economic recovery and to putting the public finances on a sound basis will have the full understanding and support of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Irish economy in the eighties has been disappointing not merely by reference to our own performance in earlier decades but also by reference to what other economies have been able to achieve in more recent years.  The current overriding problem that we face with the public finances has contributed to, and has been exacerbated by, the weak performance of the Irish economy.  Between 1980 and 1986, real GNP fell by about 2 per cent, a consequence both of sluggish output growth and the increasing drain of debt service payments abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government have now set out <Col N="665" /> clearly their strategy for correcting the public financial imbalances both in 1988 and over the years to 1990.  We have stated clearly that we will do so in a way that will not give rise to or exacerbate social inequities, that will allow an improvement in the incentive to work through reducing the impact of personal taxation, that will reduce interest rates, arrest the outflow of capital from the country and restore confidence in the general overall management of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have now clearly set down specific, well targeted development measures to improve the economic performance of the economy and to contribute in an important way to increased job creation.  The essential requirement for this process which links it firmly to the Government's public finance strategy is to restore confidence to the country and to the economy.</P>
    <P>The most important thing in restoring confidence is to let everybody see that the Government are governing, that they have a clear view of the economic situation and what needs to be done to put it right, that their policies and actions are directly aligned on that aim and that they will implement their policies with firmness and consistency and not be deflected by difficulties or criticism.</P>
    <P>We are recovering from a long period of low morale and uncertainty and a sense of failure.  Most of the mistakes made in the past in fact arose out of a genuine enthusiasm for economic development but, as a result, we now have to undergo a difficult, corrective process.  We have to get back to the realism of living within our means, of identifying clearly in the different areas exactly what we can afford and what we cannot.</P>
    <P>Returning confidence must be based on a realisation that the Irish economy is still one with enormous potential if our resources and our affairs are properly managed.  We have considerable natural resources awaiting intelligent development. Among our major advantages is the fact that we are a full member of one of the major economic communities in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> The policies which we have adopted are dictated entirely by the fiscal and economic realities.  I wish to state again categorically that they are not being undertaken for any ideological reason or political motives.  They are not policies of the left or the right, but policies dictated by the sheer necessity of economic survival.  All over the world governments with totally different political philosophies are all compelled to follow the same course of action that we are following because they have no alternative but to do so in order to survive.</P>
    <P>Some are already well on the way to solving their difficulties.  I have been talking in depth with the Prime Minister of Australia.  His Labour Government have had to tackle exactly the same economic problems as we have and they have done this by steadily reducing Government expenditure, wage restraint and specific programmes of sectoral development.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have never been a party of the right, but a party of social progress. We have been the architects of social advance and that advance will be resumed as soon as our present difficulties have been overcome.  But it is in nobody's interest to have waste or duplication or a structure of services which are unrealistic because we cannot afford them.  The reductions in Government expenditure needed were of such a magnitude that they had to be comprehensive and far-reaching but we have sought to the greatest possible extent to protect the weakest sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The time is now right for investment in Ireland.  The Government are providing the context in which positive investment decisions can be made with renewed confidence. The increase in confidence which is taking place has created the right kind of climate for individual companies and institutions to start actively considering investment again and they are, in fact, doing so.</P>
    <P>Many of the basic indicators of the Irish economy are now favourable.  Inflation is running at less than 3 per cent, which is below the rate of many other EC member states.  The balance of trade is now running a surplus of well over £1 billion over <Col N="667" /> the last 12 months, and the volume of industrial exports is expected to grow by about 12 per cent in 1987.</P>
    <P>The Government are relentlessly pursuing the achievement of soundly-based economic recovery.  We are getting the public finances right.  Overall, through decisive action on the public finances and through decisive positive Government we have created a new climate and a new belief in the very process of government itself.  We cannot simply force development and growth to happen but, with the active support of all the principal participants in the economy, I am confident that we can succeed in getting economic recovery perhaps sooner than many can at this stage foresee.  We are on the right road.  I challenge anyone, inside or outside this House, to prove that we are not.</P>
    <P>I also ask this House to face up to the reality and the requirements of our situation with maturity and responsibility. Future generations of Irish people would not forgive us if we did not do our duty to our country now without fear or favour and no matter what the political consequences for any of us might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;programme&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and Dáil Éireann notes in that under the terms of the Estimates, major reductions in the level of public services will occur, and will, therefore, undertake an indepth examination of the Estimates as presented to it by the Government with a view to allowing those members objecting to individual proposals to put forward fully costed alternative proposals which will yield a similar saving in this and subsequent years, and for this purpose directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to immediately present amendments to Standing Orders governing Estimates debates to allow:</P>
      <P>(a)  amendments to subheads in individual Estimates to reduce the amount provided;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> (b)  amendments to the subheads in individual Estimates to increase the amount provided if the amendment contains within it a proposal to reduce another subhead, in the Estimate, or in the same group of Estimates, by the same amount thereby ensuring that the overall provisions of the Estimate for this and subsequent years are not increased overall;</P>
    <P>(c)  amendments to increase provisions for particular subheads, as set out at subparagraph (b) above shall not have effect if, within two weeks of their being passed by the Dáil the Minister for Finance certifies for reasons stated, to a Committee of Public Expenditure that the proposal designed to achieve savings to compensate for the proposed increase will not in fact achieve the savings claimed;</P>
    <P>(d)  where the Minister for Finance makes a certification within the terms of subparagraph (c) above he shall, if requested, give oral evidence in public before a Committee of Public Expenditure to explain the reasons for his certification.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 2 September 1987 Deputy Alan Dukes, Leader of Fine Gael, addressed the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce.  In the early stages of his speech he said:</P>
    <P>The essential task facing us in Ireland today is to find successful and sustainable ways of: 1. Expanding employment.  2. Stimulating economic growth.  3. Eliminating deprivation in our society and 4. Removing inequities from our economic and social system.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech he went on to say:</P>
    <P>What I am saying is, quite simply, that when we strip away all the rhetoric and get down to what really matters in the day to day lives of ordinary peple, the resolution of our public finance problems is the essential key to everything that we want to do in the economic and social fields, to everything that we want to do to provide for our <Col N="669" /> people the conditions in which they can live their lives in the way that we believe is right.</P>
    <P>In other words, what I want for the Irish people cannot happen until our debt burden is under control.</P>
    <P>The first question, therefore, that arises for the Fine Gael Party on examination of these Estimates is to what extent do the Estimates for the Public Service, as published, help to bring down the debt burden and keep it under control?  The Estimates provide for a reduction of £485 million in relation to the amounts which would have been required in 1988 to provide services at their existing level.  We are not surprised at the magnitude of the cuts.  I have stated on a number of occasions during the year that cuts in the order of £500 million would be required to make the kind of progress necessary to control our debt in 1988.  Consequently, we will not be opposing the motion, to note the Book of Estimates, as we believe that the total amount of money provided for the supply of Government services is all that this country can afford in the next 12 months.  We will not have the full financial picture until budget day, but the picture now emerging, provided no dramatic changes are made in the budget, would suggest that the Exchequer borrowing requirement could be reduced by about 2 per cent of GNP next year.  An EBR of between 8.5 per cent and 9 per cent of GNP is now on the cards with a current budget deficit which is only marginally lower than this year.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght speech also enumerated the criteria against which we would measure the forthcoming budget.  These criteria are worth recalling and again I quote:</P>
    <P>specifically it means that, if in 1988 the Government produces a Budget which: 1. opens the way to a reduction in taxes and particularly to a reduction in personal taxes 2. brings about a significant reduction in the current budget deficit below the figures targeted for this year 3. holds out a strategy for real <Col N="670" /> employment expansion in future years and 4. does not add to the burden of debt service cost in future years, I will not oppose the general thrust of its policy.</P>
    <P>These are the criteria against which we propose to measure the budget and against which we will measure this Book of Estimates as an integral part of that budget.  While we welcome the overall thrust of the Book of Estimates, we deplore the so called programme for economic recovery.  It is neither a plan nor a programme and will not lead to economic recovery.  It is a public service pay agreement dressed up to look like a national plan.  It has a fungus of promises attached to it but it is merely a dickied up public service pay agreement, and a bad one.</P>
    <P>The blunt facts are as follows.  The pay concessions together with the commitments in social welfare and the tax relief promised in the programme will cost over £200 million next year.  This is about equal to the £ to the cuts on the current side on public expenditure as published in the Estimates.  What is given in the programme is taken away in the Estimates.  Consequently little progress will be made in reducing the current budget deficit and the real progress which is being made in reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement will rely almost totally on slashing the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Some questions immediately emerge from this.  Why would the Government increase the amount of expenditure by £200 million on Friday only to cut it back by £200 million on the following Tuesday? No ground has been gained in that reduction by this device but the scene has been set for a huge increase in unemployment. The pay agreement provides a direct trade off of jobs for higher pay.  Pay increases are being provided for those at work at the expense of the jobs of their collegues and of fewer opportunities for school and college leavers.  Consequently the programme will result in a massive worsening of services for the taxpayer as fewer people are paid more money to <Col N="671" /> provide the same service which, of course, they cannot provide.</P>
    <P>The central concept now behind Government pay policy seems to be to control payroll costs by trading jobs for any increase in pay regardless of the consequences for the effectiveness of the delivery of the service involved and the consequences in terms of loss of jobs and of job opportunities in the public service. The consequences of the pay deal in primary education is a very good example of what I have in mind.  Thousands of teachers will be made redundant but vacancies will not be filled because the Government have given increases to the teachers who remain teaching and they cannot afford to increase payroll costs by filling the vacancies.  On Sunday last I listened to a few young graduates from St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra, on a radio programme and they seemed to have very little hope either for their own job prospects or for the future of their profession.</P>
    <P>I had a particular interest because I graduated from that college a long time ago.  As always in situations such as this, they blamed the politicians.  It is worth pointing out to them and others and, indeed, to many people in the public service that this deal was negotiated by the social partners and the Government.  The ICTU delegation was led by their president, Mr. Gerry Quigley, who is general secretary of the INTO.  Other teacher leaders were in attendance together with other trade union leaders.  The social partners framing this programme agreed to trade jobs for extra pay.  They traded the job opportunities of students in colleges for increased pay of existing public servants, and they did it with their eyes open.  Already many teachers and student teachers are lobbying politicians and asking them to oppose the education cutbacks, particularly those in primary education. I advise them to take up the matter in the first instance with the trade unions at their own branch meetings.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the redundancy package aspect of the pay agreement I would like to discuss the financing <Col N="672" /> of the package.  While an increased allocation for public service pensions in expectation of a high takeup of the redundancy programme appears across all Votes, no provision has been made in the Book of Estimates for the lump sum element of the redundancy package.  We are told on page 5 of the Book of Estimates that the lump sum redundancy payments were not included in the budget. We are told that they will be the subject of subsequent arrangements.  Despite questions to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance both during Question Time and on the Order of Business last week, we are still not informed in this House on what these arrangements are.</P>
    <P>It is an open secret that the Central Bank make profits.  The bank transfers a proportion of these profits to the Exchequer each year but keeps some in reserve.  It seems to me that the Government want to put an arrangement in place to enable them to dip into these reserves to fund redundancy lump sums amounting to approximately £120 million over three years.  If this is the case, why not announce it?  As far back as July of this year when the Minister for Finance announced the public service redundancy package he indicated that some form of Central Bank funding would be involved.</P>
    <P>Three months later the Government are still not in a position to make an announcement about the matter. Government spokesmen have suggested that the delay arises from the fact that, as there is no indication yet of how many public servants will avail of the redundancy package, it is impossible to cost it.  The Government had no such difficulty on the current side of the Book of Estimates where they have included an amount for the extra amount of pensions that will arise from a number of public servants availing of redundancy terms.  If they can cost it in terms of pensions I cannot understand why the global figure in terms of redundancy lump sums cannot be spelled out here in the House as well.  Therefore, that cannot be the explanation.</P>
    <P>It is beginning to appear now that the <Col N="673" /> Central Bank are not a willing collaborator in this scheme and the Government are trying to coerce them into handing over some of their profits which they need in reserve to fund what the Government should be funding themselves out of revenue.  It will not inspire confidence in those who lend us money if the Government are seen to be playing fast and loose with the Central Bank.  If what I am saying is incorrect the Government can easily prove me wrong by announcing in this debate the precise details of the arrangement with the Central Bank which is to fund the redundancy package to the tune of £129 million.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Taoiseach was very short on specifics.  He prided himself on the fact that it was the first time since 1982 that a Book of Estimates was published so early.  I would like to remind him and the House that when that Book of Estimates was published in 1982 it contained £100 million worth of cuts that subsequently were found not to carry the policy decisions necessary to make the reductions which purported to be in the Book of Estimates.  The Taoiseach today has made a very general speech, many sections of which we have heard before on occasions such as this down even to the same form of words, but he has been very short on specifics.  I want to make sure that when Ministers come into this House they not only tell us how much is being taken off each subhead but they inform the House precisely what their policy decision is which brings about saving.  It did not happen in the past and the Taoiseach has done nothing to bring it about today.  I hope he lives up to the commitment he made on the Order of Business to the leader of Fine Gael and gets his Ministers in and lets us hear the policy decisions and evaluate them when we match them against the cuts.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to some other elements of the public service wage agreement.  It has little or no application to the private sector apart from making business life more difficult.  Pay settlements in the private sector in this round are averaging 5.8 per cent.  It is clear that private companies will continue to make <Col N="674" /> their own arrangements with workers at local level as they see fit.  It has an implication for private industry on the margins of profitability.  It is obvious now that regardless of whether they can afford it, the least private companies will have to pay will be 2½ per cent or 3½ per cent for lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>The public sector also seem to be walking outside the margins of the agreement. Pay claims already conceded amount to about 5 per cent and even since the publication of the plan we have seen the sugar company settling for around this amount.</P>
    <P>The big question which now arises is if the public service pay agreement will stick for a three year period.  All the machinery of negotiation remains in place and there is nothing to prevent a union from lodging a claim in conciliation and proceeding to arbitration with the hope of getting amounts in excess of 2½ per cent per annum, which is the figure which has been agreed.  The agreement allows for this.  As I understand the agreement it provides a mechanism whereby trade unions can lodge claims through the existing negotiating machinery and there is a commitment in the agreement that 40 per cent of the amount which might be awarded on special claims will be paid not later than July 1989 with discussions taking place to arrange the payment of the other 60 per cent.  On the one hand this might be looked at as a fail safe mechanism to enable minor claims which might cause severe aggravation to be negotiated.  On the other hand, it can be interpreted as an invitation to the trade union movement to lodge claims in excess of what has already been granted and under pressure from their members over a 3 year period they are very likely to do so.  The pay agreement was a bad deal but now that it has been made the Government must stick with it.  Any attempt by them to disengage from the agreement or to repudiate it will result in widespread industrial disputes and any subsequent settlement would be in excess of what has already been agreed.  What is now supposed to be a ceiling would very quickly become the floor.  The fact <Col N="675" /> that it was negotiated in the first place has to be deplored but, once it is there, there is no point in making a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>The balance of cuts between the current and the capital budgets is wrong. While little or no progress is being made in the current budget deficit, the whole weight of controlling the debt is now being carried by the capital budget.  To take £400 million out of the economy is deflationary and causes unemployment. Some cuts are more deflationary than others.  The Social Welfare Votes suggest an average live register next year of 256,000 persons.  As this is the average, peak unemployment could reach 270,000 during the year.  Our labour force is increasing by 30,000 persons each year. This is now cancelled out by the 30,000 emigrants which are noted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It is clear that the Government envisage a further decline in jobs represented by the live register average of 11,000 persons more than this year's outturn.  That is proof that the Government consider this Book of Estimates to be massively deflationary. The natural increase in the labour force is 30,000 and it is being cancelled by emigration of 30,000.  If 11,000 jobs are to go across the private sector, that is the evidence that this is a very deflationary Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>In talking about the numbers unemployed we must note that public servants availing of the public service redundancy package will not qualify for unemployment benefit, and even those who leave the service without pensions, with only the benefit of the lump sum, are unlikely to qualify for unemployment assistance in 1988 and therefore will not appear on the live register.  Therefore, the total increase in unemployment allowed for in the Social Welfare Vote, applies to jobs outside the public service. Public servants on redundancy are not entitled to unemployment benefit.  Those who do not have pensions will not be entitled to unemployment assistance so, when they have spent their lump sums, <Col N="676" /> they will trickle back on to the live register, perhaps in 1989 and 1990.  We are talking about a huge increase in unemployment which cannot be explained by the redundancy package the Minister is putting forward.</P>
    <P>The balance of cuts between the current and the capital budget exacerbates this situation.  In regard to the current budget, what has been taken on the Book of Estimates swings has already been given away on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> roundabouts.  The axe falls on the capital budget.  This is not the correct balance.  There is a tendency to pretend that if a rose is a rose, a cut is a cut and that differences between capital and current expenditure are more semantic than real, and that to defend the capital budget at the expense of the current budget is spurious.  I do not agree with the analysis that gives rise to this belief.  Much of our capital investment in the past was bad investment because there was not a great return but we have had good investment too in our telecommunications system, in the improvement in our roads network and in our investment in education.  All of this is showing a real economic return.</P>
    <P>Cutting the capital programme has a number of effects.  It deflates the economy. It reduces activity in the building and associated industries.  It causes unemployment especially of the unskilled or semi-skilled and in those trades relative to the building industry.  I am sure people on this side of the House will be pointing out the examples of this type of cut in the Book of Estimates over the next four days.  This kind of deflation reduces living standards.  Much of our capital spending has no economic return, but it has a huge social return in terms of living standards.  The provision for housing, for education, for hospitals, for sanitary services or for anything which contributes towards social infrastructure is of great benefit in terms of living standards and to cut it can have very damaging effects.  This type of cut often prevents the poorest of our citizens from enjoying the services which the rest of us consider essential and take for granted. <Col N="677" /> Expenditure on housing, on running water, on bathrooms and toilets, on decent classrooms for our children and so on is vital.  Many people here will assume that everybody has a bathroom but they have not, nor have they all got toilets.  To cut something like the grant for group water schemes will affect misfortunate people who are still going to the well with a bucket.  That is hardly social progress.  There might not be great economic return on the investment but there is a huge return in living standards. When the backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies discover that cut the Minister and the Taoiseach will be so informed in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>If we look at the summary of the Capital Programme for 1988 we can see the magnitude of the cuts in the social infrastructure. Capital for housing is down by 30 per cent, capital for education is down by 44 per cent, capital for hospitals is down by 28 per cent and capital for other Government construction is down by 10 per cent.  More important than any of these categories I have mentioned are the cuts which affect the economic infrastructure of the country, the cut in investment which would have given a real economic return.  These kinds of cuts inhibit our capacity to produce the kinds of goods and services which are internationally traded and on which our future depends.  There are many cuts in this category in the Book of Estimates.  There are cuts in the Department of the Marine, in forestry, in the food industry, in agriculture, in science and technology, in the IDA, in SFADCo and in Córas Tráchtála. These cuts are chopping off the legs on which the economy was supposed to run, if we are to believe the promises contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Taoiseach in his speech said we would grow because the agencies will work harder, because we will have more investment, more research, more science and technology and because we will grow more trees, and develop agriculture and mariculture.  Yet in every Vote the investment is slashed.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance when he speaks will explain how, if one is cutting the very <Col N="678" /> life blood of investment in the economy, we can get the kind of growth that is being projected on the other side of the House?  In the programme there is a whole fungus of promises on employment together with sectoral job targets but the means which would give any possible hope of achieving those targets in the Book of Estimates is being slashed right across the subheads.  The Social Welfare Vote, allowing as it does for a live register of 270,000 at peak, almost 30,000 up on this year's prediction, speaks for itself. We must remember that the programme has discounted any growth in the labour force, because now 30,000 emigrants per year seem to be Government policy. Deputy Lenihan let that particular cat well and truly out of the bag when he spoke recently.  The Government, of course, had an alternative, but by making the concessions they made in the programme they were left with no alternative but to cut investment in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed in this House that there are two major problems, the problem of the national debt and the problem of unemployment.  Progress is being made in stabilising the debt, but it is being done in a way that exacerbates the unemployment problem and ensures largescale emigration and widespread poverty.  We are heading for 300,000 people unemployed together with 30,000 emigrating.  The trauma, the sorrow, the anguish, the frustration and the sheer poverty which result from this will be socially devastating for the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Alan Dukes, in the second part of his Tallaght speech, said:</P>
    <P>I cannot accept any course of action which would make those who are already deprived bear the whole burden of the effort required to resolve our problems.  Our concern must be with the needy, not the greedy and our action must recognise that, until we can all truly participate both in the resolution of our problems and in the benefits of that resolution we cannot say that we will succeed.</P>
    <P>Choices have been made in the Book <Col N="679" /> of Estimates.  Even on matters of debt control there are different routes to the same station.  The unemployed, the poor, the young and the underprivileged cannot be asked to carry the burden which stronger shoulders should bear.  We will await the budget with interest.</P>
    <P>One of the major disappointments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the Book of Estimates is the lack of commitment by the Government to any real reform in our taxation system, particularly the income tax system.  We want a programme which opens the way to a reduction in taxes, particularly personal taxes.  The budgetary picture which is now emerging barely comes within the margins of this requirement in the Tallaght speech.  The amount allocated in the plan to give tax relief over the next three years is very small indeed.  In the 1986 budget the income tax concessions granted by the previous Government cost £120 million.  The tax paying public scarcely noticed the concession.  Against that background I doubt very much that the concessions now being mooted will satisfy anybody.  There is no commitment in the programme for Government to long term tax reform.  On the contrary I doubt that the totality of the reductions promised in the programme will equal the extra income tax take resulting from buoyancy of taxation over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I would like to move now to the amendment which I have put down and I would like to move it in the spirit of the Taoiseach's appeal in the last paragraph of his speech:</P>
    <P>I also ask this House to face up to the reality and the requirements of our situation with maturity and responsibility. Future generations of Irish people would not forgive us if we did not do our duty to our country now without fear or favour and no matter what the political consequences to any of us might be.</P>
    <P>That is great stuff.  Shall we put it to the test?  The amendment reads as follows:</P>
    <P>After &ldquo;programme&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and <Col N="680" /> Dáil Éireann notes in that under the terms of the Estimates, major reductions in the level of public services will occur, and will, therefore, undertake an indepth examination of the Estimates as presented to it by the Government with a view to allowing those members objecting to individual proposals to put forward fully costed alternative proposals which will yield a similar saving in this and subsequent years and for this purpose directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to immediately present amendments to Standing Orders governing Estimates debates to allow:</P>
    <P>(a)  amendments to subheads in individual Estimates to reduce the amount provided;</P>
    <P>(b)  amendments to the subheads in individual Estimates to increase the amount provided if the amendment contains within it a proposal to reduce another subhead, in the Estimate, or in the same group of Estimates, by the same amount thereby ensuring that the overall provisions of the Estimate for this and subsequent years are not increased overall;</P>
    <P>(c)  amendments to increase provisions for particular subheads, as set out at subparagraph (b) above shall not have effect if, within two weeks of their being passed by the Dáil the Minister for Finance certifies, for reasons stated, to a Committee of Public Expenditure that the proposal designed to achieve savings to compensate for the proposed increase will not in fact achieve the savings claimed;</P>
    <P>(d)  where the Minister for Finance makes a certification within the terms of subparagraph (c) above he shall, if requested, give oral evidence in public before the Committee of Public Expenditure to explain the reasons for his certification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> This amendment agrees to note the Estimates, but it also notes that major reductions in the level of public services will occur.  If this amendment is passed Dáil Éireann will be enabled to undertake an indepth examination of the Estimates as presented to it by the Government and those members objecting to individual proposals will be given the opportunity to put forward fully costed alternatives which will yield similar savings in this and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is that if we agree with the Taoiseach and respond to the last paragraph of his speech, will not the Taoiseach also respond and give some choice to the Members of this House? Obviously the Government and the Minister for Finance must decide the level of overall Government expenditure.  There is no quarrel about that.  Obviously the Government &mdash; and I think it is proper that they should &mdash; would also decide the amount of money required to run each Department.  But within the Department I cannot see why this House, by majority vote, would not have a discretion to switch money provided no extra cost was incurred overall and provided the thing stands up.</P>
    <P>When we debate the Estimates here individually they are debated on a take it or leave it basis.  We can agree or disagree but we cannot make changes.  I am saying it is time to move in the direction in which Parliaments right across Europe have moved, where some discretion not as to overall spending but as to the priority of spending, would be given to the House. Obviously a mechanism would have to be put in place to achieve this end.  Standing Orders at the moment prevent us from doing this so my amendment suggests that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be directed to change Standing Orders to enable us to proceed in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I know any Minister for Finance will be worried that someone will get up here and propose a cut on one side of the Department's vote and an increase on the other and that the two will not match. So the amendment provides a mechanism whereby the Minister, by a method of <Col N="682" /> certification, can veto a switch of money on the grounds that the sum does not add together and, in effect, there will be increased expenditure either in this or in future years and we ask him to explain why to a Committee on Public Expenditure. I understand the Taoiseach intends to set up such a committee in the near future.</P>
    <P>I know this diminishes to some degree the authority of the Executive.  Power would be switched in a small way from the Executive to the Parliament.  But in a parliamentary democracy, is that a bad thing?  Is it a bad thing if it is tied in as closely as I am suggesting here?</P>
    <P>There is one last point I would like to make on this amendment.  We have a minority Government now.  We may have majority Governments in the future or we may have minority Governments until the end of the century.  This provides a mechanism whereby a working arrangement can be made as to the priority of spending where a Government do not have an overall majority and I suggest it should be looked at seriously.  We are quick to look at Denmark as an example of what has been achieved in economic recovery and I understand that the Government in that country, which consists of a coalition of four parties, is a minority Government.  Effectively, they have to negotiate their budget through parliament.  It is difficult for them but they are succeeding and doing a better job than we are.  I ask the Taoiseach, as a response to his appeal at the end of this speech, to look at that suggestion carefully.  It is contained in our amendment and we intend to vote on that amendment.  However, that does not mean in any way we are not accepting the overall figures as put forward by the Government because we do accept them.</P>
    <P>I find it a bit churlish at times &mdash;&ldquo;churlish&rdquo; is probably the wrong word because I do not mean to be offensive to the Taoiseach &mdash; that, when the Taoiseach enumerates the achievements of the Government, he does not find it fitting to point out that the fact that the inflation rate is down to its present level is due to the work of the last Government over <Col N="683" /> four years.  When we went into Government the inflation rate was more than 20 per cent.  The improvement in our balance of trade was due to the policies of the previous Government over four years.  When we went into office in 1982 there was a deficit in the balance of trade which amounted to more than 13 per cent of gross national product.  That was a massive gap between our imports and exports.  Our economic, industrial and financial policies brought about that dramatic improvement.  Nothing has been done by the Government since March of this year which has had any effect whatever in the monthly surpluses on the trade figures.  Policy initiatives do not work that fast.  The Government will get credit for what they are doing now next year but the Taoiseach should give credit to the previous administration for the policies he is now enjoying the fruits of.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about shipping policy and it should be remembered that Deputy Jim Mitchell put that together when he was Minister but it is being claimed now as a success of the other side of the House.  We have many extra tourists here because Deputy Mitchell, by licensing other air companies, reduced the fares.  This is a pet project for those on my right and they get excited when one refers to aeroplanes or airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach, and the members of his Government, on bringing before the House a set of Estimates at this time of the year.  I do not think it should be under-estimated as an achievement.  I am aware that unkind words were spoken about the 1982 effort to do the same thing but I know from my knowledge, and things I have heard and listened to, that a huge effort of political will was necessary to bring about this change in public finance procedure.  I should like to warmly congratulate the members of the Government on their achievement in bringing this about.  They are sincere congratulations from me because this brings to the House some sense of accountability and responsibility in relation to what transpires on the public financial front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Government on their determination and decisiveness in turning about a spiral of indebtedness which they inherited when <Col N="685" /> they took office.  It would be very begrudging of me not to note in the first few sentences of my remarks something which should be stated by more Members, that there has been a change in climate by the Government, that there has been a change to decision rather than mere division and that there has been a change for the better in the way in which the finances of the country are being conducted. They have been characterised by political decisiveness which has only recently emerged on the political stage.  I could be churlish and detract from that by pointing out that there was a change of heart of massive and Pauline proportions but I will not do so.  It is a welcome development and one which our party salutes unequivocally.</P>
    <P>The debate is one which suffers from certain technical difficulties.  For constitutional reasons the Dáil cannot and should not be asked to approve in a lump the Estimates for 1988.  The solemn constitutional duty which falls on this House to examine Estimates individually, and on their own merits, still holds true.  The Dáil cannot, and by this debate does not, seek to endorse, approve or evaluate the merits of each and every Estimate which is contained in the abridged Estimates we are discussing.  On this occasion we are being asked merely to note the proposed Estimates for 1988.  We are not being asked to approve or disapprove them globally or individually.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I should like to make it clear that the role of the Progressive Democrats in the debate does not amount to any endorsement of the individual Estimates contained here.  I should like to make it clear that we intend during the debate not to sit on the fence, not to abstain in the vote at the end.  We have thought long and hard about the implications of the way we cast our votes.  It is easy to note an Estimate in an empty and hollow way but we have decided to cast our votes in favour of the proposal &mdash; leaving aside our amendment &mdash; based on our view that the overall targets which the Estimates reflect deserve support. Politically we must speak to the Irish people from the Chamber with an <Col N="686" /> unequivocal voice which rejects opportunism and is clearly seen to do so.</P>
    <P>I am indicating to the Dáil that the Progressive Democrats intend, if the motion stands unamended despite our best efforts to amend it, to vote with the Government to note the Estimates.  That is not a gesture of approval of their individual component parts but it is an unequivocal, and I suggest courageous, gesture on our side to suggest that we are not being a party of opportunists, a party who are trying to have it both ways and that we are not going to nitpick our way through the economic debate.  We are signalling clearly to the Irish people that in general terms the figures the Government are aiming to achieve are ones which we endorse.  We are signalling that their macro-economic strategy is one with which we are in fundamental agreement, as far as we understand it.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion we explicitly signalled that we were not in the business of signing or endorsing any blank cheque for any budget, or part of any budget, in advance.  We are not prepared to lay down minimum criteria for a budget and say that any budget which conforms with those minimum criteria is one we will support.  We regard our role and our mandate as Deputies as one which requires us to examine every budgetary proposal on its merits and not to indicate in advance, for our own political purposes or for some general political purpose, an unqualified approval of any budget which conforms to those basic minimum criteria. We take this view because we believe it is our duty to use whatever political leverage is in our grasp, whatever political power we have, whatever influence we have over decisions of this House, not simply to ensure that whatever budget transpires from the budget debate next January and February is one which conforms to minimum criteria, be they established in Tallaght or anywhere else, but that this country gets the best budget which conforms to the criteria which we know to be necessary.  Therefore, we shall oppose measures which we believe are wrong and will do so to the maximum of our capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> For our part, we are not subject to the same political imperative that seems to govern others in this House to avoid political turbulence at any cost.  We felt it more important to put this Government more in the direction that we believe the country should follow by every move at our command including, in the ultimate, the threat of forcing the Government to choose between doing what we believe is correct and facing the electorate.  That is our decision and we accept responsibility for it.  We believe it flows from the nature and the composition of this Dáil and that it reflects the views of the people as reflected in the manner in which they cast their votes at the last election.</P>
    <P>We do not, of course, relish the possibility of an early general election, nor I suppose would any commentator think it a likelihood in present circumstances but, equally, we do not flinch from our mandate and we are not about to abdicate our function in this House.  Therefore, we cannot accept the logic &mdash; if I may call it that &mdash; of the Tallaght philosophy.  It seems to be a tactical manoeuvre rather than a stance on principle.  It appears to be a suspension of or abdication from a political role which was thrust by the people on the Members of this House as a political mandate at the last election. We do not think that any such abdication or suspension of role is necessary, or in the interests of this country.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to vote for the resolution that these Estimates be noted. As I have said, we do so quite clearly underlining that it is not an approval, that the Constitution does not allow this House to approve any individual Estimate, that the Constitution requires this House to examine each and every one on its merits and we reserve and will exercise fearlessly as we consider it necessary, our judgment on every single Estimate based on what we consider the national interest to be.</P>
    <P>I want, if I can, to reflect for a moment on the macro-economic targets which the Government seem to be pursuing.  At the moment it appears the Government have brought about a situation in relation to <Col N="688" /> decisions they have made on spending which will enable them to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement to a figure of between 8½ and 9 per cent in the year 1988.  The exact details and the extent to which it falls below 9 per cent depends on political judgments to which we are not privy and which are not being revealed to us.  It is part of a process which, according to the Taoiseach when he spoke on the Adjournment debate here last June, was designed to bring the Exchequer borrowing requirement into rough conformity with the nominal growth in gross national product by the year 1990.  In fact, that is an ambitious target and, as some commentators have pointed out in learned journals since, it goes further than simply stabilising the ratio of debt to GNP.  As enunciated by the Taoiseach, his plan to equalise the Exchequer requirement growth with the growth in GNP brings us to the stage where this country would be entering what is called a virtuous circle as opposed to a vicious circle, where, in fact, the debt problem would be a diminishing one rather than one which was merely stable and which accounted for a proportionate growth each year.</P>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance to indicate whether the Taoiseach was using shorthand politically when he expressed that ambition or whether he was merely talking about stabilising the debt-GNP ratio.  Was he really talking about equating the growth in the Exchequer borrowing requirement with nominal growth in GNP, or was he mistakenly being over-ambitious?  Are this Government determined to bring down the Exchequer borrowing requirement not simply to 7 per cent which would achieve roughly what the stability formula requires but to bring it down to a lesser figure of 5 per cent which would permit us to begin to role back the influence of indebtedness in our economy?</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is this.  Much has been made in this House of the effect of interest rates and their effect on the Irish economy.  Much has been spoken about creating an environment whereby reducing interest rates, <Col N="689" /> economic growth and investment will be sustained.  There is no point in pursuing a policy of low interest rates if we are to be a victim of every international fluctuation without any Governmental influence on our interest rates structure.  I ask the Minister for Finance who is here to day to indicate during the course of this debate his plans to decouple Irish interest rates from those prevailing in the UK which seems at the moment to have a great influence over our economic affairs.</P>
    <P>In particular, I ask him to set out, in as much detail as he feels he can at this stage, the measures which he feels he can and will take to free Irish exchange rates to permit the Irish £ to be traded in internationally, to permit foreign currency securities to be traded in in this country so as to give his Government a genuine, independent measure of control over interest rates and their movements by economic action.  I appreciate that we are in a small open economy and that to a large extent interest rates are determined by factors which are beyond our control because of our size, relatively speaking, to the international economy of which we are part.  I do believe there is room for the Government to set out in detail their proposals in relation to interest rates and their programme to assert some kind of influence, if not absolute control, over Irish interests rates and to set out a programme for decoupling Irish interest rates.</P>
    <P>There are individual features of the Estimates which have caused considerable concern to us.  Without going through all the Votes or through all the Estimates one which stares us in the face as legislators is the balance that has been struck in education cutbacks.  The fact that primary education is to bear the brunt of the cutbacks in education is something which is hard to understand, particularly in view of the fact that for those who are least advantaged in our society and those who are likely to suffer most from cutbacks, it is the only education they will ever receive.  I stated, as a matter of conviction, that no-one can see a series of educational cuts which focuses more heavily on primary education <Col N="690" /> than elsewhere as being socially progressive, or as caring for those most disadvantaged in society.  It seems that the balance has been struck wrongly in relation to education and this party will more and more forcefully get across to the Government and to the people the injustice being done by attacking primary education in particular in the context of cutbacks in education.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the decision to close the National Social Services Board is a fundamental mistake, not because of huge economic importance but a mistake of thinking, philosophy and desire to change the Irish political system.  The National Social Services Board is a bridge between voluntary organisations and those who are disadvantaged; it is a bridge between Government and voluntary organisations. It is a fundamental mistake, for a small amount of money, to close down that institution which does so much when the consequences will be that the politics of clientelism, the politics of the stroke, of doing favours which people should have done for them as of right, will be encouraged by that decision.  It is a mistake and we are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>Likewise in relation to the Ombudsman, the decision to cut back in relation to the vote of the Ombudsman seems to be inexcusable.  As an enlightened, progressive measure, the institution of the Ombudsman was one which is a landmark of recent political development in Ireland.  For a couple of hundred thousand pounds, to entirely emasculate and destroy the administrative future and potential of the Ombudsman's Office seems to be another fundamental mistake.</P>
    <P>I am also a little at sea as to the Government's public service employment targets. We are not being told who are going to take these redundancy terms.  We are not being told what the Government's plans for a reduction in the size of the public sector, Department by Department, are.  Why not?  Why are we not entitled to know if there are planned reductions in the size of the public sector and whether any decisions have been made as to where these reductions would <Col N="691" /> be made?  If those decisions have been made, and here I am talking about the permanent Civil Service, why are we not being told the philosophy and the thinking which lies behind them and what the intentions of the Government in carrying them out are?</P>
    <P>Let me say this to the Minister for Finance.  There has been a good deal of foot dragging by the permanent Civil Service in relation to the implementation of this scheme.  Unwritten instructions have been circulated to the effect that this scheme of redundancy in the public service is not to radically affect the permanent Civil Service.  The lack of a coherent and stated public policy in relation to the manner in which public sector employment is to be introduced reflects the indecision and political struggle between Ministers and the permanent civil servants rather than a desire to keep secret from the electorate the purposes of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the Central Bank and its role in relation to financing the public sector redundancy lump sum payments.  To be honest, it is not a huge scandal that Central Bank funds are to be applied in this way.  Payment of a lump sum for any industry in the country must constitute either a current or a capital item.  While these payments in general are desirable as part of the necessary business of reducing the size of the public service, to leave them off the balance sheet and to invent a new method for financing them which does not recognise the fact that this institution is supposed to approve all Government spending and to do so by way of departmental Estimates, public capital programmes and public current programmes is a bit of self-deception which fools nobody.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know, in relation to an item which could amount to £100 million or £150 million and which can be quantified &mdash; despite what the Taoiseach may have said about it in his speech &mdash; how it is proposed to finance it, the amount of moneys in question and how this is supposed to be done.  More than <Col N="692" /> that, we are entitled to be consulted in relation to it.  It is a fundamental principle of parliamentary control over Government expenditure that this House would be consulted and would exercise control over it.  If these items do not appear in the public balance sheets as an expenditure, either capital or current, it would seem that we do not have that necessary control and the Constitution is being trampled on.</P>
    <P>In his address to this House the Taoiseach referred to the social partners.  At the time the Minister for Finance moved the Finance Bill I pointed out that there was no programme in it for radical tax reform.  I also pointed out that the Minister's hope that proposals for tax reform would emanate from consultations with the social partners was a forlorn one.  I believe that more and more as time goes by.  The Taoiseach suggested that there is to be a reduction of £225 million in income tax during the course of this plan. I suggest that that is totally and completely untrue.  The burden of income tax on the community at large will increase over that period.  Whatever the script writer or whoever is responsible for the Taoiseach's speech may say &mdash; perhaps it was Mr. Cronin or perhaps it is mere poetry &mdash; there are not going to be cuts amounting to £225 million in income tax, there is going to be an increase in income. tax.  The amount of the so-called concessions which have been negotiated as part of this plan will not amount to an overall reduction and we will see from the figures which will be presented for each of the years of the plan that the burden of income tax will have in fact increased.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also called on the contributors to this debate to indicate what their attitude is to public service pay.  He posed a fundamental question which was to the effect that those who are against the wage agreement negotiated in the context of this so-called national plan should state whether they are in favour of a general pay freeze and suggested that they owed it to the rest of this House to indicate their positions in respect of this matter.  That was the challenge fairly and <Col N="693" /> squarely put by the Taoiseach and I now intend to take it up.</P>
    <P>Let me say this in relation to public service pay.  A general pay freeze is no business of the Government.  Control over the payments to public servants who are under their remit is their business.  It would have been far better if the Government, instead of conceding the wage agreement, had not permitted any increase in payments to the public service and not allowed incremental or special increases and had in lieu of that tackled the burden of taxation on employment by, for instance, taking away PRSI on the first £1,000 or £2,000 of income.  That would have been much more progressive and would have dealt with those who will not receive any wage increase due to the impecunious state of their employers, with those who are hardest hit by taxation, with those who are not paying any income tax and for whom this £225 million worth of concessions will mean nothing because they are not even in the tax brackets.  It would have dealt, too, with those who will not receive the £4 increase because their employers cannot afford to pay it.  It would amount to relief justly given to those who most need it. That would have been far more preferable than the posturing which went on in relation to public service pay in the context of this national agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made much play of the distinctions between capital and current spending.  There is no point in extolling the virtues of capital rather than current spending without examining the nature of that capital expenditure.  Building hospitals which we cannot afford to staff and building institutions which we cannot afford to run have no significance economically and building things that will not yield an economic return to the country at a time when we cannot afford to borrow for them simply does not make economic sense.  I tend to agree with the Minister that, as between current and capital items, it is not correct to say, as Deputy Noonan suggested, that the balance was wrongly struck, that the current and capital programmes are nothing more than artificialities when we come to <Col N="694" /> look at the exact boundaries between one category and another, that what we should have been looking at were the public capital programmes which would yield an economic return and those which would yield none.  Building schools and hospitals cannot be justified by virtue of categorising them as capital reforms.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in his address that 44 per cent of taxpayers are now paying tax above the standard rate.  That is a remarkable figure because it suggests that in the past 20 years, by failing to index our tax system and by making it more and more progressive, we have brought surtax to the masses.  The Government's programme on which they were elected and to which they continue to make rather vague genuflections is, at some future date to convert the tax system into one where two thirds of people will pay at the standard rate.  That means reducing that 44 per cent to 33 per cent.  It has to be stated &mdash; and I will never tire of saying it &mdash; that the Government's programme for radical tax reform constitutes a programme for changing the marginal tax rate of 10 per cent of taxpayers only.  That is not a programme of radical tax reform.  It sounds great but it means nothing.  One is talking about one in ten of taxpayers' marginal rate.  It can be achieved by relatively small changes in the taxation system and will not suffice for the radical reform of taxation this country really requires.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is in regard to the question of growth.  It is quite clear from the figures put before us on occasion that growth in our circumstances is being driven by export growth.  The deflationary effect of these Estimates being implemented &mdash; if there is to be growth in GNP &mdash; will require to be offset by a very buoyant demand for our international exports.  I sound a note of warning in relation to that because international economic circumstances today are so dramatically different from those which obtained on Friday last. International economic conditions are so variable we cannot afford to assume that all growth can come from international <Col N="695" /> export-led growth.  At some stage we must tackle the problems which apply inside our economy, tackle the inhibitions to growth at home.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some of the elementary factors that militate against growth must be tackled by this Government at some stage whatever the political cost, for instance, the political cost of challenging the situation which obtains in relation to the Electricity Supply Board under which Irish rates of electricity charges are so much higher, are so prohibitively geared against use of a primary power source in production, the prohibitive rates which apply to Irish telecommunications and transport costs.  All of those are matters in respect of which the Government will have to show a great deal more political flint and steel and be willing to confront some interest groups in order to bring about change.</P>
    <P>I have got to say this about the general approach of the Government to industrial relations.  I believe there is an axis in this Government consisting of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour which is totally against any form of confrontation whatsoever.  Nobody wants confrontation for its own sake but there must be occasions on which one will shape up to an issue and decide one is not going to flinch.  So far the record of this Government in that area is not good.  Even in relation to the public service pay deal done it seems to me that the Government backed down in the face of what was a very ephemeral threat of industrial unrest.  It appears to me that the public service unions have pulled a fast one not only on their union colleagues in the private sector and those who are about to lose their jobs as a result of what has been negotiated, but also &mdash; and much more fundamentally &mdash; have pulled a fast one on the community at large because they had not got the ammunition in their locker of which the Taoiseach was so afraid.  They were not buying off a great winter or three years of discontent.</P>
    <P>The public has finally come to see that there cannot be more concessions such as special pay awards by the Civil Service <Col N="696" /> arbitrator on occasions.  There is the political will, if the Government are willing to capitalise on it, to prevent such payments out of funds we do not have.  It requires some degree of political courage to galvanise that political support and make it stick.  It appears to me that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour, in particular, seem to believe in a philosophy of fudge and retreat from shaping up to real issues.  I do not know how they will reduce manning levels where they are superfluous or where there are too many people in vital public utilities.  I do not know how they are going to shape up to those issues if they do not have the political courage even to express their aims in the matter on paper.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Taoiseach has apparently established as the Bible, the New Testament of his economic philosophy, the NESC report.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at one passage in that report which relates to the difference between gross pay roll costs to employers and the net value of take-home pay to employees.  The figures show &mdash; and these are already two years out of date &mdash; that, as a result of our PRSI and tax system, for an employee who is on one and a quarter times the average industrial wage &mdash; that is somebody earning approximately £15,000 per annum &mdash; for every £1 he takes home it costs his employer £2; in other words there is £1 of payroll taxes for every £1 of take-home pay.  If that is not seen as a major inhibitor of economic activity, or employment creation and willingness to participate in the labour market, I do not know what is clear evidence of it.  Some day, some time, the mandarins of Merrion Street will wake up to the fact that the tax system, on a micro-economic basis, is the single greatest inhibitor of economic activity in this country.  It prevents people being willing to work, to employ others and from being willing to take risks with investment.  The tax system is something we cannot afford to long finger, as something which can be reformed in, say, five, ten or 15 years time.  Reform of our tax system &mdash; and this party state this as a <Col N="697" /> fundamental belief &mdash; is a necessary part of the process of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the amendment which the Progressive Democrats have put down, in particular, focuses on the fact that the extra £100 million which will be caused by a combination of public expenditure, of permitting incremental pay increases to be paid, of permitting the payment of special awards and the payment of the moneys provided for in the plan by way of wage increase constitute an opportunity lost.  As Deputy Noonan said, there is no way that anyone can obscure this &mdash; those £100 million mean jobs lost and have always meant jobs lost.  When the trade union leaders who were party to that agreement signed their hands to it they signed away the jobs of many of their members and the prospects of many young people in our society today.  There is no shying away from that; they must live with it.  It is a political, economic fact and now it is a social fact which is perceived.  It is simply wrong to suggest, as has been done here, that the parties to that agreement deserve congratulation.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to them the employers' part was a walk-on, walk-off part.  They simply witnessed what happened and noted what occurred.  The public sector unions got what they wanted, that was, to secure a wage increase for those who would retain their jobs.  The Government bought off what I believe was a fundamentally unreal threat of industrial unrest and paid a very high price in jobs for so doing.  That toll of jobs is something this party believe must be underlined.  One must recognise that, when one talks about a figure of £100 million, one is talking about moneys which would have been available, for instance, to keep more primary teachers at work had not the Fianna Fáil Party encouraged those involved in education to seek to have the arbitrator's award paid to them despite the parlous economic state of the country, that one is talking about the moneys that would be available to keep the National Social Service Board in existence, to keep the <Col N="698" /> Ombudsman functioning.  One is talking about all of these funds which were written off in the face of what I believe was an unreal threat.</P>
    <P>I believe the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is not a programme at all but rather an elaborate and well conceived public service pay deal.  When I say that I mean it is elaborate only in its pretentions. It is baroque, it is like an altar piece in a continental church, it is overstated. When one looks at it, it seems to mean something until one comes close up to it when one finds that all that glisters is not gold but gilt.  All the statements and commitments to job targets turn out to be things which are mere aspirations. If I may say so, we have entered the period of the economics of the Book of Genesis where the Government feel it is permissible to say: let there be jobs and there will be jobs; let there be growth and there will be growth.  With all due respect to the Taoiseach, he may think of himself as somebody politically omnipotent but the physics and cosmology of the Book of Genesis are something which do not apply to the Irish economic situation and are unlikely ever to do.</P>

      <P>In speaking favourably on my amendment I want to suggest that this House would do itself a grave injustice if it accepted glibly the remarks made by the Taoiseach about the success of his so-called national plan.  It would be a grave injustice because the people at large know that fundamentally it is political candyfloss.  It has no substance.  It <Col N="699" /> is highly spun.  It was born to the strain of Mise Éire.  It was brought before the Irish people with great pomp and circumstance but I suggest it represents a lost opportunity for restraint.  Where restraint was possible, we lost the opportunity for restraint and in its place we have produced the ultimate political illegitimate child.  The fact is that politics is the art of the possible but on this occasion politics for ignoble reasons has fathered a false consensus.  It is a consensus to which this party will not be a part.  The signs are that already the trade unions involved in the consensus regard it as a fundamental error on their part. Their members are now seeing how false the consensus is.  The majority of the Members of this House, I believe, from varying different points of view, see how false is the consensus which seemed to be embodied in that agreement.  This House at the time of noting these Estimates should also lay down a very definite marker that it rejects the falsity of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; the public service pay deal, that it rejects its falsity and regrets its cost and therefore should take on board the amendment of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the amendment put forward by Deputy Noonan, in the name of Fine Gael.  The suggestion is that this House should amend its own procedures so that it would be possible for those Deputies who are not in Government, who are not supporting the Executive, on whom the Executive is not reliant for the time being, to put forward amendments and have them voted on, amendments that would allow the transfer within Votes &mdash; so as not to increase overall public expenditure or indeed the size of any individual Estimate &mdash; moneys from here to there, in other words that there should be costed capacity to change the pattern of public expenditure over a year.  It is, of course, superficially attractive that that should be the case.  It is of course superficially attractive that this House should take to itself, rather than require the Executive of the day to take <Col N="700" /> responsibility for, the shape of the Estimates put before the Dáil.  I believe it is wrong in one respect that the whole constitutional basis of the country is that the Government take responsibility for the Estimates and their implementation. I do not think it would be a good idea, and my party will make their attitude clearer to Deputy Noonan's proposal when we have considered it at greater length, for a Government to be forced to implement Estimates they were opposed to.  The whole idea of parliamentary government and of the executive control of public finances, subject to Dáil scrutiny, is that that Government carry forward their programmes in accordance with their priorities and are judged on that.  The peculiar circumstances of this Dáil, that a Government are in a minority without a formalised alliance that allows them to consult with any portion of the House in the formulation of their Estimates, should not be the occasion on which governmental responsibility for public finances is watered down.  It is ironic that a Government who have broken a mould in one respect, in that they have finally become decisive, should be asked to surrender some of their decision-making powers to a party who were gloriously indecisive when they had the reins of Government until very recently. That is not meant to be a crib at Fine Gael, it is meant to just point out a fact, that it is wrong to seek a share of decision-making from the Opposition when they could not make a decision when they sat on the Government benches.</P>

We will do so to note the Estimates.  This is not to be taken, and I repeat this, as approving any individual Estimate or its size.  We are doing so to establish that we are not taking the easy way out, that we are not simply riding on the coat tails of a <Col N="701" /> Government who, on the public finances, are taking overall decisions with which we agree.  We are making it clear that we share the general thrust of where the Government are trying to bring the economy in terms of the public indebtedness and we are willing to take our share of responsibility on that account.  We will be fearless in using our judgment, to the ultimate if necessary, to oppose any individual item on which we disagree.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee to the House such illuminating biblical references &mdash; perhaps in that context the Cistercians were not as successful with me as I assume the Jesuits were with the gentleman on my left.  Those with a sporting background believe that the best form of defence is to attack but it would seem, in relation to the Estimates being discussed, that the Progressive Democrats have decided that the best form of attack is now defence.  Be that as it may, I wish to move the following amendment to the motion before the House, and if you are telling me that technically I cannot move it I will recite my amendment for the benefit of the record.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After &ldquo;Programme&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and Dáil Éireann notes in particular that under the terms of the Estimates 16,000-20,000 public service jobs will be lost, which will seriously affect the extent and quality of the public services; the live register will rise to 356,000 monthly average in 1988; at least 1,200 more hospital beds will be closed and other essential health services will be dismantled; the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools will worsen dramatically; the vital services provided by the National Social Service Board, the Health Education Bureau and An Foras Forbartha will disappear; young people will be discriminated against in their access to training, education and welfare services; expectant mothers will be deprived of certain maternity payments to which they are now entitled; people suffering from disability will be <Col N="702" /> deprived of long duration payments and will pay tax and PRSI on the first 13 weeks; child benefit will be cut; a new housing crisis will develop, with both public and private home construction halved; Ireland's contribution to the Third World, already small, will be cut by 28 per cent; the role of the Ombudsman will be greatly reduced; the ability of our largest industry, agriculture, to contribute to the development of our economy will be seriously weakened by the removal of essential advisory and research services; the capacity of our tourism industry to grow will be greatly inhibited; the contribution possible through State-led industrial development will be drastically reduced: Accordingly, Dáil Éireann, in noting the Estimates, declares also that it has no confidence in the Government, because these Estimates will promote deflation and further unemployment in our economy, give rise to inequality, injustice and poverty; and because they fail to address the fundamental issue of the provision of financial resources on an equitable basis to meet the cost of essential economic and social services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from a short article in last Sunday's, <i>Sunday Independent,</i> a newspaper I do not often quote from, in which the author expresses some surprising thoughts:</P>
    <P>We now have an underclass.  The words &ldquo;poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; are no longer adequate.  Through recession and successive cuts that affect an already deprived group of people &mdash; at least one-third of our society &mdash; we push them down further and open up a huge gap between the &ldquo;have&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now this is where a contradiction comes in.  There is conspicuous wealth around us for all to see.  Each day brings a fresh crop of new deals, takeovers, or whatever.  Hundreds of millions of pounds, even billions, have been added to Stock Exchange share values in just a few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> Millions mentioned everywhere &mdash; companies sold, companies going public, individuals making millions, whizz kids making millions by shuffling paper around and calling it &ldquo;financial services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This article was written by a man who describes himself as a right wing capitalist but who is dismayed by what is happening in our country.  He is one of an increasing number of such people.  How could it be otherwise?  One only has to look around to see poverty and hardship, the real sense of despair which is growing in our so-called Republic.  Those who have eyes to see can no longer comfort themselves with the thought that there is no other way forward.  More and more people are beginning to realise that there is something rotten about a society which has no room for social justice, even in the context of financial constraints.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker in this debate will no doubt trot out the same clichés. If they are on the Government benches they will argue that there is no alternative to the vicious and inhuman cuts contained in the Estimates we are discussing.  They will praise the merits of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of which these Estimates are an inextricable part, holding their hands over their hearts while they insist on its honesty and sense of purpose.  If they are on this side of the House, many of the speakers in the debate will begin by saying that they agree with the overall thrust of the Estimates, but they will then go on to try to make some political capital by attacking aspects of the cuts.  They will try to hammer home their own new but already jaded and banal cliché &mdash;&ldquo;macro right, micro wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate, we will hear a great deal about the debt we owe to foreign banks, but we will not hear too much about the debt we owe to that quarter of a million people who are out of work. We will not hear too much about the debt we owe to our young people, whom we are committed to cherish by our Constitution. We will not hear too much <Col N="704" /> about the debt we owe to the old, the handicapped, or to people living alone.</P>
    <P>And when all the talking is over, most of the Deputies in this House will either troop sheepishly into the Government lobbies, or sit on their hands.  The Estimates will be noted, and injustice and inequality will take another step forward. The Deputies who vote for the Government, and those who abstain, will all be saying the same thing.  They will all be saying that the ideal is dying.  You can call that ideal by any number of names &mdash; the ideal of the Republic; the ideal of a Just Society &mdash; whatever you choose to call it, on Friday next a majority of this House will hammer a nail into its coffin.</P>
    <P>I know that the Labour Party amendment will not be carried, but it will be put to a vote.  Those who support it will do so because they recognise that there are other debts apart from the one we owe to foreign banks.  Those who support it will do so because they still believe in a Republic &mdash; a Republic where equality of opportunity is not to be made secondary to penny-pinching, a Republic where justice will never take second place to selfishness.  They will be a small number of Deputies &mdash; not enough to make a difference to the outcome &mdash; but their vote in this House will be cast for the Republic.  All the fine words from all the so-called Republicans on the other side will not disguise the fact that the majority are going to vote for inequality and for injustice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already told us that anyone who argues that there is some other way of dealing with our problems is misleading the people.  What arrant nonsense this is.  What he has not told us, but what more and more people are coming to realise, is that this is not an economic exercise but a political one. This is the same Taoiseach, after all, who told us that the people were tired of all this talk about cuts, who told us that &ldquo;if economics is the dismal science, then politics must be the science of hope&rdquo;. The politics we are witnessing here is the politics of expediency.</P>
    <P>It is expedient for this Government to seek to out-do all the gurus of the <Col N="705" /> economic right.  The only political mandate for Fianna Fáil is the one that the right have made them a present of.  For as long as Fianna Fáil keep the right prisoner, and for as long as the right is convinced that the well-heeled should not be asked to help solve this country's problems, the poor will have to pay.  For as long as the poor are asked to pay, there is no prospect that this country's problems can be solved.  You cannot solve the debt problem by creating a whole series of social problems.  You cannot create justice by trying to turn this into a society of yuppies and financial services.  You cannot create equality by sacking one teacher in ten, and giving the rest 2.5 per cent and a few extra sticks of chalk.</P>
    <P>That is why we have to waste our time debating what is essentially a phoney exercise.  The vast majority of people know now, even if they are not yet ready to admit it, that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a con trick, and not even a terribly clever one at that.  To listen to Government Ministers on radio and television, offering their unconvincing explanations, and protesting that everyone's dreams will come true if we all just tighten our belts a little further, is small comfort to the growing numbers of people who have nothing left that they can do without.</P>
    <P>If it was not clear before that the entire programme the Government have developed is a house of cards, it is becoming clearer every day.  Examination of one instance alone would be enough to illustrate the point.</P>
    <P>When the Government announced in early summer that they were going to bring the self-employed and farmers within the PRSI net, I regarded the news with a certain degree of scepticism.  I have a certain amount of experience of the very powerful farming and political interests that have prevented this idea being successfully broached in the past. However, the Minister for Social Welfare stated that the total yield from this move would be about £90 million, at the proposed rate of 55 per cent.  The hostility of the IFA and the ICMSA at the time was fairly muted &mdash; clearly they were <Col N="706" /> biding their time for the moment when their influence would be strongest.</P>
    <P>That influence was to be seen in the statement in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> that &ldquo;the Government have decided to introduce PRSI for farmers and the self-employed in 1988 on the basis of income as assessed for income tax purposes&rdquo;.  This proposal was drafted by those involved in the most ambiguous terms possible.  It was designed to keep the main farming organisations on board for the Taoiseach's final stroke of joining the signatures of all the parties to the document.</P>
    <P>The trouble with trying to be all things to all men is that sooner or later you are going to be found out.  The ICTU understood the proposal to mean that PRSI was to be levied on gross income, exactly as in the case of PAYE workers. The ICMSA understood likewise, and had the honesty to say so to the Taoiseach before they parted company on the day the agreement was signed.</P>
    <P>The IFA got a cynical reassurance from the Taoiseach that gross income will be redefined as net income, even though this does not appear anywhere in the text. The ICTU were told not to worry, the rate of PRSI would be increased so the yield would be unchanged.  But the IFA do not want to know about that.  They know that any attempt to discriminate against them by using a higher rate of PRSI would be unconstitutional, and they know it cannot happen.  So before the ink was dry on this deal, the IFA had secured a massive concession from a Government desperate to have their names on the dotted line.  The bully-boy tactics so often associated with the leadership of the IFA had won again.  In return for agreeing to associate themselves with the other social partners, they have been handed back about £40 million in PRSI relief.  If they are brought into the PRSI net now, farmers will get the benefits that other insured workers get &mdash; for a fraction of the contribution.  And this was inserted into the document under the heading &ldquo;Greater Social Equity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have written to the Taoiseach <Col N="707" /> demanding that he clarify the position. To the best of my knowledge no reply has been forthcoming to date.  They are also seeking reassurances that the same contribution will be sought from farmers and the self-employed as from everyone else.  The Minister for Social Welfare might clarify this point in his speech. Many people are wondering why this matter ended up in such a mess on the day the deal was signed.  It warrants clarity because we are led to believe that this deal will see us through to three years of economic activity.  People are entitled to know the exact basis of the deal.  If the Taoiseach is genuinely committed to greater social equity he will make his reply public.  The public are entitled to know.  If, as I suspect, he cannot confirm that there will be full PRSI liability, all trade unionists should take that into account when deciding whether to support the programme as a whole.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere, I have described the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as a series of contricks within a contrick.  I believe, as I have said, that it should be rejected. I cannot accept that it is possible to pick and choose the elements we like &mdash; to accept the pay rise, say, and campaign against the job losses.  Within the public services in particular, there is a deliberate trade-off between jobs and vital services, on the one hand, and small pay increases on the other.  I believe there are many public servants now, especially in the caring professions, who are questioning whether the choice they are being invited to make is worth it.</P>
    <P>Many teachers, for instance, &mdash; and I know this from experience &mdash; are saying now that a 2½ per cent rise is not worth having to watch and be part of a system where increasingly only the children of the rich can be guaranteed a fair chance at education.  Many health workers are questioning if it is acceptable that patient care should suffer, or that their work mates should be fired, or that access to health care should become more and more difficult, in return for a very modest pay increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> I am not arguing here that public servants should be asked to give up this pay agreement.  I do not see any good reason why public servants, who make a valuable contribution and who are subject to the same financial pressures as anyone working in the private sector, should be singled out as scapegoats.  My party will not be supporting the Progressive Democrats' amendment to the motion which seeks to do just that.  What I am saying is that the public service, and public servants themselves, and perhaps most of all the essential functions they perform, are being asked to pay a very heavy price for a pay increase which will not even keep them abreast of inflation, and which will not, whatever the proponents of this agreement might argue, advance the relative position of the lower paid.  By the end of the first year of the operation of the agreement, assuming it lasts that long, the lowest paid public servants will have received an increase of £4 a week; while, for instance, a principal officer in the Civil Service, who is not at the maximum of his or her scale, will have received about £26 a week.  In this area, as in so many others associated with the activities of this Government, the better way of dealing with the real problem was ignored.  At considerably less cost, a cash increase across the board would have made real inroads into the low-pay problem and would have enabled many of the social problems now being exacerbated to be avoided altogether.</P>
    <P>I would question, however, whether this Government have any real interest in generating just and fair solutions.  The Government that can blithely give away the country's oil and gas reserves in the middle of negotiations about the resolution of our problems are not, in my view, a Government who have earned the trust they so badly need.</P>
    <P>That scandalous decision was among the worst this Government have made in a very short period.  All sorts of foolish arguments have been put forward &mdash; such as that a smaller percentage of something is worth more than a larger percentage of nothing.  Arguments like this miss the point.  We will now, as a result of the <Col N="709" /> changes this Government have made, get absolutely no return whatever from the development of any foreseeable oil find. This Government have made a present of perhaps £70 million to a small group of individuals.  We cannot even be sure, given the conniving attitude expressed so far, that any oil developed will be landed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is most serious about this development is that there has been, up to now, a certain level of national consensus about how we should view our natural resources &mdash; even parties that did not really believe it were prepared to pay lip service to the notion that the natural resources of Ireland belonged to the people of Ireland.  In the breaking of that consensus, and in their cold-blooded decision to give those resources away, Fianna Fáil have committed what I have already described as an act of economic treason, one for which I believe they should not be forgiven by the young people and by the people at large.</P>
    <P>They are good, of course, at paying lip service.  Another example of this is the apparent lengths they have gone to reassure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that they have no designs on privatising our semi-State industries.  Many statements were made over the past few weeks particularly when the plan was announced, that this Government have no plans to privatise any semi-State industries.  But the question must be asked: how are those assurances to be reconciled with the reported comments of the Taoiseach and other Ministers that they are considering &ldquo;without any hangups&rdquo; the possible sale of the Irish Life Assurance Company?</P>
    <P>This is another potentially sinister development.  The media are being told on a daily basis, by the management of Irish Life among others, that up to £200 million could be raised for the State by the privatisation of the company.  The truth is that this company is worth a great deal more than £200 million, at least twice that amount.  There is a campaign underway to undervalue the company, and the only motivation possible behind such a <Col N="710" /> campaign is to make a financial killing for somebody.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Irish Life have at present some £200 million in free reserves over the solvency margin, which would be allocated between the policyholders and the company in the event of privatisation. But, in addition, the company have accumulated very substantial profits and now have hidden reserves of some £310 million, from a base of some £2,000 million working for policyholders.  These hidden reserves have never been mentioned before, and their existence means that the company is a great deal more valuable than its management says it is. The question must be asked why has there been such an obvious attempt to undervalue the company, unless there is an interest in selling it cheaply?  The value of Irish Life is of course only one of the issues that arise in relation to the possible privatisation of that company.  There are many others, which I have dealt with in the past in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil obsession with the financial institutions and with financial services generally, is an area that requires additional comment.  I believe there are very few people in this country who are not deeply uneasy about the way in which this whole sector operates.  For instance, the Sunday papers last week carried a full page advertisement for one of our building societies.  The message of that advertisement was very clear &mdash; is said, if you have lots of money to invest, we have ways of hiding it for you.  The entire emphasis in the advertisement was on confidentiality.  It was an invitation to hot money &mdash; no questions asked.</P>
    <P>Is this what this country needs right now?  Does this country need all this talk of financial services as being the panacea for all our problems?  Day after day we are being told that the new financial services centre in the Custom House Docks will create the prestigious jobs we need, and will attract the sort of investment we need into the country.  I have yet to hear a Government Minister, or anyone else, who knows exactly what financial services even means.  And yet, if we are to believe <Col N="711" /> all the hype, the Holy Grail is to be found in 27 derelict acres of Dublin dockland.</P>
    <P>But is it?  Are we really going to see 7,500 extra jobs in this area; or are we going to see a small number of firm's being given substantial tax breaks to re-locate from Dawson Street to the docks? Are we going to see substantial new investment, or are we going to see more loopholes for the exclusive use of the wealth-skimming establishment of Dublin?  Will the development of the area mean new life and new opportunities for the disadvantaged community that lives there, or will it mean the breaking up of the community?  Are we seeking highly mobile capital to locate here, with no guarantee that it will last longer than a year or two?  Are we making ourselves dependent on highly competitive ventures, which might well fail in the extraordinarily competitive environment in which they will be operating?  Despite all the glamour and mystique, are we getting ourselves hooked on an illusion in relation to financial services?</P>
    <P>We are being dragged headlong into a new development here without any explanation of all the issues involved, without any safeguards to assure us that all of this hype will really lead to a major contribution.  In all the political parties in this House we have accumulated a great deal of experience in the financial sector. &ldquo;Service&rdquo; is not a word we have tended to associate with that sector in the past &mdash; especially community service.  Few of us would have said before now that patriotism was high on the list of priorities of the financial sector as we have seen it operate.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I believe that we in this House should be demanding two things in relation to this whole area.  We should be seeking a full inquiry into the operations of our existing financial institutions, with a view to determining the extent &mdash; the very large extent, in my view &mdash; to which their contribution to the national good can be improved.</P>
    <P>We should be demanding that the Government produce a full White Paper <Col N="712" /> on the development of the financial services industry.  There is a huge variety of questions that need answers, if we are to be satisfied that this development is really in the interests of all the people of this country, instead of being an opportunity for the very few to skim more of the country's wealth off the top.  Next year, to attract the kind of investment that the Government envisage, the people of this country will forego about £30 million in corporation taxes, at a time when corporation taxes are already diminishing dramatically and the PAYE burden is rising more and more steeply.  Surely the people of this country are entitled to a full explanation as to why this is necessary and desirable, and what the long term implications are.  They are entitled to be told what safeguards their Government are building in to prevent abuse, and what opportunities and spin-offs will exist for them.  In the absence of that kind of clear, detailed exposé of this new area, the commitment to the development of this mysterious sector must be looked at with a great deal of scepticism.</P>
    <P>There is one final, essential, point that I must make here.  This debate is taking place against a background of panic on the world's Stock Exchanges.  There are a number of aspects to that situation to which I must refer.  First, the developments that we have witnessed over the last few days reveal a lot.  They reveal the basic weakness in some of the economies most affected.  Commentators have known for some time, for example, that the Japanese Stock Market was greatly overvalued, despite all that country's economic successes.  It has been said many times in the past that a crisis was inevitable in the American Stock Markets, because of the fundamental problems that economy is facing, with a combination of very large borrowings and an imbalance of trade.  These are the economies to which we are looking in the hope of attracting investment.</P>
    <P>The developments we have been witnessing also say a great deal about the instability inherent in the financial world, and particularly the financial services world.  Great fortunes have been made <Col N="713" /> by the people who shuffle paper in this world, but they have been made by people who are playing a form of Russian roulette.  Now the gun has gone off and, whatever happens to the high-flyers in the next few weeks, ordinary people have to go on making a living.  We can see now that paper shuffling, no matter how it is hyped up, is not wealth creation.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise too.  It is particularly interesting &mdash; and I hope instructive for some Deputies in this House &mdash; that by the end of yesterday, the value of many of the State enterprises nationalised in Britain was 40 per cent below its peak, greatly inhibiting their capacity to borrow and invest, and perhaps even threatening the future of some of them.  Those who keep talking about how easy it would be for State companies to attract new investment here if they were privatised conveniently forgot to tell us that there is a down side to that equation also which many of those industries will now face in the context of the Stock Exchange collapse in Britain.</P>
    <P>It is still too early to say whether there are long term implications arising from the disturbances of the last few days. There may well be.  The crash in 1929 occurred principally because most of the speculators of the day were gambling with borrowed money.  Their losses led in turn to bank collapses, with a resultant world-wide crisis.  If the same pattern is followed today &mdash; and we must hope it is not &mdash; the situation for a country which is heavily in debt to those same banks could be very bleak.</P>
    <P>By the same token, we must surely take note of the lessons for a system of economic management which ignores the need to plan, which relies exclusively on speculators and on a climate of confidence for investment, and which is more and more dependent on low interest rates.</P>
    <P>Above all, the lesson we must learn is that our people are entitled to know what is going on.  I mentioned earlier the need for a White Paper on the subject of the financial services industry.  Surely the events of the last few days must reinforce that need?  I hope the Government will <Col N="714" /> take note of this point before we go down the road of financial services.</P>
    <P>There is still a great fear that we are obliging banking institutions which are already located in this country, on the basis of making the Customs House Docks site attractive from the point of view of tax relief and more attractive than the locations they already have in this city.  If we are to become dependent on this highly volatile world, the people are entitled to know what is happening. There is only one way in which that can happen &mdash; and it may not be 100 per cent foolproof &mdash; to establish a committee of this House or a White Paper to be published by the Government before we venture down the road on which the Government seem to be totally relying at present for any new incentives or job creation.  It is essential that this House is better informed.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with many Members of the House about what they believe will happen in relation to financial services and I do not believe many of them are well informed on what will happen, the opportunities and the very basis upon which this site is being created. We have not been informed of the consequential knock-on effects in relation to the existing management of our financial affairs by the banking institutions already in this country.  The Government must clarify these matters and give the House an opportunity to examine the issues before we commit ourselves to the building programme under discussion and the tax relief involved.  As the protectors of the taxpayers we are entitled to discuss the ramifications of the proposed Customs House Docks site and the financial services which will be operated from within that site.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about some particular aspects of the Estimates. The Government established a commission to inquire into health funding: that in itself says a lot.  This is a Government which have never devoted any time to thinking about what kind of a health service we need in this country &mdash; what the mix should be between hospital and community care; what rights of access <Col N="715" /> people should have; what minimum level of service it is essential to maintain; what priorities there should be as between different types of care; what level of training is necessary to keep going.  This Government have never thought about any of these things &mdash; but they have thought about how much it should all cost.  The bottom line has been how much we can pare off the cost without actually killing anyone.</P>
    <P>In a recent document, the Catholic Bishops' Conference made a number of points very forcibly.  Among other things, they reaffirmed that a decent, accessible level of health care is a basic human right. They pointed out that there is growing inequity in our system of health care. They recognised that there is increasingly a two-tier system in operation and that the State, which is failing to provide adequate care for people on low incomes, is subsidising this development to a massive degree.  They say:</P>
    <P>The ultimate result can only be a residual and deteriorating service, with the best professionals leaving the public system altogether, not only because of the earnings attraction of the private system but because the environment and facilities of the public system will not permit a level of excellence in care.</P>
    <P>In this situation there will truly be a &ldquo;poor service for poor people&rdquo;.  The unacceptability of this is all the greater given social class differentials in health status: &ldquo;the poorer members of society are sick more often and die younger&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These points, I would emphasise, are made by the Catholic Bishops' Conference in a thoughtful and well-argued submission to the Government.  This submission was made before the Estimates were published.</P>
    <P>What has this Government's response been?  The cuts they have unveiled in the Estimates this year are, in fact, three times greater and more savage than those of last year.  Last year's Estimates led to hardship on an unprecedented scale for many thousands of people &mdash; I have to <Col N="716" /> say that this year's Estimates will kill people.  The Government have gone too far.  The health service will not be able to sustain the cuts that have now been made, which are stood over by the Government and which the House will accept before the week is over.</P>
    <P>I repeat &mdash; unless this Government can be persuaded, or forced, to change their minds about the cuts they are now making, people will die.  They will die in hospitals and they will die because they are unable to get into hospitals.  There are parts of this country now where patients are being accommodated in corridors, where wards are left unattended at night, where patients have to be carried up several flights of stairs after intensive surgery.  There are hospital staffs all over the country working under stresses and strains that this year will become finally intolerable.  I cannot emphasise the point enough &mdash; our health service cannot function with the level of resources that have been allocated to it under the present Estimates.</P>
    <P>This is not a case where anyone in this House can say they agree with the overall thrust of policy, but they would implement it differently.  The bottom line here is that too much is being taken out of our health service.  Those who believe they can hide behind the assertion that they would make minor changes here and there are missing the fundamental point. Every Deputy in this House who supports the Health Estimate is going to bear a very heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>The same is true of education.  How can any Minister for Education, particularly given the performance of the present Minister for Education in this House for the last four years, come before this House and pretend that our primary sector has enough resources?  How can you have too many teachers in this sector?  What are this Government trying to do?  It is already the case that the primary sector is the poor relation of the education system, with overcrowded classrooms, inadequate facilities and no back-up.  The long-term implications of what this Government are doing to the primary sector are horrendous.  They will <Col N="717" /> increase disadvantage and inequality in our community and will ensure a legacy of alienation and hostility to the structures of society in the areas of most disadvantage in our country.</P>
    <P>In general terms this Government are sowing a whirlwind.  The documents they are asking this House to note are a testament to injustice and selfishness, and the so-called plan of which they are a part is a monument to division.  Their whole approach is an insult to planning, and a dangerous portent for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>I am asking this House to reject this document and this approach.  I am asking Members of this House to ask themselves seriously if the time has not come to reject a society built on injustice and selfishness, and instead to set about the task of planning and building a society built on justice and equality.</P>
    <P>I would direct members of the Fianna Fáil Party and members of the public who keep a close eye on the development of politics to read some of the statements &mdash; they do not have to read them all because the amount of repetition would bore anybody &mdash; made incessantly and inanely over the past four years by the then leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, now Taoiseach, attacking the efforts being made by the Government of the day.  I ask members of the Fianna Fáil Party how they can justify to their activists or their Cumainn throughout the country their actions in Government and how they can equate those actions with the statements made by the Minister for Education.  It is not enough to say to the Irish people: &ldquo;Now, I am the Minister for Education&rdquo;.  The voters and the electorate are entitled to logical explanations as to why actions in the area of education are being taken.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister for Social Welfare that people are entitled to explanations when the benefits for which they have contributed for many years in their working lives are being reduced and taken away from people who, through PRSI and taxes, have been paying hand over fist for many years.  I do not know how the Minister for Social Welfare can justify <Col N="718" /> his actions to these people.  There seems to be a view expressed by Members of this House that people get sick deliberately and that people have accidents at work deliberately so that they can get benefits from the schemes which were originally set up to protect workers' rights and to give them some basic entitlement and dignity when accidents happen at work or when, through no fault of their own, they are sick.  We are not only cutting back on the medical care which will be available to those people, we are now cutting back on the benefits to which they are entitled.  If three years' stamps were required last year in order to obtain benefit, five years' stamps will now be required.  I cannot understand how the Minister for Social Welfare can stand over these decisions to dismantle entitlements which have been built up through years of negotiation on behalf of the working people in our community &mdash; workers who are in many cases on very meagre salaries and who have difficulty in coping and providing for their families.</P>
    <P>It would appear that, under the terms and the tenor of the documents that have been unfolded by the Government &mdash; the so-called plan for recovery and the Estimates &mdash; these people who are already living in difficult circumstances will now have foisted upon them higher school transport charges and worsening conditions for their children in schools, particularly in the primary sector which all Members of the House will agree is the sector which we have a basic responsibility to protect.  We hope that all children in our society will at least have the benefit of primary education but we are now ensuring that, while they may still have access to primary education, the quality of education will be reduced and there will be increased pressures on teachers, described by a member of the INTO last week as crowd control instead of teaching.</P>
    <P>That is not an exaggeration.  Classes will consist of 40 and 50 pupils.  A teacher once explained to my mother when she complained about the quality of education that he was lucky to know her son's name because there were 51 other pupils <Col N="719" /> in the class.  Unfortunately, that will be the position again, having made progress in the past 15 years.  I say to the Members of this House and to the members of the Government that that is not good enough.  People are entitled to a fair deal.  They will give their response to the Government when the first opportunity arises, be it in terms of local elections, European elections or any other election.</P>
    <P>The course which the Government are pursuing is the wrong course because it is based on the notion that we cannot afford justice or equality.  If Members of this House who will voice their disgust and their objections to individual aspects of these Estimates are against them, they cannot have the luxury which they are seeking, that they accept the overall Estimates but there are nicer or easier ways of implementing them.  You either accept the lot or you accept nothing.  That is the proposition before this House.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I urge the House to reject these Estimates.  They are not the solution to the problems facing the country and they are not even a signpost to the right direction to solve the problems. I urge Members of this House, particularly those who do not have any formal ties with the Government of the day, to reject the motion before the House and to support the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Spring I can only think that he has a hard neck to speak in such a way having witnessed an increase of almost 100,000 in the unemployment figures in the four to four and a half years in which he was in office.  The Government, of which he was a member, failed to bring in any form of PRSI for the self-employed, which I am sure he would like to have done, in the course of that period.</P>

The National Pensions Board are in the course of finalising a report on that matter which I will have at the end of this month.  My officials are currently doing an actuarial study on it also.  It will, of course, have to relate to the cost of providing the services and will result in savings to the Exchequer against the outgoings that are there at present.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>

    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill that is being moved by the Progressive Democrats. It is appropriate, on a day on which we have spent so much time discussing the Estimates for 1988 and rightly coming to terms with the economic difficulties that confront this country, that we should this evening turn our attention to something that is causing not just disquiet among the public but is turning so many people away from the democratic process when they look to Leinster House and Dáil Éireann and see there people who, they believe, prefer to look after themselves rather than do what is necessary in the interest of the country.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker in this debate was the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Barry Desmond. Had he not been asked just before he finished which way his party were voting and indicated that he was supporting this Bill I would have been very surprised indeed to find that he was supporting it. He made one of the best speeches against this Bill that one could possibly make. Deputy Desmond referred to our Bill as a rather simplistic measure and I agree with him there.  It is a simple measure.  It is a question of whether we in this House believe it right and appropriate that we should pay pensions to serving Members of this House, of the European Parliament and of the Judiciary while they are still drawing salaries from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say that 99 per cent of the people support the measure we are putting forward in this Bill might be even to underestimate it.  Other than the people in <Col N="722" /> receipt of these pensions, their families and close friends, I doubt if any person does not believe it is appropriate 50 years on since Dr. Shanley sat on his committee to make changes in this regard.  We have not just serious economic difficulties.  We have a huge young population who are fed up with the traditional political response they get from politicians on both sides of the House.  They are fed up with the answers that tell them that in order for progress to be made, in order to move forward, we have always to refer measures to one kind of committee or another.</P>
    <P>When people marched for tax reform, instead of the Members of this House bringing in tax reform, we set up a committee or a commission and a number of years on, despite the fact that public money was spent compiling a report on that, it has never been debated on the floor of this House.  The same occurred in relation to social welfare.  We all recognise the problem there.  Many people in our society unfortunately have to live on an inadequate income.  We set up a commission to look after that and, again, despite the fact that they produced their report over a year and a half ago, that report has never been discussed in this House either.  We have had committees on child care facilities and a host of other matters.  We are adept in this House at putting things on the long finger, promising progress sometime down the road or setting up the famous Dáil committee or outside committee to tell us what we should be doing.  We are great at ignoring the recommendations of these committees yet when it comes to something that affects ourselves our attitude is different.  Deputy Noonan from Fine Gael and others in this House have told us in the last few days that we should await the outcome of the Gleeson Committee before making any decision whatever in this matter.  Everybody in his heart knows that that is an excuse, simply putting the matter away for some future date hoping that it will never come up again.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when the Gleeson Committee were appointed their terms of reference, which I have before me <Col N="723" /> here, did not include reviewing the payment of ministerial pensions to former office holders.  Apparently some time later, no doubt when we published our Bill, they were asked to look at that.</P>
    <P>Many things need changing in the House and I would be the first to say that in relation to the payment of Oireachtas salaries of all kinds we need review.  I agree with the speeches made on that. We need to review the procedures in this House which are so archaic that it is sometimes impossible to raise burning issues of the day on the floor of the House.  When they are raised it is only with great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach made a very eloquent speech about the need to tighten our belts.  He said that the whole community must play their part in bringing this country back to economic survival. That involved the whole community; nobody must opt out.  It seems to me that everybody in the country must play his or her part except the people affected by this Bill.  When politicians try to sell tough measures, when they go around the country rightly preaching a message that there are no easy answers, no free lunches, no money readily available for so many projects, is it any wonder that people rise up and ask about the money spent on X, Y or Z, on paying pensions to serving Members of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>I agree that the amount of money involved is not great.  It would not do much.  Sister Stanislaus said today that it would keep the 400 homeless children of Dublin in a refuge for a number of years. Others have spoken about what it might do in particular areas, and no doubt we could all pick out a number of projects and say that if this Bill were passed this or that project could get support.  We might not have to reduce the allocation to the Combat Poverty Agency of £300,000. The amount of money involved here is £250,000 per year; it is not great but good example is being set because it indicates once and for all to the rest of the community whether we are serious about tackling the injustices that exist particularly when they affect ourselves.  Is it <Col N="724" /> any wonder that most people believe that politicians will tackle all the problems except those that affect them?  We must get away from the committee and the commission and the all-party approach to solving difficult problems.</P>
    <P>People in this House are elected to make decisions and even when those decisions are difficult and affect ourselves, it is there more than anywhere else that we must show that we are capable of leading by example.  In that regard I am very pleased that the two members of my party who were in receipt of these pensions have decided individually and of their own free will to give up these pensions from the end of this year.  Many people in this House and outside it, I am sure will say, &ldquo;sure, they probably can afford it anyway.&rdquo; I am aware of the enormous sacrifice that both of those men are making.  They both have young families. They are both full-time Members of this House.  They have given fantastic service to this country as Ministers in various Governments for a number of years.  They have served, in one case, for over 20 years and in the other, for almost 20 years as Members of Dáil Éireann and they have served their respective constituencies very well.</P>
    <P>I am not pleased that they are giving up their pensions just because of the amount of money saved, £16,000 or whatever it will be, but I am pleased that at least two people in this House are prepared to lead by example, that the public can see that they are not like the rest, that they are prepared to make sacrifices and are prepared, as it were, to put their money where their mouth is.  I am very pleased that at least we have two such Members.  Others might follow their example.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed, and not just at the kind of response I hear from Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil because to some extent I expect the nice answers on radio or television when they almost explain that the thing is wrong, that we must look at it, that changes must be made, and so on.  If you really believe a thing is wrong the time to show that it is wrong is not when you are on radio or television but <Col N="725" /> next Wednesday at 8.30 p.m. when this Bill will be voted on.  There is no point in telling me or anybody in this House or in this country in any words, any rhetoric, that payment of ministerial pensions to serving Members of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary, the European Parliament or whatever, is wrong if you do not vote for that principle next Wednesday at 8.30 p.m.  There is no point in making excuses or in expecting Dermot Gleeson and his committee to do what the Dáil should do.  He has not got a vote here on next Wednesday.  The Deputies here have a vote and they were elected to make the decisions.  Earlier today when the Taoiseach was talking about the things that need to be done he said regretfully:</P>
    <P>The policies which we have adopted are dictated entirely by the fiscal and economic realities.  I wish to state again categorically that they are not being undertaken for any ideological reason or political motives.  They are not policies of the left or right, but policies dictated by the sheer necessity of economic survival.</P>
    <P>That is the second time in recent days that the Taoiseach went to great pains to explain that he does not agree with what he is doing but that he has to do it anyway. Perhaps there are people in this House who do not agree with the way they will vote on this Bill, but they will do it any way because it suits them.  They know it is wrong.  Everybody in this House who does not receive a pension knows that this should be changed.  I have spoken to many of them who have said that this should be changed and that this issue more than any other is something that the public constantly refer to.  The public say &ldquo;do not tell me about reform; do not tell me you really care or that you are going to make sacrifices; show me by changing the ministerial pensions regulations&rdquo;. If a person earning more than £6.50 if single, and approximately £8 if married, applies for a non-contributory old age pension, the excess is deducted from the old age pension.  Is it any wonder that people with means of the order of £6 or £8 per week are disillusioned when <Col N="726" /> Members of this House receive pensions of over £14,000 per annum?  Can any one blame them if they are fed up with the political system and if they consider that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are the same, only looking after themselves while everyone else can live in hardship?</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the people who have to beg for sums of £5,000 or £7,000 to keep a voluntary organisation going, who have to come to politicians like me, to Government Ministers and to the media to make appeals on radio and television, are beginning to despair?  Is it any wonder that they do not really care who they talk to because they believe we are all the same, feathering our own nests? Can we convince them we are not when we have an attitude such as the one we have to this Bill?  Is it any wonder that so few young people care about any of the political parties?  Many are going outside of what we would regard as the normal democratic process in order to express their political opinions.  They are doing this not because they believe it is right but to protest against a corrupt political system.  Is it any wonder that the people I met yesterday who could not get £70,000 to build an enterprise centre to provide jobs in Tallaght where there are 70 per cent of the people unemployed, are in despair?  One Government Minister said that if they could raise the money locally, he would help them, despite the fact that 70 per cent of the people there are unemployed.  Is it any wonder that those people said that they were fed up with the politics of this country and that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were all the same?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in relation to the way Deputies are paid, to the whole operation of Oireachtas salaries and allowances and so on.  I agree with that.  I agree with having fewer <Col N="727" /> Members in this House and with having them full-time.  We have far too many TDs.  We do not need the Seanad.  For the Progressive Democrats this is the first step which is necessary along a road of institutional reform.  Getting rid of the Seanad is part of it and getting full time TDs is part of it as is having fewer TDs &mdash; a 100 or so would be more than enough. Much reform is necessary but this is the first measure and this House will show by its voting next week whether or not it is serious about reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister last week had to go back to 1937 to justify the payment of these pensions.  The Minister referred to the Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial and other Salaries of 1937 under Dr. John Shanley.  Michael Noonan accepted his justification as well.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  Deputy Michael Noonan used the same committee to justify his party's stance on this issue.  We had to go back 50 years to continue to justify something which we all know to be wrong.  Many people have to make enormous sacrifices.  The Minister in his address said that people who serve in office make a lot of sacrifices.  I agree with that.  They make enormous sacrifices in terms of finance, in terms of time with their families and so on.  But, so do a lot of other people.  The Irish Shipping workers made a lot of sacrifices on behalf of this country and yet they were left by Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues stranded pensionless all over the world.  Even last week many of them were protesting outside this House, wondering what would happen to their pensions. Their sacrifices do not seem to matter. Thousands of people who have been made redundant have made huge sacrifices and many have been left penniless. We must show that we are interested in <Col N="728" /> fairness and justice and we should go to great lengths not to treat ourselves as everybody else, but to make a little more of a sacrifice because of the job we are expected to do.  People do not go into politics to be rewarded.  If they do, they are misguided, they should be in something else.  What we want in politics are people dedicated to looking after the affairs of the country, people who are prepared to look objectively at the issues and make decisions in the interests of the common good.  That means having to make hard decisions that affect many people.  It means having to do things one might not like doing.  The best way to sell tough measures is by leading by example, by making sacrifices and by showing that we really care about the way parliamentary politics is run and organised.</P>
      <P>I would refer for a moment to something I read in <i>The Irish Independent</i> last Saturday.  I do so, not to bring the person involved into politics because he is above politics.  I am referring to the President. I read that he had given up his pension some time ago.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, if passed will save the Exchequer in this year and perhaps in each subsequent year £250,000.  If pensions were only to be applied to people when they reached the age of 65, as an energetic journalist from <i>The Irish Press</i> worked out the other day, we could save up to £3 million per annum.  That may be too much to expect because, if we cannot get this measure passed, we will not be <Col N="729" /> able to pass the additional measures required to save that amount of money.</P>
    <P>We do not bring forward this Bill simply as a finance saving exercise.  There is that involved and it is not a lot of money, but I think it can go a long way in terms of what some people require from the State.  There are many organisations that could benefit enormously by it.  We bring it forward simply to show that at this time, in 1987, the politicians of this country began to lead by example, began to show that we were prepared to try to get rid of the cynicism and the distrust and the confusion that exists in this country in terms of the people and the attitudes towards the people who serve in this House.  All of us know when we canvass at doorsteps or get involved with ordinary members of the public who are not involved in any political party that invariably many of them say: &ldquo;You are all the same, it does not really matter who is there; you all look after number one first&rdquo;.  If we pass this Bill, if we make that small sacrifice that already some Members of this House have done without the Bill being passed at all, we will help to restore confidence in the political process and in the politicians who serve in the Dáil at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are people in the Labour Party who apparently do not agree with the Bill, but they are going to vote for it anyway.  I wish there were more people in the House who would even do that. But I want to call on the members of Fine Gael in particular.  This Government is a minority Government.  The Workers' Party are committed to supporting this Bill.  The Labour Party have already indicated they are.  If Fine Gael, instead of sitting down next Wednesday night or simply voting for their amendment which is so meaningless that it does not really matter whether they vote for it or not, were to use their influence in this House and vote for our measure, then Second Stage would be passed and we would be on the way to getting rid of what everybody, other than the people affected by it, regard as a terrible anomaly.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not asking too much. <Col N="730" /> Deputy Mitchell who is here on behalf of Fine Gael tonight is their spokesperson on social welfare.  He knows as well as I do that for the thousands of families depending on social welfare each week to survive, the passing of this Bill will be an important step towards showing them that there are others prepared to make sacrifices.  He represents a constituency like my own, with very high levels of unemployment and many people, particularly young people, turning away from the politics we have been used to here for so long.  I hope that many of them will continue to turn to a new party that is prepared to shake this country up and look at new ways without falling back on the excuses that come from 1937 or whatever.  He knows that this measure is important to many of those people because it will prove once and for all that we are interested in tackling the things that affect ourselves.</P>
    <P>The debate has widened into other issues such as the payment of Dáil salaries and allowances for Members of the Oireachtas which are not really the issue. The issue is simply the payment of ministerial pensions.  Last week we saw in a Dáil reply the kind of money involved, £14,000 in relation to one person and other amounts varying up to £10,000. There are young people in this House, people as young as I, who will have £3,000 for the rest of their lives by way of pension in addition to other salaries.  That cannot be justified.  Some people in the House will say that the pension was not brought in for those people but for older people, to reward people of ability.</P>
    <P>Of course it is not always the case that people of ability serve in Government. There are many able people in this House who have never served in Government and possibly never will.  Some are possibly more able than those that do.  It is not a question of ability.  Ability is sometimes confused with promotion, and given the way we promote people on political patronage, I doubt very much if we will always have the best people to serve in ministerial positions.  Nonetheless the excuse is made that the pension is there to reward the able, the <Col N="731" /> experienced, those who have given long service as Ministers.  I would not regard three years service in Government as long service and justifying the payment of a pension for the rest of one's life. Three years as a junior Minister is not, by any stretch of the imagination, long service.  In fact, it is short.  For younger Members promoted to junior Ministries, it is a lot of money to have for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Colley was moving this Bill she said that for the Progressive Democrats it was the first stage of bringing forward in this House for debate a number of measures that will change not just one parliamentary institution but many of the other institutions under which we are governed.  Many of them urgently need review.  They are not serving the functions for which they were established and have long outlived their usefulness.  Nowhere is that more relevant than in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment want to accept defeat because there is plenty of time for people in both parties to change their minds.  I am sure many of them have met numbers of people who want this Bill passed not because of the money but because of the principle and the example we are prepared to make through decisions that affect ourselves.  In the context of the debate we had earlier, the tough decisions that are necessary, the sacrifices that people must make over the next number of months, we have had cuts right across the board except where it affects the Members of this House.  Let us try to end the cynicism.  Let us try to begin a process of restoring faith in this House and in the Members who serve in it.  Let not everybody in this House be tarred with the same brush.  I am pleased that two people have set an example.  I hope others will follow.  They may not do so today or next week but I have no doubt that there are many decent people in this country who want to work for change and for the image of politics, who will continue to put on pressure until this kind of measure is introduced, and I hope it will not be too long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael have between them enough votes to carry this Bill through Second Stage. We are not hung up on the wording.  We will accept changes from whatever source but let us accept the principle and we can get down to changing the words, if that is what is involved.  Let nobody in this House who votes against this Bill next week get up on any platform, radio programme on television programme and pretend they are against payment of ministerial pensions but are waiting for some committee to make the decision for us.</P>
    <P>Even giving up the pension is almost impossible.  It is almost necessary to bring in lawyers.  Yet, if an old age pensioner decided to give up his pension, or if a woman decided she did not want her child benefit and threw the book in the fire, there is no doubt that they would hear no more from the powers that be but giving up this ministerial pension is almost impossible.  It almost takes a miracle. That indicates just how much we have tied ourselves up in red tape to protect the Members of this House, not the people we are elected to serve and lead. We should do that leading by example, particularly by showing that we are going to end the anomalies that affect ourselves.</P>

      <P>This Bill touches on a very major cause of a lot of our problems. If we are not able to pay or provide the conditions of service that attract the best of people into the State sector, whether in the Dáil, in the public service or in the wider public sector, we will not get them. The question of ministerial pensions cannot be isolated from the general question. Of course it is a sacrifice for Members in receipt of such pensions to give them up.  It represents a loss and if it is to be taken as being devoid of all political opportunism it is a wholly worthy exercise but, unfortunately, it appears from what Deputy Harney and other members of the Progressive Democrats have said that there is another motive.  I am not saying there is not a motive of self-sacrifice but the other motive is to milk this otherwise worthy <Col N="733" /> move for all its political worth.  That discredits the self-sacrifice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what salary Deputy Colley has from her practice as a solicitor and I do not know how much Deputy McDowell earns in the Law Library.  I do not want to take those earnings from those Deputies but I am anxious to make a fundamental point.  I do not want to take away from Deputy Mac Giolla his ESB pension.  The question raised in the Bill is an important one. It seems wrong in practice to pay what are called pensions to those who are still active in this House.  In other walks of life such payments, called increments or cushion money, are paid to people who take a substantial drop in salary on leaving office.</P>
      <P>This gives rise to the whole question of trying to get the best people into the public sector.  Without seeking to nullify the intentions of the Bill I must point out that one of the greatest problems facing us is that we cannot attract the best people available to this House.  I suggest that if Members scan the list of able Members who belong to the Progressive Democrats they will see that none of them comes from the business sector. What businessman could afford to give up his position to become a Member of the House?</P>

      <P>This House could do with an injection of business expertise.  I do not mind members of the Progressive Democrats heckling me during what I hope is a not unsympathetic contribution but it is important that we consider how things should work here.  If we demean the work of public representatives it will be no surprise if the public demean that work.  I agree with Deputy Harney that if the Bill was put to a referendum it <Col N="734" /> would be carried by a two to one majority, because it is popular to call for a cut in the pay of TDs and some people consider that we are too well paid. However, I consider that to be a cosmetic point which does not bear examination.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of employment of TDs since 1938 have been fixed by independent commissions.  Almost invariably those commissions have recommended higher rates of remuneration and better conditions of service than have been adopted.  Only a few months ago a 15 per cent interim increase was recommended by a commission. That body reported that terms and conditions were so bad commensurate with the responsibility and the type of people who should be enticed into politics that an interim increase in pay of 15 per cent should be paid.  However, because of our economic position the Government shot down that recommendation.  A similar recommendation was made in respect of higher civil servants and that was shot down.</P>
      <P>We pay secretaries of Government Departments £38,000 per annum and those individuals have huge responsibilities. Frequently they must go to the marketplace to try to recruit executives to run such concerns as the ESB, Aer Lingus, our rail company or our broadcasting corporation but they cannot attract the best people.  Is it any wonder that our electricity charges are so much higher than in other European countries, a point made by Deputy McDowell?  Is it any wonder that our telecommunications charges are so high when there is no way under our system of (a) recognising responsibility and rewarding it and (b) recognising achievement and rewarding it.  There is a more fundamental point than the mere question of ministerial pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in charge of the Department of Communications I was responsible for many State companies all of which, with the exception of B &amp; I, are now in better shape than they were four years ago.  It is my belief that they could be in better shape if we were able to recruit more experienced executives.  We <Col N="735" /> could not do that because we could not reward them adequately.  We cannot hire for the State sector or encourage into Parliament the best people available because we cannot reward them adequately.  The sacrifices by Deputies Dessie O'Malley and Molloy are praiseworthy but they are minor points compared to the central issue: how can we run our public affairs better and get the best people involved?</P>
    <P>In the UK where a great deal of economic recovery is taking place the Government have taken steps to break away from the old system and varied the level of salary paid to Departmental secretaries and they have broken all norms by deciding to pay competitive salaries to those who take on the responsibility of running major State organisations.</P>

If the policy I favour was followed in the past ten years we would not be in the economic mess we are in today. We would not have the chaos that has occurred in the State sector.

We are not able to recognise achievement.

Of one thing we can be certain, that that salary is a great deal less than would be paid for commensurate responsibility in the private sector.  We must change these things.  We must do this urgently.  Take, for instance, the health sector.</P>

      <P>I would submit that I should not be looking at Deputy McDowell, either.  What I have to say is more pertinent to the question before us than the biblical references of Deputy McDowell half an hour ago.  We cannot recognise achievement, as I said.  We cannot reward achievement by pay in the State sector.  As a result, we are not getting the quality of people into the State sector, whether it be the Dáil, the Civil Service, or State companies.  Let us look at the list of people who have left the Civil Service in the past couple of years and goodness knows there are many more able people in the public service who will have opportunities of earning much more outside the public service in the coming <Col N="738" /> months and years.  It is a very major problem.</P>
      <P>I was going to make a point about the health sector before Deputy McDowell interjected.  Let us take the health boards.  No chief executive can be rewarded, even if he had gone out himself and reduced the expenditure of the health boards.  He will not be recognised, so why have the hassle?  However, if he could be recognised, I suspect we would have had much less growth in health expenditure over the past number of years than we have had.  I suspect we would have had much less of a crisis than we now have in the health sector &mdash; fewer problems and less hardship.  If we had had that sort of performance in the health and other sectors, we would have much less unemployment today.  We know the old saying: &ldquo;Pay peanuts and you get monkeys&rdquo;. While we are still very lucky to have in this House, in the other House and in the public service people of very great ability, they are only human and they will be attracted by better salaries and better conditions elsewhere.  This is a very serious point.  It is a very basic problem in how we do things.  It is a very major flaw.  If we are to get this economy going again, one major change will have to be introduced, that is, of being able to reward achievement in the public sector.</P>
      <P>To come precisely to the Bill, I have no doubt that what is proposed in it would meet with a very warm welcome indeed among the general public.  That is understandable, especially when there are so many people living on, for instance, £35 or £36 per week.  However, this is a much greater question than just individual sacrifices of a few former Ministers.  The question is, how do we get into this House people who are capable of and are drawing substantial salaries and earning them in the private sector?  How do we import into this House that sort of business acumen?</P>

      <P>I am a little bemused by Deputy Mitchell's assumption that it is only people of quality who get paid high salaries and that there are no people outside this House, or outside the public sector, or the managerial sector who are low paid and are of low <Col N="740" /> quality.  That is a wrong assumption and the Deputy should give it a bit more thought; he would then appreciate the point.</P>

      <P>The assumption that Deputies are only prepared to serve in this House on the basis of getting a large amount of money, or serve in ministerial office for that reason, is doing a disservice to Deputies and to Ministers in this House who have considerable responsibility and who, when all is said and done, do make many sacrifices.  That is true of many of the people who run our State companies also, the very many who have not run off to the private sector because they were offered an extra £10,000 or £15,000.  We should challenge the notion that the only people remaining in the public sector are those who cannot get higher rates outside of it.  That is patently untrue.  We have many successful public sector companies which have been run for many years by people on incomes which are far lower than they could receive outside of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party support this Bill. There would have been some surprise if we had indicated that we were not going to support this Bill but we do not consider that it is not a complete response to the scandal which we have raised over a number of years in this House of the payment of ministerial pensions and as to how they are handled at present.  If and when this Bill reaches Committee Stage we would hope to be in a position to table amendments which we feel would strengthen its provisions.  It is worth reminding the House that the present system of payment of ministerial pensions was introduced following the Shanley Report of 1937.  That fact has been stated by a number of speakers.  It is significant that it is now 50 years since the system was introduced and apart from any other argument in relation to them they clearly require another look.  The fact that they have existed for 50 years and went virtually unchallenged in this <Col N="741" /> House until recent times is also significant.</P>
    <P>It was only in 1983 when The Workers' Party raised a series of questions with regard to them that it became a topical subject for public debate.  Up until then it had received very little public or media attention.  The reaction of the public to the information which those questions did elicit could be described as one of fury. The public quite rightly saw a great contrast between the continual calls for belt tightening which was being prescribed for them by one and all and the feather bedding of former Ministers by way of pensions. Indeed, there have been few other issues which have caused such public indignation and the reaction on the door step was so great that it forced many Deputies and some parties to change their positions on the issue.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the Bill itself and dealing with the question of ministerial pensions in more detail, I would like to make a few points about the position of The Workers' Party on the general issue of payment for Deputies and Ministers. It is the policy of The Workers' Party that Deputies and Ministers are entitled to be paid adequately for the jobs they perform. Indeed, the introduction of salaries for members of Parliament was an absolutely essential reform of the system which assisted in the evolution of a fully representative Parliament both here and in Britain.  It was a reform which the Labour movement in Britain had fought for for many years and had it never been brought in the possibility is that there would never have been a Labour Government in Britain or Labour or Workers' Party representation in this House.</P>
    <P>The principle is that salaries are necessary so that membership of the Dáil does not become the sole preserve of businessmen, self-employed, farmers, auctioneers, lawyers and so on many of whom can participate quite easily in the Dáil, survive without a Dáil salary and still live quite comfortably on their incomes from other sources.  The Workers' Party hold that Deputies are entitled to be adequately paid.  Most <Col N="742" /> members of the public, we believe, support this principle.  However, the other side of that coin is that the taxpayers who pay our salaries are entitled to expect that Deputies should earn their money and in particular if Deputies receive a full salary they should be doing a full time job.  It is a fact that there are many Members of this House who are only part time politicians and who also have substantial incomes from business and professional interests.  There are people in this House who also work as accountants, solicitors, publicans, farmers, auctioneers and as medical consultants and so on while drawing their Dáil salaries. The payment of a full salary to a Deputy should be dependent on him treating his office as a full time position.</P>
    <P>In the same way we accept that many Ministers carry a huge workload and greater responsibility and it is reasonable that they should be paid a sum over and above a Deputy's salary for the additional work which they have to do.  However, there are many other perquisites and privileges attached to the position of Minister such as the provision of a State car, driver and the use in some cases of up to six civil servants to do their constituency work.  These factors should be taken into account when ministerial salaries are being fixed.  Indeed, another anomaly in relation to this wider issue is the fact that we have a number of former Taoisigh in this House who still have State cars and drivers.  I recognise that there are security reasons involved but it is an unnecessary drain that former Taoisigh should forever and a day retain the use of a State car and drivers.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to deal with the specific question of pensions.  One of the main objections to the present system is that pensions can be paid to former Ministers after serving only three years in office. This means that some Ministers who are still only in their mid-30's can look forward to a pension for the rest of their lives and in some cases this can mean for 40 or 50 years, we hope.  Even at the lowest level of income which a Minister of State could expect to receive it is a rate of pension well in excess of that which <Col N="743" /> we pay to a widow or a widower.  A former Minister or Minister of State who qualifies for a pension in this way will still draw a Dáil salary and many of these will also have an income from business or professional interests.  At a time when we are being lectured by every single Government Minister on the need for belt tightening and at a time when hospital wards are being closed all over the country, when social welfare is being cut back and free education is being undermined this privileged treatment of former Ministers cannot be justified.  No other part of the public sector or indeed any part of the private sector pays a pension after three years of service.</P>
    <P>Most pension schemes in the public service require a worker to put in 40 years of service to qualify for a full pension and even then they will only qualify for half their salary.  The normal qualifying age is between 60 and 65 years of age.  Some schemes of course provide for earlier retirement at a reduced pension rate.  The basic principles applying to pension schemes in the public service should also be applied to ministerial pensions.  There should be no privileged treatment for politicians.  The Workers' Party favour the establishment of an income-related pension scheme as part of a revamped social insurance scheme.  We believe that only a State scheme can cater effectively for all categories of employees as well as the self-employed covering all eventualities and circumstances in a manner which the private pensions industry is unwilling or perhaps unable to do.  Had we such a national income-related pensions scheme the need for special individual pension schemes for Ministers, Deputies, Army officers, civil servants, journalists, bus workers or any other type of worker would be done away with. Everybody would qualify for a pension related to their service and income.  Obviously this is a long term proposition and, in the present climate, is unlikely to be acted on in full at any rate.  However, the previous Government established the National Pensions Board which produced <Col N="744" /> a first report last summer which contained many important recommendations and suggestions which could be acted on.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for people elected to this House for the first time is that they may have been paying into a pension scheme &mdash; a public sector or private pension scheme &mdash; but they cannot transfer their pension rights into the Dáil pensions scheme.  This applies not merely to Deputies but to the many people who change their jobs or careers, particularly those who change from the public to the private sector or <i>vice versa.</i> The report of the National Pensions Board recommended specifically that there should be transferability of pension entitlements.  Certainly that is a recommendation that should be acted on without delay.</P>
    <P>The main argument in recent years in defence of ministerial pensions is that they are not really pensions, as such, but rather a special sort of compensation for loss of opportunity and earnings while holding the position of Minister. Ovbiously that argument falls on the basis of the first example I gave in the case of a Minister or a Minister of State who ceases to hold such office after three years, who remains a Dáil Deputy, say, in his or her mid-thirties.  We are expected to accept that such person will be compensated for the next 30 to 40 years for whatever responsibility he or she had which is completely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister for Finance referred to the financial sacrifice involved in holding office because of the enforced severance of all active connection by the person concerned with his original occupation or profession and also the near impossibility, while in office, of providing for the future of himself and his family.  This was exactly the argument advanced by the Shanley Committee in 1937.  It hardly withstands examination in the eighties when a Minister's earnings are about four times the average industrial wage.  While Ministers are not permitted to take part in the day to day <Col N="745" /> operations of other business interests they might have, is anybody really asking us to accept that a Minister who, say, owns a farm takes no interest whatsoever in that farm while in office, or indeed reaps no benefit from it, or that a Minister who, say, owns a business takes no interest in or benefit from the operations of that firm?  In addition, many of those who were involved in specific careers such as teaching, before becoming full time politicians, are simply on leave of absence and can revert to that career.  I have already mentioned the fact that there are people in this House in receipt of ministerial pensions who are engaged in full time professional careers as well.</P>
    <P>The point is that, despite odd exceptions like the 1977 General Elections, most Ministers do not lose their Dáil seats and will still have their Dáil salary to support them.  Many of the arguments advanced in defence of ministerial pensions are false and carry all the hallmarks of those put forward by people who know they are defending the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I might turn briefly to the specific details of the Bill before us.  The Bill provides only that ministerial pensions would not be paid to persons who hold other public offices, mainly in the political or judicial areas.  The main flaw in the Bill is that its provisions would still allow a Minister who has held office for three years only and who decides to get out of politics altogether &mdash; even though he or she might be in their thirties only &mdash; to draw a substantial pension for the rest of his or her life even though he or she might have a good income from another position in the public or private sector.  Where is the logic in saying that a former Minister who is a judge cannot draw a pension, but that a former Minister who goes back to work as a teacher or for a semi-State company can do so?</P>
    <P>The Progresive Democrats' Bill would constitute a step forward but would leave anomalies needing to be dealt with. There is need for a more fundamental review of the system of remuneration of Deputies and Ministers and especially of the pensions schemes.  A number of Deputies have made the point that a <Col N="746" /> Deputy with 20 years experience receives the same salary only as a Deputy on his or her first day in the Dáil.  There have even been suggestions that ministerial pensions were meant to compensate for that anomaly.  Arguments appear to be put forward that these pensions are to compensate for all sorts of anomalies. Many Deputies with long service have never held ministerial office.  It is a valid criticism of the system of salaries for Deputies that the civil servants who work in this House have a system of increments for length of service.  There is no reason the same principle should not be applicable to Deputies' salaries.</P>
    <P>In relation to pensions we believe that ministerial pensions should be abolished. There should be an income-related pensions scheme for all Members of the Dáil which would take into consideration the additional earnings of those who have held ministerial office.  We believe the full pension should be payable in the same way as it applies in the general public service after a minimum of 20 years service.  No pension should be paid while a person remains a Member of the Oireachtas, the full pension being payable only on reaching the age of 60 or 65. A reduced rate, on a sliding scale, could be paid in the case of Members with less than 20 years service on reaching the age of 60 or 65, subject to a minimum qualifying period of, say, eight years.</P>
    <P>Some allowance should be made for the particularly uncertain nature of a Deputy's position in that, in effect, he or she can be summarily dismissed by the electorate.  Perhaps Deputies who lose their seats should qualify for a type of redundancy lump sum in the same way as do other workers who lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>The failure of successive Governments to deal with the scandal of ministerial pensions has contributed enormously to the sense of disillusionment with which many of the electorate view our political system.  All parties have been party to this failure which is reflected in relatively low turn-outs at elections, particularly on the part of those who are not in secure jobs or in receipt of very good incomes. A serious attempt to end this abuse, to <Col N="747" /> abolish the exceptional privilege afforded to former Ministers, could contribute to a restoration of public confidence in the political system, an objective to which I am sure all Deputies are committed.</P>
    <P>Limited though this Bill is we support it purely as a device in an effort to eliminate a particular abuse of and anomaly in the system.  We do not support the general context within which the Bill has been introduced, that is, in the context of abolishing the Seanad, reducing the number of seats in the Dáil and various other abolitions being proposed by the Progressive Democrats, such as their proposal to abolish certain health boards, local authorities, VECs and so on.  We accept the need for institutional reform but we do not accept the case for narrowing the base for representation in the Dáil or Seanad or at the level of local democracy.  We argue for a broadening of democratic representation.  We do not agree with the abolition of the multi-seat constituency system or the abolition of proportional representation.  We feel, however unconscious it may be, the proposals being put forward by the Progressive Democrats are essentially undemocratic.  I believe they would lead to a lessening of people's involvement in our democratic system at a time when we should be encouraging a greater and deeper understanding of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to support this Bill which is fundamental legislation being put before this House.  We, the Progressive Democrats, have received a mandate to lay this before the House, and that should not be overlooked.  I feel that, unlike many Deputies, I can approach this Bill in a very unbiased way as I was fortunate to have the freedom to allow my political philosophy to mature.  I was not subjected to any of the biased political philosophies of bygone ages and therefore, what I say tonight is truly representative of current thinking in the country.  I can truly say, as a 33 year old, that I represent the youth of this country who in many instances have not got the opportunity to <Col N="748" /> speak in a forum such as this.  Indeed, I feel it is a rare privilege.</P>
      <P>Many of the speakers I have listened to in the past week would have us believe that there is some mystery about this Bill or that it is couched in terms that cover all degrees of legislation or matters that occur in this House.  However, that is clearly not the case.  This is a simple and fundamental matter of principle, nothing more or less.  It is about whether people should receive pensions who are still active in public life and in receipt of their salaries.  I believe that is fundamentally wrong and in present circumstances is an affront to many citizens.  I was surprised that Deputy Mitchell referred to individual Deputies in this party on so many occasions.  I take grave exception to his remark that this is political opportunism which is being vented on this side of the House.  It certainly is not and I would not be here with a mandate to speak on such an issue if it was political opportunism, or if the people saw it that way.  I assure him that I did not come into the House with the prospect of receiving a ministerial pension if I were to have an opportunity to serve in Government.  That is not why I am here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to deride or demean the process.  This is the process whereby duly elected public representatives get the opportunity to examine their consciences and it is being done in a very fair and orderly manner.  It is Deputy Mitchell who is bringing the Bill into disrepute because he is incapable of finding any fundamental arguments against it.  I assure him that it is not a minor point for Deputies Desmond O'Malley and Robert Molloy to give up their pensions.  It was a fundamental matter of deep heart searching as the Deputies are not in receipt of other large incomes apart from their salaries.  They saw that the principle of receiving a pension while in receipt of a salary from this House was wrong.  They were prepared not only to back legislation to have that changed but to lead by example.  That is one of the reasons I am in this House and, indeed, why the Progressive Democrats are here.  As long as we are here and I can draw breath, I <Col N="749" /> will stand up and speak on matters and give a lead to the politicians and, more importantly, to the people.  It is equally important to give the youth a voice in this House.</P>
    <P>Last week I was amazed when listening to the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry making a four page speech, that all he could talk about was something that had occurred in 1937.  I found it amazing that he was incapable of addressing any of the issues or, as I said earlier, one fundamental issue.  Events which occurred in 1937 may have been right for 1937, but I assure him they are not right for 1987 particularly in present economic circumstances.  This was the sum total of the argument put forward.  Am I to believe that legislation or rules and regulations enacted over a long number of years are in some way sacrosanct and cannot be changed by the Members of this House?  I remind Members that this is the forum for addressing these matters. The Oireachtas is the Legislature of the country and it is where decisions are made.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, also referred to the Gleeson review committee.  While I wish the Gleeson committee every success in the many issues they will address with which I agree and which are correct, ironically the committee do not address the issue of people in receipt of pensions who are also in receipt of a salary.  As this issue is not being addressed by the Gleeson Committee it is wrong to hide behind the committee and, in my opinion, demean the very important work they are doing in other areas and to gloss over the fundamental thrust of what they are doing. That is fundamentally wrong and the Minister was incorrect to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance by all the Deputies sitting here this evening &mdash; I know it and they know it &mdash; that the fundamental principle being addressed in this Bill is correct.  Many Deputies in all parties in receipt of pensions know it is wrong.  Yet they are all afraid to address this issue.  In the quiet corridors of this building they will admit that the thrust of this Bill is correct.  Yet they have not the courage to come into this House and <Col N="750" /> say to Members and to the public that what this Bill proposes is correct and fundamental to Irish democracy and the way it should go forward.</P>
    <P>This Bill provokes discussion.  Many other Members have addressed other issues raised by this Bill which for too long were not addressed.  However, other Members seek to hide behind the issues raised but I assure the House they will be dealt with in legislation.  It appals me that of the 166 Deputies elected, the majority &mdash; all except 14 PDs who have been joined by The Workers' Party who have had the courage to support this Bill &mdash; are afraid to get up and say what they know in their hearts to be true.</P>
    <P>We live in an age of unprecedented cutbacks affecting every single sector of the community, from the extremely poor to the middle class and the wealthy.  Services are being cut back right across the board and yet we see the comical efforts of the Taoiseach launching a national plan last week in which he gives an increase guaranteed for the next three years to people in the public service while, at the same time, telling the rest of the people they will have to put up with fewer services and pay for many of them as well.  Where is the justice in that approach?  In my opinion there is no justice and the people are saying that.</P>
    <P>Why can the matter not be addressed by the people of this House?  Many changes are needed in the structures, some of which have been referred to.  I take issue with Deputy De Rossa's remarks that this party are in some way being undemocratic by requesting a reduction in the total number of Deputies.  From my experience as a new Deputy I see that a large proportion of the Deputies only appear at a head count when it comes to voting and being whipped into the lobbies.  Some of the Deputies never get an opportunity or want the opportunity to speak in this forum.  This country cannot afford that luxury and it is about time those issues were addressed.  This country could have great opportunities and a future if only the duly elected Members had the gumption and courage to face the difficult decisions.  I can assure them that <Col N="751" /> they will never find this party lacking in that kind of support when those issues are put before this House.</P>
    <P>This is the dawning of a new era in Irish politics, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour want to think otherwise. The Progressive Democrats are here to stay and to increase and we will have a major influence on politics.  The catty remarks which have been passed in this House about our Deputies and party will not make us go away and stop us bringing forward ministerial pensions Bills.  It is not going to stop us looking for reforms in the public service.  It is not to get at the public service, but to see a more efficient body and to recognise the talent that is contained in the public service. We want to give that talent the forum whereby it can show initiative in its own right and stand up and get on with the job so that people are not confined in an archaic system of annual increments and gradings.  There are something like 92 grades in the public service.  How can one expect efficiency to work in such an archaic system?  This country does not need this at this time: it needs courage, confidence and leadership.  The only leadership being offered is by this party and it is being offered by the likes of Deputies Des O'Malley and Bobby Molloy.  They are prepared to bring forward legislation which will address the issues and to carry it through.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign one of the anomalies which was raised by voters was the incorrectness of people in public life receiving pensions.  There was a genuine mandate given to us to bring legislation dealing with this before the House.  It is very important that we are seen to do this and that we get people to stand up and support this legislation.  If this legislation is implemented people will have their confidence restored because they will realise that at last the leadership which they have wanted for so long is in Leinster House.  I am confident that that leadership is in the Progressive Democrats. I am asking the other parties to show their leadership qualities by supporting this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the attitude of the other political parties in the House to this Bill which seeks to abolish ministerial pensions.  So far the Government have only put in one Minister, the Minister for Finance, and one other speaker on this issue.  To date, the Fine Gael Party have put in two speakers, the Labour Party one speaker and The Workers' Party one speaker.  I am the fifth Member of the Progressive Democrats to speak in favour of this Bill and I think the other parties say an awful lot by their silence.  They are afraid, of course, to stand up and say they disagree with the Bill because they know that the public feel that the ministerial pensions being given to former office holders is a great anomaly.</P>
      <P>The other two parties have washed their hands of the issue.  They say they are not the arbiters of ministerial pensions and that a committee are considering this issue.  I wish to point out to the House that we are the legislators and we can change this law and any other law affecting people.  This House should decide on this issue.  I ask the Government and, in particular the Fine Gael Party, to reconsider their voting positions for next week.  I know from speaking privately to Members of the House that they agree that the payment of ministerial pensions is an anomaly.  They agree that the Progressive Democrats have embarrassed them by bringing this Bill before the House and yet, they are afraid to stand up and speak their minds on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an issue like ministerial pensions, and not the advent of this Bill by the Progressive Democrats, that brings politics and politicians generally into disrepute. The people I met during the general election campaign latched on to this issue because it symbolised for them their disillusionment with politics and politicians generally.  I remember there was a story in the papers at that time saying that a former Deputy, Michael O'Leary, had received a ministerial pension of some £7,000 on his retirement from politics.  People were appalled at this.  That was why, when we proposed <Col N="753" /> this Bill at election time, we got a mandate from the people to bring it forward.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening Deputy Mitchell questioned our motive in bringing forward this Bill.  The reason we brought it forward was because we promised it to the people at election time and we are fulfilling that mandate.  Unlike the Government who went around making all sorts of promises which they are not now fulfilling, we are bringing this Bill forward because we said we would do so.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of money which seems to be such an embarrassment for all politicians.  I feel I can speak on this matter with a perfectly clear conscience because, in effect, today I am earning less as a TD than I did as a political correspondent.  I earned more money in 1980 and 1981, than I am earning as a TD today.</P>

      <P>I would like to commend the action of the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Des O'Malley, and Deputy Bobby Molloy for giving up their ministerial pensions in order to give leadership on this issue and to put pressure on the other political parties to change the law.  Without going into any personal details of their cases, I know very well that both of these gentlemen can ill afford to do without one-third of their salaries at present.  I do not think it is right that a person of the calibre of Deputy Des O'Malley should be paid the same as somebody such as myself who is only a wet day in the Dáil.  Former Ministers such as Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Jim Mitchell on the Fine Gael benches have been receiving pensions of over £6,000 for the past year. Because they have contributed to public life by serving in Cabinet and being part of a Government, they deserve some recognition of that contribution to public life in their salaries.  As I said already, I do not think it is right that somebody of the calibre of Deputy Des O'Malley should be paid the same money as I am paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> Even Deputy Michael Noonan recognised what is wrong with the issue of ministerial pensions.  The word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; is seen as something which is paid to a person in their retirement.  Somehow or other it is associated with old age.  When one looks at somebody like Deputy George Birmingham in the Fine Gael Party one certainly cannot say that he is heading for retirement or old age.  Yet, he is now in receipt of a ministerial pension. That is the issue which has annoyed so many people and it is why there is so much public support for this Bill.  I would like to commend the action of the President, Dr. Hillery, in handing back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have put forward a number of policies on institutional reform.  This is the first one we have brought before the House.  Let there be no doubt that, by rejecting our Bill, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are again signing a blank cheque to continue paying their ministerial pensions.

      <P>We believe the time has come when people in this House should make decisions for themselves.  They can change this law.  There is no need to wait for proposals on this issue from another committee.  People can indicate their attitudes on this ministerial pensions Bill by voting with the Progressive Democrats next Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell questioned our motivation in bringing forward this issue.  First, he said he admired the sacrifice of the two individuals concerned and then he turned and said it was a minor point. It is not a minor point for two senior Deputies of this House who have families at a very expensive stage in their education to turn over £7,000 and £8,000 of their salaries, one-third, probably, in each case, in order to try to change a law which the public will not recognise. Though other politicians in this House may try to discredit them, the public will know better than the politicians in this case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also raised a broader question when he asked how do we order our public affairs in this House.  This is precisely the question the Progressive Democrats are putting to the other parties on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say first of all that I appreciate very much the opportunity given to me to raise this issue.  Secondly, I hope that anything I say will be interpreted as being constructive. I am aware of attempts being made to resolve this issue and I do not in any way wish to complicate them or make them more difficult for those engaged in the talks.  I felt it was essential that certain questions should be answered in the context of this extraordinary collapse.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would be good enough to endeavour to answer those queries when he gets an opportunity to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I believe that an urgent investigation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is fully warranted in the case of this extraordinary collapse.  A large number of serious questions fall to be answered and I think we are entitled to know those answers.  As taxpayers and as public representatives we are entitled to full comprehensive and clear answers to the questions that arise.  In essence, I believe it is hardly credible that a large company which invoked the support of the Bank of Ireland as recently as last August, a bank which must have been aware of the financial facts at that time, could together issue strong assertions about the financial stability of H. Williams Group at that time, including stating that the assets of the group exceeded their liabilities, and that the chain could then collapse within weeks.  I find that incomprehensible, a collapse which left a trail of human and financial disasters unprecedented in the distribution trade.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable also that the Department of Industry and Commerce could have been absolutely ignorant of the concerns which were prevalent in the trade or that the Bank of Ireland were in a similar position.  It may very well be that the Department were aware and found themselves, for one reason or another, perhaps because of lack of capacity in the current law, unable to do something about it.  If that is the case I would like the Minister to say so.  Both of these institutions &mdash; the Bank of Ireland as a major economic institution and the Department as the ultimate guarantor of peoples rights in this matter &mdash; have clear public responsibilities and social responsibilities to us all.  In the case of the Bank of Ireland, their mandate and obligations in this respect are very far from proven.  I believe the Minister should intervene to have investigated the role which the Bank of Ireland and H. Williams Group played together in the past few months.</P>
    <P>Among the serious questions which should now be answered are the following: how is it possible for a major company such as this to have traded as they did for so long without having their <Col N="757" /> questionable financial structuring detected?  How is it possible that the serious implications of that trading pattern and that trading arrangement for over 400 supplier companies, the serious implications for 1,500 employees directly within the employ of the chain and many other thousands of jobs in those companies who were supplying H. Williams were not addressed at an early stage? How is it possible for a company to build up a debt which included approximately £18 million owed to suppliers, approximately £15 million owed to the banks, approximately £3 million to non-trading creditors and, last but not least, and perhaps very important, a sum of almost £2 million owed to the Revenue Commissioners without somebody somewhere shouting &ldquo;stop&rdquo;?  I find that extraordinary.  The specific question should be answered: who knew how much and why was action not taken earlier? I want to know specifically what action will be taken to protect the jobs of 1,500 people in the trade and, indeed, the jobs of many people in the 400 small companies whose financial viability could be threatened by this collapse who were supplying H. Williams.</P>
    <P>I have read with some degree of optimism reports of a proposed restructuring of the company.  I am, I have to admit, somewhat aghast at the prospect that it embodies proposed redundancies in the region of two-thirds of the current workforce and a shutting down of some 13 of the present chain of stores.  I am appalled also by what I understand to be &mdash; and I would appreciate if the Minister would comment specifically on this &mdash; the baulking by the Bank of Ireland at buying this agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether it is the case that all the parties involved, the unions, the group themselves, the suppliers and the creditors, reluctantly but inevitably perhaps, accept that a restructuring is essential and that the only individual, organisation or corporate body holding out is the Bank of Ireland.  As far as I am concerned, the Bank of Ireland should address the question: to what extent were they culpable by being aware <Col N="758" /> of the circumstances of this chain, not do something concrete about it and perhaps passively facilitating statements by senior personnel in the H. Williams chain as recently as last August in Jury's Hotel to the effect that everything was in order when it was not in order.  I would like to know precisely what the Bank of Ireland feel about the situation at this time and whether they are standing in the way of progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what action will be taken with respect to these amazing statements made by the senior executives of H. Williams at a public meeting in Jury's Hotel in August when they asserted that they had the full backing of the banks, that their assets at that time exceeded their liabilities and that their financial base was stable and invulnerable when it is now perfectly clear that none of those three statements was the truth. They were gulled by the banks and, in turn, consciously or otherwise, either deceived those at the meeting or, despite the banks, took a course of action which was not in accordance with the highest standards of integrity.  It has to be one or the other.</P>
    <P>Someone should answer for those people who are today left possibly without jobs and certainly without moneys which are due to them, and I include in this the taxpayer.  I want to know what action can be taken to deal specifically with the central responsibility pertaining to the Bank of Ireland who must have known a great deal more than they pretended to know a few months ago.  Yet they chose to remain silent, and apparently passive, in the light of their clear social responsibility as a major element in this financial mess.  There is a big question mark over their role in this operation. The only forum in which I can raise it is here and the only person who can answer the questions for me is the Minister.  I want the bank's role in this matter to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that our small economy depends on the highest standards of integrity and operational procedures on the part of the banking and financial institutions, or else this economy has no <Col N="759" /> chance.  I have a large doubt in my mind about the role of the Bank of Ireland in this particular debacle.  I would be grateful if the Minister would tell us whether he is willing to take a personal interest in ensuring the urgent publication of a financial statement on the group's affairs. A full month after the receiver has been appointed creditors &mdash; people to whom a debt of all kinds is due &mdash; have still not been told the facts.  That is not good enough.  They are entitled to know the facts.  A statement was made that the creditors would get nothing because there was nothing there.  I believe that the creditors, in law and in the context of their moral and other rights, are entitled to a great deal more than that.</P>
    <P>I demand &mdash; if that is not too blunt a word &mdash; that the Minister should insist, in so far as he can within the existing law, and I accept that it is not as effective in that respect as it should be, that a full statement of the group's financial affairs be presented immediately in order that people can make their own judgments and take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate an indication as to whether the Government intend to take urgent action on below-cost selling, which is a fundamental element in this mess.  This artificial internecine feuding is codding many people into changing their allegiance, temporarily or otherwise, in their trading patterns on a day-to-day basis, but ultimately it may act to the detriment of the consumer and the economy in general.  This difficult issue needs to be addressed and some approach could be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would take a personal interest in the proposed &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; of the company, which is a very euphemistic term for what I understand to be happening &mdash; the shedding of 1,000 jobs and the closing down of a large number of stores.  If this is left to those who engineered this mess I would not be optimistic about the outcome. There are major issues involving the debt to the Exchequer and to others which need to be safeguarded by somebody with public responsibility.  None of <Col N="760" /> the people at present involved fits that category.  The Minister could consider intervening to assist in the restructuring of the company.  If some of the interests involved &mdash; say, for example, the Bank of Ireland &mdash; are being obstructive or negative in their approach, their attitude should be dealt with appropriately and rapidly in the interests of the workers and their families, the creditors and everybody else.</P>
    <P>If the receiver proceeds down the present road, he himself will be looked after according to his legal entitlement, but it is possible that nobody else will be looked after.  It is quite conceivable that others, some of whom might have a vested interest in ensuring the liquidation of this chain, could pick up the pieces at a knock down price and set the liabilities to one side.  Some form of restructuring is inevitable but nobody wants to go along that route.  I am not in a position to judge whether the package which has been accepted by some elements is the best solution.  I appeal to the Minister to take a personal interest because the mess which has resulted from the ignoring of this problem by a large number of people involved does not lead one to believe that there will be a better result unless there is interest by a Government Minister.</P>
    <P>If H. Williams, which had only 8 per cent of the total market, owed £18 million to creditors, is it reasonable to suppose that this pattern of debt is the norm within the marketplace and that other major chain stores might collectively owe many times that amount to other suppliers and creditors, as well as to the Revenue Commissioners? If that is the case, we have a problem not just in terms of the inevitable fall-out which results from the ritualistic feuding which goes on but also in relation to the longer term interests of the consumer and the trade.</P>
    <P>There have been assertions that some of the interests involved have made use of the cash flow to add to their profits and have delayed paying creditors for long periods.  If that kind of speculation was going on, as well as the feuding, we have a serious structural problem in that trade which must be addressed.  The Minister <Col N="761" /> should tell us whether there are large sums outstanding to the Revenue Commissioners and to suppliers over and above what would normally be acceptable in this area of business.  If that pattern of debt is a fundamental element in the retail grocery area we have a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to insist on winding down the scale and dominance of both Dunnes Stores and Quinnsworth in the light of the fact that customers who will be dispossessed of their normal shopping outlets will be gravitating towards these stores, assuming the inevitable closure of large sections of the H. Williams chain?  Most people do not want the quasi-monopolistic tendencies in this trade to develop any further.  If consumers assist in augmenting the scale and size of Dunnes Stores and Quinnsworth we could end up with different problems. I know the Minister's philosophy is not to intervene unless it is essential but there are times when the public interest must be safeguarded.  This may be one such case.  The data available to the Minister will enable him to make that judgment. It is not in the public interest to have an effective oligarchy or monopoly in this area of trade and the virtual removal of a large trader like Williams from the field assists in that creation.  I should like to know what the Minister intends to do to curb that tendency.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister investigate where and how the revenue of H. Williams has been used and how their cash flow was allocated during the past six months?  It is extraordinary that a chain which is reported to be in good health weeks before its collapse can suddenly find itself with debts worth about £40 million. There is no point in turning away from the problem and carrying out a restructuring. That is not good enough.  We are entitled to answers.  Where did the money go which H. Williams took in over the past six months?  I have a right to ask that question because some of it should have gone to the Exchequer but it did not.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state clearly whether this company were complying with the <Col N="762" /> Companies Acts in terms of the presentation and clarity of their statement of accounts and in terms of every other rubric?  The Minister has powers to order an investigation and that is the essence of what I want to say tonight.  I am not satisfied that we should all stay silent in the hope that the bits and pieces can be put together again and a few jobs may be saved.  I am glad for the people who are employed and that there will be some form of limping along after this incredible mess.  Above all I want to prevent a repetition. The lesson we should learn is that a similar mess must never again be allowed to occur or tolerated by the Government of the day.  There can be no guarantee that it will not occur again unless the questions I have asked are answered fully and comprehensively and appropriate actions taken.  The Minister must take a firm hand in the matter and we should ask him for a departmental investigation under his aegis in order to get at the facts.  He should use whatever powers are necessary, including his powers under the Companies Acts, to order that investigation and to obtain answers to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have to be concerned at the loss of jobs or disruption of trade following on from the financial problems in the H. Williams Group.  This is obviously the primary concern of the workers in the group and of employees of suppliers who may have lost out because of the difficulties in H. Williams.</P>
      <P>For this reason, we would welcome any arrangement that can offer a viable future for the business and an outlet for suppliers. It is clear that the staff interests in the group have already indicated their willingness to make a substantial sacrifice in order to maintain as many jobs as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a party to any of the discussions or negotiations which are going on at present in relation to the future of the group.  I cannot say what proposals might emerge over the next few days or the next week in relation to the company. <Col N="763" /> However, I can assure the House that the Government's concern will be that any proposals which do emerge should meet the wider public interest in this matter &mdash; and I include in that the interests of workers, suppliers and of the public as consumers.</P>
    <P>We read a lot about how far the possible rescue attempts have gone.  I re-echo the Deputy's call that if the bank concerned are the only party willing to accept the possible rescue plan &mdash; I do not have the details &mdash; the bank should positively and constructively look at any realistic rescue plan and thereby ensure that they play their role in what has been one of the major collapses in recent times.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised arising out of the collapse of H. Williams. The first of these relates to concentration in the retail grocery sector and the use of buying power that flows from that concentration. This is an issue which was considered in some detail by the Restrictive Practices Commission within the past year.  The report of their review of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981, sets out their views on this question with which I am in broad agreement.  The commission concluded from their examination of the retail grocery sector that the power of the multiple supermarkets had increased in recent years and that, if continued unchecked, the concentration of power could have adverse effects on the public interest in the long term. Where concentrated buying power is used to damage unfairly the interests of other retailers, suppliers or consumers, that power has to be curbed.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission recommended that below cost selling and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money should be banned and proposed a number of other steps for more transparent arrangements in relation to the terms and conditions of supply to multiple supermarkets.  These recommendations represent a considered attempt to redress the balance of power and to bring to an end practices which are unfair and militate against the common good.</P>
    <P>I expect that the legislation to confirm <Col N="764" /> the order which I have signed will be discussed by the House shortly, I hope next week.  It is worth noting at this stage that it would have been discussed this week but for the four day debate on the Estimates.  I had hoped that this legislation would have gone through the House before the summer recess which would have been the case if disruptive practices had not been engaged in and approximately two and a half days were wasted on petty squabbling.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some quarters that collapses such as that of H. Williams arise in part at least from shortcomings in company law.  However, company law can only provide a framework under which the business sector can operate and conduct its affairs in an enterprising and productive manner while offering reasonable protection for stakeholders in companies and interests dealing with them. For an investigation under the Companies Act as the law now stands, other than one requested by the company or its shareholders, I must have in my possession some evidence that circumstances suggested wrongdoing.  I do not have such evidence at the moment although I have read allegations of wrongdoing in various newspapers.  If the Deputy has any evidence in relation to wrongdoing, I ask him to put it in my possession and if I can take any action I will.</P>
    <P>That is not to say there is not scope for updating and extending the present laws governing companies.  The Deputy will be aware that a substantial Companies Bill is at present before the Seanad.  This Bill contains new provisions on company rescue which have the potential to be of benefit in cases such as H. Williams. These provisions would offer court protection for dealing with potentially viable companies while a court appointed examiner seeks to establish whether a rescue plan can be arranged.  That measure, taken with other reforms set out in the Bill, will represent a very substantial and valuable contribution to the framework in which business operates in this country.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me to offer any comment on suggestions that creditors of H. Williams may have been misled or <Col N="765" /> that the position of the company may have been misrepresented to them in the period prior to the appointment of a receiver.  I am simply not in possession of the facts to make any informed comment on this point at this stage.  There is, in any event, the danger that anything I might say might prejudice the position of any of the parties involved.  In the circumstances I must remain silent on this point other than to say that if any suppliers have facts which would substantiate the allegations made about the company, remedies are available to them through the normal legal process.  I would also welcome being apprised of such facts.  The suppliers concerned, as a group, have their own civil remedy if they wish to take it or they can place the facts in front of me.</P>
    <P>Other questions were raised by the Deputy to which I should like to refer.  He asked what would happen if the receiver sold all, or any part of the H. Williams Group.  Any assets worth £5 million or an asset with a turnover of £10 million are notifiable to me under the Act dealing with mergers and monopolies.  My views and what my approach will be in the event of suggested sales are already on record.</P>
    <P>In regard to the exact amount of money owed by the company, that is a matter for the receiver and I do not have any information in that regard.  As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, approximately £1.1 million, not including possible moneys due under corporate tax not assessed, represents the basis of turnover, approximately two months.  That does not indicate anything more than the normal amount due to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I look forward to introducing the Bill dealing with below cost selling and the banning of &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money as that will be <Col N="766" /> in the interests of the retail trade and the public generally.  The Deputy asked about the amount of credit given.  It is said that the amount of money owed to creditors represents something in excess of 50 days' credit which is approximately twice the amount of credit extended in the UK grocery market.  A lesson to be learned from this collapse is that suppliers should be a lot more careful in extending credit as the grocery trade operates on very small margins.  Indeed, that sort of credit does not exist anywhere else in the EC.  The Government cannot run businesses for the people involved but we can provide the framework in which they operate.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons was signed by Ireland on 20 August 1986.  It will enter into force in respect of Ireland only on ratification.  The question of possible legislative changes to enable the Convention to be ratified is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <P>According to an estimate of last year there are about 1,000 Irish citizens (including about 300 from Northern Ireland) in prison in Britain who would be covered by the Convention.  There are currently about 40 Irish citizens in prison in the other member states of the Council of Europe who would be covered by the Convention.  It has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the number of Irish citizens imprisoned in Canada and the US, which are also <Col N="558" /> parties to the Convention.  The number of prisoners in custody in this State who would be covered by the Convention was 92 &mdash; of whom 54 were from Northern Ireland &mdash; in February 1987, the last date for which exact figures are available.</P>

      <P>Details of the guidelines for the operation of the scheme are included in Circular 28/86, a copy of which has been lodged in the Oireachtas library.  The following amendments have been introduced since the date of issue of the circular:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(ii)  vacancies arising from career breaks are not being filled except in the most exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of an application for a career break is not automatic.  Every application <Col N="564" /> is considered on its merits and where possible the career break is allowed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made by my Department in implementing the decision in relation to reports and accounts of State bodies, announced by the Government on 16 December 1986.  The decision pertained to three main areas, relating to:</P>
      <P>annual reports and accounts</P>
      <P>annual and interim unaudited accounts</P>
      <P>audit committees</P>
      <P>As far as annual reports and accounts are concerned, the format of each State body's annual report has been reviewed by the Department in conjunction with the State body.  Revised formats of annual reports and accounts are being submitted by the State bodies for consideration by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  It is my intention that this review be progressed swiftly so that the necessary changes can be introduced in annual reports for financial years commencing after 31 March 1987.  Furthermore, I have been pressing to ensure that the six month publication requirement is met by the bodies under my aegis, though I should point out that a number of the bodies have indeed been meeting this deadline in recent years.</P>
      <P>On the issue of unaudited management accounts, the four commercial State bodies under my aegis are submitting such accounts to me on a regular basis. As regards the non-commercial State bodies, the matter of unaudited management accounts has been under active consideration.</P>
      <P>Finally, as regards the establishment of audit committees within the State bodies, again such committees are already in place for the four commercial State bodies under my aegis, and are under consideration for the non-commercial State bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport his views on whether the proposed liberalisation of air transport in Europe will lead to the formation of a small number of mega-airlines, as deregulation led to only five mega-airlines in the USA; the effect this type of liberalisation would have on Aer Lingus; the steps, if any, taken by Aer Lingus in the event of the introduction of liberalisation; the plans, if any Aer Lingus have to merge with smaller European airlines or if they are hoping to consolidate with one of the mega-airlines in Europe or the USA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>US-style deregulation is not considered by European Administrations to be appropriate to European conditions.  There are, however, proposals for a more liberal regulatory system which will make it easier for airlines to introduce new services and give airlines greater flexibility in regard to the capacity to be provided and the fares to be charged.  These proposals have my strong support and I hope that agreement on their introduction can be reached before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The proposed new regime will allow a greater degree of competition and thus provide both threats and opportunities for all airlines, including Aer Lingus.  I know that Aer Lingus are alive to the situation and are taking appropriate steps to meet the new challenge by various means, including reductions in costs, the improvement of efficiency and consideration of joint ventures and other co-operative arrangements with other airlines. I have every confidence in the ability of Aer Lingus to hold its place in the very competitive environment now developing in Europe.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means exceed the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.  His means, which were assessed at £72.65 from 25 February 1987 were derived from self-employment and the capital value of property.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance on 6 March 1987 and arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal his papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries. When these inquiries were completed, his case was submitted to an appeals officer for determination.  Following an oral hearing of his case on 9 July 1987, the appeals officer also assessed him with means of £72.65.</P>
      <P>Notification of the outcome of the appeal was issued to the person concerned on 23 July 1987.  As it would appear from the information supplied by the Deputy that he did not receive the original notification, arrangements have been made to issue a duplicate notification to him.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements recently announced the national fuel scheme has been extended to cover an additional 30,000 persons on long term unemployment assistance living alone or with dependants.  To qualify for unemployment assistance at the long term rate a person must have been unemployed for 15 months or more.</P>
      <P>The social employment scheme, which is administered by the Department of Labour, enables unemployed people to work on a specific project for an average of two and a half days a week for which they receive a weekly allowance of £60 (single) or £85 (married).  These allowances are higher than the single and married rates of unemployemnt assistance. Any person on unemployment assistance is eligible to participate in the scheme. Participants in the scheme are free to take up other work for the remainder of the week.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to extend the national fuel scheme on this occasion to other categories of persons because of the financial constraints.  The question of further extensions of the national fuel scheme will be a matter for consideration in the light of the available resources.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for entitlement to non-contributory old age pension the means of one of a married couple living together is taken to be one-half of the total means of the couple.  In the case of an applicant whose spouse is working the earnings of the spouse may, in certain circumstances, be so high as to put the applicants means over the limit for entitlement to pension.

      <P>The arrangements for the provision by An Post of free postage of election literature are governed by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and regulations and schemes made under: (i) the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923; (ii) the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act, 1937; (iii) the Presidential Elections Act, 1937; (iv) European Assembly Elections Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The regulations and schemes prescribe the conditions under which electoral candidates may send by post, free of charge, one communication relating solely to the election to every person registered as an elector for the constituency.  Conditions relating to such matters as how election communications are to be posted and the weight, size and marking of the communications are also prescribed in the regulations and schemes.</P>
      <P>An Post is recouped from the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance for the loss of postage in connection with elections. Recoupments by the Minister for Finance to An Post for the free postage scheme for electoral candidates have been as follows: 1984 European Elections, £1,025,172 (estimated); 1984 Laois-Offaly By-Election, £21,413; 1987 General Election, £2,000,000 (estimated); 1987 Seanad Election, £286,000 (estimated).  There has been no review of the free postage arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem has been with us for the past few years.  A number of vessels owned by Irish registered companies with predominantly Spanish interests have been registered as Irish vessels thereby gaining access to Irish quotas.  As the Deputy is aware, the 1983 Sea Fisheries Amendment Act was introduced to deal with this problem and the threat of a large number of English registered flag-of-convenience vessels.  Since 1983, sea fishing boat licences held in respect of Irish registered vessels have contained a requirement in some form that at least 75 per cent of the crews must be EC nationals, with the <Col N="585" /> exception of Greek, Spanish and Portuguese nationals for specified periods. There have been several challenges to this provision in the courts here and the matter has also been referred to the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the deep feeling and resentment experienced by genuine Irish fishermen at the activities of these vessels. I am also anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit from the fishing of Irish quotas should accrue to the Irish economy. It was for these reasons that I raised this matter specifically at the Council of Fisheries Ministers held in Brussels on 29 September 1987, where I stressed the need for a Community solution.  The Commission accepted that this was a major problem for Ireland and promised to try and find an early solution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps, if any, he proposes to take in relation to public roads in housing estates, community development and the provision of local amenities in order to minimise the stolen <Col N="592" /> car problem in Dublin; if, in the wake of the terrible accident at Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, in which two children were killed and a third seriously injured by a stolen car he will make a statement on the matter and in particular if he will give the reason for the delay in issuing regulations governing the provisions of ramps and bollards under the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly saddened when I learned that two children had been killed and a third seriously injured in Ballyfermot recently when a stolen car went out of control.  The accident is being investigated by the Garda.  I wish to extend my sympathy to the relatives of the children in question.</P>
      <P>Regarding the general issues raised in the Deputy's question, the primary responsibility for the proper layout and design of roads in housing estates and for the provision of local amenities and community development facilities rests with local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department has specifically advised local authorities that roads in housing estates which they themselves provide should be designed to suit prevailing circumstances having regard to expected traffic volume.  The authorities have also been encouraged, in the interest of road safety, to limit access from such housing estates to main traffic arteries.</P>
      <P>There has been no undue delay in making regulations to give effect to section 32 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, which provides for the installation of road ramps and the erection of bollards. In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 191 of 14 October last which sets out the present position in relation to road ramps. The same position applies to bollards.</P>

The Exchequer allocation for these two programmes in 1988 is £2.603 million.  In addition they will attract European Social Fund assistance.</P>
      <P>The allocation of this provision between the two programmes has yet to be decided and is, in the first instance, a matter for FÁS.  In 1987 the YEA initially allocated from its total provision £2.058 million and £0.966 million for the community enterprise programme and graduate placement programmes respectively.

      <P>In the current year these costs will be met out of the AnCO and YEA provisions in the 1987 Labour Vote.

    <P>Some ward accommodation was closed on a temporary basis for a short period during the summer when demand is traditionally low and this may be repeated over the Christmas holiday period.  At all <Col N="603" /> times arrangements are in place to ensure that emergencies are dealt with.</P>
    <P>The recent opening of the new geriatric hospital in Dundalk has, in fact, considerably improved the services for geriatric patients and the maternity services at the hospital have been expanded considerably in recent times.</P>
    <P>The level of staffing in the hospital will be a matter for the board in the context of the maintenance of the level of services for the area and the board's allocation for 1988.</P>

      <P>No decision has been taken to close Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, County Clare. The Mid-Western Health Board, in common with all the health boards, is developing plans for the establishment of a community-based psychiatric service. The plans, and their implementation, are the subject of ongoing discussions between officers of my Department, representatives of the board and administrative, medical and nursing staff of Our Lady's Hospital.  The most recent meeting was on 15 October.  As in all other areas, the full implementation of the plan will result in the provision of psychiatric services at local points throughout the catchment area, in this instance centred on Ennis, Ennistymon, Shannon and Kilrush.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the two appointments referred to in the Deputy's question is that in one case my Department approved an appointment, following open competition, to a permanent whole-time lecturer I post in marine electronics in Limerick CoACT on 30 October 1981.  In the other case my Department approved an appointment, following open competition, to a Class III post in marine electronics in Limerick CoACT on 5 March 1980.  The latter appointee was subsequently upgraded to college teacher level and then to lecturer I level following internal promotion agreements authorised under the terms <Col N="630" /> of Agreed Report Nos. 14/79 and 5/82. My Department is satisfied that in each case the minimum requirements of the posts in question were met.</P>

      <P>After the change in the schedules for the appointment and retention of staff in national schools takes effect in 1988 it is estimated that the average pupil-teacher ratio will be 29.2:1. As the full impact of a reduction in teacher numbers will not occur until late in 1988 it would not be possible at this stage to give details of the numbers of pupils which are likely to be in classes of various sizes.  However, the revised schedules allow in general for the appointment of an additional assistant for <Col N="632" /> each 38 units of average enrolment.  On this basis, a significant number of classes with more than 40 pupils is not expected.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the average pupil-teacher ratio in national schools during 1988 should be 29:1.  Information about class-sizes from 1 January 1988 is not available at present.</P>
