    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the percentage of the total health budget which is spent on non-medical areas; (b) the percentage of reductions in expenditure in the present financial year on non-medical areas; and <Col N="853" /> (c) the percentage reduction in expenditure in this financial year in medical areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in reply to a question by Deputy Michael Keating on 21 May 1987, the financial systems in place do not allow for the apportionment of full costs over specific categories of staff.  Moreover, any attempt at delineation of medical as opposed to non-medical areas must be open to question.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy is concerned that there may be an imbalance in the application of allocations by the health agencies in 1987, I should like to state that these agencies have been directed to make every effort to spread any reductions in staff over all grades and to retain front line staff where possible. From the reports I have had of the measures being taken to effect necessary economies, I have found no evidence that my direction is not being followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not possible to decide which parts of the health services are administrative and which provide medical services, how can the Minister say that only 10 per cent of the health service expenditure goes on administration? He said the health cuts were supposed to have been spread throughout the service &mdash; I am looking at the speech he made on the Private Members' Motion introduced by the Progressive Democrats two weeks ago &mdash; and he named three methods of reducing numbers in the health services.  I submit that those three areas affected are, almost exclusively, front line health servicing personnel and not administration.  I am quoting from this speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the non-filling of some vacancies, the reduction in the number of current temporary employees and the reduced scale of locum cover almost exclusively affect personnel providing medical cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of medical and non-medical areas in the health services is open to a very wide interpretation. For example, on the pay side, the strict interpretation might refer to the cost of doctors only, while a liberal interpretation might include porters and domestics employed in hospitals, mentally handicapped homes, <i>et cetera.</i> On the non-pay side, certain foods could be medically prescribed for a patient.  Two per cent of the total staff employed by the health agencies are involved in administration at the various regional headquarters. A further 8 per cent of the total staff are in administrative categories engaged in the direct delivery of service to patients either in the institutions or in community care.</P>
      <P>As regards reductions in the number of persons working in the health services, 9.2 per cent of the total number of reductions are in the clerical and administrative area which is broadly representative of the number working in the area of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us what percentage of the total health budget is spent on drugs?  Would he not agree that he has failed to reduce expenditure in the general medical area?  This is an area which could most easily and painlessly have produced substantial savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we have failed miserably this year.  Negotiations are taking place with the federation of Irish chemical industries about the cost of drugs.  On the question of generic prescribing, this is a much broader area and is not covered in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the reduction of expenditure in the non-medical <Col N="855" /> area, why is the Minister prepared to stand over the decision, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area, to reduce the supply of medical appliances, for example, to mentally and physically handicapped children who had their quota of incontinent pads reduced from 120 or 160 to 60 per month?  That kind of reduction in the welfare side of the community health service is totally unacceptable.  Will the Minister agree that there is an urgent need to review the guidelines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is a question on the Order Paper relating specifically to the matter raised by the Deputy I feel that, in fairness to the Deputy who tabled that question, I should not answer the supplementary now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of more than 1,200 mentally and physically handicapped children who are in many instances totally incontinent, the parents have been told by the Eastern Health Board that their quota of incontinent pads which roughly amount to 160 per month is being reduced to 60 and that they can pay at least £40 per month out of the domiciliary care allowance for the balance?  Will the Minister agree that whatever else is happening in the health services this cannot be allowed to continue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into a lot of detail on a matter which is worthy of a special question.  I should like to remind Members that many questions have been tabled today appertaining to Health.  I would be grateful for the co-operation of Members to have as many as possible dealt with.  Consequently, I appeal for brevity.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is fair to the Deputy who tabled the question that I should answer Deputy Desmond now.  However, I should like to tell him that the practice referred to by him of providing such equipment for children is <Col N="856" /> not the practice in any of the other seven health board areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will respond to the vital questions posed by the &ldquo;Today-Tonight&rdquo; programme on 12 May 1987 on AIDS; if he will expedite a scheme of needle exchange and more readily available methadone to drug addicts as a preventative measure against the spread of the AIDS virus among addicts; and if he will make a statement on the matter so as to allay public disquiet.</P>

    <P>196.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the serious problem relating to the interaction between drug pushing, the use of needles for drug abuse and the AIDS disease in inner city Dublin, as reported recently on radio and television programmes; the action, if any, he is taking in the light of these developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 196 together.  I am very conscious of the interaction between drug pushing, intravenous drug abuse and the spread of the AIDS virus.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to drug pushing is being constantly monitored by the Garda Síochána and they are taking all steps open to them to curb this problem.</P>
      <P>Intravenous drug abuse and the spread of the AIDS virus are clearly very closely linked and the Government's recent public information programme specifically addressed this problem.  I did, however, recognise that drug addicts are not particularly receptive to general campaigns and that special measures were required to get the message into the drug community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AIDS information booklet and a special poster specifically directed at intravenous drug abusers were circulated to all voluntary drug agencies as part of the programme.  In addition the poster <Col N="857" /> has been erected at several sites in the inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, I realise that, in relation to intravenous drug abusers, one-to-one contact and education remains the most important and realistic way of motivating personal behavioural changes.  Having consulted the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse it was agreed that a meeting should be urgently convened for personnel currently working on a one-to-one basis with intravenous drug abusers.  That meeting has been held and the Central Strategy Committee on AIDS have been examining these suggestions, my Department will be responding on these to the relevant agencies in the very near future.</P>
    <P>While the establishment of programmes of needle exchange and methadone maintenance for drug addicts was not advocated at the meeting it was considered that research done in other countries in relation to both of these topics should be examined to see if either would be appropriate in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>In relation to free needles the situation is that no other country has yet got a general policy on their distribution to intravenous drug abusers.  Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have experimental programmes in operation and will be evaluating the results over the coming months.  Information on these pilot projects should, therefore, be available quite soon and it would seem prudent to await these results before making a positive policy decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>Countries have also diametrically opposed views on the value and, indeed, ethics of methadone maintenance programmes. Many people regard methadone maintenance as a form of social management rather than medical treatment and find it very objectionable on that basis.  It must also be remembered that methadone is a very potent and addictive drug in its own right.</P>
    <P>However, both the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, and the Central Strategy Committee on AIDS, will be closely monitoring <Col N="858" /> developments in other countries in relation to both of these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the highest risk group in the AIDS crisis here are the intravenous drug users and those in intimate contact with them? Does the Minister agree that for some time the use of infected needles has been the most common means of transmission of the virus among drug users and that it has meant transmission of very dangerous proportions?  Does he agree also that this is a matter of extreme urgency because a virtual AIDS epidemic faces intravenous drug users here?  In the course of a reply to a recent question the Minister informed me that there are at least 3,000 drug users in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is embarking on a speech.  We should have finality in respect of these supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that such a dangerous position requires immediate and urgent action?  Does he agree that a pilot scheme, based on similar schemes in Britain under which needles are made available to drug users should be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assist the Deputy in eliciting information but he may not proceed indefinitely.  I have asked for finality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to my questions will the Minister set a time limit on when he will make a decision in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of numbers, the Department's HIV testing programme shows that 369, or 19 per cent of those tested intravenous drug abusers, are infected with the virus.  On the question of the use of needles I should like to tell the Deputy that no other country has yet adopted a general policy in relation to the distribution of free needles to intravenous drug abusers.  Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have got experimental programmes in operation <Col N="859" /> and will be evaluating those results in the coming months.  Information on those pilot projects should be available quite soon but it is too early to make a positive policy decision on the matter.  For instance, the question of legal liability pertaining to the distribution of free needles will have to be considered.  It is felt by some professionals that the distribution of free needles would not necessarily make irresponsible drug addicts become more responsible.  It should be noted that the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland have left it to individual pharmacists to decide whether to supply needles in different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to his recent publicity campaign and I should like to ask him if he accepts the criticism of it, that it is too narrow in a moralistic sense and does not, with the necessary emphasis, relate to the real problem in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland which is the number of drug users who are affected by the virus and present a real threat to other people.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the AIDS information programme is too narrow in a moralistic or in any other sense.  I am pleased to report to the House that at a recent meeting of the Ministers for Health of the other 11 countries of the European Community, it was unanimously agreed by all 12 that the public information campaign should be directed at the whole population and not specifically at those most at risk, the homosexual population and the intravenous drug abusers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's original reply, while I welcome his indication that the review committee in the Department are moving towards a position where they are trying to develop a policy of one-to-one contact with drug users and the drug community who are most at risk, I should like to ask if the Minister has funds available &mdash; should a decision of that kind be made &mdash; for the deployment of sufficient numbers of workers to undertake the task?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's public information campaign directed at drug abusers first appeared in the AIDS information booklet, in the newspaper advertisements to which I referred and by way of special posters in treatment centres and certain locations throughout the city.  At the launch of the AIDS campaign, it was stated that drug addicts are not especially receptive to a general campaign and that special measures are required.  Some of those special measures have been taken since the launch of the campaign.  The National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse has been set up and is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden.  They met on 5 May 1987 and considered what extra steps might be required to educate the intravenous drug community in regards to AIDS.  As a direct result of that meeting, a special meeting took place on 13 May with drug counsellors, social workers and others who work with the drug community from the Eastern Health Board and from the organisations working with drug abusers in the Eastern Health Board area.  I have a list of the organisations represented if the Deputy wishes to see it.  At that meeting a wide-ranging discussion took place during which several matters were raised which might improve the delivery of information on AIDS and drug abuse generally to persons not yet addicted to hard drugs and to hard drug abusers.  These measures include the need for improved structures co-ordination between the Department, the health boards and the voluntary agencies and the need for <Col N="861" /> additional resources, mainly trained personnel. The Department will be responding shortly to the organisations on these points and as the campaign will be carried on mainly by people who are already working with drug abusers the question of extra funds does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have implemented, to date, the following measures aimed at controlling the spread of AIDS:</P>
      <P>&mdash; a monitoring system was established in 1984 under which AIDS cases are reported to my Department on a confidential and voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>&mdash;all blood donations are screened for the AIDS virus and those at risk are asked not to donate blood or organs.</P>
      <P>&mdash;only heat-treated blood products are used here and Ireland is practically self-sufficient in blood products produced for the domestic blood supply.</P>
      <P>&mdash;an AIDS anti-body testing service is available on a voluntary basis, throughout the country.  The level of infection is monitored, as far as possible, by the Department through the report of the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, where confirmatory testing is carried out; 9,338 tests have been carried out and 590 have been positive for the virus.</P>
      <P>&mdash;a capital grant of £250,000 has been given by the Department towards the further development of the Virus Reference Laboratory.</P>
      <P>&mdash;all doctors have been circulated with booklets on AIDS and the Health Education Bureau have published a leaflet for the general public.</P>
      <P>&mdash;a number of seminars have been held to train health care staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" />&mdash;cases of AIDS are treated in general hospitals by the appropriate consultant depending on the nature of the opportunist infection the individual may be suffering from.  General practitioners are a primary source of care and counselling for people who wish to be tested and have a positive result.  The community care teams will continue to provide general practitioners with a support service.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ireland is participating in an EC study of paediatric AIDS and we continue to co-operate with the international bodies, particularly the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a public information programme is being carried out.  Public knowledge about AIDS is being reinforced through the mass media programme and, on a more individual level, the personal worries and queries of individuals are being addressed through a detailed booklet and a freefone service.  The booklet is available through pharmacies, public health clinics and from doctors.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the health boards are setting up local AIDS programmes.  The necessary staff to do this are now in place in all the health boards following a series of training seminars which have been held over the last few months.  Over 500 people from the health boards and voluntary hospitals have taken part in these seminars and these now provide a pool of experience and resource to develop and implement local programmes to ensure that the AIDS information element of our overall strategy is sustained.</P>
    <P>&mdash;I have established a central strategy committee to implement the national AIDS strategy.  The committee have available to them, and will, as appropriate, draw on the advice and assistance of other experts on particular aspects of the AIDS problem.  The committee are reviewing further strategies for dealing <Col N="863" /> with AIDS and are reporting to me on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>&mdash;while the campaign addresses the problem of the spread of AIDS through intravenous drug abuse, addicts are not especially receptive to general campaigns and special measures are required to get into the drug community.  The booklet and a special poster directed at IV drug abusers are being provided to all voluntary drug agencies.  In addition the poster has been erected at several sites in the inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>&mdash;however, we realised that in relation to IV drug abusers one-to-one contact and education remains the most important and realistic way of motivating personal behaviour changes. Having consulted the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse it was agreed that a meeting should be urgently covened for personnel currently working on a one-to-one basis with IV drug abusers. This meeting took place on 13 May 1987.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply.  Does he agree that the booklet to which he referred and the advertising in general in this area have been rather simplistic and moralising and thereby ineffective?  They have been widely criticised by those directly involved with sufferers from AIDS and those at risk.  Does the Minister further agree that the booklet pays very scant attention to those at present most at risk, drug abusers and some members of the homosexual community?  Does he further agree that the lack of emphasis on the use of condoms as a protection against the virus and the use of a free needle exchange system between intravenous drug abusers is a serious omission?  Will the Minister agree to provide funding for the voluntary counselling services which are at present doing excellent work in assisting those at risk and others who have been infected with the HIV virus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the campaign or the booklet issued at the launching of the campaign are limited. The campaign is very well balanced and, as I said earlier, it confirms to the views of the other Ministers for Health in the EC.  They agreed the campaign was being conducted satisfactorily and directed at the whole population and not specifically at the high risk groups such as intravenous drug abusers and homosexuals. One of the reasons the 12 Ministers of the European Community believe that it should be directed at the whole community is that there is more and more evidence that AIDS is spreading among the heterosexual community and is not specifically confined to drug abusers and the homosexual community.</P>
      <P>On the question of condoms, the booklet made it very clear that the safest way to avoid AIDS is to stay with one faithful partner. On page nine of that booklet it is stated that for sexually active people who are not in one faithful partner relationships a strong condom correctly used is the single most effective defence against AIDS.  I do not know how anybody can say the issue was avoided in the booklet which also gave the names of the various agencies who might be in a position to help those who are anxious or worried about AIDS or those who may have the AIDS virus.  Included among those agencies is the Gay Health Action Group in Sheriff Street in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very important need for anonymous testing services for AIDS victims and for those at risk?  Is he also aware of the World Health Organisation's recommendation on the matter and that it is, in fact, the practice in both Britain and the United States that such anonymous testing services are available?  Will the Minister set up such a service here with pre- and post-counselling services attached as they are very important? Such a service is not available and a test <Col N="865" /> cannot be carried out anonymously at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity to have blood taken and a test carried out for the AIDS virus is available from a family doctor.  I accept that that test is not anonymous.  There are a number of sexually transmitted disease clinics, in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. They are available to anybody who wants to have a test for the AIDS virus carried out.  There is a also a telephone service in operation in each health board area manned by an area medical officer who will discuss the problem with individuals who wish to remain anonymous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why no reference to the provision of clinics and services within a hospital was made in the Minister's reply even though he has now referred to them.  It is indicative of the lack of seriousness with which the need to have back-up services available in hospitals is taken.  The hospitals bear the brunt of the testing services because of people's desire for confidentiality.  Has the Minister visited any of these facilities and seen the circumstances in which they operate and, if not, will he undertake to do so?  He would then become more aware of how understaffed they are, of the lack of space and equipment.  A very expensive drug which may halt or, perhaps, cure the disease may become available later in the summer and is the Minister going to leave the decision to the medical personnel who will be fighting for some of the limited provisions as a result of the cutbacks as to whether they will order this expensive drug?  I would like the Minister to comment on the adequacy of the financial provision which has been made to face this medical crisis.</P>

      <P>Let me say before the Minister replies that I asked for the co-operation of the House in dealing with as many questions as possible on the Order Paper today.  You will observe that we have now been dealing with questions for over half an hour and have only <Col N="866" /> dealt with three questions.  If that is the way Members want it, that is fine with the Chair, but I am anxious to make some progress on other questions and I am again seeking your co-operation and asking you to be relevant and brief.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the question of the availability of a drug in the summer, my information is that a drug to combat AIDS will not be available for four years.  We are keeping the situation under review and any drug which becomes available for the treatment of AIDS will be made available to those who suffer from that illness in this country. I am reviewing the facilities which are available in each of the health board areas, such as sexually transmitted disease clinics, to ensure that facilities will be made available and that people can go anonymously to them to have a blood test carried out if they so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In his initial reply the Minister said that notification of the AIDS virus is not compulsory but voluntary.  If that is so, would the Minister not accept that it is now necessary to give a directive to the health boards that this disease is a notifiable one and that it should be compulsory for the health boards to report back to the Department of Health as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are varying views on the question of compulsory notification and I am one of those who believe that there should not be compulsory notification at this point in time as there is always the danger that people who should turn up to have a test for AIDS might not come forward for investigation and treatment if the disease was compulsorily notifiable.  This is the practice in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us why there is a contrast between the explicitness of the booklet as to the use of condoms &mdash; a booklet which will not be read by the overwhelming majority of the people &mdash; and the phraseology used <Col N="867" /> in the public notices and advertisements in the newspapers which indicates that in the context of AIDS and the use of condoms they should consult with their medical practitioners?  Could the Minister tell us what the reason for that particular form of advice is and could he also state whether it would not be preferable for the advertisments to state explicitly that the use of condoms provides a barrier to the catching of the AIDS virus?  I make the point to the Minister and ask him to comment on it.  It is a rather circuitous route to suggest to people that they should consult with their doctors about using condoms when, for anyone over the age of 18, there is no need to consult with a doctor or to obtain a prescription in order to obtain condoms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that the public should be aware that condoms are not 100 per cent safe in preventing AIDS any more than they are 100 per cent safe in preventing pregnancy.  As I have stated many times in public and particularly during the launching of the campaign, condoms reduce the risk of contracting AIDS but they do not eliminate the risk.  It is important that the public should know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the general opinion which has been expressed here and elsewhere, would the Minister agree that the money he has spent so far, about £500,000, has been wasted on fairly useless advertising?  Can he tell us what extra provision of funds he has made available to provide the extra special beds and the extra special staff which are required to <Col N="868" /> deal with this crisis?

I believe the campaign has been very successful in making people aware of how AIDS is contracted and how it may be avoided.  It is important to stress that as of now there is no known cure for AIDS.  We are depending on a public information programme.  As I said earlier in reply to a question, we have a central strategy committee who are monitoring the situation.  Now that the campaign is coming to a close, I will be asking them what further steps need to be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal recommendation of the Task Force on Child Care Services was that new legislation should be introduced to update and extend the law in relation to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, which was one of a number of measures <Col N="870" /> intended to give effect to that recommendation, was being examined by a special committee of this House when the general election intervened.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to the question on 30 April last, that Bill would have required substantial changes involving as many as 150 amendments.  Rather than re-introducing the Bill and re-writing it on the floor of the House, I am convinced that it would be more expeditious to allow the 1985 Bill to lapse and to introduce a new Children Bill.  Much of the work on this has already been completed by my Department and I hope to introduce a new Children Bill during the summer.</P>
    <P>The supplementary report of the Task Force recommended that the law should be changed to permit the adoption of children whose parents are married to each other.  Within the next day or two, I expect to circulate an Adoption Bill which will enable the adoption in certain circumstances of legitimate children with a parent or parents alive.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that there have been widespread improvements in child care services since the publication of the Task Force report in 1980.  I am committed to maintaining and, where possible, building on the advances which have been made in this area.  Towards this end, I have directed health boards in the 1987 letters of allocation to protect the child care services from the effects of any necessary spending reductions and to maintain expenditure on these services at least at 1986 approved levels in real terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister saying that the situation has improved dramatically since the report was published in 1980.  Would he not be honest today and admit that the organisations dealing with child care are in crisis at present, being inadequately funded to deal with the problems of teenage drinking, teenage drug abuse, teenage homelessness and the whole area of glue sniffing and lawlessness amongst teenagers? The present statutory bodies are inadequately funded to deal with these problems at present.  There is a crying <Col N="871" /> need for the Bill to be published immediately. We were promised legislation before the summer recess.  It is obvious now that we will not have it before the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is well advanced at this stage.  As I said, we thought it would be more expeditious to bring forward a new Bill because of the number of amendments that were necessary to the 1985 Child (Care and Protection) Bill.  The Bill will be circulated to the House as early as possible.  It will not be debated in the House before the summer recess but it was never intended, as I understand it, that it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Bill circulated in 1985 was a substantial Bill?  Apart from four amendments for consequence, the other 150 amendments are purely consequential changes in the numbering and resectioning of the Bill.  In view of the fact that that Bill was before a special committee of the House and had completed Second Stage debate, there should be no delay in the publication of the new Bill.  Would the Minister not agree that after 30 years we really must publish this Bill and get it through now because it will not be enacted before the middle of 1988 at the earliest?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond about the need to expedite publication of the Bill.  As the Deputy knows, it is important that the Bill should be correct when it comes to the House so that it will not be necessary to withdraw it from the House.  When I was in Opposition, at the first meeting of the committee to discuss that Bill I suggested that it would be more expeditious for the then Minister to withdraw the Bill and bring forward a new Bill.  I believe we have taken the correct course.  Certainly, there will be no delay on my part in bringing the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>My question perhaps includes that element of Deputy Shatter's question in that he was interested to know whether there will be any major areas of omission.  Is the Minister including a strengthening of the Bill in any way, or is it simply a redrafting procedure based on decisions existing at the time the Bill was withdrawn?  In that redrafting or additional reconsideration, will the Minister be paying attention to the recent <Col N="873" /> report of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children which saw need for a stronger Bill?</P>

      <P>How can the Minister reconcile the answer he has just given &mdash; that there will be no real reduction in the level of care of children who are in need of care and protection &mdash; with the fact that in community care services there is a real reduction in care?  Many social workers have been let go and those who are left are working under such constant pressure that they are suffering from burn out.  Those social workers also will be forced to leave.  The service is being rapidly run down.  Would the Minister not agree that children who are being neglected, children in foster care and those in need of foster care or adoption are very much at risk in terms of care?</P>

      <P>My Department issued a circular on 23 April 1987 to each health <Col N="874" /> board, public voluntary hospital and home for the mentally handicapped which gave clear instructions to these agencies as to the basis for implementation of the Government's decision on non-filling of vacancies in the health services.</P>
      <P>The types of posts referred to by the Deputy, those in the surgical and medical areas, those occasioned by maternity leave or those in mental handicap homes, are subject to similar criteria in relation to filling of vacancies.  Such vacancies may be filled on a temporary or locum basis, without specific approval, provided the agencies are satisfied that they are on target to meet their staffing reduction targets and that they do not exceed their 1987 financial allocation.  Filling of such vacancies on a permanent basis requires my approval and is dependent on strict criteria being met.</P>
      <P>Temporary vacancies arising from career breaks may only be filled if the particular agency is on target to meet its 1987 staff reduction requirement and its 1987 financial allocation is not exceeded. The agencies have also been advised that persons due to return from career breaks in 1987 may be offered an extension on their career break or be allowed to return provided suitable vacancies are available.</P>

I want to ask the Minister, too, if he is aware of the chaos being caused in every health board area, both in urban and rural communities, by virtue of the fact that not a day goes by without large reductions in staffs of the health boards.  Is the Minister going to continue with the policy he has been implementing for the past two months or does he now realise that that policy is totally incorrect and, if so, is he prepared to change it?</P>

      <P>In the Dáil on budget day my colleague the Minister for Finance announced that the public service embargo would apply right across the public service and that vacancies would not be filled without the prior consent of both the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Because of the sensitive nature of the health services it was agreed with the Minister for Finance that vacancies in essential areas could be filled temporarily while awaiting the sanction of the Minister for Health and the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he, as a medical practitioner, can conceive of a situation where vacancies, for example, surgical vacancies, would arise and where there would be available locums on a temporary basis to fill those positions for months on end pending sanction by him and the Minister for Finance? Would the Minister not agree that such a personnel procedure is a recipe for chaos and will lead to total confusion within the voluntary hospitals, the health board hospitals and even in the agencies for the mentally and physically handicapped? Is it true that a nurse who has got, say, a two year career break will only be allowed back into the hospital provided there is a vacancy in the hospital?  Would the Minister not agree that that procedure is a total travesty of the policy of career breaks.  That procedure which is now apparently being applied will mean that career breaks in the public service will terminate forthwith because nobody will go on a career break if they have no prospect of being reabsorbed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is nothing new in a public service embargo.  In 1981 the Coalition implemented a public service embargo in which only one in three vacancies was to be filled.  That embargo <Col N="876" /> was not successful in reducing the numbers working in the public service which was the object of the embargo.  Because of the arrangement between myself and the Minister for Finance I am satisfied that there will be no serious problem in the filling of essential vacancies in any of the health agencies.</P>
      <P>I am looking into the question of temporary career breaks to see what can be done to alleviate the problems that are created both for people who are on career breaks and for those who may want to take career breaks in the future.</P>

With regard to the reduction in the number of people working in the health service I accept that 2,000 vacancies will not be filled and that other jobs may be lost as a result of the inability of the health agencies to fund these jobs.

It is twice the number projected in the budget.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>In June 1986 the then Minister concluded negotiations with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on a new bilateral agreement governing the terms of supply of drugs and medicines to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current agreement with FICI provides that, on average, the price of drugs to the GMS shall not exceed 107.5 per cent of the UK trade price of those drugs. A rebate of 5 per cent of the cost of the <Col N="880" /> drugs supplied to the GMS is also made by the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>In the hospital services, a mandatory discount of 15 per cent is given off the listed Irish trade price on orders in excess of £100 in respect of any single manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing a national drugs formulary is one that is kept under review.  The basic drugs formulary concept is already widely used by public hospitals, in selecting drugs for purchase.</P>
    <P>The terms of the existing agreement are currently being discussed with the federation by officers of my Department and I shall issue a further statement when these discussions have been concluded.</P>
    <P>I should point out, that while I have no control over the retail price of drugs, I am having the reports referred to examined in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of talking in the context of our relationship with Britain is the Minister aware that in the context of the EC in 1984 our drug prices were the fourth highest in Europe, that in 1986 our prices were the second highest and that some drugs here are costing ten times what they cost in Spain and in other European countries?  Has the Minister any plans to introduce legislation which would limit the percentage of profits ploughed back into promoting drugs in this country?  Will he consider curbing the power of drug companies in this country where considerable savings could be made rather than indulging in the cuts among temporary workers and temporary nurses?  Surely the Minister should renegotiate the arrangements with the drug companies in this country?</P>

It is only right that I should pay tribute to my predecessor Deputy Desmond for the agreement he achieved with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries in ensuring that the drugs would be purchased by the public services <Col N="881" /> here at just 7½ per cent above their cost price in the UK.</P>

I have also set up a cost containment unit in my Department which will examine all purchases made by the health services, including drugs, to see how we can achieve better value for money throughout the health service. It is an area which I will monitor closely because there are savings to be made, although I do not accept that the savings to be made are as great as some people allege.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by me yesterday regarding the strike by non-consultant hospital doctors.  In that statement I indicated that I met with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation recently and at that meeting the action proposed by the non-consultant hospital doctors was discussed.</P>
      <P>Following that meeting, my officials contacted the health boards and voluntary hospitals to arrange for each of these bodies to hold discussions with their medical staffs and in particular the local non-consultant hospital doctors' representatives. The purpose of these discussions was to explain the implications of any decisions taken which would affect the non-consultant hospital doctors and to ask them to take part in talks which might reduce the effect of such decisions.</P>
      <P>Widespread consultation at local level has, in fact, taken place and in many cases such consultation has proved successful. It is only through those discussions at local level that practical progress can be made where the detailed knowledge of local circumstances is available. Accordingly, I have urged that in any case where agreement has not been reached these discussions should continue so that inconvenience and disruption can be avoided.  I am satisfied that emergency cover is being provided in those hospitals affected, while many hospitals are operating normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the imminent crisis in all of the hospitals where the junior doctors have withdrawn their services &mdash; I have in mind two major hospitals in my area as well as those in other areas &mdash; will the Minister not now agree to meet with the junior doctors to discuss with them the difficulties which <Col N="883" /> have caused this strike?  Will he not agree that previous agreements have been broken and that discussions at local level are not adequate now to bring about a satisfactory solution to the difficulty which confronts the junior doctors?  Will he agree further that these junior doctors are expected to work up to 120 hours per week and does he consider that reasonable? Would it not be much more reasonable for him in the interests of the health of people to agree to meet with the junior doctors, sit down face to face with them and go through the problems that confront them now and bring about a quick solution to this problem?</P>

      <P>As I have said, I met the IMO within the last two weeks and we discussed the present problem.  I share Deputy Molloy's concern at the long hours the doctors might have to work.  I have asked the health boards and the hospitals affected to renew their invitation to junior hospital doctors to enter into local negotiations, and I have indicated my concern that excessive hours should not be asked of non-consultant hospital doctors as a matter of routine rostering.  I believe the way forward in this dispute is negotiation at local level. I am glad to say that in the last 24 hours agreement has been reached with two further hospitals and the non-consultant hospital doctors, and I believe that negotiations on agreement in a further two hospitals are in progress at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has referred to information about events in the past 24 hours, how many doctors at this time have withdrawn their services and, it seems, will continue to withdraw their services?  In those cases will the Minister agree that the withdrawal of services is on an indefinite basis and that this dispute could develop into a major crisis for the health of our people and for the whole structure of the health services?  Unless immediate action is taken by the Minister such as is suggested here, of direct meeting with the doctors <Col N="884" /> concerned and with their spokespersons, this situation will develop and deterioration will occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I believe this dispute can be settled only at local level by negotiations between the doctors concerned and the management of the hospitals concerned.  It is difficult to say how many doctors are involved in the dispute because numbers differ in different hospitals and a different number of doctors are involved in each hospital.  On the broader question, the Government issued a statement this morning after the Government meeting pointing out the serious financial position &mdash; we are all aware of it &mdash; in the health services.  It is not possible to provide more money for the health services this year.  Again, I appeal to the non-consultant hospital doctors to re-enter negotiations at local level so that this dispute may be brought quickly to an end.</P>

      <P>I will give very careful consideration to any further requests for closures which I might receive since I would remind the Deputy that primarily decisions as to the future of hospitals or other institutions rest with the authorities of such institutions, whether they be health boards, boards of management or religious orders.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos 41 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>During 1986, 13 consultants holding the common contract in voluntary hospitals ceased pensionable employment on age grounds.  Two other consultants died in service.</P>
      <P>The total net cost of the actual lump sum, including death gratuity, benefit paid in 1986 under the voluntary hospitals superannuation scheme was £79,706.  The gross cost of that benefit was £503,778, which was abated by arrears of superannuation contributions due in respect of reckonable service prior to the introduction of the common contract.  The gross annual cost in a full year of the pensions involved is £119,000 approximately, at salary rates effective from 1 May 1987.</P>
      <P>Between 1981 and 1985, 122 cases of retirement or death in service of consultants occurred in voluntary hospitals. The actual net cost of all lump sum benefit paid in those years was about £0.5 million, that is a gross cost of about £4.5 million reduced by arrears of contributions. At present, there are 93 retired voluntary hospital consultants in receipt of pensions and 23 pensions are being paid to widows of deceased consultants. The total gross annual cost in a full year is about £1.216 million at 1 May 1987 rates.  The benefits payable under the scheme to consultants are the normal benefits due to scheme members.</P>
      <P>Consultants in the health board service were already superannuable before the introduction of the common contract in accordance with the terms of the local government superannuation code which is administered by the Department of the Environment.</P>

Therefore it is possible to draft a foreign affairs committee, as outlined in the proposals in the names of myself and other Deputies of the Labour Party on this Order Paper which would not impinge at all on the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.

      <P>I wish to raise an item relating to the Order of Business for today and the schedule of business for the week.  The Taoiseach and the House may know that discussions at present between the Whips are exclusively, in a formal sense, between the Government Whip and the Fine Gael Whip.  There are limited times, of two, three or four hours, <Col N="1004" /> for debate on a number of items on the schedule of business this week.  The principle adopted for the Order of Business today is one that commends itself, I am sure, to many Deputies, that is that there is an internal limitation on the length of speeches on those items.  Will the Taoiseach agree in principle to incorporate that procedure into debates generally? For example, I am referring to the statements on the Cavan rape case tomorrow and the Urban Renewal Bill which will be debated immediately after it.  In the former case only two hours are allocated for debate.  If there is not some internal control on the length of speeches that means that the vast majority of members on all sides of the House cannot participate in debates.  I am asking a procedural question in relation to the need to impose an internal time limit on the length of speeches, if there is to be a limit on discussion generally in relation to issues.  I think that is something that would commend itself generally to the House and would afford everyone a democratic entitlement to participate.</P>

      <P>It does not present a problem today because as it happens the Order of Business indicates a time limit on the items to be discussed.  However, I gather that on the first item to be taken tomorrow that may be the case but in relation to the Urban Renewal Bill there is only an hour or two allocated for discussion. Second Stage is to conclude not later than 7 p.m.  Without some kind of control on the length of speeches, surely that is unrealistic.  Maybe this can be discussed tomorrow morning.  We start tomorrow morning with a two-hour discussion on the Cavan rape case without any agreement, as far as we are formally aware, on the limitation of time of speakers. That may mean theoretically that two speakers can take up the whole time allotted for discussion of that case in <Col N="1005" /> which many speakers in the House are interested and want to participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to continue to make a number of points in relation to the Finance Bill.  I wish to make three principal points in my remarks today.  The first one relates to what we believe to be a major omission in the Finance Bill, that is any suggestion that there will be any alleviation of the tax burden, particularly for the PAYE workers.  Secondly, I would like to comment on the generally fairly crude <Col N="1007" /> approach to the constraining of public expenditure, the effect of which is to cause unnecessary distress to very many people without necessarily bringing about major economic advantages which we all hope for.  Third, I wish to make some suggestions about omissions in the Bill in relation to the need for a much more sharply focused approach to industrial policy and industrial development.</P>
      <P>In relation to tax reform, one of the problems with the budget and the Finance Bill from our point of view is that we think it is possible and conceivable for substantial public support to be obtained for difficult financial measures &mdash; measures which curb public expenditure and which introduce public cut backs, if there is some light at the end of the tunnel or some reason for optimism.  Our problem is that there is no suggestion of any such optimism in this Finance Bill because it carefully excludes any reference to the need for improvement in tax reform now.</P>
      <P>Thus far one of the most fundamental flaws in the Government's policies, as evidenced by the budget and confirmed in this Finance Bill, is the total lack of any coherent plan for tax reform or even a first step in that direction.  This is not just a financial issue.  We maintain it is vital to communicate to the public a reason for constraint and tax reform is one such reason.  There is no such evidence in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all areas of fiscal policy I and my colleagues in the Progressive Democrates believe that fundamental tax reform is the issue crying out for the most urgent attention.  Government after Government in recent times have paid lip service to the concept of tax reform and we are all aware of the dust that is gathering on the Report of the Commission of Taxation. We have all talked about an equitable tax collection and enforcement system.  We have again in this year's budget the by now hardy annual of yet another special task force, this time comprising 25 members, to concentrate on collecting tax arrears.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a token gesture and a tinkering with the system rather than a radical <Col N="1008" /> root and branch approach to tax reform which genuinely gives to the bulk of PAYE employees some indication that the road has a turning for them.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from various sources and reports that the tax collection and enforcement system has effectively broken down.  A simple example of this was the recent admission by the Minister for Finance that the Revenue Commissioners were unable to chase up the almost £10 million owing by farmers in health contributions since the task of collecting this money was transferred to the Revenue Commissioners in 1984.  It is not a problem of obtaining additional revenue or a problem of imagination, seeking new sources of tax.  No, it was the simple exercise of collecting what was owed.  We have to accept that if we cannot collect what is due, then the system has faltered, if not totally broken down.</P>
    <P>Ordinary workers have been very patient but they are not fools.  I believe those in the PAYE net feel conned and bitter at their persistent exploitation and the fact that they, peculiarly and exclusively, have carried the burden for an enormous and disproportionate level of public expenditure over many years.  They are exhausted from that burden.  They are being driven in large numbers into economic activity outside the legitimate economy, driven in large numbers out of the country and driven away from the idea of personal enterprise and initiative into, unfortunately, depression and despair. This is because it is no longer worthwhile working here because the tax take is too great; it depresses initiative and stultifies any attempt by people to better themselves. Surely that is a reasonable and laudable objective.</P>
    <P>The PAYE taxpayers observe the contrasting lifestyles of their neighbours and those lucky enough not to be in the PAYE net.  They see there are two broad classifications of taxpayers; what we might call the PAYE group and the PAYL sector.  One pays as they earn, having tax deducted before they even receive their wages and under the other system it appears you pay as you like.  In <Col N="1009" /> the latter sector the extent of tax evasion is scandalous.  This scandal is exacerbated and encouraged to thrive by the knowledge of our totally inadequate tax collection and enforcement system and the fact that the nonsensical sanctions which are allegedly in existence are seen to be a waste of time because at the end of the day if people are unlucky enough to be caught they negotiate a settlement that, inevitably, is better than what they would otherwise have had to pay.  That is turning economic justice and logic on its head.  It is an absolute scandal in terms of the entitlement and equal rights of the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that if this Finance Bill is to attempt to revitalise the economy, a fair tax system must be developed.  People must be reassured that when they pay their fair share towards the upkeep of the State their money is being wisely spent and, secondly their share must not be such as to crush them beneath its weight, which is happening at present.  Many people are paying half their earnings in tax and that is very wrong.</P>
    <P>Part of an equitable tax system has to be a significant alleviation of the tax burden on the PAYE sector.  Six years ago only 14 per cent of taxpayers paid tax above the standard rate.  This year that figure is likely to be nearly 50 per cent. Instead of the repeated promises of tax relief, this Government have turned the screw still more, not merely by the relentless rise in direct taxation or by the failure to even consider the indexation of tax allowances but by increasing the PRSI take &mdash; which is income tax by another name &mdash; and, throughout the budget, increasing the tax take by something in the order of 14 per cent or over £300 million.  I believe the PRSI take alone is set to reap an extra £11 million this year and the tampering with the mortgage interest relief will take another £10 million out of the allowance previously enjoyed by taxpayers.</P>
    <P>All the waffle, the talk and the promises about tax reform and relieving the burden on the PAYE sector is put in stark relief when we look at the revenue <Col N="1010" /> projections for this year.  This year income tax will bring in £2,721 million, up £333 million on last year, the vast bulk of it coming from the PAYE sector, while certain privileged groups in our society, including people with substantial holdings of land, are getting away yet again virtually scotfree.  That is unjust and cries out for some form of correction.  This Finance Bill does nothing in that respect.</P>
    <P>By contrast, capital taxes this year will bring in a paltry £36 million.  When total tax revenue is looked at, we see that income tax again contributes disproportionately to the Exchequer coffers.  Of the total increase of £473 million in global tax revenue, £333 million comes from income tax, from people caught in a spiralling net of increasing taxation.  They get less reward for their work.  We have a declining tax base while in general terms public expenditure and State expenditure &mdash; inefficient expenditure in many cases &mdash; continue to rise.  That is not the type of picture anybody can be optimistic about. The Bill is not the type of measure which can point us in the direction of radical reform of our taxation system.</P>
    <P>We will not support any Finance Bill which does not include some rationale for public expenditure constraints, that rationale being some beginning of improvements for those in the PAYE net.  If there is not that kind of light at the end of the PAYE tunnel we will oppose that measure and that is why we are voting against the Bill.  We are voting against the measure not because we will get any great pleasure in making it uncomfortable for a Government who have in some ways begun to do some of the things many of us were talking about for the past few years, but because there is no point in passing such measures unless there is the beginning of an argument for people who do not understand the cutbacks and constraints and cannot see what the rationale is.  Part of that rationale is about ensuring a more equal distribution of tax in our society.  That has not happened and it is not proposed in the Bill.  If the Minister uses the same type of phrases in next year's Finance Bill, assume we can expect the same <Col N="1011" /> Augustinian type of approach to tax reform, namely, in due course make me chaste but not just yet or, as in this case, we will correct the taxation imbalance but not just yet.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>We maintain that tax reform cannot wait, that it is an element of social justice relating to the well-being of the State, to the right of people to have fair return for their efforts, to the right of people to have reward for initiative, to the nature of a society which increasingly says to people who work: &ldquo;You are fools; it is much easier if you do not; it is much easier in the black economy or outside the country.&rdquo;  The reason the PAYE net is being tightened about the necks of those people is that they are a soft target. They are in the net.  An interesting thing about the approach in the budget in regard to the attempt to collect tax due is that the chase is on after those who are in the tax net but if one happens to have evaded or eluded the grasp of the Revenue Commissioners to date one is safe. That is preposterous.</P>
    <P>We are making a strong demand, underlined by our outright opposition to any proposed measure that does not incorporate some meeting of that demand for tax reform now.  It is not something that can wait for some hazy global national picture to become balanced in a way that nobody has yet defined.  It is not something that can wait indefinitely because the effects of brutal taxation on the PAYE sector are depressing economic initiative and the spirit of people who are &mdash; pardon the cliche &mdash; the very backbone of society because they are the people who work.  That has be be corrected.  We are not asking for an overwhelming redistribution in the Bill or very soon, but we are asking the Government to begin the process.  I will spell out how we believe the Government should embark on that.  We think tax reform is inextricably part and parcel of the problem of economic well-being.  Obviously, if we increase reward for effort, we encourage additional reward but if we do the opposite, if we increase the tax take as is proposed in the Bill, we depress the <Col N="1012" /> initiative of people who are working and we depress the natural initiative of people to get out and work in the legitimate economy.</P>
    <P>How can we create an environment for risk-taking for the entrepreneur or, indeed, for getting up out of bed for the ordinary worker while the black economy, a symptom of the way we looked after our tax affairs, continues to thrive and taxation is at such penal rates?  All one has to do is look at the motor industry as an example.  In the past five or six years 9,000 jobs were lost in that industry.  The were not lost in net terms but were lost from the legitimate economy to the black economy, if motor industry sources we have had discussions with are telling the truth, as I am sure they are.  The House must address this primary need.</P>
    <P>The reform of our tax system is particularly crucial to the development of the services sector which so many recognise as the primary vehicle in job creation.  It is also vital that the tax rates are alleviated especially for those entering the workforce or seeking lower paid employment. Our tax reform proposal would begin at that end of the scale.  I should like to ask the Minister to have a look at the document our party published before the election.  That document, warts and all, tried to grasp some of the issues and spelled out what the priorities should be. We were so bold as to suggest where the Government could get some of the money to carry out those changes.</P>
    <P>It makes little sense for a person on the dole to take on a job when his net pay after PAYE, PRSI and levies leaves him or her no better off than if he or she were on unemployment assistance.  We must tackle the poverty trap which ensnares the lower paid and that is why the PDs put forward in the recent election campaign an innovative and practical proposal to begin with phasing out PRSI by abolishing it in year one on the first £3,000 of everybody's income.  In that way the measure is particularly beneficial to the lower paid who should be our first consideration.  We have examined a programme for abolishing PRSI right across the board and that would have <Col N="1013" /> begun by lopping 1 per cent or 2 per cent off the gross rate of 7.5 per cent but that would have meant very little to the lower paid and would have involved a substantial cost in this year.  This proposal to exclude the first £3,000 of everybody's income from PRSI would have been a dramatic step in tax reform and would be deliberately targeted at favouring the lower paid.  It would ease the tax burden on the lower paid.  That proposal will form the basis of an amendment we hope to table to the Bill before us.  The cost of that measure this year would be in the order of £60 million and I shall point out where I think that money can be obtained.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the manner in which the State oversee the expenditure of taxes they are taking in. It is foolhardy of the State to continue to seek to raise massive sums of public finance unless they address the problems of expenditure, not just quantitively &mdash; it is suggested that the State is doing that in the health area where there is a constraint but the bottom line is that we are spending more on health this year than we did last year &mdash; but also qualitatively where much work needs to be done.  In the qualitative area of State expenditure there is great room for imagination and initiative in successive reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That official oversees the various expenditures by Government Departments and every year he points to substantial revenues that would accrue to the State if we had better management and accountability systems and if there was the elimination of abuse, overlapping and, in some cases, downright fraud.  Those matters are explicitly outlined in a volume which is, despite its somewhat staid cover and colour, invariably more exciting than a Frederick Forsyth novel by virtue of its revelations.  I am referring to the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Any Government who stand over the annual publication of those reports without taking on board the suggestions in them do not have the moral right to continue to raise taxes in the way we do. <Col N="1014" /> Year in and year out the refrain in those reports about the deficiencies in the systems in place for spending our money is the same.  Year in and year out the same inadequacies, inefficiencies and systematic weaknesses are evident and outlined explicitly by Mr. Mac Domhnaill and his staff.  However, like recurring plaintive themes, it does not seem to get any better with age and, there is no change in the system.  Invariably, the reports are consigned to the Library where they gather dust in some obscure corner.  I maintain that if it is evident in those reports, as it is, that there are people in various areas of the public sector who have engaged in the forgery of invoices, in the falsification of documents, in establishing systems which allow them to make inputs to a computer for social welfare purposes, to keep the records and make the payments &mdash; a system designed for abuse &mdash; the moral entitlement of the Government to demand more tax is whittled away. Indeed, the competence and the qualification of those who oversee that system to remain in office &mdash; I am not only referring to Ministers who are publicly accountable but to the senior departmental staff &mdash; has to be called into question.</P>
    <P>There is no real accountability in that sense and I urge the Minister for Finance to commence a debate in the House on those reports and those issues.  We should be permitted to examine how it is that the money we raise in this painful way, the vast sums that are increasing annually, are in some cases so misspent.  I am arguing for a major overhaul of the quality of public expenditure, the systems overlapping and duplication which goes on in every Department and sometimes between Departments.  It is a preposterous monument to incompetence, inactivity and inertia over the years and, above all, an indictment of our system of Government.  It is a major question mark over our entitlement to continue to raise taxes unless we can demonstrate that we have spent them wisely and well and it is perfectly obvious that we have not done so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> I will make a few brief comments in relation to the general approach the Government have adopted.  It is true, but pointless, to say that our present system of Government is not what the people, the Fianna Fáil supporters or indeed some of their backbenchers expected. The Government recognised the huge problem in relation to public expenditure, that there was not a limitless pocket and their supporters expected them to draw a line at a certain stage and to say that they would go no further. Leaving aside the damage that they may have done to the shredded credibility of all politicians in terms of a complete somersault <i>vis-à-vis</i> the promises prior to the election as an interesting philosopical exercise, for the first time in my memory in this House there is virtually unanimity about the need to correct the incredible imbalance between the size of the State sector, the role of the private sector and the tax take.  I exclude The Workers' Party from that unanimity as they can indulge in the luxury of being against everything and for nothing because they do not have to worry about implementing these measures.  Perhaps, to be fair, they do not agree because of their ideological views.  Unless the Government can alleviate taxation for PAYE workers they will not win public support or understanding because the ordinary person does not understand the system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some of the ways in which these cutbacks &mdash; if they can be so called &mdash; in public expenditure are implemented have been very arbitrary and crude.  In some cases the Government are depending on mechanisms which are outside their immediate control and in respect of which in some cases, they hope they will work.  However, that has not been the case.  Minister Woods in his contribution last Thursday went on at some length in this regard and I do not intend to elaborate on it.  To give an example of what I am talking about, Minister O'Hanlon, Minister Wilson and, to a lesser extent, the Minister for Finance spoke about the area of health.  The reality is that the poor are suffering <Col N="1016" /> because the machinery and system for dispensing the central fund of revenue from the Department of Health are loaded with vested interests.  It is a preposterous model for spending public money that those in control directly benefit, depending on their decisions.  I am talking about consultants, county councillors and others who comprise health boards.  It is whistling by the graveyard for the Minister for Health to hope that the taxes raised and constrained by him in overall terms to an increase of £16 million over last year will be all right when it percolates through the system.  It will not be all right because the people who make the decisions at middle management level stand to gain from them and because of that they succumb to the temptation of ensuring that the weakest and least articulate suffer.  That is wrong. It is an abdication of responsibility by the Government.  It is preposterous that medical card holders or those who have had to spend the last 30 or 40 years in old people's homes are bearing the brunt of cutbacks operated by health boards which, in every case bar one, have more money to spend this year than last year. The reason is that those at middle management and health board level who manage the funds are acting in a deliberately politically mischievous manner. They are allowed to do this because the Minister who has been involved for many years with health boards, is a prisoner of their psychology.  We all tend to stand up for the institutions with which we are associated but in this case they are doing us an injustice.</P>
    <P>There must be curbs on public expenditure accompanied by the alleviation of tax for at least some workers to show that there is light at the end of the tunnel and to give them a belief that there is justice in the system.  Various Ministers must ensure that justice is done and that the weak do not suffer.  The common contract is an outstanding example of the way public resources are abused, an open-ended capacity to write your own cheque.  It is an absolute disgrace which is not being dealt with.  I know people in pain who cannot get attention in hospitals <Col N="1017" /> and others who cannot get replacement limbs unless they pay for the service.  I want the Minister to take heed of what I say and to ensure that people are not abused in this way.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of industrial development policy.  The Minister did not refer to this in the Finance Bill but he mentioned confidence which used to be called buoyancy in the old days. Unfortunately, confidence does not butter any toast or fill any pint.  Ultimately, industrial development which is about creating an environment in which jobs can be generated is not just about a financial infrastructure which the Finance Bill is supposed to put in place, it is also about the shape, scale, size and nature of the semi-State bodies and organisations devoted to the creation of that kind of environment.  I want to make a suggestion in this respect which may seem a bit radical but it is a personal view.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, for example, has a plethora of semi-State bodies under his aegis and all doing good enough work.  Some do better work than others and project themselves very well. They range from the IDA with a staff of 700 and an administrative cost of £32 million to groups like the NBST with a staff of 76 and an administrative cost of £1 million.  The NBST dole out grants of £3 million and the IDA allocate grants of £176 million.  There are many other organisations involved, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fóir Teoranta, The Irish Film Board, IPC, ICC, NDC, CTT and so on.  I could go on for a long time.  The organisations which impinge on industry and commerce include ANCO, CERT, YEA, IMI, IIRS and so on.  Basically, they employ about 4,000 people and they spend something in the order of £700 million in grants.  I wonder whether the State should decide to consider taking a substantial portion of those grants and investing them in infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The economy would be aided and enterprise would flourish if we considered the elimination of virtually all grants with the possible exception of certain seeding grants for the purposes of getting industry <Col N="1018" /> off the ground and if interest rates, energy, telecommunications, postal and transport costs were brought into line with international competition.  That could be done if there was a drastic rationalisation of semi-State bodies.  I know it needs someone to bite a fairly large bullet &mdash; in this case perhaps 14 or 15 bullets &mdash; for this to be done but if we do not do so someone else will.  It is profoundly wrong that these semi-State bodies should continue to operate without a clear remit at this point of their function, without any clear accountability for the achievement of targets and long past the date on which they were set up.  In some cases, as in the case of SFADCo, they were set up to achieve temporary objectives.  In many cases, too, such as the IIRS, substantial technology is now available outside of their particular ambit and consequently the same degree of investment is no longer required.  When I inquired as to how many staff are employed in the IIRS I was informed that the number is 603.  It is very hard to accept that the number of semi-State bodies has to remain constant for all time.  Indeed, if you define a State sponsored body as being a body which receives public funds either directly or indirectly there are many more State-sponsored bodies and, of course, in all of these latter cases there is no accountability to the Department responsible for public funding.  That is a matter which should be addressed.  No list of those State-sponsored bodies is available in the Department as many of the grants are given by lower middle management bodies who in turn do not necessarily require the same standards of accountability. Indeed, there is no standard form of accounting in semi-State bodies so we cannot compare like with like.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is a case to be made for asking whether we would all benefit if we dealt with infrastructure and input costs.  Should we spend substantial amounts of money by way of giving grants to individual enterprises, the return on which is sometimes hard to see?  I have no doubt that Fóir Teoranta would be willing to substantiate that point.  We <Col N="1019" /> should put that money directly into infrastructure and the services area and into reducing input costs which would automatically benefit all industries while leaving some funds to help the initiation of companies and their subsequent development, which presumably is the purpose of the NDC, the venture capital agency.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on section 4 of the Bill which abolishes, in relation to Irish people working abroad, the place of abode test for tax purposes for residents in the State.  Under that test Irish people working abroad are deemed to be resident in Ireland for tax purposes if they maintain a place of abode here and return even for a short period during the tax year.  In consequence, they are liable to Irish tax on their remittances home.  The abolition of the place of abode test will enable such people to visit home and transfer their savings here without being subject to Irish tax simply because they maintain a place of abode here and make short visits home.  That is fine but why is it that this welcome provision is not accompanied by the same principle being applied to foreigners who maintain a holiday home in Ireland?  The economic benefits are precisely the same and the potential advantages to the Irish economy are significant.  Foreign currency would be earned from the initial sales of holiday homes, a development which presumably would be made attractive by such initiative, and the construction industry would obtain more business and consequently create more jobs in the process. Tourism would benefit from the visits to Ireland of these people each year and those who maintain holiday homes here could well be attracted to use those same houses as their retirement homes in due course, thus bringing their retirement incomes to Ireland.  That would be a measure which would not cost the State anything but which would offer an extra fiscal inducement to a wide range of people who at present do not make any net contribution to the Irish Exchequer. I suggest that the Minister look again at the place of abode requirement and consider whether it should apply to <Col N="1020" /> foreigners who maintain a home here.</P>
    <P>Regarding sections 8 to 11 the Minister talks about the improvements to and the extension of the business expansion scheme which obviously are welcome but I do not understand what the thinking behind this aspect of the Bill is.  There appears to be a major sting in the tail: two areas are specifically excluded for no apparent good reason but perhaps the Minister would be good enough to explain why that is so.  The first of these two areas is data processing and computer software which benefits from the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax under the Finance Act, 1984 and the second is the area of the financial services which will be carried on within the Custom House Dock site.  I argue that this provision should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>In the case of data processing and computer software, either these internationally traded high quality services are good for the economy and for job creation or they are not.  I imagine they are as they are labour intensive and do not have the disadvantages which attach to some heavy product industries operating in a small island economy.  They require high skills and generate a high added value.  They allow for technology transfer and for the payment of high salaries to employees.  They do not place a burden on the balance of payments through the import of raw materials as they depend primarily on Irish brain and telecommunication networks, all positive pluses that one might have thought would suggest some degree of recognition and encouragement.  Therefore, it seems that we should be promoting this kind of industry in every way and encouraging Irish people to invest in enterprises in these industries but, unfortunately, they are specifically excluded.  I do not see any reason for this in the Bill, in the explanatory memoranda or in any of the speeches which have been made including, that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Custom House Docks site &mdash; the ring fence as I call it but to the extent that it is in my own constituency, I welcome it &mdash; it seems that the concept of a geographic limit should take second <Col N="1021" /> place to the concept of encouraging a type of business.  The question of whether that internationally traded service is available in the north dock, in the south dock or in any other part of the country is secondary as regional policy should take care of imbalances in terms of industrial or commercial investment in city areas and not financial mechanisms in a Bill such as this.  This Bill should be about attracting industry into this country. Consequently, it should be about a positive move to support internationally traded services be they professional or financial services, including architectural or consultant engineering services, medical services and so on.  I do not understand why it should be constrained within certain tight limits.</P>
    <P>In sections 12 to 20 the Minister makes a number of suggestions.  Much criticism has been levied by certain persons at the witholding tax on payments in respect of professional services.  I shall not go over that ground again but on the other hand any right thinking or fair person will not deny that this is an area which must be tackled.  However, the instrument which is, being used is crude in the extreme. The probability is that at the end of the day it will not take tax from those who it is supposed to take it from but from those who are serviced by these professional services.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill amounts, in effect, to the Exchequer receiving an interest free loan of part of the gross turnover from a wide range of professional practices.  That is what it boils down to.  The State will take an interest free loan on part of the gross turnover from a wide range of these practices. Therefore, it discriminates between practices which work for public institutions and those which work mainly or exclusively for the private sector.  Again, that is very hard to understand.  In many cases it amounts to double taxation as some professional practices are constituted as unlimited companies and the partners in this case are the PAYE workers who ultimately will pay the bill.</P>
    <P>The real solution is to introduce a tax clearance certificate scheme such as that <Col N="1022" /> which applies in the construction industry. This would apply right across the board in both the public and the private sectors.  It would apply to the widest possible range of services and would catch the defaulters, rather than penalising those who already pay their taxes in full and on time.  This system would insist that anybody operating in these areas would have to show a tax clearance certificate before being able to engage in that area of activity.  This would automatically catch everybody involved, not just those already comfortably and snugly in the net.  With a little imagination, the concept underlying the withholding tax could be improved to treat that area of potential tax revenue, but fairly and in such a way that everybody who should be caught will be caught.</P>
    <P>Section 28 gives effect to the Government decision to develop the Custom House Docks site as an international financial services centre by applying the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax to certain financial services to be carried on there.  I am familiar with that area, having represented it since 1973 in some shape or form, and I have no doubt that it is beginning to tell on me &mdash; I do not know about the constituents.  The type of proposal made is not ideal, in sociological or economic terms, for the area.  It inevitably will be a kind of empty canyon at night, if it ever takes off, an area of non-activity at night time with a large office concentration and people engaged in the financial markets, I presume surrounded by a large wall to protect it from the local citizens and the marauders who might challenge its domain.  It is not ideal if we want to do something with that site, but perhaps one should not be too churlish. At least, some commitment to that area is better than none.</P>
    <P>Whereas the general question of incentives for the Custom House Docks site is welcome, there are two major defects. The first is that the concept of confining these incentives to financial services alone is far too restricted.  We should follow the philosophy behind the designation of internationally traded services under the aegis of CTT.  The international <Col N="1023" /> services of architects and consulting engineers were named for promotion abroad by CTT in 1968.  They felt that here were legitimate areas for promotion which should be supported and encouraged. The services of the quantity surveyor were likewise added in 1971.  A major step forward was taken in 1983 when a very wide range of additional services was specified by ministerial order, made under the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act of that year.</P>
    <P>These areas are worth listing and included agricultural development and processing services, construction related services, medical services, training services catering for all kinds of activities, technical and general consulting services, including commercial and development services generally, international financial services, computer software and data processing services, public administration services, media recording and publishing services.  This section of the Bill could be broadened and its philosophy could be elaborated on to include the kind of reference already explicit in the way CTT promote these areas abroad.  That development of these and, indeed, other appropriate internationally traded services should be a mainstream plank in Ireland's new industrial development strategy.</P>
    <P>The second flaw is the erection of a fiscal ring fence around 27 acres of the Custom House Docks site.  These services about which we have spoken should be promoted here as a whole, nationally. They are good for all of us, not just as a regional strategy to deal with the local problems of a small area.  Our laws, our tax regime, our regulatory processes &mdash; of which, of course, there are too many &mdash; and our administration should apply to the whole of Ireland.  This vehicle should be used as a way of presenting Ireland as an attractive investment opportunity.  A simple technical amendment to the definition of services which qualify for the 10 per cent corporation tax is what is required, with the IDA being the operational conduit for entry into that regime.  Certification of a project <Col N="1024" /> by the IDA should not necessarily mean that the payment of a grant to that project by the IDA or by any other State agency should occur, but at least that the IDA should be involved to that extent.</P>
    <P>Section 31 talks about a change in the rate of corporation tax chargeable on home loan interest earned by banks when taken in isolation.  I hold no great candle for the banks but if we are going to get into the area of comparing like with like, this section does not do that.  Instead, it takes in isolation the home loan interest earned by banks and does not put them on an equal footing with other mortgage giving institutions.  This issue should not be viewed in isolation but should be related to other aspects such as the basic rate of tax paid by mortgage credit institutions on all their operations and the question of levies, such as the bank levy, which continues under section 43 of the Bill.  I must admit that I cannot understand any great rationale for this.  It is a totally arbitrary levy unrelated to any criterion that I am aware of.  Perhaps it would be bringing in a lot more money if it were related to some common sense criteria or perhaps it should not be there at all.</P>
    <P>Also what should be considered in this context is the application to certain institutions of statutory liquidity requirements and of capital adequacy ratios. None of those applies in this case.  We are simply singling out one element and pretending, for the purpose of comparing like with like, that the section is in order. I submit that that is not the case.  If we want a level pitch for competition, by all means let us have it, but an <i>ad hoc</i> action such as this does not achieve that desired end result.  It should be reviewed, or at least clarified in that context.</P>
    <P>As I have hinted, section 43 imposes a levy on banks, which was announced in the budget.  The section says that the duty would be assessed on the average amount of current accounts and deposit accounts as at stated dates in each of the months in 1986, subject to certain adjustments including a threshold of £10 million and so on.  I do not know what barometers the average amount of current and deposit <Col N="1025" /> accounts gives, or what that tells about the bank.  Obviously, it tells very little. In principle it is wrong that there is an arbitrary approach to levies on any financial institution when once again, I have no doubt, it will be the account holder who will pay this levy &mdash; the taxpayer once again.</P>
    <P>If there is something wrong with a corporation tax regime imposed on banks let us not get around the problem by some kind of arbitrary levy.  Let us tackle the root causes rather than continue to play around with the system in a crude and arbitrary manner such as this, which only brings tax law into disrepute.  Both the Central Bank and the Commission on Taxation are on record as saying that the bank levy is not justified, is arbitrary and does not have the kind of financial integrity that it should have in this context. When first introduced it was stated to be a temporary arrangement which was to be reviewed after the publication of the report of the Commission on Taxation. The first report of that commission was published in July 1982.  How long is temporary? How long do we have to wait for the review?  I do not know.</P>

      <P>For four years I sat listening to Deputy Desmond talking about health matters for two hours when he was Minister.  When the big parties change the rules we will play by the rules.  Until then I intend to exercise the same freedom as anybody else.  I sat here all day on Thursday and got in on the debate at 4.50 p.m.  I do not want to abuse the right of anybody else to speak and I am about to conclude but I shall not be lectured either.  It is in the Government's hands. We do not even get a chance to discuss the Order of Business in this House.  If the Government want to resolve it, they can take up what I said today to the Taoiseach.  We shall be quite happy to <Col N="1026" /> operate a five minute or ten minute limit, but as long as other people abuse it in this House we will take the time necessary to put our views on the record.  We understand very clearly that those views will be constricted and constrained at every opportunity &mdash; and perhaps electorally if some people get their way.  That said, I am sorry I had to get onto that note.</P>
      <P>The essential points I wanted to make were that the Bill is not acceptable because there is no suggestion of tax reform.  The public expenditure constraints that are being imposed in a crude fashion are hurting the weakest sections of the community.  There is a need for radical reform of our industrial policy. Something should be done about the question of spending money directly in infrastructure and in lowering input costs rather than through the system of semi-State bodies.  I would be grateful if the Minister would be good enough to comment on the specific sections of the Bill I referred to.</P>

      <P>I think you do.  I want to comment on some of the points made by Deputy Keating before I reflect on the general thrust of the budget and the <Col N="1027" /> Finance Bill: I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating said that his party could not accept the thrust of the Finance Bill because it did not contain in it the seeds of tax equity which his party espoused during the recent general election campaign.  Deputy Keating referred to his party's programme of tax equity and expenditure cutbacks.  I have to take issue with Deputy Keating &mdash; not with him personally because I respect him very much as a person &mdash; but with the thrust of the Progressive Democrate policies because they were dishonest in their manifestations.  The Progressive Democrats in one fell swoop proposed budget expenditure cuts and, at the same time, massive and sweeping tax reforms.  They proposed that all of these would happen instantaneously.  However, this could not happen.  His party did not cost their proposals fully and effectively.  The voter was left awash with ideas which were very vague and insubstantial, attractive in their general outline but containing no depth as to how one would go about achieving them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating may philosophise all he likes about what we said before and after the election.  He has already given us a lecture on that so therefore, it would not be proper to have a rehash of it across the floor of the House.  I have to take issue with his comments because during the period of the election campaign it was quite dishonest how his party expressed their ideas.  On the the one hand they promised expenditure cuts which were the flavour of the month and simultaneously they promised tax equity. They put before the electorate a rosy dawn, promising things that could not happen together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In his heart Deputy Keating knows quite clearly that they could not possibly come together.  Fianna Fáil's first priority when they came into office was to contain public expenditure. We had to address this problem in a very <Col N="1028" /> restrictive time limit because the budget had to be introduced on a specific date. We were left with very little time to review the expenditure of each Government Department and to trim our sails in each Department.  It is not true to say that the Minister for Finance and the Government have shown no light at the end of the tunnel.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the Finance Bill he stated very clearly in his speech that tax equity is high on the Government's agenda and that this will be tackled when we have restrained and contained Government expenditure.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  The Minister for Finance spoke about the introduction of tax equity when we have our first priority established.  We have introduced expenditure cuts and the public respect what we have done.  We all needed to learn lessons.  The public at large &mdash; and not just the political parties &mdash; have come to accept that if one spends more than is in one's purse one will eventually face enormous problems.

      <P>Side-by-side with the containment of public expenditure, we have also embarked on a policy of developmental projects and the two policies in tandem will bring in their wake tax equity.  Our first priorities are to cut back on public expenditure and to implement our policy of developmental projects which will lead to increased activity on <Col N="1029" /> the economic front.  Following from that there will be more funding for resources to ease the tax burden.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Keating's point that PAYE workers can, and do rightfully, feel they have borne the burden of taxaction for quite a long time for the range of increased and enhanced public services which the public have demanded during the years.  All of the programmes funded by the various Government Departments are worthy and estimable and are of great benefit to the consumer.  However, we must contain public expenditure and this we have set out to do.</P>
      <P>We have commenced also a range of developmental projects which will proceed at intervals in various sectors. Announcements have already been made which lend weight to what I have said. The educational announcement made yesterday will be clarified in full on Thursday by myself and the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology. This announcement holds great potential for development in third level colleges.  Its purpose is to enhance and establish well recognised links between the third level institutions dealing mostly in technology areas, the universities, the NIHEs and the world of industry.</P>

      <P>Hell hath no fury like a Leas-Cheann Comhairle scorned.  The purpose of the developmental projects, particularly the one on biotechnology, is to enhance liaison between industry and education.  When in Opposition Fianna Fáil placed emphasis on the importance of science and technology as an essential requirement for national development. Indeed all parties agree with us in this. Our priority must be to get the public finances in order but projects needed to stimulate economic activity must also be undertaken if our programme for national recovery is to get under way. We must encourage indigenous industries because they contain the seeds of growth. We have all woken up for the dreams in which one went abroad and returned with 1,000 jobs under one's belt, 1,000 jobs which turned out to be unsustainable. This is reflected in comments by the previous speaker with regard to grant-aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> There is great encouragement of innovation and technological self-confidence among young people in our second and third level institutions.  The Department of Education have undertaken pilot projects in the areas of science and technology. Young women are now becoming more involved and girls are now taking up the required mathematics, physics, chemistry and allied subjects.  Four pilot projects undertaken by my Department are to be increased this year with EC aid.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges were the success story of education in the seventies and eighties.  They were set up with a remit to serve the needs of a region industrially and economically.  These colleges have expanded and have responded magnificently to regional needs.  In many cases they achieved a national character in their degree awarding activities.  Some colleges have a particular speciality. Through the limitations of the 1930 VEC Act, the VECs are not empowered to engage in research and development. They see this as a constraint upon their activities in interacting with the local business agencies and the local development agencies, such as the IDA, the county development teams and the various other groups set up to attract industry and to develop new processes and new ideas for industry.  Because of my long links with regional colleges this was an area I was determined to do something about when I came into office.</P>
    <P>I was not happy with the idea of the Fine Gael Government, which was disseminated six weeks prior to the election, in which they proposed to break the links between the regional colleges and the VEC committees.  The notion that, if that link were broken, the regional colleges would become dynamic powerhouses overnight was false in its premise and it was not sufficiently explored.  I am convinced that with amendments to the existing VEC Act there is great potential for growth in industrial development in the regional colleges.  Within the human resources and within the resources of the courses offered by the regional technical colleges, there is great potential for interaction <Col N="1032" /> in a region between educational institutions, the training agencies and the industrial development agencies.  These aims can best be served by maintaining the links with the VEC committees in an altered fashion.  I propose, within a reasonable time, to introduce legislation outlining how this can be done.</P>
    <P>The ERASMUS programme which has recently been decided by the Council of Education Ministers in Brussels will have attractive implications in the following three years for third level colleges in Ireland.  I was lucky in that I could go off to Brussels and come home with it in the bag.  I was lucky that there had been other meetings prior to that at which various hindrances were overcome.  I arrived in Brussels on the evening it was all signed and sealed, which was very fortunate for me.  It means that over the next three years roughly £65 million will be allocated to the member states of the EC to be devoted to interaction between third level institutions in the various countries. A young man or woman in a third level institution can opt at the end of, say, two years, with a further year to run, to go to a comparable institution in Europe dealing with the discipline in which that student is engaged, and can spend six, nine or 12 months doing that course at that university and can then come back home to the parent college and the student will receive the full credits and full assessment of that period abroad.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Estimates debate on Education I will give details of this proposal.  In the light of my comments today on third level education and funding, it is a very important milestone.  It will give our students a chance to gain from the experiences of colleges abroad. The grants available to students to do so will enable them to travel freely and to enter freely on the course of studies.  The grant will not be means tested but will be available if a student fulfils the academic requirements and subject to the finding of a comparable level of study in that discipline at a comparable university. This proposal happens to tie in with the announcement which Deputy McCarthy will be making on Thursday and with the <Col N="1033" /> whole idea for development in third level institutions.  I am very pleased that the third level institutions have been up front in their initial submissions for the ERASMUS programme and for this biotechnology programme in the centres of excellence which we have designated. I have greatly interested industry in responding to the proposal by way of sponsorship.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Government thrust in the Estimates, in the Budget and in the Finance Bill, it is not true, as was said by an earlier speaker in the debate, that in the health services, the poor are the people who will suffer.  As Deputy Keating said, vested interests remain on the health boards protecting their interests. For instance, when we came into Government we decided that the prescription charges which were to be levied on medical card holders for each item for which they would go to their prescribing chemist would be lifted because we saw those charges as a direct affront to the medical card holders who would bear the full brunt of that provision.  Also we saw fit to change that stipulation about rural doctors as proposed by Fine Gael.  We are satisfied that the level of funding available to the health services will enable a comprehensive and adequate health service to be maintained throughout the various regions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Custom House Docks site, it is strange that the Deputy would seek to hinder development within the constitutency and talk of it as being &ldquo;behind high walls&rdquo; and not &ldquo;fit&rdquo; for that constituency.  I would have thought that any development in one's constituency would be welcome, particularly when the spin-off and consequential activities are considered and which one would hope would lead to increased development in that area.  I am sure the Minister will bear in mind the matter of the perimeter around the Custom House Docks site and the restrictions on finances at present and that he will speak on those matter when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>According to the Deputy, St. Augustine said, &ldquo;Lord, make me good but not <Col N="1034" /> yet.&rdquo;  What he said was &ldquo;chaste&rdquo;, not &ldquo;good&rdquo;.  That saying illustrates the programme outlined by the PDs in the recent general election.  I cavilled at the previous speaker for the time he took, therefore I must be brief.  I am sorry to end on a cranky note, but the PDs told us that in one swoop they could cut public expenditure to an alarming extent.  I noticed that they would have no primary school building at all in 1987.  They would cut expenditure on that to £6 million.  They would practically savage all public expenditure and at the same time would be able to give tax equity immediately.</P>

      <P>That was their programme. It was uncosted and, therefore, ludicrous and false.  Now they are saying they cannot adopt the present budget proposals and that they will oppose the Finance Bill because it does not carry tax equity immediately and contemporaneously. They are hoisting themselves on to the platform on which they hoisted themselves during the election campaign and trying to appear to be the only party who propose tax equity.  We had a threefold approach.  Our greatest priority was and is to get public expenditure under control.  Secondly, allied to that were the developmental projects which we have initiated and will continue to pursue.  Thirdly, the Minister for Finance and the Government are committed to a restoration of tax equity within the system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring, it is not desirable for any holder of the Chair to predict what is going to happen, but ordinarily, having called Deputy Dukes I would then call a speaker from the Government side after whom, if time allowed, it would be my pleasure to call you.  However, many factors will govern that.  Deputy Dukes is in order now and if he were so disposed he could consume all the time remaining.  Having put it to him in that way, I imagine that he will not do so.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you may be rather modest about your ability to predict things but you are not a bad man for suggesting things.  I assure you that it will be up to the next speaker to ensure there is room for Deputy Spring before the Minister for Finance replies at 6.40 p.m.</P>
      <P>There are a number of defects in this Finance Bill.  My colleague and our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>&mdash; not the other Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Defence &mdash; outlined a number of these in his speech on the matter in this House on 3 June so I do not intend to dwell in any great detail on them.  The defects in this Bill can largely be remedied, deserve to be remedied and need to be remedied, and that is the approach we will be taking.  They need to be remedied because a number of the measures in this Bill are downright mischievous in the effects they will have on the economy, or else are misconceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider question for the need for the Bill, whatever our views on the overall thrust of budgetary policy or detailed measures, we need certainty and clarity in the public financial environment for this year.  The main areas in which this Bill is defective have been outlined <Col N="1036" /> by my colleague.  There is first the proposal to reduce mortgage interest relief, to restrict it to 90 per cent of the qualifying interest.  That proposal is designed to yield £10 million in 1987.  No doubt the arithmetic is correct and the measure now being implemented will yield £10 million in 1987.  Even if we accept that as part of the overall package that reduction in tax expenditure of £10 million is required, the measure before us is the wrong way of going about it.  It is a simple, proportionate reduction in the tax relief right across the board.  It is inevitable that that will hit some people harder than others.  For those on lower incomes, even though they may have lower mortgages, the effect of that will in real terms be more severe than the effect on those with higher incomes.  There is an infinite variation of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Take the typical case of a person whose income is just about high enough to justify buying a house at the lower end of the price range today.  Depending on which part of the country one is in, the range is £25,000 to £30,000 and mortgages in those cases of anything from £18,000 to £20,000.  The effect of a 10 per cent reduction in the amount of mortgage interest allowable as tax relief obviously will be more severe on that person than on a person with a much higher income, even one whose total mortgage represents the same proportion of his income as applies to a person at the lower end of the scale.  If the Government wished to reduce tax expenditures in this way, if they wished to save £10 million by a measure related to mortgage interest relief, I would have thought at the very least, there should be some relation of the impact and that there should not be a greater real burden on those with lower incomes than on those with higher incomes.  Of course this measure has all the hallmarks of having been introduced without a great deal of thought.  I would even think that, had the Government given the matter somewhat more thought, they might have changed the balance of the measure before us.  Of course that can be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> Then we have the effect &mdash; and the matter is taken up again in the provisions of the Bill before us &mdash; of the abolition of farm tax which, according to the Principal Features of the Budget, as circulated on budget day, will cost a net £9 million in 1987.  I do not agree with the abolition of the farm tax; nor have I seen any sign that the system the Government are putting in its place is being pursued with anything like the diligence or attention required even to bring about its stated objective by the Government.  Then the Government find, somewhat to their surprise, that the abolition of the farm tax will reduce their revenue yields by £9 million this year and they cast about for a way of recouping that revenue.  In what must be one of the most unimaginative answers to this problem that could have been conceived the Government decide to reduce the flat rate addition to farm prices.  That is the kind of measure that will be taken by a Government unthinkingly, a Government who see nothing more than a change in the revenue yields.  It represents a notable interference in the overall value-added tax system.  I readily concede that the flat rate reimbursement system we have is one which was designed specifically for the farming sector.  We are not the only country in the EC to have such a system.</P>
    <P>The measure the Government are taking in this Bill represents the first occasion on which there has been a departure from the fundamental principle of value-added tax, which means ultimately that it is a tax on consumption and not on production.  Because this Government have run away from the principle of the farm tax, because they have found that their retreat from that system costs revenue, they have decided to interfere in a fundamental way with the principles of the value-added tax system.  We now have a value-added tax system which, in one part, is actually a tax on production. That is very unwise and, viewed in some lights, it could be seen as sinister or threatening.  Once the principle is breached I am not at all sure that there will not be pressure on this Government, at some stage in the future, to do the <Col N="1038" /> same in some other sector.</P>
    <P>It is a most unwise departure from the principle.  It is unnecessary in that the Government did not have to abolish the farm tax in the first place and, even had they decided to abolish the farm tax, it is my belief that a different way should have been found of recouping that loss of revenue.  It is very worrying to see a major interference of this kind with the fundamental principle of the value-added tax system.  This is not a satisfactory way of resolving that problem; it is not a satisfactory way of going about the overall business of collecting taxation from the farming community and the interference with the principle of what is basically a tax on consumption is most unwise.</P>
    <P>We then have the proposed withholding tax dealt with in sections 12 to 20 of the Bill before us.  This tax will go down in history as one of the most confused attempts on the part of any Government to bring about a change in the taxation status of any group of people.  First, it does not even amount to that.  This does not represent a way of bringing people into the tax net who would not otherwise be in the net.  Let us look at the categories of persons concerned.  First, there are people who are conducting a substantial body of business with the State.  The tax applies only to fees paid by certain State agencies to professional people providing services in various sectors.  It deals only with people who are dealing with the State.  It deals with professionals only to the extent that they deal with the State. That is not a specific category of persons. It is not a specific category of taxpayer, nor is it a specific category of people who, it could be argued, are not now in the tax system.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people who provide services of these various kinds to the State will be in the tax system already. Certainly the great majority of them are in the value-added tax system because they are subject to value-added tax on the provision of their services.  Again, by far the great majority of these professional persons who supply services, if they employ anybody, already have them registered as employees for the perfectly <Col N="1039" /> straightforward reason that they are registered for value-added tax in order to be able to reclaim it.  It is in their interests to do so.  They have their employees registered because they are in the public demesne and there is a check on them; put it no higher than that.</P>
    <P>This is not a scheme which can be presented as one designed to bring into the tax net people who may not now be in that net.  To the extent that it affects groups of people providing professional services it affects them only to the extent of their dealings with the State.  Of course the circumstances vary very substantially from one group to another.  Some of the groups defined here do most of their business with the State.  Some of them do a substantial amount of business with the State, some a relatively small proportion only with the State.  The effect of this proposed tax on various groups of professionals will differ depending on the extent to which they do business with the State.  It will vary from one person to another, from one firm to another, even in the same line of business, depending on the proportion of their total work covered by their dealings with the State.</P>
    <P>It cannot be argued that this proposed tax is designed to bring about a specific effect in relation to these professions. The effect is differential, in many cases is random and would vary even from year to year in many of the professional practices concerned here.  It is a tax which takes no account whatever either of the rest of the tax status of the firm in question, of the total taxable content of the work being conducted by the firm in question or, indeed, of their total tax liability.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks my colleague Deputy Noonan and I have met a great many people involved in the professions concerned with this tax.  I can assure the House that the variety of circumstances is huge.  There are cases where almost all of the services provided by the firms in question really take the form of labour. There are cases where there is a substantial material content in the services provided and in the base of the charges that are levied.  There are cases in which <Col N="1040" /> some firms, professions or individuals do 80 per cent of all of their work for the State.  There are others where the proportion may be as low as 20 per cent or even 10 per cent.  What is common to them all is that a simple withholding tax of the kind proposed has a very much bigger effect on the income, that is the net income left after paying all costs, than any 35 per cent income tax rate or than any 50 per cent income tax rate in the case of incorporated taxpayers.</P>
    <P>On budget night it was argued that this was a way of bringing people involved in these professions onto a current basis of assessment.  That is a most extraordinary claim and it smacks of what one of my lecturers on statistics once called a retrospective rationalisation of something that had previously been intuitively perceived. That is no way to run a railroad. It is certainly no way to design a tax.  To argue that this is a way of bringing people onto a current basis of assessment is absolute nonsense when you find that the situations differ so much from one firm to another and from one individual to another in the same profession.  It cannot be argued that this represents a single movement of any kind.  If the attempt to bring people in these professions onto a current basis of assessment involves paying in one year's not just two years' tax but in some cases a multiple of an extra year's tax on top of the taxation normally due in the current year, it seems it is a very badly thought out measure and one which certainly needs a great deal more thinking about before it can be enacted into legislation.</P>
    <P>Any move to bring professionals or groups onto a current year basis of assessment will, in its first year, involve the payment of more than one year's tax.  If the Government feel it is desirable to move to that situation, it seems to me that what they should do is come into this House with a proposal for a tax system that is designed to do that.  The way not to do it is the way proposed here which is to bring in a measure, inconceived, badly thought out, which has hugely differential effects and which may not at the end of the day produce the revenue it is <Col N="1041" /> designed to produce.  We will oppose that.  I hope the Government and the Minister for Finance, having listened ever since budget day to the various representations and statements which have been made about the effects of this tax on different professions, will feel moved to propose some amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister for Finance was recently quoted as having said he sees no reason for any amendment.  I cannot honestly say that can be interpreted as anything other than simple macho politics.</P>
    <P>As I said, if it is the Government's intention that we should have a system that would bring these professions onto a current year basis of assessment, this is not the way to do so.  I cannot in any case see why the Government should decide that only these professions should be treated in that way.  Why pick these ones and not others?  Why pick, in particular, professions that simply happen to do some proportion, substantial in some cases, of their business with the Government? Why pick only the proportion of their business that they do with the Government to have this current year basis of assessment?  That is an argument that just will not wash because there was never any foundation for it in the first place.  That is an argument which the Taoiseach took up on budget night on a purely opportunistic basis.  There is no sustainable case for saying that this measure is designed to bring about a current year basis of assessment in these professions.</P>
    <P>Another area of taxation where this Bill produces some rather startling changes is in relation to the treatment of profits made by banks on lending of money for house purchase.  As I said, my colleague, Deputy Noonan, dealt with this matter at some length and made the point that the inevitable effect of this measure would be to increase the cost of borrowing money from a bank for house purchase.  There may be many reasons the Government would feel they should take such a step.  Some of them probably have more to do with the rather muted competition that there is in that market <Col N="1042" /> at the moment.  Some of them may have to do with a philosophical view as to how much of that market should be reserved to building societies.  If that is the case, let the Government say that.  Let them make their argument on that basis, but let them not try to conceal what they are doing by claiming this is a measure that is justified in relation to some overall concept of corporation tax or the taxation of financial institutions, because it cannot be justified on that basis.  It certainly cannot be justified in terms of the effect it has on borrowers.</P>
    <P>Looking through the tax measures in this Bill I can find no trace of any real concern on the Government's part with measures to improve the efficiency of the collection of taxes.  In the Principal Features of the Budget circulated by the Minister for Finance on budget day the new tax measures relate to mortgage interest relief, a measure on the place of abode rule for Irish people working abroad, the new 35 per cent tax, the abolition of the farm tax and the consequent unwise change in the system of value-added tax refunds for farmers. There is nothing that improves the administration of taxation other than the institution of the task force, 25 civil servants who were previously involved in, I think, the Department of the Public Service who are now to be drafted into the Revenue Commissioners in order to improve the collection of taxes.  To suggest, as the Government do, that this measure will bring in £10 million of extra taxation is simply not credible.  There has been no evidence of it so far.  As far as I am aware, the Minister for Finance has not so far said what these people are doing or what the effect is of what they might be doing. Nor has he given us anything more than an aspiration that they will collect an extra £10 million.</P>
    <P>The lack of any real measure to improve the efficiency of tax collection is perfectly in keeping with the view adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 when, in Opposition, they vigorously opposed every single measure that was brought in by the Government and by the Minister for Finance <Col N="1043" /> at that time &mdash; it was myself for most of that time &mdash; to improve the efficiency of tax collection.  It is very clear that they are bringing the same lack of commitment to efficiency in the system into the Finance Bill that is now before us. On that at least they have been consistent and I am sad to say they are consistent only in their lack of ideas in this regard.</P>
    <P>We need to have this Finance Bill put in place with the kinds of modifications which Deputy Noonan and I have indicated are necessary.  We need it all the more because I suspect the Government will be off target in relation to the balance between expenditure and revenue.  Even on the measures set out in this Finance Bill, numbers of them will not realise the revenue or the tax expenditure savings that they set out to achieve.  I suspect that in a number of areas the Government's expenditure figures will not hold and that, at the half way stage of the year, they will find themselves off target.  It appears also on the basis of the Taoiseach's now famous, or perhaps infamous, letter to Ministers recently leaked, that the Taoiseach believes that will be the case because he is looking for further expenditure cuts for the remainder of this year. It appears that the Government will be off target.  To the extent that the measures in this Finance Bill can help to stop the rot, then I believe we need it.  It is important that we have these measures enacted with the modifications I mentioned in order to prevent, as far as we can, even further pressures being put on some of the expenditure areas where there has been the most difficulty in the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of the health area.  That has been the subject of debate on other occasions but it is abundantly clear that the Government have done that job backwards.  The Minister for Health said today at Question Time that he expects to have the reports from his teams of civil servants who are investigating the action proposed to be taken by the health boards in July.  The Minister for Health, on his own admission, is telling us that he expects to be in a position <Col N="1044" /> some time next month to come forward with his considered views on how the measures proposed to be taken by the health boards and by individual hospitals can be put together in a rationalised way. At that stage more than half of the year will have passed and more than half of the originally intended expenditure for the year will have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister for Health will have either the room or the ability to have a more rationalised approach to the health services at that time of the year but all the better if revenue raising and the confirmation of what is set out in this Finance Bill can help to avoid more of the hamfisted approach which the Minister and the Government have adopted to the health services.  That is another reason for clarifying and solidifying to the maximum extent the position of the public Exchequer for this year. Without this, there will be even greater difficulty and greater pressure on areas where the Government have already done damage not only through the policies they have adopted but also by the way they have gone about administering the financial allocations they have made, particularly in the health services.</P>
    <P>Therefore we need this Bill enacted with the kind of amendments I have set out.  There are two other amendments being proposed, but one in particular causes me some amazement.  This amendment is down in the name of Deputy McDowell.  It is a most extraordinary amendment particularly when it is read in the context of comments made by the same Deputy in this House on 31 March last.  I propose to quote some of his comments at column 830, Volume 371, of the Official Report.  Deputy McDowell chose to chide, to use a polite word, my colleague Deputy Michael Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>, for his approach to the budget, and said:</P>
    <P>I find it remarkable that somebody could be so abusive and so scornful when on the Fianna Fáil benches we now see a change of heart of a very substantial kind which has been made in the interests of the country at large. <Col N="1045" /> Everyone should have the generosity to accept it.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>...when people choose to do the right thing, albeit at the eleventh hour, they deserve support for it and not derision.</P>
    <P>There is more.  At column 831 he said:</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats were founded as a new and separate political party in order to make the Irish political process not more divisive but more decisive.</P>
    <P>That kind of statement would have them rolling in the aisles in the L &amp; H but it was not particularly appropriate for this House.  He wanted to make the whole political process not more divisive but more decisive.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We will not make the best the enemy of the good in this debate.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>Because we believe that these measures are insufficient we will criticise them but, to the extent that they are necessary, they will receive our support.</P>
    <P>There was much more but that is enough to give a flavour of what Deputy McDowell was then saying.  That Deputy and that party who want our debates to be decisive rather than divisive produced this amendment that declines to give the Finance Bill a Second Reading, that attempts to ensure that the financial position of the State cannot be decided this year, that we cannot get to the Committee Stage of this debate so that we can alter the detail of the Bill in a way that makes it at least efficient in doing what it sets out to do without being excessively oppressive on the people concerned.  The party who want to be decisive decide that they do not want to debate the Committee Stage of this Bill.  There is another case of that party saying one thing and doing another. This afternoon that party seemed to take the view that political debate consists only of their saying what they wish and <Col N="1046" /> then leaving the House and not engaging in a debate with anybody else once they have had their say.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to follow that procedure because I believe it is pointless.  I regard it as being the purest opportunism and a stance that is taken purely for the optics. That is not the way to go about debating the financial business of the country and it is certainly not the way to go about debating the detailed implementation of the Government's proposals in relation to taxation and other financial matters for this year.  Because we need clarity in these matters to the maximum possible extent, because we want to avoid further pressures that might arise in relation to other areas of expenditure, because we need to ensure that some of the more unwise proposals of the Government in relation to taxation are not proceeded with without modification, and because we want to ensure that those parts of the Government's proposals which are excessively oppressive on some sectors are not proceeded with, we want to get to the Committee Stage debate and make the necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>For that reason I do not intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill but we will be putting forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage to take out of the Bill some of the unnecessary and unjustified effects which it will have on a number of categories of taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to accommodate other Members as I would like to be accommodated.  I have done my best.  I welcome the strategy that lies behind the budget which is to ensure that a firm hand is kept on the economy and that action is taken to ensure a drop in interest rates.  I am pleased to note that interest rates have dropped and I expect them to continue to do so for the remainder of the year, all things remaining equal on the international scene.  Certainly, the Government have not done anything to cause interest rates to rise and that should be recognised as an indication that Fianna <Col N="1048" /> Fáil policies are working.  It is necessary that there should be firmness and moderation in Government spending but that is not sufficient in relation to the budgetary strategy of the Government who aim to get growth once again.  We are hopeful that as a result of Government policies greater wealth will be created to fund existing services and a reduction in the overall levels of taxation.  We all agree that taxation is at a punitive level and cannot be justified on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Government being allowed to proceed on their course without any mouthing or preaching about the necessity to reduce Government expenditure or introduce cuts.  The Government are proceeding in a business-like fashion.  They are implementing promises that were made as far back as 1982 by the Coalition Government. However, that Government were not in a position to deliver on those policies because the parties were committed to a marriage that was doomed from the start. They were committed to a marriage of conflicting ideologies and, despite the best intentions of both parties to hold on to power for power's sake, were not in a position to cater for the budgetary needs of the country from 1982 until they fell earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to have to reflect on those facts because I must confess that had I been a Member in 1982 I would have wished the Coalition every success in tackling the problems that faced the country.  Had they pursued their policies in 1982 without engaging in a two-horse tug-o-war we would not be faced with taking firm decisions in regard to cutbacks, including cutbacks in the sensitive area of health. Nobody likes implementing cutbacks but they are necessary and I support the Government's moves on them.  I will not flinch from continuing to support them. I commend the Government for having the courage to move forward and I assure them of my support.  I have no doubt that they will proceed with their policies in a unified way, unlike the last Government. Their management structure is not torn by a duplicity of personalities or a divergence <Col N="1049" /> of ideology.  It is that aspect of Fianna Fáil that leaves them apart from anything that went before.  It leaves them apart from any proposals made by Fine Gael when they were on their own in Government.</P>

      <P>We went into the last election without promising anything except firm Government.  It is sad to hear allegations of U-turns, lack of integrity and so on when one turns on the monitor in one's room in the House.  In my view the Government are the finest the country has ever seen and they will be decisive, <Col N="1050" /> something that was lacking in the past four years.</P>
      <P>I am glad that tourism has proved that it is a get up and go industry, that it is capable of expansion and dynamism. Above all it has shown that it is capable of responding to the leadership shown by the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, who encouraged those involved to produce holiday packages. The approach by the Minister in relation to the tourist industry shows how Government and private enterprise can move forward together if the necessary leadership is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before in the House, the agricultural industry is vital to the future of the country but interest rates must come down.  That is the first and fundamental prong of the Government's agricultural policy.  In my own constituency many farmers are crippled by capital commitments and interest rates and the more they come down the better farming will be.  In this context EC negotiations will be difficult.  We are well past the honeymoon period of 1973-78 when, automatically, Ministers for Agriculture could expect a transitional increase of 20 per cent, a reduction in tariffs and monetary compensatory in relation to the devaluation of the Green £.  There were normal annual increases in prices and the Minister could come back to this country and announce gleefully that the farmers had done well again.  That has all gone and the onset of surpluses has created difficulties in relation to price fixing.  The trend in many sectoral areas of agriculture is for prices to be reduced or limited by quota restriction such as the super-levy for milk.  Notwithstanding that, I commend the Government for their strategy in expanding agricultural production and leading the way in relation to a market expansion.  For too long we depended on the begging bowl in Brussels and now when the pressure is on us it is heartening to see the Government, private enterprise in agriculture and other bodies responding to provide the dynamism necessary to ensure that our agricultural products will be sold directly in supermarkets in Britain and <Col N="1051" /> across mainland Europe to avoid the difficulties as a result of institutional arrangements for intervention &mdash; and its lack &mdash; in the EC.  I am very heartened by these developments and I wish Minister O'Kennedy well in his continuing negotiations in Brussels.  I commend him for the forthright way he has approached his portfolio.</P>
    <P>I should also like to praise the Irish Farmers' Association for their document published earlier this year and in which they made a submission as to how agriculture might go forward.  While one cannot agree with everything in the document, nevertheless one must praise the association for their realism and clarity of thought.</P>
    <P>In relation to industrial development, it is very heartening to see the climate created in the economy through the budgetary strategy, declining interest rates and the commitment of the Government to special projects such as the Dublin Port and Docks and others.  It is indicative of the commitment of the Government to growth in that area. Although I come from a farming constituency, increasingly one looks to the large industrial concerns &mdash; very often financed by international capital &mdash; to provide worthwhile employment.  One hopes that small industries in rural and urban areas will respond to the positive climate created by the Government in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Finance Bill increases the income allowance for taxation purposes arising from the agricultural leases from £2,000 to £2,800.  This is an increase on an allowance given by the Minister for Finance of the previous Government and while that allowance was welcome as indicative of the support which that Government gave to farm leasing, when it was introduced it represented a flag waving exercise in relation to their commitment to farm leasing and the introduction of a new system of tenure to allow for an early start scheme in farming by young people and for the flexibility and mobility of the land resource in this country.  It was proceeding on the basis <Col N="1052" /> of the total winding down of the Land Commission and the bankruptcy of thought of the previous Government in relation to the allocation of land resources and in ensuring that there was a stable agricultural economy and society in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I have often said, outside the House, that the response of the previous Government in relation to getting the leasing system off the ground was not adequate in so far as it did not represent a full, inter-departmental response to the difficulties presented by leasing.  Any reasonably competent legal adviser would not have advised an ordinary, elderly farmer to enter into a leasing arrangement because of the difficulties of capital taxation and those which have arisen in relation to transferring the super-levy milk quota.  Very often one finds that persons have taken land on a long lease under the master lease and have ended up losing their super-levy milk quota through being ejected from land taken in such a manner.  That sort of injustice can put people off leasing land.  As time progresses I hope the Government will examine the difficulties of the technical objections I have raised. I also raised these objections at meetings where the former Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, was present.  I have no personal criticism of him and I thank him for the courtesy and enthusiasm he displayed when he went around the country trying to promote the idea of the long lease.  I hope that farm leasing will be a vehicle whereby young farmers can get a foothold in the agricultural scene.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the farm tax has been abolished because it was inequitable and totally devoid of any basic principle.  As Deputy Dukes said, it could be faulted because it was a tax on production.  It was not based on an ability to pay, it was based on slick collection methods, nothing else.  Some people said that various aspects of the tax were to be commended but they were always very reserved regarding the prospect of the tax being extended as, no doubt, it would have been.  Many Members still in the <Col N="1053" /> House, especially in the Labour Party, voiced their opinion that the charge per acre and the net should be extended but that would have meant that ordinary family farmers would be crucified in a financial sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider the efficiency of taxation in the farming sector.  It has been met by the reintroduction of the farm profile system of accounts.  If that system were implemented it would be a very efficient method of the collection of accounts.  The problem is how it is to be implemented. I was very concerned that there were staffing difficulties in the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the preparation and examination of farm profile accounts and that at the end of the year the farm profile system may be found not to be working efficiently.  Every effort should be made at an administrative level to ensure that the system does work as it allows farmers to sidetrack very costly accounting costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If farmers had a commitment to the section of the farm tax it was on the basis that it would help them to avoid paying accountancy costs.  Small farmers who may or may not have some taxable income wish to avoid the necessity and burden of paying £200, £300 or £400 to a firm of accountants to prepare a set of accounts which would show a negligible liability to tax.  Some of those farmers regretted the abolition of the farm tax but I am glad to note that this matter was fully dealt with in the budget through the introduction of the farm profile system.  I <Col N="1054" /> suggest that the Minister keep a very close eye on how the administrative arrangements are made.  While a very admirable system of simplified accounts was introduced in 1978-79 it was not possible for the system to work satisfactorily without ultimately resorting to an accountant who promptly did the job with the agreement of the Revenue Commissioners and who in the process charged the farmer very substantial fees. This is a live issue and as a Deputy representing a farming constituency, one I would like to think I would pursue in a active way with due respect to the very important interests of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The local authorities would be very glad to have the responsibility for collecting income tax from farmers and I am sure that through their very efficient revenue collection system they would be in a position to ensure that farmers would pay their fair share of tax while at the same time ensuring that they would not be considered criminals by way of allegations that they were failling behind. Farmers have always paid their rates in the past and have always paid whatever was due but, regrettably, there is a tendency in this House to defame and talk in criminal terms of the farming community in regard to their tax paying record.  Part of the reason there are substantial farm tax arrears is that successive Governments and the Revenue Commissioners have never looked at the way in which certain commercial bodies and local authorities collect the revenue.  They do so by appointing revenue collectors who operate in a humane way.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the Revenue Commissioners would collect in a humane way revenue which is due from the farming community and that, if necessary, persons would be appointed not only to collect revenue but to help farmers with their farm profiles.  Revenue should not be collected in an inhumane way and through a depersonalised correspondence system as that only results in resentment and a lack of co-operation. The farming community are ready to co-operate <Col N="1055" /> and I have never met a farmer who resolutely refused to pay his tax. There are cultural and psychological difficulties in trying to get elderly farmers to prepare accounts and to pay their taxes. I am very concerned that the farming community will become the victims of the special sheriffs who were appointed by the Coalition Government, freelance executioners, as it were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are now setting out without fear or favour, without flexibility and in some cases without any personal introduction to take whatever is owed on foot of a warrant which might be based on a purely notional assessment. I would like to think that the worst aspects of this system would be avoided as the farming community are anxious to contribute their fair share of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 12 to 20 relate to the deduction of tax at source.  I am conscious of the many criticisms which have been made but I am satisifed that in the collection of that tax no substantial injustices will take place but there may be cases in which some hardship will be imposed on the professional people concerned. I would like to think that the Revenue Commissioners would read closely the provisions in the Bill in relation to hardship so as to ensure that their traditional inflexible approach which has been backed by the courts will not be applied and that no personal hardship will arise under the system.  I hope that Ministers who employ professional services will make every effort to speed up payment to the personnel involved. For far too long Government Departments and local authorities have played the cash-flow game to the detriment of those who work for them.  It would not be very pleasant if employees were told that they were not going to receive their wages for six to 12 months.  Very often professional people who are employed by State bodies are left high and dry in respect of their payments for considerable amounts of time.  Any hardship <Col N="1056" /> which might result from the deduction at source system might be substantially alleviated, if not eliminated, through prompt payment by the Government having regard to the need to vouch the work that was done and to observe any formalities.  There are far too many delays in the matter of these payments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of trading houses and I hope the Ministers concerned can proceed on the basis that no difficulties will arise with the EC.  I am satisfied that the terms under which licences may be given will not attract any undue attention from the bureaucrats in Brussels.  The establishment of trading houses underlines the commitment of the Government to securing growth in every sector of the economy.  If one looks across the different sectors of the economy one sees that there are many incentives in place to encourage production to take place, particularly in manufacturing. Many tax incentives and grants are available and there are institutional provisions in place ranging from the various services provided by the county development teams to the services provided by semi-State bodies such as the IDA and CTT.</P>
    <P>If there is a weakness in relation to industrial expansion, it has been in the area of marketing.  Very many commentators have highlighted this in the past, but unfortunately Governments, and in particular the last Government, have not been alive to the possibilities of making progress through rectifying that deficiency.  I am very glad that this Government have brought in the provision in this Finance Bill, which is very developmental in its nature, to rectify this great lack in the area of industrial development.  I am satisfied that when these trading houses get going they will provide a dynamic in the marketing area that this country has never experienced. I hope that from that the potential for growth which is so great here will be realised.</P>
    <P>In the context of the general budgetary strategy and of the Finance Bill, I welcome the commitment of the Minister for the Environment in relation to local government reform.  He has already <Col N="1057" /> unveiled his intentions to this House.  It is high time that there was local government reform, not merely legislative reform but in the area of the provision of real resources for local authorities to operate with.</P>

      <P>In relation to the general taxation proposals, a very large part of the Government budget which goes to funding local authorities from the Central Exchequer over the last few years is constantly diminishing.  If this Finance Bill has a deficiency, it might be perhaps that the provisions are not there for the reform of local government in relation to the financial aspect.  I would hope that at some stage the Finance Bill, or a Bill in relation to the financing of the Exchequer, whether it be called a local Government Bill or not, would come forward as a result of the decision of the Minister for the Environment to reform local government.  It is in the area of financing that I would have a particular interest because there is need to ensure a financing of local government services and, in particular, of the county and rural roads right around the country and in my constituency.</P>

      <P>In relation to the further aspects of the Bill, I welcome the general context in which the Bill proceeds to raise and allocate funds in the context of the national lottery.  The various critics have said that that lottery is part of the taxation <Col N="1058" /> system; I reject that proposal.  It is certainly not part of this Finance Bill.  It is a voluntary code.  This arises in relation to the discussion on this Bill having regard to the fact that the Bill is one relating to taxation.  The introduction of the lottery will give rise to the funding of many areas of national life in the sporting, agricultural and educational areas, which were hitherto devoid of funds.  I should like to think that the funds brought in by the national lottery will be divided out equally across the country in relation to specific projects I have in mind.

      <P>I should like to conclude, despite the unnecessary interruption by Deputy Mitchell in relation to the matter. <Col N="1059" /> With regard to the general budgetary strategy which underlines this Finance Bill I regret very much that the health services have had to be dealt with in the fairly stern manner in which they were by the Minister for Health.  However, I am very glad to note that in the context of the cutbacks in the health services the hospitals &mdash; and in particular the three hospitals in my constituency of Mullingar &mdash; will continue to give a good service notwithstanding the unfortunate reduction in the staff involved.  I take this opportunity to voice my sympathy for those who were let go.  The indications are that the health board concerned will not proceed to penalise the temporary workers who were let go or leave them in a situation in which they will not be given priority for being taken on again.</P>
      <P>I should like to think that the provisions of this Bill will represent a taxation policy and a policy for growth which will enable the country to survive the threat of breakdown so that the basic provisions can be made in relation to the health services and to the construction and maintenance of roads and the very many services in the developmental field which are necessary in the area of marketing in industry.  The Finance Bill has been criticised by various Deputies as having a lack of developmental approach. This is absolute and total nonsense.  It is a travesty because, above all, the Bill contains an emphasis on development.  It has been criticised for lack of provision in relation to the efficiency of tax collection.</P>

      <P>Before I refer to any specific items in the Bill I should like to respond to criticism made of our budgetary and taxation policies.  Deputy Noonan was highly critical of what he described as the absence of economic philosophy.  I am not quite sure what he had in mind.  Our economic philosophy is straightforward.  We must revitalise the economy which has been on the decline. We must restore confidence and encourage investment.  To achieve this the management of the public finances must be improved and interest rates must come down.  We have wasted no time in demonstrating our determination to reverse the trends of recent years.  I am well aware of the difficulties and the pitfalls. It is not an easy brief to manage a very difficult budget situation properly and, at the same time, to promote development opportunities vigorously.  We are determined to get the balance right.</P>
      <P>The Deputy emphasised the importance of meeting budget targets.  He is quite right about this.  I fully agree with him.  In my opening speech last week I said we will take whatever steps may be required as the year goes on to adhere to these targets.  Right now the best information we have is that we are on course both on expenditure and taxation.  I assure Deputy Noonan, Deputy Dukes and others that that is the position and it will remain so.  I would like to remind Deputies that last year there was an overrun of £145 million in the current budget deficit and no corrective action was taken.</P>

      <P>We are on target this year and we will remain so.  I should like to remind Deputies opposite and, in particular, Deputy Noonan that last year when the overrun on the budget deficit was £145 million no corrective action whatsoever was taken.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke at some length on the issue of tax reform.  Deputy Noonan believes that high levels of taxation are crippling and regrets that the Finance Bill does not incorporate a major tax reform.  He did not tell us what shape this reform might take.  Deputy McDowell is so concerned that the Bill does not provide for reform that his party are proposing that the Bill should not get a second reading.  The word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is much abused in the taxation context and different interests have different priorities. I always understood that the Finance Bill was primarily concerned with budget decisions and not a vehicle for major new initiatives on taxation.  I agree entirely with Deputy Noonan that high rates of taxation are a problem and have a serious disincentive effect.  However, I would like to remind him of the increases that took place during the term of office of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that we intend to widen the tax base and reduce tax levels. We can do this only on a gradual basis. There is no opportunity for the grand slam, as Deputy McDowell would have us believe, unless we turn a blind eye to the realities of the budget.  The Deputy spoke eloquently about the need to alleviate the tax burden and to introduce radical reforms, but he made no effort to fit these arguments into the framework of the budget.  It is easy to preach eloquently about tax reform and reducing taxation if budget realities are ignored.  As I stated in my opening address, the Government <Col N="1064" /> have identified reform of the taxation system as a priority because it is an essential element in achieving the scale of economic progress we need.  However, I pointed out also the absolute link between the discretion available for changes in taxation and the level of expenditure and borrowing.</P>
    <P>For Deputy Noonan tax reform revolves around reducing selectively the higher tax rates or widening the bands and he asserted that I missed an opportunity by not doing so in the present Bill.  The Deputy referred to the present disincentive effect of present high interest rates and in doing so he is echoing what I said in my opening address, that too many people pay interest rates above the standard rates and that the average worker suffers under an unacceptably higher level of tax deduction.  The income tax regime of bands and allowances incorporated in this Bill are the same as that in the budget proposals of 20 January last.  The previous Government took the view, as do we, that in a choice between lower borrowing and lower taxation the present priority has to be to reduce borrowing. The alternative is income tax reductions paid for by borrowing resulting in higher interest rates and a continuation of the vicious circle out of which we are trying to break.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell castigated all recent Governments for their inaction in the field of tax reform, but he was short on specifics as regards his own proposals for reform.  The Deputy, however, indicated that he considers the thrust of the reports of the Commission on Taxation to be correct.  A major plank in the proposals of the Commission on Taxation is the expansion of the tax base.  Nobody should be under any illusion as to how the Commission on Taxation propose to expand the tax base.  They recommend the virtual abolition of secondary allowances such as mortgage subsidy relief, VHI relief and relief for life assurance premiums. Deputy McDowell did not indicate if he agreed with these recommendations but I mention them here as an illustration of the hard choices which have to be faced in any movement to expand the tax base.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The Deputy's party in their election manifesto had proposals for tax concessions. These were being financed in an unrealistic way by so-called reductions in capital spending and debt service costs. Deputy McDowell was also dismissive of our objective to place two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate of tax. The Deputy evidently considers that notwithstanding the existing resource constraints we should aim for a greater reduction but he puts forward no specific measures.  Presumably he has in mind income tax promises made by his party in the recent election.  This would involve a reduction of 2 per cent in each of the current tax rates.  The cost in 1987 would be £72 million.  When one considers this is conjunction with the Deputy's amendment that the Finance Bill be rejected, thereby denying the Exchequer the benefit of £25 million yield from the withholding tax and the £10 million yield from the reduction in mortgage interest relief, the Deputy appears to be advocating an increase of over £100 million in the level of the 1987 current budget deficit.  It is difficult to reconcile this stance with his continuous exhortation to us to keep within our targets and to keep borrowing down.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendments of the Progressive Democrats and the Workers' Party would mean that the development proposals in the Bill in relation to tourism, shipping, financing services and the food processing industry would not proceed. It would also mean that the special PRSI tax allowance would lapse thereby increasing the tax burden on the PAYE sector.  The PAYE taxpayers were mentioned by Deputy Mac Giolla who complained that they were expected to carry an unreasonably heavy proportion of the overall tax burden.  The position of PAYE taxpayers has been recognised through the introduction of the special allowance which is now £700.  I agree that it would seem that PAYE taxpayers pay a higher proportion of the tax burden than the self-employed.  The average self-employed person, however, is taxed on income on the same basis as everybody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> It may be that a proportion in the self-employed sector are not making full returns or are evading tax in some other way.  If so, they are guilty of an offence and improved administrative procedures will make it more difficult for them in future to escape.  The new withholding tax on professional fees affects, in particular, the self-employed sector; the majority of those liable for this tax are self-employed professionals.  The extension of the profile system will bring many farmers into the tax net for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of this Government that all taxpayers should pay tax on an equal basis.  If persons are evading tax, no matter what sector they are in, the priority must be to catch them and to expose them to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about higher taxes on wealth and property.  Is he advocating the return of rates under another name?  Unless there is a major property tax applicable to land and housing property in general, the tax yield from this source will inevitably be on a relatively small scale and cannot compensate for substantial income tax reductions.  This is a fact of life that we must acknowledge in any debate on tax reform.</P>
    <P>There are many things which I would like to have discussed, but I will just touch on a few other points in the few minutes left to me.  Deputies Desmond, Mac Giolla and others concentrated to a considerable degree in their contributions on deficiencies in the tax collection system.  As I indicated in my opening speech I accept that any reform package must incorporate measures to improve collection.  It is folly however to suggest that our problems of high taxation can be solved by simply collecting outstanding taxes.  Deputy Desmond must be aware that the existence of outstanding amounts of tax has not just occurred since this Government took office and that during his term of office there were similar large amounts of tax outstanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to a figure of £700 million in outstanding tax which he asserted was legally due.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the figures in the <Col N="1067" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the 1985 Appropriation Accounts which indicated that at end May 1986 the amount of collectible tax then outstanding was estimated by the Revenue Commissioners at £664 million. As my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, indicated in a statement he made on the general issue of tax collection and enforcement on 10 December last this figure of £664 million does not represent an amount actually due for collection on 31 May 1986.  In many instances tax liabilities were not even finalised on that date.  For example, in the case of corporation tax, money is included in this figure which was not actually due to be paid until a later date, and thus was not outstanding at all, in the sense of being due for immediate payment.  I would also like to stress that the estimate of tax ultimately likely to be collected is already built into estimates of tax yield according to the expected timing of payments.  This amount does not therefore represent a new increment which can be added to available tax revenue.  In summary, amounts of uncollected taxes do not in the words of one of my predecessors, Deputy Dukes, represent &ldquo;a crock of gold out there&rdquo; which can be harnessed to solve our budget problems.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up one specific point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla when he alleged that VAT outstanding for over three years was being written off.  As was made clear in a reply to parliamentary questions on 12 May last this is incorrect. There has been no writing-off of VAT arrears by the Revenue Commissioners except where the tax is formally remitted or deemed to be irrecoverable. Remission of tax may be made on compassionate grounds, while tax may be deemed irrecoverable in for example, situations of bankruptcy.  The amounts involved for 1985 represented less than 0.1 per cent of the actual VAT yield for that year.  Any case involving a loss of £100 or upwards where tax is remitted or passed as irrecoverable is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General who reports on them to the Public Accounts <Col N="1068" /> Committee of this House giving details of the number of cases under each tax head, the amount of tax involved and the grounds of remission or write-off.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the withholding tax and I do not have time to respond to it.  I have listened to the bleating and crying of some Deputies in relation to the introduction of this tax which is not new, which is not inequitable, which is not disruptive and which will not affect employment.  I could go on about it.  There was also a lot of talk about the question of the change in the tax on bank income from interest on home loans.  It amazes me, having listened to most of this debate, that many Deputies referred in much of the debate only to the withholding tax and to the change in the concession given to the associated banks <i>vis-à-vis</i> house mortgage. Those were the two items which occupied most Deputies' minds.  I have to search diligently through the reports of the debates on the Second Reading of this Finance Bill to count on one hand the number of times that anybody from the other side of the House mentioned unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible indictment of this House that in a debate such as this there was little or no mention of the 245,000 people who are unemployed and who have little prospect of jobs in the immediate future and they would have even further diminished prospects were it not for the withholding tax and the change in the tax on banks and the other taxation items mentioned in this Bill.  We will have much more time to discuss tax issues in greater detail on Committee Stage of this Bill next week.  I am sure we will co-operate as fully as we can in any amendments put forward.  I think Deputy Dukes described me as somebody involved in macho politics.  I call myself a mini-macho, definitely not a macho macho.  Any amendments that improve the efficiency of this legislation before the House without costing the Exchquer money will be considered seriously and favourably by me.</P>

      <P>I contributed at the end of this debate last week and I had the pleasure of complimenting the Government on the recent action they have taken in relation to Coolattin.  I have been asked by my party colleague, Deputy Geraldine Kennedy, and by other people to ask the Government to ensure that the action which they promised in relation to Tomnafinnogue woods will be carried out forcibly so that no further felling of trees will take place at that location.  At the close of the debate last week I said that we, the Progressive Democrats, support fully this Private Members' Bill as introduced by the Labour Party.  We will work as enthusiastically as we can to ensure that this Bill becomes law and that its <Col N="1072" /> provisions will be enforced as rigidly and as adequately as possible.</P>
      <P>I want to address myself to two main aspects of this Bill.  The first one is the provision made in section 2 to include under the existing planning law trees comprised in woodlands.  Under existing law such woodlands cannot be made the subject of tree preservation orders, nor can felling licences be refused without compensation being paid.  Therein has lain the source of our problem with Coolattin over the years.  The provisions relating to liability for compensation in relation to tree preservation orders are set out in sections 40 to 45(2) of the Planning Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>In summary, the present position is that the refusal of a consent to fell, or a consent to fell with conditions, can give rise to a claim for compensation.  The only exemption from this compensation clause applies to single trees or groups of trees that are not, and I am quoting from the Act, &ldquo;comprised in woodlands&rdquo;. Under existing law there is no real protection for trees laid out in a woodland setting, irrespective of the high amenity or ecological value of such woodlands unless local authorities are in a position to pay huge sums in compensation, an option clearly not feasible with the present constraints on local authorities and when most local authorities do not even have enough money to sweep the streets.  Surely this option is not wise at any time if, as a nation, we are to arrange our priorities correctly.</P>
      <P>The remedy seems to be contained in section 2, that is, to bring trees comprised in woodlands under the scope of the existing Act and make them subject to the same provisions as are already extended to single trees and trees arranged in some groups, that is, liable to tree preservation orders without liability for compensation. That requirement is sought under section 2 of this Bill and we fully support the request for that requirement.  That is the first part of the Bill to which I want to pledge my support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the next obstacle to be overcome is the question that may arise in relation to compensation.  The question <Col N="1073" /> of the prior rights of private property will inevitably arise.  Indeed, it has already arisen under the Government's response to this Bill and in the assertion that the Attorney General's opinion is that the Bill would not withstand a challenge on constitutional grounds.  I find this response quite alarming.  It represents, for me, the narrowest and the meanest possible interpretation of our Constitution and, in my view, does little justice to the framers of that document who had a vision of what constitutes the common good in a society with clearly defined values.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, quite right to acknowledge that Article 43 of the Constitution is quite specific on the issue of private ownership of property.  It gives the assurance that: &ldquo;The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the rights of private ownership...&rdquo; Even within the Constitution that requirement is not absolute.  Immediately the following clause states: &ldquo;The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.&rdquo;  More significantly and more relevant to the discussion this evening is the next subsection of that clause which states: &ldquo;The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;  This clause is the small print as far as this Bill is concerned.  This is the clause to which we should direct the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats see no conflict between what is being asked for in this Bill and what is clearly stated in that clause of the Constitution.  If the Government or the Attorney General feel that we are sailing close to the wind, let the onus be on the other party to bring a test case before our courts and let us have the courage to contest that case.  If we are serious about the preservation of our heritage for God's sake let us not do the cowardly thing and shelter behind the shield of our Constitution under the <Col N="1074" /> pretext that we cannot confront the issue that has arisen in Coolattin and that will inevitably arise in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Other countries, notably Sweden, have long since resolved the conflict between the right of private ownership and the prior claims of items of heritage importance. It is high time that we grasped the nettle.  If we want to see how it is done, we need look no further than Sweden where the issue was settled quite properly more than 300 years ago.  We are quite prepared to confront the Constitution on this issue.  We do not think, if the Constitution is read and examined properly, there is any real battle.</P>
    <P>For me the Bill takes on an urgent relevance because of the recent proposals to locate an extensive holiday complex on Fota Island in Cork harbour.  Fota is an island of outstanding natural beauty and is in very many ways unique in this island and acknowledged to be so in many reports prepared for Cork County Council by An Foras Forbartha and other equally authoritative bodies.  The arboretum at Fota, because of its climate and sheltered situation, is able to grow a range of rare materials, at least as wideranging as anywhere else in the world.  It is one of the oldest arboretums extant and many of its specimens are older and finer than those found in Kew Gardens.  It contains at least one plant which is the only example of its kind growing in Ireland and which is on the international endangered specimen list.  Many other species, notably the redwood, have reached record proportions.</P>
    <P>In this arboretum there is a museum of beautiful trees without parallel in any other part of the world.  This arboretum is located in a setting of native trees and exotic flora and fauna with rare and beautiful insect and bird life.  It provides an invaluable location for ecological study and research.  All of this is situated scarcely a stone's throw away from the University City of Cork.  Surely this is a very rich resource and not one to be overlooked.  Because of its nature it is a delicate living thing and needs great care and protection.  It is incumbent on all of <Col N="1075" /> us to ensure that it continues to get the level of care and protection that will ensure its existence.  Recently the island has become the subject of bitter controversy with proposals to locate an extensive holiday complex on the island.  The scale of this complex will be better understood when I explain that among other buildings it is proposed to put 335 holiday-type chalets on the island.</P>
    <P>The extent of this can be better understood when we consider the nature of the roadway and the excavation that must take place to service a building development of that size.  This development must be viewed with grave disquiet by anybody who has any respect for what is on the island already.  Many experts would argue if this development goes on all life on the island will be put at risk, will suffer and much of it will die.  If the shelter on the perimeter of the island, which is made up mainly of native trees, disappears it is argued that the future of the arboretum, the future of bird life, insect life, flora and fauna on the island will be put at risk and will die a slow death.  Surely that is a high price to pay for a development of any kind and certainly for a development that could easily take place on any other part of the coastline of County Cork within reach of the island.</P>
    <P>I see in this Bill a measure that could arrest the destruction of Fota Island and could give to the trees a measure of protection which would ensure their existence. That perhaps more than any other reason, though there are others, is why I support this Bill.  I plead with all the sides of the House to support this Bill to ensure that it gets a very speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas and that it becomes law.  I hope when it becomes law that its provisions are enforced consistently and rigidly.  We have a sad history where our woods are concerned.  We have talked a lot in recent years about Coolattin but our history of wood felling did not begin there.  In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when Walter Raleigh, and people of his time, had cut down large tracts of woodland, and had the wood therefrom sold for commercial <Col N="1076" /> gain, the people of Ireland mourned their woods very poignantly in a song that is well known to you, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash;&ldquo;Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad.  Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár&rdquo;. There have been many times since we got our independence when the same sentiments could have been put to music. Let us not continue to do to ourselves what we deplored others having done to us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say that if this Bill is adopted and becomes law a succeeding generation will not be singing that song but will instead be singing a celebration of our woods because what is left of our ancient and historic woods will be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in support of this Bill which is a Private Members' Bill presented in my name.  Perhaps I might explain to the House the background and the reasons for this Bill.  Even though this Bill refers to a debate which has been going on for some time in relation to the woods in County Wicklow I believe this is a long overdue debate on a far broader issue.  This is an issue which will continue to trouble us and will require clarification in relation to the exercise of rights over personal property, the extent and the necessity of delimiting those personal rights and balancing those rights as against the rights of the people as a whole.  That is a question which will continue into the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Constitution has been questioned and examined in detail for the past 20 years and many legal volumes are accumulating seeking to clarify exactly the various rights and the extent of those rights.  It is necessary that this clarification should continue because I do not believe, and certainly my party do not believe, that the interpretation of the Constitution and the attributing of weight to the various conflicting rights has been done in an evenhanded manner.  It has not been done in the spirit in which I believe the people who framed the Constitution in 1936 and 1937 had intended it to be exercised.  It is necessary to reform or <Col N="1077" /> overhaul our Constitution, now in its fiftieth year, to cope with the passage of time.  This will obviously be a central area to any reform of the Constitution which might take place.  I am not particularly optimistic, I have to admit, that this review of the Constitution will take place. I am concerned because the drift of Irish politics seems to indicate that about 90 per cent of our public representatives consider themselves to be of right wing thinking and that thinking would dominate in any new Constitution.  As somebody reminded me recently we might be better settling for what was a relatively broad Constitution, in fact, a very far-thinking Constitution which was framed in 1937.</P>
    <P>This Bill is doubly important, first, because of the immediate difficulties in relation to the Coolattin Woods in County Wicklow and second, regarding the overall question of constitutional rights and balance being achieved between those rights.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed, to say the least, at the reaction of the Government to this Bill.  Of course the Government may claim they are being consistent in their reaction to Private Members' Bills, because I was absolutely astounded at their refusal to accept the Private Members' Bill put forward by the Fine Gael Party some weeks ago in relation to the laws on adoption.  There was absolutely no foundation or logical basis for the Government's refusal to accept that Bill which was put forward in good faith. Likewise, I do not believe that the Government have good grounds for refusing this Bill here this evening.  I think that the idea of Private Members' Bills has not been properly developed in this House because there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the Government to take on board the ideas that come forward in such Bills.  In framing this Bill, I was very conscious of and allowed myself to be guided by reference to the difficulties that have arisen in interpreting our Constitution down through the years. With my experience and legal training and the experience of those people whose advice was made available to me, I feel I <Col N="1078" /> can put forward people of the same quality and calibre as those offering advice to the Government at present.  I do not think that the advice coming forward to the Government has in fact given the Government or the Minister for the Environment the armoury necessary to convince me and indeed many members of this House of any weaknesses in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support being offered by the Progressive Democratic Party.  While we do not see eye to eye on many matters, particularly economic matters, this shows we can support one another where it is of public concern.  I am disappointed at the attitude being adopted by the Fine Gael Party but I think they are still suffering from some confusion as to whether they are in or out of Government.  Perhaps in due course they will realise what is happening.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'Etre</i> of the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Trees and Woodlands) Bill, 1987, is to close the major loophole in the 1963 Planning Act and thus protect trees and woodlands which are of outstanding natural beauty and amenity value.  I do not think anyone in this House would question the importance of the areas involved and the necessity of preserving the Tomnafinnogue Wood at Coolattin.  There are four units there &mdash; the riverside walk, the open oak plantation, the oak forest and the oak forest infested with rhododendrons. Each area has merit in its own right, and some are the richest in the country so far as flora and fauna are concerned and are worth protecting.</P>
    <P>Despite economic difficulties I believe we have a responsibility in this area which, unfortunately, has been neglected in the past.  Local authorities are experiencing economic pressures &mdash; the Minister of State will be familiar with the activities of Bord na Móna in the midlands &mdash; and it is important that we achieve a balance.  Because of the total disregard for the proper development of our environment, the 1963 Act was introduced. That legislation was of major importance and laid down guidelines to proper planning.  In some areas it may <Col N="1079" /> have gone into too much detail and it might have been better if we had allowed more flexibility but overall, the 1963 Act was very necessary and long overdue. The 1963 Act was the first stab at solving this problem and providing guidelines for the future planning and development of the country.  The time is long overdue for an amendment to that Act.</P>
    <P>The principal provision of our planning code, which is directed towards the protection and preservation of trees, is section 45 of the 1963 Act.  Under that section planning authorities have the power to make tree preservation orders which will prevent the cutting down of trees unless the local authority give consent. However, where a local authority give consent to the cutting down of trees, a person who has suffered damage as a result can claim compensation.  Generally speaking, where trees comprising woodlands are concerned local authorities can only avoid paying compensation by allowing the cutting down of trees without conditions or by attaching conditions related to replanting.  Section 2 of the Bill before us will remove that loophole by excluding a right to compensation where a tree preservation order declares that trees comprising woodlands are a special amenity of recreational value, of special interest, of outstanding natural beauty or are part of or comprise any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest.</P>
    <P>There will be a right of appeal to the planning board in the Bill and the right to compensation, but only in certain circumstances which are set out in detail in the Bill.  Basically there will be no right to compensation if the planning board decide that trees or woodlands may not be extracted for reasons relating to the amenity value, special interest, natural beauty or age of the trees in question, or if it is in the best interest of the management of the environment that they be preserved.  I believe that in this section, I, with the legal advise available to me, have achieved the balance which has been missing in our legislation to date, the balance which I believe the vast majority <Col N="1080" /> of right thinking people would wish to see achieved in our laws and in the interpretation of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the majority of people would be satisfied with the present position because it is causing distress, inconvenience, a good deal of financial hardship and is putting a curb on the activities of our elected representatives, the executive arms of local authorities and the State by virtue of the fear of compensation at a time when most of our local authorities are under-funded and are in no position to countenance the threat of having to pay compensation in respect of a refusal to grant planning permission.</P>
    <P>Obviously one has to respect the rights of individuals, groups and companies &mdash; who, in my view, have been over-protected although, hopefully, that will be rectified when the Government introduce the company law legislation &mdash; but that respect has to be balanced with the rights of the common good.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties in giving expression to the rights of the common good, the same sort of difficulty experienced by the private citizen when he has to deal with the might of multinationals, large companies and corporations and when it comes to trying to vindicate one's personal rights.</P>
    <P>This is an area where I believe the State has to intervene and take a major lead. It is also one of the very unsatisfactory areas in terms of law where a private citizen cannot afford the high cost of legal action and is not able to sustain long and extended legal actions against multinational companies, co-operatives and corporations with large resources who can afford to trample on the rights of individuals.  The argument put forward by the Minister for the Environment was very weak.  He attempted, not very convincingly, to make a legal justification for the Government's attitude in rejecting the Bill.  I do not believe any adequate grounds were given in that defence of the opinion of the Attorney General and we will not have a satisfactory defence put forward by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the day that is in it I am glad to have any minutes in the House. The important considerations relate not just to Coolattin, which are of enormous importance.  Some months ago the Taoiseach, while he did not walk through the woods, had a regal flight over them and expressed interest and concern about them.  It was for that reason that I expected the Taoiseach to accept the Bill in the spirit in which it was intended.  He had expressed his concern for the preservation of the oak forest.  The sad feature about this whole episode is that we have already lost a great deal of the wood and it is of vital importance that all parties should come together to ensure that we save what is left.</P>
      <P>I obtained a copy of the planning permission granted by Wicklow County Council in relation to the selective felling and extraction of trees on 66.5 hectares at Tomnafinnogue, Ballykelly, Ballyraheen and Coolattin Park Townland, Shillelagh and I am at a loss to understand the basis on which that permission was granted. There are many conditions which I hope will be implemented in detail.  There are requirements of replanting of sections of the wood before any further extractions take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is my humble nature but I would gladly have preferred at least 15 minutes on the Finance Bill. The logic of giving 66.5 hectares in an application that was made for twice that amount leaves me wondering if negotiations had been taking place between the authorities in that area and the applicants. Obviously, the requirements of the planning laws are not such for the authority to have to specify the reasons for refusing a certain amount and giving a certain amount but it is unfortunate that <Col N="1082" /> any amount of extraction of these trees should be permitted.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is a standard section requiring the publication of consents or refusals. Section 4 requires a planning authority to give or refuse their consent to the cutting down, topping, lopping or extraction of trees and will be the subject of an appeal to the planning board by an interested person.  The board have full powers under that section to grant or refuse the application and to impose conditions such as the provision of open spaces, landscaping designed to improve the amenity of the lands or conditions requiring planting. We are fortunate to have a body such as An Bord Pleanála who can play a role in difficult and controversial planning matters such as are under examination this evening.  It is important that we have an independent body such as An Bord Pleanála who can exercise their decisions removed from either local or personal considerations that might otherwise be brought to bear on difficult planning decisions.</P>
      <P>Section 5 specifies in detail the right to compensation to any person whose interest in land, trees or woodlands is reduced by the decision of the planning board to refuse consent to cut down, top, lop or extract trees or by a decision to grant such consent subject to conditions but a right to such compensation is excluded where a decision for such refusal or such consent subject to conditions is given for one or more of the reasons set out in subsection (2).  Those conditions are balanced.  They are certainly of importance to community groups and groups which tended in the past to be minority groups &mdash; they are growing in numbers because of the importance of the preservation and protection of the environment.  Those reasons are justifiable.  They were not pulled out of the air.  A lot of consideration was given to matters which should be under scrutiny when it comes to making conditions on such controversial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section proposes that compensation shall not be payable where trees are of special amenity value or <Col N="1083" /> special interest, or are of outstanding natural beauty or importance which it is in the interests of the common good to conserve.  Given the importance of preserving natural beauty in amenity areas the latter is a reasonable provision that will be understood by all but the most selfish and cold-hearted individuals. Compensation will not be payable if the trees are part of or comprise any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest, if it is premature to cut down the trees having regard to the age and state of maturity of such trees or any adjoining trees or woodlands, if the trees, because of their type or age and the extent, state and condition of such trees constitute a unique or special feature of the natural environment or &mdash; this is an important aspect &mdash; if considering the extent of trees or woodlands already cut down it would be in the best interest of the proper management of the environment that the trees should not be cut down or interfered with.</P>
    <P>The conditions set out in section 5 are reasonable.  The vast majority of people, irrespective of their political ideologies or associations or their economic interests will respect them and want to see them respected in the development and control of our environment.  I should like to appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider the objections by his Department. The Government, who claim to be considerate and progressive although they are not showing much signs of that on the field, have time to reconsider their objections.  I do not consider them to be well-founded after giving them some consideration.  The Government should reconsider court decisions on private property and the whole question of compensation, being guided in particular by the many judgments of the late Mr. Justice Kenny which were of fundamental importance and showed a tremendous vision and respect for the rights of the common good in our society.  They set out to put some limits on the right to compensation which, before that, had no curtailment and because of the imbalance people were in a position to hold the rest <Col N="1084" /> of society to ransom.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in balancing the various rights and, unfortunately, powerful companies and private individuals can sometimes steamroll and trample on the rights of minority groups despite the fact that such groups have put time, effort and energy into saving and preserving natural amenities and the environment. On occasion they have preserved cultural aspects of society, most of the time at enormous personal expense.  However, when it comes to balancing environmental concerns with economic gain &mdash; which is under discussion at present &mdash; unfortunately commercial interests and powerful groups, private individuals, companies, co-operative movements or corporations always seem to win mainly because of access to resources and because they can afford to take on long legal actions.  Most important, they are able to do this because they are armed with the threat which they can hold over local authorities in relation to extracting compensation when such authorities refuse to grant planning permission.  It is a sad reflection on the development of society over the past 50 or 60 years.  On many occasions in various localities we have seen our environment spoiled and the absolute disregard for planning values, and long term development plans in the interest of the community because of a misinterpretation and an over-protection of rights of individuals to the loss and diminution of the rights of the common good.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government seem to be reacting negatively to this Bill but I am quite satisfied that this debate, which has attracted a lot of public interest, is the resurgence of giving expression to the demand by the vast majority of people that we redress his imbalance.  It was attempted heretofore by virtue of the Kenny Report which, unfortunately, was not brought to conclusion. I appeal to the Government to ensure that progress is made as quickly as possible and I assure them that the Labour Party will be fully supportive when they introduce proposals in the <Col N="1085" /> House to redress this imbalance.  Let us, once and for all, give the common good its rightful place and the protection it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Private Members' Bill on the preservation of trees and woodlands.  The Minister for the Environment has already explained to the House that the Government agree in principle with the objectives of this Bill but that fundamental constitutional problems are raised by a number of sections in the Bill.  The Minister also explained that the issue is more than simply a Planning Act amendment.  It will be necessary also to consider the Forestry Acts in order that the best possible conbination of legislative and administrative measures can be devised to achieve the objectives in question.</P>
      <P>The objects of the Bill are to amend the provisions of the Planning Acts in relation to the preservation of trees and woodlands by providing, first, that no compensation will be payable in respect of a refusal of consent to fell trees comprised in woodlands of special amenity value, special interest etc.; secondly, that planning authority decisions on applications for consent to fell trees be published; thirdly, that an appeal by any interested person will lie to An Bord Pleanála in relation to a decision by a planning authority on an application for consent to fell trees; and fourthly, that a refusal of consent to fell trees by An Bord Pleanála, or a decision by the board to grant felling consent subject to conditions, will not be compensatable if the trees are of special amenity value, special interest, outstanding natural beauty or importance, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have carefully examined the Bill in consultation with the Attorney General and, as the Minister has already pointed out, there are constitutional difficulties with some of its provisions.  In addition, the proposals concerning the right of appeal and the publication of notices are unnecessary in <Col N="1086" /> that provisions on these lines can be made to apply under existing law.</P>
    <P>It appears that the intent, meaning and effect of section 45 of the 1963 Planning Act may not be fully understood and I should like to explain it clearly to the House before reiterating the Government's position.  When a planning authority consider it expedient for amenity reasons to secure the preservation of trees, whether in pursuance of a specific objective of the development plan or otherwise, they may make a tree preservation order under section 45.  The amenity objective is the essential requirement. For example, a tree preservation order cannot be made in respect of trees solely on grounds of ecological, botanical or other similar interest or value.  The amenity aspect must also be present.</P>
    <P>The felling of a tree does not constitute development and does not require planning permission in the ordinary way.  The purpose of a tree preservation order is to bring such activity within the control exercisable under the Planning Acts so that no tree covered by a tree preservation order may be felled without the consent of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>A tree preservation order may apply to an individual tree or trees, a group or groups of trees, or woodlands.  It may not apply to shrubs or to hedges although trees within hedges may, of course, be covered.  Woodlands are not defined in the legislation, but it may be taken that woodlands in many instances would involve commercial timber production. One would not normally expect planning authorities to become involved in the control of forestry activity and that is why it is exempted development under section 4 of the 1963 Act but subject to regulation under the Forestry Act, 1946.  However, there may be special amenity considerations relating to particular woodlands which would justify planning authority intervention by way of a tree preservation order.  For example, it may be necessary in some locations, for amenity reasons, to seek postponement of felling, to limit felling or even to prohibit felling at a particular time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The main provisions in a tree preservation order will prohibit, except with a consent under the order, the cutting down, topping, lopping, or wilful destruction of the tree, trees, groups of trees or woodlands specified in the order, and set out the extent to which the provisions of Part IV of the 1963 Act will apply to applications for consent to fell.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the provisions of Part IV of the 1963 Act can be applied to felling consents in each tree preservation order.  If section 26 (5) of the Act, as amended, is included in the provisions applied, there will be a right of appeal against the decision of the planning authority.  This right of appeal is fundamental to the whole planning control system and my Department have recommended that it should be provided for in every tree preservation order.  That is why, as the Minister has already explained, the model tree preservation order sent by my Department to local authorities includes the appropriate appeal provisions.</P>
    <P>This model order also makes provision for applicants for consent to publish notice of intent in accordance with the normal planning permission practice and for the notification of a decision to any third party who has made representations about a particular application.  I would, therefore, reiterate that the procedural provisions in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill are unnecessary.  I believe that planning authorities should amend existing tree preservation orders if the appeals provisions are not incorporated, and I welcome the Minister's commitment to remind authorities of this.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to liability for compensation in the case of tree preservation orders are set out in section 45 (2) of the 1963 Act.  In summary, the position is that refusal of a consent to fell, or the issue of a consent with conditions, can give rise to a claim for compensation, where it can be established that damage has been suffered as a consequence. However, there are two exceptions. First, if an order made in respect of a tree, trees or group of trees expressly <Col N="1088" /> declares that all the trees covered by the order are of special amenity value or of special interest, no compensation is payble in respect of refusal of a consent. This does not apply in relation to trees which form part of a woodland.  Secondly, where an order covers woodland trees and the planning authority wish to impose a replanting condition as an essential requirement in the interest of the amenity, the order may make a declaration to that effect and no compensation is then payable in relation to that condition.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, the law already provides for non-payment of compensation in certain cases.  The question is, however, whether these provisions, together with the other requirements under the Forestry Acts etc., are sufficient to preserve trees in the way we would like and, if not, whether a way can be found of extending and amending them within the constraints imposed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has already detailed the factual situation regarding Wicklow County Council's handling of recent applications for consent to fell trees at Coolattin, County Wicklow.  I fully appreciate that there were difficulties for the council in dealing with these applications and it is clear that the council were anxious to do what they could to secure the preservation of Tomnafinnogue Wood.  The making of a special amenity area order for the wood is proof of this.  Nobody in the House could feel happy about the destruction of our woodlands, especially where there is not an adequate programme of replanting. This results not only in a loss of amenity but also in an economic loss to the nation, a loss which cannot be made good for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Energy, my colleague Deputy Smith, who is responsible for forestry matters, is to be congratulated on his quick and decisive action in making a prohibition order to prevent more tree felling at Coolattin.  The Minister of State has shown his personal commitment by visiting the area himself and arranging for his officials to carry out a comprehensive <Col N="1089" /> inspection of the woods in which trees have already been felled.  As the Minister of State explained in the House, the inspection revealed that the mortality rate of new trees was unacceptably high and this was a factor in his decision to prohibit further felling.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there may be further stages in the procedure under the Forestry Acts and I do not want to comment on the possible outcome.  However, I am confident that the Government will do all in their power to secure the preservation of the oakwoods in Tomnafinnogue.  The Taoiseach himself has already assured the House of that.</P>
    <P>On a more long term basis, there are a variety of other issues involved.  The Minister of State at the Department of Energy said that his Department will gradually increase the percentage of broadleaf species planted each year and this is very welcome.  I too would like to see a national strategy being developed in relation to broadleaved species.  Anybody who visits the countryside will notice the difference in the landscape where such trees are present.  They add tremendous colour and character, apart from their benefits in terms of shelter and wildlife.  It is sad to think that only about 1 per cent of the country is covered by broadleaved trees and we must do all we can to protect this part of our heritage. We take a strong line of action when national monuments are threatened.  We must respond in the same way when other elements of our heritage are also at risk.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by this Bill revolve around the preservation of our national heritage on the one hand and, on the other, the personal rights and guarantees which our Constitution enshrines.  We have the Attorney General's advice that this Bill would not withstand a challenge on constitutional grounds.  So, we must think again about the way we tackle this issue.  I should say that Deputy McDowell is being a bit unfair when he alleges that unduly restrictive advice has been given by the Attorney General to successive Governments as to the import of the constitutional provisions on private property. He may rest assured that the <Col N="1090" /> Attorney General is fully aware of case law in this area.  In recent years, the courts may appear to have taken a less restrictive view of these Articles of the Constitution but successive Attorneys General and their staff take full account of all judgments, especially those of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Deputies are, of course, entitled to express their views on how the Constitution may or should be interpreted. However, when it comes to dealing with specific legislative proposals which raise constitutional issues the Government will have regard to the reasoned and detailed advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I believe that the strategy of linking the compensation aspect of tree preservation to a more general and fundamental review of the compensation provisions of the Planning Acts as a whole is the correct strategy, given the constitutional complexities involved and the problems and questions arising.  My Department are carrying out a review of all the issues involved and this will be completed as soon as possible.  The objective will be to bring forward a package of proposals which will strengthen the position of the planning authorities generally.  I would like to assure the House that the position of the planning authorities in dealing with applications for tree felling consents will receive particular attention.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed to the need to consider both the Planning Acts and the Forestry Acts together.  I welcome the proposal to establish a special working group to consider how best responsibility for the protection and preservation of woodlands can be discharged and how the functions involved can best be allocated as between the local planning authorities and the State.  I hope that the working group will be able to come up with sensible and practical recommendations and that their deliberations can be completed in a matter of months.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that I, too, would be pleased if it were possible for me to support this Bill.  However, some of the provisions of the Bill are in the Government's view, unconstitutional and I must <Col N="1091" /> therefore oppose the motion for a Second Reading.  The Government will not allow the broadleaved woodlands of Ireland to be indiscriminately destroyed because of any weakness in the current legislative or administrative process.  Recent developments have brought the matter to a head. The particular situation in relation to Tomnafinnoge Wood is being dealt with by the Government.  This Bill does not offer a practical or workable response to that problem.  Neither is it the best way to proceed on the general problem.  The Government's approach of linking the development, extension and proper management of broadleaf woodland with the needs of amenity protection and preservation is, I believe, the best approach in the long run.  New legislation may be needed but any proposals for legislative changes will require careful drafting and scrutiny so that they will accord with the relevant Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the genuine concern expressed here in the House on this issue but I believe that the best way forward is to leave it to the Government to take effective action.  The Government will bring forward workable proposals for legislation, together with whatever other changes are needed to improve the situation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been many years now in this House and I have seen successive Governments bringing in legislation on many matters.  Some legislation thought by some Members of the House to be unconstitutional proved to be so.  Rightly or wrongly, that was the ruling of the courts and we always respect the ruling of the courts; I would not dare to interfere with that.  We have a duty as a Government in that whatever legislation we bring in must have the approval of the Attorney General.  It must stand up in law.  I do not believe in bringing in legislation that will not stand up in the courts because of bad advice.  I must accept the advice of the Attorney General on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins when speaking last week said, in so many words, if I took him up correctly and I believe I did, that we should bring this legislation in and let <Col N="1092" /> the courts decide afterwards.  That is not my way of doing things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

I want to assure all the Members of the House that as soon as it is possible to do so, we will bring a Bill before the House and I have no doubt that this will stand up constitutionally. There is no other way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Marine, including certain services, adminstered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>It is a privilege for me, as first Minister for the Marine in the history of the State, to introduce this supplementary estimate for Roinn na Mara and thereby afford the House an opportunity to debate marine affairs and fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil prepared a policy document entitled &ldquo;Roinn na Mara, Department of the Marine&rdquo;. This document highlighted weaknesses in <Col N="1095" /> the approach of central Government to the marine economy.  It outlined, <i>inter alia,</i> (i) wasteful utilisation of Government financial and human resources; (ii) demarcation overlaps in policy between Government Departments and agencies operating both within and outside the marine field; (iii) absence of forward development planning relating to existing established marine resources and those with developmental potential; (iv) lack of cohesion in approach to international maritime developments which impinge on national interests; and (v) inadequate investment in research and development. All of these indicated very clearly the need for a new initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out that no fewer than nine of the then existing Departments had varying degrees of involvement in marine development.  While involvement of some of these Departments in maritime affairs may be justifiable, this fragmentation led to the absence of an overall cohesive marine policy.  Fianna Fáil promised to end this unsatisfactory situation in the marine and establish a new marine Department.  This has been done.  Relevant functions previously performed by the Departments of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, Communications and the Gaeltacht have been transferred to the new Department. These functions include sea and inland fisheries, aquaculture development, fishery harbours, commercial harbours, licensing of the foreshore, shipping, marine search, rescue, and safety, marine pollution and dumping at sea.  Other marine related activities are being reviewed with a view to ascertaining the most effective administrative location for them.</P>
    <P>The overall situation since the foundation of the State has been that we have never had an administrative structure which would look at the marine economic potential development area and put an administrative structure in place which would utilise to the maximum potential in every aspect this huge resource we have as an island nation.  The decision speedily taken by the Government is a <Col N="1096" /> recognition of the importance of the marine economy and the necessity for the commercial drive and development which is so essential if we are to exploit to the fullest possibility the jobs and revenue for the State from the vast potential we have as an island nation.</P>
    <P>The sea and shellfish catches, excluding salmon, by Irish registered vessels in 1986 amounted to 223,450 tonnes valued at £64.4 million compared to 222,200 tonnes in 1985 valued at £60 million.  Higher fish prices and a sharp reduction in fuel oil prices have resulted in a major upturn in the fortunes of the sea fishing industry. A good indication of the recovery of the industry and of future expectations is the upsurge, in 1986, in grant and loan applications to BIM for new vessels in the size range of 18 metres to 33 metres.  This year also saw the £6 million supertrawler <i>Atlantic Challenge,</i> Ireland's biggest fishing vessel, join the fleet.  By year end a further four vessels in the 200-300 ft. class, with on-board processing facilities, geared mainly towards non-quota horse mackerel and blue whiting fisheries were placed on order.</P>
    <P>The fish processing industry had a year of mixed fortunes but export sales performance was nevertheless exceptionally good.  There were buoyant markets for white fish, herring roe and shellfish, shore-frozen horse mackerel and a growing range of added-value products.  The total value of exports is estimated at £102 million.  Erratic supplies of whitefish accompanied by high quayside prices and an unsatisfactory mackerel season were the main difficulties encountered.  The mackerel season started off with excess supply, low demand and full cold stores from 1985 but that situation had been reversed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Investment in shore based fish processing facilities continued in 1986.  Five fish processing projects, with an associated fixed asset investment of £3.84 million, received State aid amounting to £714,000 and were approved by the EC Commission for FEOGA grant-aid of £1.11 million.</P>
    <P>The 1987 provision for Bord Iascaigh Mhara is £9.547 million.  This includes a <Col N="1097" /> capital allocation of £2.02 million to be spent mainly on grants for the purchase of new fishing vessels, the improvement of existing vessels and the setting up of mariculture projects.  A further £2.385 million is provided for loans by BIM to fishermen for the purchase of new or secondhand vessels and for vessel improvements.  The BIM investment will be supplemented by EC grants and bank loans.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that BIM are the appropriate agency for all market development of fish and have, therefore, reversed the decision of the previous Government that the marketing function be transferred to CTT.  The fishing industry requires a totally integrated approach from production through to marketing and BIM have the necessary expertise at all stages of the production-marketing chain.  I might add that this decision has the unanimous support of all sectors of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>On the sea fisheries side, we continue to work within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, the provisions of which are applicable in all member states.  The policy has been strengthened in recent times by the introduction of a number of conservation and technical regulations.  Our fishermen should continue to support these measures so that we may benefit from the consequent increases in stock levels in the future.</P>
    <P>The single most important element of the Common Fisheries Policy from our point of view is, of course, the catch quotas available to the Irish fishing fleet. The quotas available in 1987 were agreed last December.  Discussions on the 1988 quotas will not take place until later this year.  I felt that I could not wait that long to present my views on these quotas and other matters affecting the Irish fishing industry and so during April both the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and myself went to Brussels to meet with the Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries, Mr. Cardoso E. Cunha.</P>
    <P>During the discussions, which covered a wide range of issues, we raised the question of Irish quotas generally with specific emphasis on those species of <Col N="1098" /> greatest importance to us.  We invited the Commissioner to visit Ireland and see the situation at first hand.  It is expected that this visit will take place some time next month and I will be availing of that opportunity to press again for the maximum quotas possible for Irish fishermen.  It would be my intention that during his visit the Commissioner should meet with various fishing groups so that he will be fully aware of the Irish situation.  I propose also during the Commissioner's visit to take him to some of the fishing harbours and landing places so that he can see the position in which the Irish fishing industry is now poised and whether we can identify clearly the potential we have for further development and expansion in the area of fishing activities.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is significant scope for the development and expansion of the Irish fishing industry.  Already we are developing a highly lucrative nephrops fishery and there is also scope for increased fishing effort on whitefish. It is important that we should utilise our whitefish quotas, as failure to do so may militate against us in our quest for increased quotas.  In addition, the shortfall in the availability of whitefish, on the UK market in particular, consequent on the reduced whitefish quotas in the North Sea, means that top prices are available to our fishermen.  We should encourage the industry, particularly the fishermen to use the maximum quotas available which at the moment are not being fully taken up.  It is difficult to make a case for increased quotas when within the existing quota arrangement some of the species of fish available to Irish fishermen are not being fully taken up.</P>
    <P>Interest has been expressed by a number of our fishermen in the past in conducting exploratory fishing to determine the extent of the possibilities that exist in relation to certain species, particularly non-quota ones.  Should these efforts prove successful then significant new possibilities could be opened up for our fishermen.  This is the type of &ldquo;pioneering spirit&rdquo; which must be encouraged and supported.</P>
    <P>In the event of quotas being introduced <Col N="1099" /> for some of the species which are presently non-quota, our quota will be determined on our historic performance in these areas.  I would draw the attention of the industry to the opportunities that are there and to the fact that if quotas are introduced for new species our quota will be determined by our past efforts.  It is important now to fish these species to the maximum possible.</P>
    <P>The new EC structures package offers continued opportunities to the industry by way of financial assistance towards fleet modernisation and renewal, aquaculture, etc.  It includes a number of new and innovative measures such as aid for searching out new markets, provision of facilities at ports, both of which are particularly welcome from my point of view.  We have benefited considerably from the Community's schemes in the past and it is my intention that we should seek to increase this in the future in order to promote the development and expansion of the Irish fishing industry.  To this end the BIM marine credit plan is being reviewed and consideration is being given to the inclusion of vessels over 33 metres under the plan in order that they may qualify for EC aid.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated this year in Subhead C2 of the Vote for fishery harbour development is £1,700,000.  This sum in the main will be used for ongoing harbour development works at a number of locations with a small amount being allocated to some minor new works which are urgently needed.  A small amount of money to develop some of the smaller landing places and harbours could be of great benefit to the fishermen in these areas.  It could mean the difference between the fleet being able to expand fishing activities and not being able to expand at all.  I will be looking at some of the smaller landing places to see how small amounts of money can help to improve facilities and help the overall fishing effort.</P>
    <P>The general interest in fish-farming continues to grow particularly in salmon farming.  Generous grants are available for both pilot and commercial scale projects <Col N="1100" /> to encourage further development to take place.  The new EC structures policy negotiated last year makes specific allocations for aquaculture and will greatly assist development of the industry in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Notable success has been achieved recently on the implementation of the designation process provided for under the 1980 Fisheries Act.  Fourteen areas have now been designated.  These designations provide a sound legal basis for the future development of aquaculture and include virtually all of the area suitable for mariculture from Greatman's Bay in County Galway to Broadhaven Bay in County Mayo.  Extensive areas in Counties Donegal, Kerry and Louth have also been designated.</P>
    <P>Production of farmed salmon in 1986 amounted to 1,215 tonnes which was more than double the 1985 figure.  It is estimated that by 1992 production will have reached at least 10,000 tonnes &mdash; a significant increase by any standard.</P>
    <P>Shellfish production is also set to rise dramatically during the coming years with a number of local community based oyster fishery development plans coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>The future for aquaculture in Ireland is very hopeful but it is essential that proper arrangments are in place to realise its full potential.  I am at present engaged in a review of the aquaculture development programme and I will shortly be making detailed proposals to the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>The amount being allocated to Inland Fisheries Development is £5,582,000.  Of this a sum of £4,814,000 is being allocated to the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to enable them to carry out their functions in the conservation, protection and development of our inland fisheries. In addition a sum of £350,000 has been provided for the purchase of the very valuable Moy Fishery at Ballina by the State.</P>
    <P>The angling potential of our rivers as a source of leisure for our people and as a means of attracting angling tourists from Britain and mainland Europe has not received the recognition it deserved. <Col N="1101" /> resources available to me to develop and expand this very valuable resource by means of improving and enhancing stocks, continuing research, co-operating with relevant Government colleagues in monitoring and combating pollution in our rivers and making people more aware of the great potential of this amenity.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that those benefiting from angling developments should make some effort in return to the further development of the resource.  This is something I intend to address in the near future.</P>
    <P>While recognising the importance of trout and coarse fish in the inland fisheries scene, no one will disagree that salmon has a special place in the hearts of the Irish people and has been a very emotive issue over the years.  As members are aware a salmon review group in my Department have been examining the effectiveness of the salmon protection regulations.  The group have received many submissions and met many deputations in the course of their review and have identified many complex problems. They will be presenting an interim report to me in the near future.  While in no way wishing to pre-empt the recommendations of the group I wish to make three points.</P>
    <P>First, I am satisfied that the greatest return to the State from salmon can be got from angling.  Secondly, sea fishing for salmon plays an important role in some communities and thirdly, I am determined to do all in my power to eliminate illegal salmon fishing.  Illegal fishing at sea causes severe damage to salmon stocks and cannot be allowed to continue. I have directed the regional managers in each of the regions to make a special effort this season to stamp out illegal salmon fishing which is damaging the future prospects of salmon stocks and putting the livelihoods of many people in jeopardy.  There will be no let up in my drive to stamp out illegal salmon fishing and all illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>The protection, development nad conservation of inland fisheries is carried out by the fisheries boards on my behalf under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  The previous <Col N="1102" /> Government took a decision to abolish the Central Fisheries Board.  I am presently examining the structures, functions and role of the central and regional fisheries boards in the context of Roinn na Mara.  The future, nature, composition and functions of the boards will have to be carefully considered.  I will welcome any views which the various interests concerned may wish to offer on these issues.</P>
    <P>I have already met a number of fishery boards.  It is my intention to see all the fishery boards in the course of the next few weeks to outline to them a number of key areas to which they should pay more attention and to impress on them the desirability of preparing a developmental programme for the whole inland fisheries area so that we can utilise to the maximum our inland fisheries resource.  We can make Ireland the angling centre of Europe.  I will be directing the boards to see to it that they undertake the necessary developmental programmes within their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>A sum of £130,000 is provided as my Department's contribution to the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  This is a statutory body set up under legislation enacted here and in Northern Ireland in 1952 with responsibility for the conservation, protection and improvement of fisheries in the Foyle area.  It is a fine example of North-South co-operation carried on unobtrusively for many years.  The deficit in the operation of the commission's activities are funded on a 50:50 basis by my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objectives of Roinn na Mara in relation to the Irish merchant shipping industry are two fold: to foster the development of a viable industry under the Irish flag which will serve our strategic and trading needs and to ensure that the industry operates in a safe maritime environment.</P>
    <P>In framing a maritime policy which is now the responsibility of Roinn na Mara, for the years ahead, I see a need for steps to develop once more a deep sea Irish fleet, beginning in a modest way, perhaps, <Col N="1103" /> and expanding as trading opportunities are indentified and exploited.  I have to say, however, that the extent to which existing assistance for the industry can be augmented is limited in view of the present constraints on the Exchequer and other competing needs on Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to the scheme of investment grants for the shipping industry.  These will provide for the payment of 25 per cent grants towards the purchase of new and secondhand vessels by the private sector of the Irish shipping industry.  A provision of £1.5 million was made for this scheme in the Estimate.  In addition the industry will benefit from the application of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and the extension to it of the business expansion scheme as provided in the Finance Bill.  These measures are necessary having regard to the depressed state of the industry, if shipping is to be revitalised and expanded.</P>
    <P>Within the overall picture of continuing surplus capacity on a world scale, the EC share of world tonnage has steadily declined since the beginning of the decade.  The competitiveness of the EC fleet <i>vis-à-vis</i> its foreign competitors has suffered badly.  In the context of these difficulties, the adoption last December by the Council of Ministers of a package of maritime regulations is welcomed as an important and historic initiative.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted, however, that the Council of Ministers was not able to reach agreement on the liberalisation of internal shipping services, but I am confident that it will be able to resolve these difficulties and to move forward.  Ireland's position is, of course, clear: we have a very liberal regime and pursue an &ldquo;open ports&rdquo; policy &mdash; there are no restrictions on vessels of any nationality trading to and from Irish ports.</P>
    <P>On safety aspects, it will be a primary objective of Roinn na Mara that the highest internationally accepted standards will continue to apply on board Irish ships in relation to their construction, equipment and operation and <Col N="1104" /> in standards of training of those on board. We are a party to all of the principal safety conventions drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation, the specialised agency of the United Nations which is responsible for safety at sea matters. Ireland is also a party to the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, an agreement between 14 maritime nations of Western Europe.  The parties to this agreement implement a rigorous programme of inspection of ships calling to ports to ensure adherence to the standards of internationally accepted conventions designed to achieve safety at sea and prevent oil pollution.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances, I look forward to further improvements in marine safety and search and rescue facilities in 1987.  A sum of £250,000 has been earmarked for the further extension of the maritime VHF network around our coasts.  Four remote control stations are already in operation linked to the manned stations at Malin Head and Valentia; two are in County Kerry and one each in Counties Donegal and Cork.  In addition, my Department will be continuing their programme of re-equipping the Coast Life Saving Service, a voluntary body operated under the auspices of my Department at over 50 locations around the coast.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Estimates mark the first Exchequer payment to the general lighthouse fund which finances the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This follows an agreement reached in 1985 between the UK and Irish authorities.</P>
    <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is vested in three bodies, known as General Lighthouse Authorities: the Commissioners of Irish Lights who serve the coasts around Ireland, Trinity House who have responsibility for England and Wales and the Northern Lights Board, who are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.  While the facilities in the three areas are separately held and managed <Col N="1105" /> by the three lighthouse authorities, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit.  Expenditure is met from the central lighthouse fund which derives its income from the collection of lights dues in ports in Britain and Ireland. There is a substantial gap &mdash; £8 million in the year ended 31 March 1986 &mdash; between revenue from light dues in Ireland and expenditure by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This arises because the elaborate system of lights demanded by the geographical situation of Ireland has not been matched by a corresponding flow of shipping traffic into Irish ports.</P>
    <P>Following negotiations between the Irish and British authorities, it was agreed that in future a greater share of the costs incurred by the Commissioners of Irish Lights in the State will be met from sources in the State.  Under the agreement, the lights dues collected at Irish ports will be supplemented as necessary by an Exchequer contribution so that total revenue from sources in the State will gradually increase from a level of 30 per cent in 1987 of CIL's expenditure in the State to reach 50 per cent by 1991.  The Exchequer contribution in 1987 amounts to £1.287 million.  This sum was, in fact, paid out of the Vote of the Department of Communications just prior to the establishment of Roinn na Mara.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure this year on the commercial harbours is expected to total about £9.5 million which is roughly the same as last year's outturn.  The total amount of Exchequer assistance for those harbours, including voted and non-voted moneys, is £4.6 million, comprising £4.5 million grant and £0.1 million local loans fund financing.  The sum of £1.468 million in the Vote for the Marine is in respect of the period 1 April to 31 December 1987.  The balance is accounted for under the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>The new deepwater berth at Ringaskiddy in Cork Harbour which cost £10 million approximately is now complete and is capable of accommodating fully laden vessels of up to 60,000 dead weight tonnage.  Grant assistance of £642,000 <Col N="1106" /> has been allocated this year to meet completion costs of the project.  The berth is the final stage in the Cork harbour development scheme which began in 1977 and which has cost approximately £28 million.  This new facility together with the planned free port at Ringaskiddy should greatly enhance the attractiveness of Cork Harbour as a location for new port related industry and will boost the efforts of Cork Harbour Commissioners and the IDA to generate development in the region.</P>
    <P>In May 1985 the Government approved a rescue package for the Dublin Port and Docks Board which included payment of a grant of £3 million for each of the years 1985, 1986 and 1987.  The 1987 instalment included in this year's allocation for harbours has already been paid.  One of the board's major assets, the Custom House Docks site, was recently transferred to the Custom House Dock Development Authority, the grants paid to the board being deducted from the agreed valuation of the site.  The development of that site will undoubtedly contribute towards realising, the Government's plan for national economic recovery and, indeed, I am glad to note that there has already been an increase in traffic volume through the port, and that the board's trading performance is steadily improving.</P>
    <P>Extensive storm damage was suffered by Arklow Harbour in August last and as a result a sum of £250,000 was provided for essential repair works there.  Just under £150,000 of the grant was paid in 1986 and the remainder is being made available this year.  Grant assistance of £57,000 is also being provided to Tralee &amp; Fenit Pier &amp; Harbour Commissioners to enable repairs to the pier at Fenit to continue this year.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for commercial harbours my aim is to channel the limited State funds at my disposal into the most productive harbour investment having regard to the financial resources of the individual harbours and the need to avoid wasteful duplication of facilities in maintaining an efficient and <Col N="1107" /> cost effective ports infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that Roinn na Mara have satisfactorily completed removal of the remaining recoverable oil in the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> wreck, thus eliminating the threat of any further oil pollution to the west Cork area as a result of this unfortunate incident.  On assuming responsibility for the marine functions of the former Department of Communications, I immediately established a special task force, to survey the wreck and remove the oil.  The wreck had been very badly damaged during the winter.  Irish divers inspected and drilled into any tanks that could contain oil and they identified oil in three tanks which was then removed by use of a specialised Dutch salvage vessel.  The owners and insurers will be pursued as soon as practicable for recovery of the costs incurred.  A substantial quantity of paint was also removed.  This was tested by IIRS and I am happy to say that none of this paint contained TBT.  I have arranged for a review of domestic legislation covering marine safety and pollution in the light of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> affair and any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Roinn na Mara have, as one of their objectives, the development of a rational policy for national port development. There has been a feeling for a long time on both sides of this House that the best use is not being made of our harbours and port facilities.  The Shannon estuary is one area where I believe we have failed to exploit the opportunities.</P>
    <P>The other matter we regard as important is that of overall marine research. Our policy document outlined the need for the establishment of an institute for marine resources and fisheries research which would identify areas of research which have not been developed to date.</P>

      <P>In order to capitalise on our marine and fisheries resources it is essential that we measure these resources, devising the most effective exploitation methods while, at the same time, ensuring the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>The need for a coherent policy for marine and fisheries research and technology and for adequate support structures has been fully acknowledged for some time.  Under existing arrangements there are overlaps, duplications, waste of both human and financial resources.  It is our intention to draw existing facilities together under a new marine and research technological institute which would not alone bring together existing organisations and people working in this area but also implement a major initiative in the whole area of marine research and development so sadly neglected.  It is our intention to set up a marine institute which will have final responsibility for the development and management of marine and fisheries research and technology activities.  As part of their co-ordinating function the institute will have responsibility for the operation of all the centralised facilities and equipment.  They will also organise the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive data collection storage and dissemination system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have had more time to go into more detail on the whole mandate of Roinn na Mara and the broad thrust of the policy we see as being essential to the development, utilisation and maximum exploitation of the huge potential we have in the seas around us.  The establishment of Roinn na Mara constitutes the first step in realising that potential, in charting a course for future policy and planning in that whole area, laying down under their commercial, promotional marketing division a new powerhouse which will be crucial in organising a major drive to expand to <Col N="1109" /> the very maximum potential jobs and revenue for the State from this resource which has remained relatively untapped to date.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Fish are a very important, renewable natural resource from which we, totally surrounded by water, could derive much greater benefit through the full and planned development of the proper processing of our catch.  The horsepower of our fleet is capable of a far greater catch than our quota now allows even though most of our fleet itself is over ten years old.  We have three applications only for new boats submitted to take advantage of the new EC structures policy which is providing £65 million for the fishing industry.  In a nutshell that is the position facing us and the fishing industry as we look to the future.</P>
      <P>In 1922 the Department of Fisheries were set up to help develop Irish sea fisheries.  Though a very depressed position existed in the industry right up to the thirties &mdash; due to the loss of major export markets for herring in Central Europe and for mackerel in the United States, followed by the economic depression &mdash; the high prices for fish during the Second World War saw the beginning of a gradual recovery.  In 1952 the Sea Fisheries Act established An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to assume overall responsibility for the fishing industry.  This remained the position until the sixties when, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara become a development authority and withdrew from commercial involvements in the fishing industry, as laid down in a Government White Paper in 1963.  This produced an immediate response, with increased confidence in investment in new vessels and increased enterprise in the processing and distributive sector of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development programmes undertaken by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from 1963 to 1985 made major contributions to the rapid extension of our fishing industry.  These included fish landings which have increased from 25,000 tonnes to 223,500 tonnes in 1986.  The corresponding <Col N="1110" /> increase in the value of fish catches was £1.4 million in 1963 to over £60 million in 1985.  Exports have increased from £1.7 million to £103 million plus in 1985.  Consumption of fish in this country has doubled in the same period.  There has been a major expansion of our fleet with a State investment of over £120 million at this time.  We witnessed the doubling of the number of full time and part time fishermen, a vast growth in aquaculture and mariculture and in shore processing and the value-added industry generally.  Therefore, up to 1985 fishing and fish farming employed directly 13,000 people, not counting those involved in distribution and retailing, a most important contribution to the often remote coastal regions where the industry generally is located.</P>
    <P>Major problems were encountered during the negotiations for our accession to the EC in 1973.  In the end concessions were made in 1976, at the Council of Ministers meeting at The Hague, which went a long way towards helping our fishermen adapt to the Community's fisheries policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They went a long way. The emergence of the common fisheries policy was a major disappointment.  Even though it was finally sealed in January 1983 the agreements, the small print, were all reached in the autumn or winter of 1982.  The major difficulty for us was the agreement by the then Minister, Deputy Daly &mdash; who happens to be the present Minister &mdash; to a quota of 4.6 per cent of the total allowable catch for us even though we have 25 per cent of the Community waters.  This did not reflect the spirit of the Council of Ministers meeting at The Hague in 1976 and was never adequate for the catching capacity of our fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we must constantly increase our catch of non-quota species &mdash; as the Minister rightly points out &mdash; our priority must be to get a fairer slice of the total cake in relation to quota species.  Unlike most of our European colleagues we are <Col N="1111" /> in a developing state.  I urge the Minister and his Minister of State &mdash; I realise they were with the Commissioner in Europe some time in April; the Minister mentioned the fact in the course of his remarks &mdash; to ensure that the reciprocal visit of Commissioner Cunha here in July will be successful in relation to our request for an increased quota.</P>
    <P>I put down a parliamentary question some days ago in relation to the response the Minister received on that visit.  I received information from a reliable source that the Minister's reception in relation to our requested quota was less than we would have liked.  I will leave it at that.  I hope the Minister will get a positive response from Commissioner Cunha in relation to this issue vital to the future of our industry.  I can assure the Minister I will be as co-operative and constructive on that matter as is possible. Indeed, the Minister can rest assured of the support of this side of the House in anything we can do in order to get a fairer slice of the cake when it comes to increasing our quota.  Might I also say that we cannot afford to wait until 1992.  I hope our European colleagues appreciate our position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The late seventies and early eighties spelled financial disaster for our fishermen, with rampant inflation, the energy crisis and a depressed market generally for fish.  With financial aid packages the fishing industry has fought back.  Now the future looks brighter.  We have much lower oil prices, increased prices for our fish and a rapid decrease in the rate of inflation over the past few years.  The future looks better provided we are allowed to develop our fleet which can be done only if we can increase our catch.</P>
    <P>The latest chapter on which this Government have just embarked is the establishment of Roinn na Mara and the marine research and technology institute. These deserve every chance to live up to the Fianna Fáil manifesto expectations though I warn the Minister as constructively as possible that a rose by any other name is but a rose.  He catalogued <Col N="1112" /> in the course of his remarks the tremendous achievements over the past few years in relation to the doubling of catches, the increase in the value of fish landed and general developments in this area which happened even without the benefit of Roinn na Mara to co-ordinate and increase efficiency.  I do not disagree that we could have greater co-ordination. God knows there is great room for increased efficiency in most areas in this country.</P>
    <P>I will wait and hope that Roinn na Mara and the technology institute live up to the potential and the expectations of Fianna Fáil's manifesto.  If they do they cannot but be of tremendous benefit to the industry.  It would not be responsible for me, as spokesperson on the Marine, after three short months of this Government to use the occasion to be politically opportunistic to attack anything without being reasonable and letting it develop. I wait with interest the developments of the Minister in that area.</P>
    <P>In appreciation of the long-term advantages and economic implications of respecting conservation measures generally, a consequent increase in stock levels is essential for the future.  In particular, respect for the life-cycle of the salmon is essential for this most lucrative industry in order to preserve our natural fish stock balance.  The previous Minister set up a salmon review group and it is hoped that commonsense and natural justice will be reflected when that group report.  None of us can feel that justice is being done when we see our own fishermen being sent to jail while non-nationals using flags of convenience flout the laws just outside the territorial limit.</P>
    <P>At present the widespread use of monofilament nets of enormous depth and miles in length is wreaking havoc with our stocks and destroying the livelihood of the estuary fishermen and the sport of the rod angler.  It is destroying the future for all.  Our fishery boards are so underfunded that they are no longer in a position to carry out their statutory functions which are the conservation, development and protection of inland <Col N="1113" /> fisheries and sea angling.  I welcome the Minister's reference to an investigation into this whole area in relation to the fishery boards.</P>
    <P>The success story of our aquaculture and mariculture industries deserves to be lauded and given all the support necessary by central Government to reach its potential.  The recent threat to our valuable and rapidly expanding oyster industry from bonamia ostrea underlines how fragile the balance is between success and disaster and how important it is for the Government to have in place the necessary legislative and licensing provisions to protect the industry in relation in particular to movement, to imports, to the environmental aspects and to conservation measures generally.</P>
    <P>The whole area of safety at sea needs urgent legislative action, bearing in mind the growing numbers involved in aquaculture and mariculture.  These are usually marine biologists and general operatives with little or no experience in the handling of boats.  We already had one recent tragic accident in this area. Safety measures include the overloading of boats, the wearing of lifejackets, basic training in tying knots, safety regulations for personnel and never being alone on a boat.  The list is endless.  Responsibility must rest with the heads of management of our fish farms but I urge immediate legislation in this area to spell out the requirements.  It might be the job of the Minister for Labour to draw up this legislation but I urge the Minister for the Marine and his Minister of State to discuss what can be achieved because it is a vital aspect of an industry that has great potential and one that I hope will grow at a great rate in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The amenity and conservation aspects of aquaculture and a response to the environmental issues and conflicts raised by the development of this most important and expanding natural resource-based industry were recently put in print by An Taisce and I commend them for their concern.  They recommend the concept of a single licence to be examined by Roinn na Mara with the aim of making one agency responsible for the processing <Col N="1114" /> of all aspects of aquaculture.  The Minister, in his speech, referred basically to the licensing and designation of areas. He said that notable success has been achieved recently on the implementation of the designation process provided for under the Fisheries Act, 1980, and that 14 areas have now been designated.  He also said that licence applications for the designation areas are currently being processed and the issue of licences on a regular basis will commence in the coming weeks.  I draw the Minister's attention to the An Taisce report, with which he will be familiar, to see if he could take on board any of their recommendations, particularly in relation to this aspect of the aquaculture industry, which are very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to national port development and its importance.  He rightly pointed out that successive Governments have touched on this area but little work has been done. We have all expressed our concern about this matter.  May I take this point, together with the reference to the Shannon Estuary, to mean that we will shortly see again on the Order Paper the Harbours Bill?  I hope that is the case because we agree with the Minister that the proper and structured development of our ports is essential and that we must protect our open ports policy and ensure we get maximum benefit for our ports, the most important part of our coastal resources.</P>
    <P>The general development of our coastal resources has been lamentable for decades.  From a sport and recreation point of view we have done little to ensure access and to create the amenities along our coastline that other similar countries have managed to do.  The only development of a marina in this country recently has been in Howth harbour and yet nearly every maritime county has potential for the installation of a marina to increase the enjoyment and the recreation potential of the sea.  This is an area which needs immediate attention and we should direct resources, if at all possible, to the encouragement <Col N="1115" /> by local groups of development in this line.</P>
    <P>Basically we can discuss many aspects of the fishing industry but in the short time allocated to us this evening do little justice to the importance of the many topics involved.  As far as I am concerned, two major problems confront us.  First, we should take maximum advantage of the EC structures policy.  I urge the Minister to ensure in any way possible that we are in a position to do that.  He should ensure we can provide the resources needed for this end, to get maximum advantage from the £65 million this structures policy is offering the fishing industry in Europe at present.  He should ensure that there will be sufficient investment in new boats so that we can have a fleet fit for the development of the industry and to increase the capacity of our catch when, I am sure, he gets an increased quota from the Commission.</P>
    <P>We cannot always depend on the invaluable work and the excellence of the work of people like John Molloy and Dr. Pauline King in relation to the mackerel egg survey.  We cannot depend on finding more fish every year.  Even though we would have the same percentage it would be of our greater total allowable catch. That cannot go on, even though it is very much welcomed if it is the only vehicle we have pending the resolution to our quota problem.  The excellence of that type of work and the work done by ICES, the international committee on the exploration of the seas, must be commended and recognised by us as a maritime country.  The work done internationally on which we can piggyback is a tremendous advantage to us. We are not in a position to invest the enormous amount in research and technology in this area that is invested by the international groups and, therefore, it is of major advantage to us to be able to take on board the results of their work and of their research.</P>
    <P>As I said, it would not be constructive of me at present to develop too much my views of Roinn na Mara or of the situation as outlined by the Minister.  I hope there <Col N="1116" /> will be another occasion in the not too distant future when we can have a very constructive debate on the proposals in the Government's election manifesto and consider how perhaps they can take on board some of our views in relation to some of the issues therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, is mian liom tréaslú leis an Aire agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh sé tairbhe as an obair agus go n-éireoidh leis san aireacht tábhachtach a bhfuil sé ceaptha chuige anois, Roinn na Mara.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister and his officials every success in the new Department of the Marine.  We in the Labour Party welcome the establishment of this Department and the integration of functions involved.</P>
      <P>A central thrust of our document on the marine in 1969 was to have an integrated Department.  We had a series of meetings with the then Taoiseach.  To set the record straight as to the manner in which we pursued this principle I quote from the Official Report of 15 June 1982, column 11, volume 336:</P>
      <P>Mr. Higgins asked the Taoiseach if he will seek to integrate all matters dealing with the sea in a single Ministry for Seas and Fisheries with a view to co-ordinating the development of marine-related industry and research as a matter of urgency...</P>
      <P>That was in the mid term of my pursuit of a Department of the Marine which did not come to fruition at that stage.  Even if it is almost exactly five years later, I welcome the presence of Deputy Daly, the first Minister for the Marine.  I wish him success in his Department.  The principle of having an integrated Department of the Marine was urged at that time because I had identified eight Departments and agencies dealing with marine affairs.  I note in the Minister's speech that he discovered another and there are, in fact, nine Departments involved, I take his correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that division of functions in relation to marine matters is symptomatic of a comprehensive neglect of the sea <Col N="1117" /> fishing industry in Ireland for several generations. I will give one dramatic indicator of that neglect.  In 1832 there were exactly ten times the number of people employed and making a living from the sea as there are today.  That is a simple fact.  When you look at the attitude of the Industrial Development Authority and other promotional agencies which have been trying to establish industries here, funded entirely out of public taxation from a relatively narrow band of people who pay tax, due to reasons which I can develop again on another occasion, in the period 1970-80 the IDA invested £2.8 billion in foreign enterprise; in 1981 and 1982 the IDA investment in fish processing was £1.466 million; and BIM grant-aid to processing facilities between January 1980 and May 1983 was £123,551.  That tells the story of the commitment to the expansion of the job potential of the fish processing industry. There was not a commitment to it.  The money was not allocated and jobs were not created.  I want to say a couple of words about the crocodile tears shed about the conservation of fish stocks. Shortly after we joined the European Community, column 928, volume 85 of the Official Report of 14 December 1976 shows that we were reviewing the position of our fisheries after joining the Community.  It is important for me to make the record very clear.  When we entered the Community the whole question of fish stocks and the resources of the sea was literally offered up on an altar.  Anything that was good for butter or beef was important but people talking about fish were asked to please belt up.</P>
    <P>I remember at the time reviewing the whole question of fishing stocks in Europe.  It was the experts' opinion and not mine that was important.  Reference was made to the reports of the International Council for the Sea.  These reports showed that we did not have farming of the sea or a fishing industry developed in Europe with any respect for conservation.  We had the plundering of the sea.  It was clear after we joined the Community that we would be stuck with a quota system based on the principle <Col N="1118" /> of plunder rather than the principle of farming the sea, ocean ranching, or any of the usual concepts which were there. Therefore, the people who had plundered most got the highest quotas.  We began to shed tears when it was too late. Then people began to get very interested. Eleven years ago I placed in the Library Dr. Gibson's paper on stocks.  Speaking in Galway in 1975 Dr. Gibson said and I quote from the Official Report of Seanad Éireann 16 December 1976, volume 85, column 934:</P>
    <P>In the period from 1950 to 1967-68, the Atlanto-Scandinavian herring fishery was one of the largest in the world.  The biology of this herring has been studied by Norwegian and Icelandic scientists to the point where its annual stock abundance was known with certainty.  In conjunction with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, recommendations to reduce the catch level of this stock were made as long ago as 1964.  However, while catches in 1966 and 1967 were still running at over 1,000,000 tons no one took the warning of the scientists seriously.  In 1967, research work by ICES on the state of these stocks sounded the warning bells, not only was the stock in bad shape, it was on the verge of collapse.</P>
    <P>Dr. Gibson continued:</P>
    <P>Still no action to curtail fishing was taken, so that by 1970-71, the fishery was over, finished...boats returning dejectedly to Norwegian and Icelandic fishing ports with no herring.  In 1973, a massive hunt of the North Atlantic between Iceland and Norway by the research vessels of many ICES nations, in the words of one Icelandic scientist, &ldquo;produced one bloody herring larva&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the story of the destruction of fisheries and of the destruction of a species. One scientist after another commenting on it said that the structure of the fishing industry by the larger countries with whom we were joining had destroyed one species and had placed three or four others in danger.  This is the <Col N="1119" /> group to whom we are going now.  One hopes we will be able to extract a better quota from them.  The whole principle upon which the quota system was established was based on the plunder of the sea.  It had no conservation elements in it. It resisted all the scientific contributions towards the assessment of the state of stocks in one scientific report after another.</P>
    <P>I remember very distinctly going up and down the coast with Deputies, some of whom are not alive now, in particular with the late Deputy Clement Coughlan who joined me on one occasion and expressed his profound worry at a meeting in Donegal about the implications for the fishing industry of our entry to the European Community.  There is no doubt that we have to live among the plunderers. That is what it is because I have looked at the documentation which came from the Commission and the Community. I referred in my contribution in 1976 to a meeting I had with a Danish parliamentarian on the occasion of the visit of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, of which I was a member. I put it to him that if he was serious about the conservation of fishing stocks in Europe the Danish fleet should be reduced by one third or a half.  He laughed at me.  He said people are not serious.</P>
    <P>Parliamentarians who do not believe in the conservation of fishing stocks internationally go on like our parliamentarians here.  They talk about it but they are not willing to implement any of these proposals.  They do not really mean it and they are not committed to it.  That is why one species of fish after another will be destroyed in the world.  The principle is that over the past 40 or 50 years the people who have made the most money from fish have been those who were neither reliant on it as a food protein source nor were they living in the coastal communities.  That is why we have that inescapable fact.  I had to set the record straight in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Department of the <Col N="1120" /> Marine &mdash; Roinn na Mara &mdash; and the integration of functions which has taken place.  I commend also the strong principle of conservation which is so important in international fishing.  Our national policy is meaningless unless there are significant gains or a turn around in international conservation measures.</P>
    <P>There are three or four issues facing the industry at present.  First, there is conservation; secondly, the capital gearing of the industry, the provision of capital, to which I have referred only lightly so far as it has not figured in the large scale investment of funds.  I do not want to quibble about the point but when you look at the estimates for the development side of BIM you can see that there is a reduction of £1 million in the current year in the amount of money which is allocated.  I do not welcome that.  There is no point in imagining that small amounts of money are of any value.  The Minister is correct in emphasising the importance of developing species other than the endangered species to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to accept the statements by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and their record in the seventies when they were pushing vessels into fishing for species which were endangered.  The result was that they geared up the supply of vessels while ignoring the scientific evidence which was available for anyone to read and, at the same time, failed to provide capital for the larger vessels which could have fished for species which were recognisable and which could have been developed.  All this was taking place in an atmosphere which was hostile to planning. I still do not see any evidence that there is a commitment to planning in relation to the fishing industry.  I do not believe very much has changed.  What is lost would make one weep if one were an emotional person but because of our deep national commitment to the destruction of our resources and our failure to create jobs I am no longer emotional in relation to topics like this.</P>
    <P>In Ireland it takes two fishermen to create one job in the processing industry while in European countries one person <Col N="1121" /> at sea generates 12 onshore opportunities in the fish processing industry.  What is the reason for this?  If we want to understand what has gone wrong we have to look at the provision of even appropriate infrastructural facilities, cold room facilities, distribution of fish and so on.  Until recently there has been total confusion and ineptitude.  Egotism has reigned and there has been competition of a wasteful kind between individuals and institutions. The marketing of fish should have been conducted by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Córas Trachtála Teoranta. The Minister might tell me that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are now marketing with enthusiasm, but when I last spoke on this subject, they had one office in Paris.  I tried to visit it once but I did not get the smell of fish from that office.  What proposals are there for the provision of capital, for gearing operations in the fishing industry and for the sale of fish?</P>
    <P>It is pathetic to look at the education and training which has been provided for young fishermen.  In a survey carried out in north Mayo some years ago one out of 2,000 school children wanted to be a fisherman.  That was the attitude of young people and their parents towards a life at sea.  They could see it was a life full of uncertainty.  It was full of danger as our folklore tells us.  Anyone who lives in a coastal community can tell us about that. The heart of the problem was that one had to deal with nine agencies, and the situation has not changed remarkably. When these people went to sea conditions were very uncertain.</P>
    <P>It is 12 years since I drew attention to the need to change the social welfare regulations to meet the needs of fishermen who were away from their place of residence and who wanted to sign on. Has that side been cleared up?  What about the rights of crewmen at sea?  I remember on one occasion being regarded as a Marxist because I suggested we should have a leasing system for our vessels, similar to that which exists in other countries, instead of an absolute ownership system.  People regarded that as some kind of Soviet based suggestion. This would have ensured that people <Col N="1122" /> went to sea and used properly their vessels which were provided out of the taxpayers' purse.</P>
    <P>I mention only these points because I have a limited amount of time but I want to end my historical retrospect with a phrase from column 946 of the Official Report for the Seanad, 14 December 1976.  People are forever quoting Europeans to me.  Mr. Gundelach, assistant to Pierre Lardinois described the establishment of quotas in the European Community in a sentence.  He said, &ldquo;We are dividing up the misery&rdquo;.  Fishing stocks have been so badly damaged that we could now join and participate in dividing up the misery.  That is the story.</P>
    <P>I understand the Commissioner was invited here by Minister Kavanagh, and I hope he comes.  It is time he came.  I believe he will be courteously received, but I am not so naive as to think his visit will undo the damage which has been done by many member states, Denmark or Holland for example.  Holland is catching 20 or 30 times its permitted quota of some species, landing many of them at Nigerian ports thereby totally escaping the surveillance of the Community.  They are driving a coach-and-four through all the conservation regulations of the Community.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say that last weekend I read in my local newspaper a quarter page advertisement looking for men and women to work skinning and filleting fish on Norwegian factory ships. No experience was required.  People could be hired to work there.  That is the pathetic situation at present.  We are continually giving ourselves these needles that we are wonderful, I am sure we are, but we will go down in history as an island people with all the resources of the sea, the possibilities of farming and developing the fruits of the sea as well as the opportunities of providing jobs and of being responsible, with other countries, in looking after the sea while there will be nothing on our record but a long, pathetic and arid approach towards this resource.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example which is futuristic.  I notice that people have taken <Col N="1123" /> on the fashion, as they usually do ten years afterwards, of saying there is a wonderful future in aquaculture.  I am glad there is.  Of course there is a future in aquaculture but we must begin at the beginning.  May I raise this issue by making a list?  For example, the constitutional issue as to the ownership of the coastline is undecided, even though that issue was raised 20 years ago.  Who will go down to the sea to put out ramps and so on?  These points are not answered by the designation orders.  There could be a row about the coastline that would make the land war look like a polite picnic.  Now, there is a combination of different Departments involved under one ministry.  Who is to train people?  I have seen the most unseemly rows between An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and other agencies as to who should claim the credit for a pathetic little bit of paper which somebody got as a diploma for having completed a fish farming course. If that is our attitude in the eighties, God help us.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to put himself in the position I did some weeks ago when I met people living along the coastline of the Gaeltacht in Connemara.  They said there were only a few of them living there and that they had been involved in the sea for a long time.  Their boats are small but they want to get involved in aquaculture. What does the Minister tell them?  The county development officer will tell them how to set up a co-operative. He will then tell them to get someone to visit from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  He will tell them to get somebody from Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Then someone will write a letter to the Department of Transport and Power and so on.  Now they will be able to write to Roinn na Mhara, but the people are still not involved in aquaculture.  They do not need a marine scientist.  What they need is a marine technologist, someone who will be able to go out in waders and show them how to put a raft together, and how to look after mussels and so on.  That is what they need.  It is a pathetic reflection on all the agencies involved that there <Col N="1124" /> are not thousands more people involved in this industry.  It is a pathetic reflection on so many Governments that they did not straighten out the constitutional issues and that only now are some of the administrative issues being straightened out.</P>
    <P>I offer the Minister my condolences on the pathetic allocation he got in the Estimates for his Department.  Obviously the coming year will be spent entirely on administrative reorganisation.  There will not be much development or many jobs created in a direct or indirect way.  I wish more money were available for him.  I do not want to quibble as to who decided to abolish the central fisheries board.  It was not decided by Minister Kavanagh because I was in correspondence with him at the time and he assured me that this would not happen, and I am willing to accept that.</P>
    <P>I want to say something which is very important in relation to the Minister and I hope the Department of Defence will listen to him as the livelihood of people is involved.  There have been several fishing incidents in the Irish Sea where fishing vessels have been dragged backwards, lives put in danger and so on.  It is well known that the Irish Sea is a nuclear corridor used by submarines of both major super powers.  Is there not a very strong case for Roinn na Mara to do something imaginative, even at this late stage, such as patrolling the sea for information which is a low cost marine operation, and offering that information to other nations who are anxious if they cannot prevent these super powers from using the Irish Sea to share the information? Those nations are anxious to have some of the great waterways of the world in some way nuclear free eventually. For example, we can have sonic monitoring and report the presence and movement of submarines.  A number of other countries in the same position have carried out such monitoring.  We need to have a clear policy in regard to the naval sector and there is a need to publish a document in regard to the catching sector.  We have lost most of the jobs in processing and our marketing needs to be <Col N="1125" /> improved.  A maritime research agency should be established at UCG in Galway. We should take on the EC in a bolder manner in regard to quotas and research.</P>
    <P>With regard to infrastructure, there is no point in saying we will have a good sea fishing industry unless we have adequate roads, ports and electricity supply. County councils are under-financed to provide the infrastructure.  I have listed a number of essential requirements for aquaculture if we are to create any jobs. I should like to urge the Minister to set up an inter-departmental group to try to make progress on the elimination of pollution so that we can maintain the quality of water here, one of our finest assets.  I wish the Minister well and I hope that in the years to come the Taoiseach, who in words is committed to the sea, allocates some money to the new Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by publicly congratulating the Minister, Deputy Daly, and his Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on their success in dealing with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> wreckage off the coast of west Cork.  That wreckage caused untold damage while the Coalition were in power.  I am aware of the great depth of feeling among the people of the south-west region regarding the utter neglect and absolute foolhardiness of the outgoing administration in relation to their performance in regard to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> affair.  We should congratulate the Minister on the speedy action he took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmentalists and those involved in the fishing industry should congratulate the Minister on his work. Deputy Daly took over as Minister for the Marine at one of the most crucial periods in the history of our fishing industry. It has taken more than 60 years for people to realise that the fishing industry can no longer be ignored and that it represents hope for the future.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the industry deserves a tremendous amount of respect, thought, co-ordination and <Col N="1126" /> imagination.  The industry has been ignored and it is on its knees.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised the importance of the industry.  In establishing a new Department of the Marine they have indicated to fishermen, and those involved in the fishing industry, that they are prepared to face up to the problems being experienced by the industry. The infrastructure in the south-west is to a large extent in a shambles, and it has been for some time.  Some of the finest harbours in western Europe are almost falling into the sea.  I am referring to harbours in the vicinity of Valentia. We cannot have a viable fishing industry without the infrastructure and in many instances that has been ignored.  Accordingly, the industry has been allowed to fall into decline.</P>
    <P>People living in south-west Kerry told me that in the forties the industry was more buoyant than it is today.  In Valentia harbour young women put salt in the fish in barrels and exported them but that does not happen today.  At one time people thought that what had happened to our industry was that the fish had got away but we know that the fish were taken by foreign countries with larger and more developed fleets.  The Irish fishing grounds, a resource for all our people, have been plundered.  I am not saying that is not continuing; if we are to be honest we must accept that it is.  We must ask ourselves if we are prepared to take on other countries that have larger fleets and say to them, &ldquo;thus far and no further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister in representing Ireland at the EC will advise other member states that we are no longer willing to tolerate the infiltration of what is one of our most important resources.  We will have to tell other member states we will not tolerate this at a time of great monetary difficulties here, at a time when public expenditure had to be cut to provide the fundamental base on which we can provide jobs for our young people, and at a time when many of our young people are being forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why in an <Col N="1127" /> island nation after 60 years we are creating about 1.25 jobs on shore to every one at sea while countries like Norway can provide six or seven jobs on shore to every one at sea.  That is an indication that in the past the direction was not all that it might have been.  It shows the industry has been badly treated, the understatement of the year.  Is there any reason why an island nation should continuously import processed fish products? Why should we import John West, Captain Birds Eye and the other products that are being sold in our supermarkets while the resources of our country are ignored?  Why does nobody ever ask why we are not exporting our fish instead of importing fish products?  I urge the Minister to consider setting up a processing industry so that justice will be done.  It is necessary, in the light of recent trends in the industry, for far greater diversification and for Irish fleets to fish for new species in order to build up a sufficient quota because it must be anticipated there will be a quota for these species later on.</P>
    <P>Rumours have abounded along the south-west coast that our fishermen's attempts to diversify have at times been scuttled or interfered with by foreign boats operating off our shores.  This country can no longer accept that.  In the same period when Scottish yards had a booming boat building industry, the 700 workers who were employed in the same industry here some years ago have been reduced to about 30 workers which is an incredible indictment of the approach of the previous Government to the fishing industry.  That cannot, and should not, be forgotten.  The development of the Irish fleet is now a matter of extreme importance; 95 per cent of our fishing fleet was built for a period and a type of fishing which is now virtually extinct.</P>
    <P>One shining example of the fishing industry is in Killybegs, in the constituency of the Minister of State, and the rest of the industry must take its lead from that kind of innovation and imagination. We are too small to continue to ignore the industry.  I know that throughout <Col N="1128" /> the length and breadth of the country, particularly in the fishing industry, the appointment of Deputy Daly as Minister for the Marine was greatly welcomed. There is considerable confidence in his integrity and ability to deal with the problems facing the industry at this crucial period.  In that respect, it is clearly important that this country should become seriously involved in the aquaculture industry which should be treated with the importance and recognition it deserves as a means of creating employment.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons for the high emigration rate in the west was that the fishing industry did not receive the treatment it so richly deserved.  Emigration occurred at an alarming rate over the past four years and, at the same time, the Danes, the Spaniards and God knows who else blatantly fished in Irish waters. No country in the free world could accept that kind of treatment.  Our young people in the west deserved better than that from the previous Government.  The Minister and the Government must make a conscious effort to prevent the rape of the waters which, under our Constitution and by international agreement, form part of the State.  There was a pessimism in the industry which can now be eliminated. With an injection of confidence in the industry, with a clear statement that this country at European Community level is no longer willing to allow its trading partners to infiltrate its waters to take its resources, will come a new-found confidence among our fishermen and the industry.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will consider these points and that he will act to protect Irish waters for our fishermen, a duty which was ignored by the previous Government. The formation of the Department of the Marine and the appointment of the Minister was an important first step in instilling confidence in the industry.  He has started off tremendously well with his treatment of the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> He has shown his commitment to the industry and the industry is willing to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general realisation of the importance of the fishing <Col N="1129" /> industry to our economy, particularly to the county and constituency represented by the Minister of State and myself.  A few figures will indicate the importance of the industry to the economy when one considers that a total of 13,000 people are employed in it.  The value of our fishing exports during 1985 was in excess of £100 million.  If we are to further develop the industry to provide much needed employment for our young people and to stem the tide of emigration, especially from the west, two conditions are necessary.  We must have an adequate quota of fish and the capacity to catch it. One of the greatest handicaps the fishing industry has at present and one of the greatest constraints on its development is the low quota to which we are subject.  A perfect illustration of this difficulty exists in Killybegs which depends to a great extent on the mackerel catch.  We are subject to an 80,000 tonne quota and already the 1987 quota is almost exhausted as 73,000 tonnes have already been caught.  For the remainder of 1987 we will be allowed to catch 7,000 tonnes and the mackerel fishing fleet have the capacity to land that tonnage in a day's fishing. That is an indication of the seriousness of the position.</P>
      <P>There could be anything up to 1,000 people employed in Killybegs at present if we had an adequate quota.  I realise the Minister and the Minister of State have already visited Brussels and discussed this serious problem with the Commissioner and I understand he will visit this country in the near future, probably next month. I hope he will have an opportunity of going to Killybegs to see the facilities and realise how important it is that the quota be increased without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One also needs the capacity to catch the fish and to bring the catch ashore.  I would like the Minister in his reply to this debate this evening to let us know how the purchase of new vessels and repairs etc. to the fishing fleet are to be financed. In the past BIM were empowered to give grants of up to 25 per cent towards the purchase of new vessels and the purchase of new parts and equipment and I would <Col N="1130" /> like to know whether they are still in a position to do so?  I would also like to know if there is any truth in the rumour that this figure is to be reduced to 10 per cent?  If it is true, it will be a retrograde step in the development of this great natural resource.</P>
    <P>Fishing ports along our coasts need to be developed.  In my own county there are a number of important ports which are well known to the Minister and the Minister of State.  Killybegs is probably the most important fishing port in the country but its development has been hindered by a number of constraints, including an inadequate water supply. This is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment but I believe the Minister for the Marine should apply pressure on that Department to ensure that an adequate clean water supply is available in Killybegs.  This would enable further development to take place in the fish processing industry in the area.  At present work is being undertaken on the long sought after synchro-lift and this will be of great benefit to the fishermen who frequent the port as well as to the industry itself.</P>
    <P>Another very important harbour in Donegal is Burtonport and this is in a sad state at present.  A number of developments are envisaged for Burtonport and these include the dredging and extension of the harbour.  These developments have been promised for the past ten or 12 years and it is a source of disappointment that this dredging will not be undertaken in 1987.  From a reply to a recent question in this House I understand that this work has been postponed until 1988 or later. Last weekend there was a clear illustration of the necessity for this dredging to be carried out.  Not only is Burtonport used by the fishing fleet but it is also used by companies in the nearby industrial estate at Gweedore in the importing of raw materials.  Last weekend a cargo ship from a continental country carrying steel for one of the factories in the industrial estate ran aground on one of the sand banks near the harbour and lay there for over 24 hours.  That is an illustration of <Col N="1131" /> the necessity for the dredging of the harbour. As I said, the port is used by companies in industrial estates in the importing of raw materials and it is the port from which the Aranmore ferry sails.  I hope the Minister will use whatever power he has to ensure that this work is undertaken without further delay.</P>
    <P>Another harbour in Donegal where we thought work would be under way by now is Portnablagh which is used extensively by salmon fishermen.  An allocation was made available last year to carry out much needed work but I am not sure what the present position is.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister will let us know the exact position and whether we can expect work to commence on the port this year. Bunbeg harbour comes under the responsibility of the Department of the Gaeltacht and I understand that funds were made available in the Estimates for work to be carried out this year.  Perhaps the Minister would give an indication as to when the third stage of the development plan for the harbour will get under way.  Port Inver is used by both salmon and herring fishermen and perhaps the Minister can tell us if any development will take place in this port or at Cladach na gCaorach in Kilcar.</P>
    <P>Fish processing has great potential for job creation.  A fact often cited is that some continental countries have seven or eight jobs ashore for every one at sea. The ratio in this country is not so favourable. We must endeavour to create far more employment in this industry.  The Minister is on record as stating that it is his wish to concentrate on this sector of the industry and he also mentioned the fact that we import £7 million worth of fish fingers each year.  It is disgraceful if that is correct and the sooner that position is rectified the better.  I hope the Minister will be successful in his efforts. However, in our efforts to replace these imports with home produced products we will have to compete with long established firms and I suggest and advocate that it is essential that a proper programme of research and development is <Col N="1132" /> first carried out to see whether there will be a constant supply of fish available before we invest in the industry and every effort should be made to develop it.</P>
    <P>When we speak of the fishing industry in this country we always refer to some of the recent tragedies which have occurred around our coasts.  In my own county of Donegal there were a number of tragic accidents over the past number of years and all possible safety and rescue measures should be put in place.  It is very disturbing that our lighthouses are now in the process of being automated.  At present only 18 or 19 of our lighthouses are being manned but within the next five years every lighthouse around our coasts will go automatic and that is a retrograde step.  Unlike the UK and other continental countries we do not have a coast-guard service.  It is vital that someone maintains a watch and the lighthouse keepers have provided such a service down through the years.  In 1986 they were responsible for alerting the safety services over 200 times.  I understand that this programme of automation is being reassessed at Government level and I implore the Minister and the Government to have second thoughts as it will be a sad day if this service is allowed to come to an end within the next few years.</P>
    <P>When people are in difficulty at sea, time is always of crucial importance.  If you want to mount a rescue, time is important.  We are in the process of purchasing helicopters that can fly by night as well as by day.  I have advocated before and do again tonight that one of these helicopters should be based at Finner in Donegal.  All the facilities are there for refuelling and so on.  There is perfect safety there, perfect security.  I ask that serious consideration be given to this. When a vessel gets into difficulty at sea, at present helicopters have to fly from Baldonnel, or Shannon, or elsewhere and five, ten or 15 minutes can be of crucial importance; it can just make the difference between life and death.  I raised this subject in the House a number of weeks ago and the Minister for Defence who is responsible for the purchase of these helicopters said he would have <Col N="1133" /> another look at the suggestion.  I hope the Minister for the Marine and the Minister of State will impress on that Minister the importance of having the west coast and particularly the north west coast patrolled by one of these helicopters. Five are being purchased and it is not too much to ask to have one based in that area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well in the new Department of the Marine.  They will ultimately be judged on how they handle negotiations in Europe and whether they will succeed in increasing the fish quota.  If they do not, we will be handicapped and hampered and there will be no proper development or scope for development in that important industry.</P>
    <P>No matter what Department are there or by what name they are called, if they have not got the money or the resources to put into the industry, we are only window-dressing. There are many people working in the industry but the potential is much greater and the potential is concentrated in the west of Ireland where there are very few other industries.  Fishing is a natural resource right along the coast, but particularly in the west.  The best fishing grounds are there.  Any development would be of immense benefit to the people of the west, to the people of Donegal in general and of south west Donegal particularly.</P>

Tá rudaí ag tarlú san iascaireacht atá tábhachtach agus sílim go mbeidh páirt anmhór ag Roinn na Mara san fhorbairt seo sna blianta atá romhainn.  Bíonn daoine ag caitheamh anuas ar Rialtais nach ndéanann siad a gcion féin maidir le hiascaireacht a chur chun cinn ach ní shílim go bhfuil an locht ar Rialtais.  Tá cuid mhaith den locht ar mhuintir na tíre iad féin thart faoin chósta mar gur neartaigh siad na deacrachtaí a bhí ag baint le hiascaireacht san am atá caite, an cruatan a bhí ann.  Thóg sé scaitheamh maith do <Col N="1134" /> dhaoine a fháil amach go raibh buntáistí san iascaireacht agus thóg sé scaitheamh maith forbairt cheart a dhéanamh air.</P>
      <P>San am i láthair tá dearcadh nua le feiceáil.  Caithfimid báid mhóra a fháil, báid a bheas in ann dul amach agus coimhlint leis na náisúin eile san EC.  Tá sé in am dúinn réiteach níos fearr a fháil do hiascairí na tíre seo san Chomhphobal. Nuair a bhí an t-iar-Thaoiseach in a Aire i 1975 agus é ag plé le cúrsaí na hEorpa ag an am, rinneadh socruithe &mdash; an Hague Agreement mar a tugadh air &mdash; agus bhí ceart againn dúbailt ar an méid iascaireachta a bhí á dhéanamh againn ag an am sin.  Ach ní raibh san réiteach sin ach dúbailt ar tada.  Ní raibh aon iascaireacht ar siúl anseo ag an am sin.  Ná ní raibh aon fhorbairt á déanamh.  Ní raibh againn ach báid bheaga agus ní bhfuaireamar tada.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom i ndíospóireacht ar an raidio leis an Aire sin ag an am &mdash; agus níl mé ag caitheamh anuas air; b'fhéidir gur shíl sé go raibh sé ag déanamh a chion féin &mdash; dúirt mé go n-inseodh an saol agus i gcaitheamh ama go mbeadh a fhios aige na buntáistí a bhí le fáil, agus tá sé faighte amach anois againn nach bhfuil aon bhuntáistí againn.  Tá na hiascairí ceaptha i gcaoi nach dtig leo ach oiread áirithe éisc a bhaint amach agus is féidir leis na báid mhóra an scair eisc atá ag dul dúinne a thógáil amach i gceann cúpla mí.  Níl sé sin ag tabhairt cothrom na féinne dúinne agus sílim nár sheas an EC linne mar Stát a bhí ag tosnú ar fhorbairt na hiascaireachta agus go bhfuil siad san ag iarraidh an t-am ar fad go mbeadh an chuid is fearr de na buntáistí acusan mar bhí forbairt déanta acusan i bhfad rómhainne.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach go bhféachfaimis le dul chun cinn níos fearr a dhéanamh maidir le ceart a fháil do na hiascairí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le mo Roinn féin, Roinn na Gaeltachta, tá suim ar leith againn sa chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí iascaireachta ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag cur béime an fhorbairt ár n-achmhainní nádurtha.  Nuair a fheicimid, cuir i gcás, an fhorbairt atá á déanamh ar fheilméireacht éisc, beidh tabhacht ansin do na Gaeltachtaí sna blianta atá rómhainn. Beidh daoine nach gnáth iascairí iad ag <Col N="1135" /> plé le feilméireacht éisc agus rudaí mar sin.  Déanaim comhghairdeas le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a bhí in a gceannródaithe sa tír seo ar an fhorbairt sin agus a bhfuil an-obair déanta acu le feilméireacht éisc a chur chun cinn agus sa todhchaí beidh an-tábhacht ar fad ag baint leis an obair seo.  Ó tharla go mbeidh Roinn na Mara anois ag togáil páirt faoi leith sna cúrsaí seo, tá mé cinnte go dtabharfaidh siad aitheantas do Údarás na Gaeltachta san fhorbairt seo.</P>
    <P>Tá casaoid beag amháin agam maidir leis na cúrsaí seo.  Sílim go bhfuil an Roinn Iascaigh an-mhall ag déanamh cinneadh ar cheadúnais a thabhairt do hiascairí thart ar an gcósta le haghaidh feilméireacht éisc a dhéanamh in a n-áiteacha féin.  Ní bhíonn morán moille ar na comhlachtaí móra de réir cosúlachta ach tá clamhsán ag gnáth dhaoine thart faoin chósta a bhfuil suim acu san fhorbairt seo nach bhfaigheann siad morán éisteachta mar ba cheart dóibh maidir leis na ceadúnais seo.  Ba mhaith liom go rachadh mo chairde anseo isteach sa scéal agus go dtabharfadh siad cluas níos fearr do na hiascairí atá ag iarraidh leanúint ar aghaidh le feilméireacht éisc.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid de na comharchumainn coinnithe siar i ngeall ar go bhfuil an Roinn cineál mall ag tabhairt amach na gceadúnas seo.

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Marine Estimate.  I hope the Minister will achieve a considerable amount of progress in his portfolio.  I do not think there is any other Ministry about which I have heard such pious platitudes during my 14 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas and about which so little has been done to fulfil those platitudes. Deputies and Senators cry about the neglect of the sea fisheries and tell us what should be done.  There has not been a great deal done in regard to sea fisheries in modern times.  There is a great deal to be done and I wish the Minister every good fortune in his efforts to improve our present lamentable situation.  I am not sure that a change in the name of the ministry will bring about a change in the fortunes of the industry.  Calling it the Ministry for the Marine may sound attractive but I will wait and judge on the results that are obtained at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too enamoured of the number of review groups which have been set up, some of which were set up during the lifetime of the last Government and some set up under this Government.  So far as I am aware there are five review groups <Col N="1137" /> at present reviewing matters within the Department of the Marine: a salmon review group, a review group examining the fishery boards, a review group on the aquaculture development programme, a review group looking at the Bord Iascaigh Mhara marine credit plan and a review group on legislation governing marine safety and pollution.  I am open to contradiction but there appears to be that considerable number of review groups. Perhaps the Minister will review all the review groups or else have the Minister for Defence to review them with a fanfare of trumpets.  We all know that review groups are an excuse most often not to do anything: they postpone the evil day and pass the problem on to somebody else.  That may well be true of one administration as of another.  I would like to know, if there are that number of review groups, when they will report and what is their specific function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of those review groups was set by your predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that some of the review groups may have originated under the previous Government and some under this Government.</P>
      <P>One of the areas which creates tremendous difficulties at this time of the year is the very emotional issue of salmon fishing. The Minister has listed among his priorities the question of angling in terms of attracting tourists.  I agree fully that that is as it should be.  Angling is a segment of the tourist industry which has suffered considerably during the past 20 years.  This has been due partly to illegal fishing which has decimated supplies of fish from time to time though this is a questionable issue because salmon seem to come back in huge numbers having appeared to be on the point of elimination. This often makes me wonder if intensive fishing can strengthen the species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a drop in real terms in the number of tourists coming to Ireland. I imagine that this is due principally to the troubles in Northern Ireland.  I say this because during the fifties and sixties <Col N="1138" /> British tourists were the backbone of the Irish tourist industry and they were particularly keen on angling as an activity.</P>
    <P>The most important thing so far as the tourists and the rod anglers are concerned is that the fish and in particular, the spawning salmon, get up river.  That is the essence of the angling segment of the tourist industry.  Fish must get up river. As legislators we must be imaginative, innovative and courageous enough to face up to the problems that exist and have existed for years.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the drift netting at sea is causing immense difficulties for river anglers.  We seem to forget that there are people besides anglers who suffer as a result of drift netting.  These are the net fishermen who fish with draught net licences and also with snap net licences in the estuaries and rivers.  These people have suffered in the last 20 years due to extensive netting at sea where one can get as much as three or five miles of nets or a series of three to five miles of nets blocking whole harbour estuaries, even ones as big as the Shannon Estuary.  That must be stopped and the fish must be allowed up the river.  In advance of the review group report I suggest that we will not eliminate this illegal fishing with the present law enforcement agencies at our disposal. The Irish Navy together with the Garda Síochána and the fisheries protection officers have done a wonderful job in recent years.  They have been assaulted and abused by unscrupulous poachers. When big money is at stake people will use any means to get their hands on it.  It is not unusual for people to make £10,000 or £15,000 in one week when there is a good run of salmon.  They can get those sums because they use incredible amounts of net in an illegal manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not believe that anybody could fish with five miles of nets.  That is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With trawlers it is possible. It is going on in places like the Shannon estuary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It just could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done with a whole series of nets.  The angling potential of this country is being seriously damaged. We are having continuous confrontation between the law enforcement agencies and the drift netters.  A number of illegal fishermen have gone to prison, some from my own constituency.  A stage has been reached where we will have to agree to compromise.  We should give serious consideration to allowing the use of a limited amount of monofilament net.  The best people to enforce a discipline on fishermen are fishermen.  If there were a compromise the fishing communities would impose their own discipline.  At the moment no discipline is imposed.  The situation is deplorable and it should not be allowed to continue.  I would like to think that the law enforcement agencies could deal with the problem but in recent years experience has shown that it is extremely difficult if not impossible for them.  We should make some effort to work out an experimental compromise on a limited time basis to see if we could sanction the use of a small amount of monofilament netting together with the traditional nylon nets.  A fisherman fishing with a legal amount of net cannot make a living.  That is a sad commentary on the system.  I know some who have tried consistently and rather than break the law have abandoned fishing.  The Minister might take a courageous decision to experiment for one season with my suggestion.  If the experiment did not succeed we could return to the existing situation.  We should put the onus on the fishermen to see that discipline is imposed.  If we had a limited amount of nylon net and monofilament net it would give fish a chance to get up river and we would have a reasonable amount of fish spawning which would give the angling industry a shot in the arm.  My suggestion is worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit confused by the figures in the Minister's speech.  The Minister referred to the quantity of fish caught in 1986 at 223,415 tonnes, valued at £64 <Col N="1140" /> million excluding salmon.  How does that compare with the figure given which says that the total value of our exports is estimated at £102 million?  Does the £102 million include or exclude salmon?  Even if that does not include salmon, if the catch is worth £64 million and the export value is £102 million, it is a disgracefully low added value content.  I am sure the figure to which we should aspire should be 10 times the £64 million, and not just a 40 per cent increase.  Those figures are striking and they are alarming.</P>
    <P>In relation to fish farming it is hoped this year to produce 1.2 tonnes of cultivated salmon and by 1992 it is hoped to produce 10,000 tonnes.  If we achieve that target we will have made tremendous progress. The Norwegians have done it and they are years ahead of us.  They are very impressed with the growth rate of salmon in our waters and they see tremendous potential here for salmon fish farming.</P>
    <P>We have not exploited other forms of fish farming to the full.  It is really a matter of education.  Universities could be of greater assistance in this regard.  Perhaps the universities could get assistance from the Government and special moneys from the EC to provide more post graduate courses to encourage people to maximise their earning from fish farming. Dungarvan Harbour, in my own area was never thought of in relation to mariculture but recent experiments have shown that it is ideal for clams, oysters and mussels on a commercial scale.  There must be hundreds of harbours around the coast suitable for this.  It is basically a matter of education.  If experimentation showed that the harbours were fit for that type of fish farming the investment would follow, whether native or foreign.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, white fish are the sheet anchor of the fishing industry here. The figures can get blurred by the fact that in our total catch of 223,000 tonnes we include fish like horse mackerel and whiting.  The bulk catching of these species of fish blurs the whole issue.  We should break up that figure and show how much white fish is being caught, how much salmon is being caught and how much bulk fish such as blue whiting and <Col N="1141" /> horse mackerel is being caught.  We need those figures as the global figures do not tell the true story.  The Minister should break down the figures in metric tonnes and in terms of money and in terms of value added and export earnings.</P>
    <P>Not all fish enterprises are encouraged as they should be.  One item referred to in the Minister's statement as creating a buoyant market and earning money in exports is herring roe which is a relatively new product.  I want to give a graphical demonstration.  In my area in the Ring Gaeltacht a factory which operated last winter employed 200 people in extracting roe from herrings and exporting that roe to Japan.  The company in question, CPR, applied for a FEOGA grant to expand their operation so that they could employ 400 people but I believe they are having considerable difficulty in getting a FEOGA grant.  I would like the Minister to take to heart that vivid example of what can be achieved in the fish processing industry and see if he can help a company like that.  They have already provided 200 jobs that are seasonal of course and they feel these jobs could be all the year round if they had proper premises.  They can immediately expand the workforce to 400 but there is some doubt as to whether they are entitled to a FEOGA grant.</P>
    <P>Another point in regard to white fish is fishing by the Spanish fleet off the south-west of Ireland, primarily for hake.  We read reports that are rather sensational, although I have no doubt they contain a great deal of truth and perhaps are totally true, about boats being rammed by Spanish operated vessels.  The whole matter is quite unsavoury.  I do not know whether the Minister has protested to his Spanish counterpart, the Spanish Minister for Fisheries.  This type of activity is not good enough.  The Spaniards, acting illegally and perhaps criminally in some cases, can teach us a lesson about what we should be doing.  They catch huge quantities particularly of hake in prime condition because the method of fishing is by long lining.  This is a rather tedious form of fishing involving a geat deal of manpower and work but it produces the fish in prime <Col N="1142" /> condition and it is a very lucrative operation.</P>
    <P>If others can come 1,000 miles to fish in our fishing grounds off the south-west of Ireland, surely it is a poor reflection on us that we cannot operate a similar enterprise maybe 50 or 100 miles off our coast.  At times it almost makes one feel that the major fishing development at Castletownbere was constructed for the benefit of the Spanish.  We are not getting back the potential that that investment deserves.  We have a massive investment in Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs, Castletownbere and Ross a'Mhíl.  We should be getting back the investment we put into those five harbours but in some cases we are not doing so.  The Spanish and the French seem to be making better use of those facilities than we are making.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish the Minister the best of good fortune in his portfolio.  He has tremendous potential for developing our sea fisheries.  That will take a little ingenuity and a great deal of courage especially in salmon fishing because that is a troublesome area, but he should change the rules if only on a temporary basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the limited time available I propose to confine my remarks to sea fisheries, the area for which I am primarily responsible. I have had the pleasure of meeting a number of the main national organisations representing the industry, and the Minister and I hope to meet with the others during the summer and at that time we hope also to visit a number of our ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to our meeting with the EC Commissioner for Fisheries some weeks ago when the problem of quotas was dealt with.  As he indicated, we raised a number of other issues, for example the difficulties regarding the herring market.  This has been a matter of great concern for us for some time. The Commissioner assured us he is aware of the problem, that a special working group has been set up by the Commission and it is expected that its report will be available before the end of the year.  We <Col N="1143" /> are concerned at the high level of imports from third countries of herring in particular and we raised this matter also. Herring imports into the EC last year were an alarming 120,000 tonnes: only 26 per cent of those imports attracted some duty while herrings in the EC are going to producer organisations.  This must contribute to the deflated prices of our herrings. We are aware of the problem and we will do our utmost to ensure it will be resolved.  We pointed out to the Commissioner the social and regional implications in regard to provision of jobs along the coasts where there is no alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Despite these difficulties which the fishing industry has faced in recent years, there are signs of a marked recovery in the profitability of the fleet.  The best indicator of recent trends is the relationship between fish and fuel oil prices.  Fuel oil can account for between 30 and 60 per cent of total operating costs depending on the age and size of the boat, the fishing method and the type of engine.  The average price of oil fell by one third between 1985 and 1986, and this was a big factor. White fish prices increased during the same period by some 16 per cent which represents a healthy relationship in contrast to the cost price squeeze which has bedevilled the fleet for far too long.</P>
    <P>The interest of our fishermen in purchasing new fishing vessels and having their vessels refurbished, modernised and lengthened is encouraging.  Their commitment is an accurate barometer for the future.  Now we must encourage greater emphasis on white fish as the industry suffers due to the lack of continuity of supply.  With that continuity the processors will always react to changing circumstances. They are only too anxious to add value, provided they can obtain adequate, continuous supplied of white fish at realistic prices.</P>
    <P>Figures have been bandied about here tonight from 1:8 to 1:12 in regard to the number of jobs on shore as against the number at sea.  That is not a reflection on the Department; it is a reflection on the industry and on behalf of the industry I <Col N="1144" /> refute the allegation.  There was a suggestion of landed fish valued at £60 million realising only £100 million when exported.  The reference was to mackerel which we are exporting.  That is precisely the way they want it in Europe and in Africa.  Fresh fish on the market is exactly what the customer wants.  Lobsters, for instance, are wanted fresh because that is when they are at peak value.  If we are to add value then it must be in white fish and the jobs must be created there.</P>
    <P>We will strive towards substitution for the many imports not in the area of mackerel and herring but in white fish generally. I refute any indication that the industry is not reacting to the circumstances. The year 1986 witnessed mixed fortunes for the industry.  Exports remained static at the figure mentioned of some £102 million.  Currency exchange rates exerted a strong influence on export returns.  Exports to the dollar trading areas such as west Africa and Egypt were affected adversely.  On the positive side the 8 per cent devaluation of the Irish £ within the EMS resulted in higher returns to continental destinations.  Not surprisingly, EC countries increased their share of total Irish fish exports from 68 per cent in 1985 to 79 per cent in 1986, the balance going to third countries falling from 32 per cent to 21 per cent during those years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  During the year An Bord Iascaigh Mhara intensified their programme to promote sales of seafood <Col N="1145" /> on home and export markets in co-operation with the industry.  As the Minister has already indicated, the Government decided that responsibility for fish export marketing should be returned to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, a wise decision much applauded by the industry.</P>
      <P>We propose to take up with RTE the question of the resumption of the fish-related programme on RTE, the termination of which programme had adverse effects on consumption of fish at home. We shall pursue that matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the non-quota species.  I should like to refer briefly to scad or horse mackerel, as they are known, and blue whiting, in respect of which there is a total allowable catch. However, as yet no quota has been agreed.  It is important that we build up our historical performance in relation to these species pending the fixing of quotas. I am glad to say that already progress has been made in that direction.  The addition of the four large vessels referred to will improve our position even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to harbours a sum of £1.7 million has been provided for their development.  This will be required almost entirely to finance the syncrolift at Killybegs, the improvement scheme at Greencastle, the completion of schemes in progress such as those at Schull, Derryinver and Porteen on Achill Island. Apart from the Killybegs and Greencastle projects, all ongoing improvements are expected to be completed this year.  I take the point raised by my colleague, Deputy McGinley, in relation to the water at Killybegs.  A meeting has been arranged in the near future with the Department of the Environment and officials of Donegal County Council to discuss this very serious problem.  He referred to Burtonport.  I had two meetings with the Burtonport fishermen's organisation, one as recently as Saturday last, and have established that their priority would be the extension of the harbour.  However, it is more practical to go ahead with the dredging which will be high on the priority list next year. However I must say that, at the end of last year, all of the money was not <Col N="1146" /> expended for this type of development. I regret that Burtonport had not been started then but hopefully it will be very high on the priority list next year.  The Deputy also referred to Bunbeg.  We realise its importance and will be pursuing the question of an extension of the harbour there.  The question of Port na Blath was also raised.  The cost in that case will some £106,000, a reasonable cost.  I hope we will be able to look at this before the end of the year in order to ascertain whether the necessary finance can be provided.  I also had discussions with the fishermen from Inver to which the Deputy also referred.  We have given them permission to undertake some dredging work there.  We are awaiting the costings of the widening of the pier and the heightening of the slipway.  Cladnagaoragh pier is under active consideration. The mere fact that we have some £32,000 already as a contribution from Donegal County Council means that there is an obligation there. However, we must take landings of fish into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more funds made available for harbours but, because of the heavy expenditure involved at Killybegs and Greencastle, this has not been possible. Of course an allocation of £1.7 million for fisheries harbours is equitable bearing in mind the financial position confronting the Government.  We hope that a number of the other projects such as those at Burtonport, Clogherhead, Kilmore Quay and a few others can be considered for next year.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the question of flags of convenience.  Deputies will be aware of the difficulties facing the Irish authorities arising from the activities of the so-called flags of convenience vessels.  The matter has been pursued by the Irish authorities in the courts and has also been referred to the European Court.  I want to assure the House that the Minister and I will not countenace a situation in which these flags of convenience vessels will be allowed to fish our waters when they make no real contribution to our economy.  We must aim to ensure that the maximum benefit from <Col N="1147" /> the fishing of Irish quotas will accrue to our economy.  Here I should like to compliment the naval service and my Department's protection services for their outstanding contribution to the fisheries protection effort down the years.</P>
    <P>There have also been incidents off the south west coast involving Irish trawlers and foreign fishing vessels.  The matter was discussed in this House on 27 May last on the Adjournment debate.  As the Minister indicated then we will not tolerate a situation in which Irish fishermen are prevented or hindered in any way from pursuing their legitimate fishing operations.  I will not hesitate to take the necessary appropriate steps to deal with this matter.  I have today arranged to view the situation at first hand with the aid of one of the air corps fisheries surveillance planes.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances this was not possible.  The Minister has asked me to view the situation early next week, weather permitting.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter of vital importance, the question of quality. We are in the process of preparing a fish marketing Bill and will take into consideration the question of hygiene and quality so that Ireland and fish quality will be synonymous eventually.  As far as Irish exports generally are concerned it is widely accepted at this stage that quality, more than price, is one of the main factors influencing foreign buyers to purchase from one producer rather than another.  The importance of fish product quality, our overall national reputation and the competitiveness of Irish products on the majority of international markets cannot be over-emphasised.  Already the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs Bill has been circulated.  That is important also if we are to ensure that our goods are transported in proper containers.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the huge potential of maritime resources from an amenity and recreational point of view.  This potential must be fully exploited.  Recreational facilities, such as marina facilities and so on have not been developed <Col N="1148" /> here as they have been in other countries. For example, last year in my constituency we hosted the European surfing championships which were most successful. We must strive toward greater usage of the potential off our coasts.  This can result in enticing tourists here.  We can provide more jobs in the recreational area.  I hope to have an opportunity in the future of developing at greater length those points in relation to quality and amenities.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who contributed to this useful and constructive Estimate debate here this evening.  I should like to thank Deputies Doyle, Michael Higgins, O'Donoghue, McGinley, Deasy and the two Ministers of State who came in within the very limited time available.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are full aware it constitutes a huge area.  There is nothing like a time limit to concentrate people's minds on real issues.  Might I give Deputies an assurance that if they need any information on any of the points raised here this evening I will be happy to provide it for them.  I do not have an opportunity here of dealing in detail with the many points raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins raised a matter that has been the cause of some concern, that is, the number of incidents involving fishing vessels in the Irish Sea and elsewhere in Europe in recent years in which submarines were involved.  I should say that this issue has been raised with the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations' specialised agency responsible for safety at sea.  We will be afforded an opportunity later in the year at their governing body to raise this issue when we will be hoping for some positive action to deal with this menace which has been a cause of concern and very nearly the cause of tragedies here on a number of occasions in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies for their constructive contributions. Unfortunately it appears that some of the other parties did not consider it sufficiently important to contribute.  It <Col N="1149" /> is my belief that people will recognise the importance of this whole area, the need to organise our marine economy, through the Department of the Marine, in a way that will maximise jobs and revenue for this State, realising the huge potential that we, as an island nation, have on our doorstep.  I hope this evening's debate will give further encouragement to all of us to press ahead with the urgent work of national development which needs to be undertaken in this vital area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her presence here tonight.  I appreciate that she has a very busy schedule and I do not intend to keep her too long.  I raised this matter in the Seanad early in 1986 and the project has come a long way since.</P>
      <P>Coolard national school was built in 1886.  It then comprised three classrooms, a store room and a toilet. The structure remained unaltered until 1982 apart from minor repairs which were carried out to the toilet in 1974.  In the seventies Coolard was one of the four schools proposed for relocation in a central building. However, the move was resisted locally and the proposal was abandoned.  In 1982 Tullamore national school, which is nearby, was amalgamated with Coolard national school.  The existing store room was converted into a classroom to facilitate the extra numbers from Tullamore. At present there are 99 pupils on the roll. The numbers have more or less remained constant in the past three years and are likely to increase in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1150" /> Because of local initiative the building has been reasonably well maintained. However, the toilet, which is on the outside of the building, is in a deplorable condition.  In 1958 it was condemned by the Department of Health and this is one of the reasons the school was not singled out for repair over the years.  I am sure it was intended that the school would be abandoned.</P>
    <P>The origins of the present proposals date back to 1983 when a deputation from the school met officials of the Department of Education and with the Minister of State at that time.  Following discussions between the Department and the school authorities it was agreed that the existing buildings should be remodelled and extended to provide three classrooms and a general purposes area together with the usual ancillary facilities such as a staff room, a store room and a library cum medical room.  A contribution was collected locally and was paid.  Some of the parents who paid the contribution at the time will not enjoy the benefit of their money because their children have since left the school. However, I am sure the project will have their goodwill.  It went to tender in 1986 and provision was made in the provisional estimates by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, in January 1987. I am sure this provision still stands.</P>

      <P>Ten thousand.  I understand there was a delay in signing the contract because of the problem in relation to the appointment of a clerk of works.  The school authorities were anxious that the Department should pay for this and that view prevailed in the end.  All that remains at present is for the contract to be signed as a contractor has been accepted by the Department and the school authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to try to arrange this as soon as possible.  The reason the school authorities are so anxious that work should <Col N="1151" /> start immediately is that they will be getting their holidays very soon.  A large amount of the work involved will be carried out to the structure of the existing school and, as the Minister realises, if this work carries over into September, it will lead to the disruption of classes and so on.  Now that the money is there and has only to be made available for the work, I would appreciate it if the Minister used her good offices to ensure that work starts as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter again, even at this late hour.  I am very glad to come into the House to give him an answer.  I was interested to hear him say that the school was built in 1886.  It coincides with one of the famous periods of Parnellite history in Ireland.  The school is 101 years old and obviously is due for a major refurbishment.  As the Deputy said, the extension proposed for Coolard includes the building of two new classrooms and the remodelling of two existing classrooms so as to provide one standard classroom and a general purposes area.  Certain ancillary accommodation is also to be provided, namely, a teachers' room, a library-medical room and various stores.  The Coolard project has a long history and I am sure nobody knows that better than Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about the deputation which visited the Department in 1983.  At that time they spoke about a new school building or a major remodelling of the existing building and finally the latter approach was agreed between the school authorities and my Department resulting in the engagement by the school of an architect in private practice so that he could submit detailed proposals and costings.  As the Deputy may know, my Department approved the invitation <Col N="1152" /> of tenders for the project in June 1986 and a complete tender documentation was forwarded to my Department in February 1987 on behalf of the school authorities. Examination of these tender recommendations has since been completed in my Department.</P>
    <P>In a Dáil question on 5 May or 6 May 1987 Deputy Deenihan asked when work would commence on the Coolard extension. I told him in a written reply that my Department have authorised the placing of the contract for the extension and would in the near future be writing formally to the chairman of the school's board of management in regard to the matter.  I said then that I was not in a position to state when the actual construction, the digging and the building, would commence.  I am glad to say we have the necessary arrangements in hand.  I am unable to say precisely when the formal letter will issue but it will issue shortly.  I assure the Deputy that when those arrangements have been finalised there will be no delay in advising the school authorities on the matter.  I am loath to say when exactly a letter will issue in case it does not issue on that date and people will be disappointed.  I am reasonably satisfied &mdash; I wish I could be as satisfied with the other 800 cases that are piled up on my desk &mdash; that within a very short period of time the steps I have outlined will be taken and the work can commence.  I will be in communication with the Deputy quite soon, I hope, to let him know when a letter will issue.</P>

      <P>Where a health board becomes aware that a child who has been abducted into the State in circumstances such as those described by the Deputy is residing in its area, the relevant authorities in the foreign State are notified so that they can institute High Court proceedings here for an order for the return of the child to the foreign jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>If, however, it is feared that there is an immediate and serious threat to the health or well-being of the child, the matter is dealt with in accordance with the standard procedures laid down in guidelines issued by my Department on the investigation and management of child abuse and neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures include the collection of information on the nature and extent of the risk to the child and the summonsing of a case conference of all relevant personnel (including, if necessary, <Col N="889" /> the Garda) to decide on the appropriate action to be taken.</P>
    <P>If it is considered necessary to do so, the health board may apply to the District Court for a warrant to remove the child to a place of safety or for a Fit Person Order committing the child to the care of the health board.</P>

These controls are identical to those in operation in all other member states of the EC and are implemented in pursuance of a number of EC directives relating to medicinal products for human or veterinary use.</P>
      <P>These controls are implemented mainly by means of product authorisation schemes which require that persons wishing to import and place medical or veterinary preparations on the market in this country must first obtain an authorisation in respect of each preparation.  A special licence is required also in respect of the importation of therapeutic substances such as vaccines.  Furthermore, persons importing medical or veterinary preparations from the US or from any other non-EC country must obtain a manufacturing licence from my Department in respect of such preparations.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by the International Organisation of Consumer Unions in this matter.  However, having regard to the controls in force in this country I do not consider that the Irish consumer should have any concerns in this regard.</P>

      <P>While mental handicap services have developed significantly in recent years, I am aware that the present level of service falls short of meeting all requirements, especially for adults.  The Eastern Health Board has carried out a review of mental handicap services in their area to identify any shortfall in service provision and to plan the future development of a fully comprehensive service.  It has been estimated by the health board that the full implementation of their proposals will have extra revenue implications which may be in the region of £5 million a year and capital implications of about <Col N="897" /> £8 million.  My Department is currently examining the Eastern Health Board's proposals.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department is carrying out a review of mental handicap services to set down guidelines for the development of the service.  This review is being carried out largely by way of consultation with agencies and persons involved in the provision of mental handicap services.  It is hoped that the review will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional places will depend both on the established need for such places and on the resources which can be made available for the further development of the mental handicap service.</P>

      <P>The report of the working party on the general medical services was published in August 1984.  The report recommended wide-ranging changes, most notably enhancement and development of the scope of general practice and modification in the method of remunerating general practitioners who participate in the GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>These recommendations were the subject of negotiations between the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation, between December 1984 and May 1986.  No agreement was reached on their implementation.  I have arranged for the re-opening of discussions which I hope will be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

    <P>The health board has recently decided to close the 12 bed Young Peoples Unit at St. Stephen's hospital, Sarsfield Court.

      <P>The terms &ldquo;established&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-established&rdquo; are not relevant to health board grades.  What the Deputy may have had in mind are pensionable and non-pensionable grades and it is to these grades that I refer in my reply.</P>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable staff of health boards are superannuated under the terms of the Local Government Superannuation Code.  As pensionable members of non-officer grades and non-pensionable persons employed by health boards in both officer and non-officer grades are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, the Redundancy Payments Acts would apply to them.  In addition, the superannuation provisions of the Local Government Superannuation Code relating to payment of preserved pension and lump sum at age 60, or immediate return of superannuation contributions, as appropriate, would also apply to pensionable non-officer grades.  The superannuation provisions governing the payment of gratuities would apply to non-pensionable persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Redundancy Payments Acts <Col N="900" /> do not apply to pensionable officer grades in local authorities, I would refer the Deputy to the superannuation provisions of the Local Government Superannuation Code which provide in certain circumstances for the immediate payment of pension and lump sum and for the grant of additions to service, where an officer is removed from office for a cause other than misconduct or unfitness or his office is abolished in accordance with the provisions of Local Government Acts and relevant regulations applicable to health board staff.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 30 of 19 June 1986 which outlined the steps which had been taken to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Drug Abuse at that time.  The following is an outline of the progress which has been made in this area since then:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau, in conjunction with the Department of Education, is in the process of developing a Drug Education Resource Pack for Post-Primary Schools.  They hope to pilot-test this new pack for schools during the current year and that it will be accepted as more specific drug-related material and be taught in the context of general health education in schools.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education, the Health Education Bureau and the Mater Dei Institute have organised a further summer course for teachers on Drug Education to be held in July of this year.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau also expects to launch a new pack &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers?&rdquo; this year, which is a programme of inter-disciplinary training for people working in local communities which seeks to encourage community-based responses to local drug problems.</P>
      <P>In relation to treatment services, agreement has been reached on the purchase of a property for a new walk-in out-patient drug treatment facility in the inner-city area of Dublin and the contract for these premises was signed recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, on the recommendation of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, published a <Col N="902" />&ldquo;Directory of Organisations concerned with Substance Abuse&rdquo; to assist substance abusers and those who come into contact with them, to explain what services are available and how contact may be made with them.  Copies of this directory were circulated to all of the agencies listed therein.</P>
    <P>My Department also circulated to all doctors and pharmacists in the country, a document outlining the recommendations from the Medical Council on the Prescribing of Controlled Drugs, for the purpose of assisting them in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of such drugs.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the drug problem it is very difficult to compile reliable statistics on the number of drug addicts. However, the statistics provided by the Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre in Jervis Street, and which are given in the table circulated in the Official Report, show that the numbers presenting for treatment of heroin, cannabis and amphetamine abuse have dropped in recent years.</P>
    <P>Accurate comprehensive information on drug-related deaths is difficult to obtain because drug-addicts suffer from various afflictions.  The Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre and the Garda Drug Squad compile an annual list of deaths of drug users known to them.  The number of drug deaths in Dublin established by this procedure were: nine persons in 1982, 12 persons in 1983, 13 persons in 1984, 12 persons in 1985 and nine persons in 1986.</P>
    <P>I believe that the treatment statistics, in particular, are encouraging.  However, because intravenous drug abuse poses such a serious problem in the context of the spread of the AIDS virus it is now more important than ever that we maintain the momentum in our efforts to reduce the incidence of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that this momentum and impetus will be maintained.</P>

      <P>In fact all of my instructions have been accompanied by guidelines and ameliorating conditions which have ensured that the contrary is the position.

      <P>I have enjoined on health agencies the need to provide for priority services, to protect services for the aged and the handicapped and in, for example, the making of allocations I have fully protected the organisations which cater for the mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>Synthetic opiates serve a very legitimate and necessary purpose in the treatment of certain medical conditions and most such products which are prescribed and dispensed are used in this context.</P>
      <P>However, there has been an increase in the incidence of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs by a small number of general practitioners, mostly based in the greater Dublin area.  We have now prohibited a number of these general medical practitioners from prescribing controlled drugs and the prescribing habits of a small number of others are being actively monitored. We will not hesitate to refer practitioners for investigation by committees of inquiry as provided for in the Misuse of Drugs Acts when the evidence warrants it.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that my Department recently issued a document, jointly drawn up by the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to all doctors and pharmacists in the country setting out recommendations on the prescribing and dispensing of controlled drugs.  These recommendations emphasised that practitioners should not treat patients from outside their practice areas for addiction problems by prescribing controlled drugs.  Practitioners are advised to refer such patients to recognised drug treatment centres.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these arrangements, I would like to assure the Deputy that the general availability of and controls applicable to synthetic opiates are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>To date I have not had a response from the IMO in this regard.  However I am still hopeful that the review will get underway in the near future.</P>

      <P>The provision of this site is being undertaken by the Eastern Health Board and I understand that its purchase is about to be finalised by the board.  The proposed health centre, to be provided by means of a scheme of adaptations to one of the existing buildings, will provide community nursing, community welfare, child development, social work, immunisation and health education services. The numbers employed in the centre will vary from day to day as some services will only be provided on a weekly or monthly basis.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the health centre will be ready to commence services.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he intends issuing a directive to the health boards advising them to discontinue the practice of holding meetings of local advisory committees, since the wasteful expenditure incurred in the holding of such meetings cannot be justified in the circumstances of stringent cut backs in the medical side of the health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under section 7 of the Health Act, 1970, <Col N="908" /> the Minister for Health is obliged to establish by regulations local committees in relation to the functional areas of each health board.  These committees were established under the Health (Local Committees) Regulations, 1972.  Under those regulations a local committee is empowered to hold such number of meetings as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.  Consequently, the Minister for Health is not empowered to make any changes in relation to the conduct of such committees by way of a directive.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House I am at present considering the question of the appropriate future organisation of health services including the structuring of the health boards.  Until this consideration is completed I do not intend to change the existing legislation in relation to local committees only. However, I would point out that in informing health boards of their allocations for 1987, I specifically indicated that substantial savings were to be achieved by a reduction in their travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>By virtue of Article 102 of the United Nations Charter and Regulations which have been made to give effect to the said article every treaty and every international agreement must be registered with the UN Secretariat.

    <P>In order to register a treaty a certified <Col N="913" /> copy of the text must be sent to the secretariat. The text of the treaty as published in the Treaty Series is used for this purpose, and accordingly those so published have been registered.  Some recent agreements are in the process of being published and will be registered in due course.  All the issues of the Treaty Series are in the Dáil Library, together with indices.</P>
    <P>In regard to many multinational international agreements, the international organisation concerned registers the agreement and the names of the countries parties to them.  In my Department a print-out from the computer in the treaty division of the United Nations setting out a complete list of all bilateral and multilateral treaties to which the State is a party, and registered whether by the State, the other contracting party or the international organisation, and published in the League of Nations Treaty Series and UN Treaty Series is available for inspection.

The occupation by Israel of these Arab territories, on the West Bank of the Jordan, <Col N="915" /> in the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, is contrary to the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force.  Ireland, in common with its partners in the Twelve, has repeatedly called for an end to the occupation of these territories in accordance with Resolutions 242 and 338 of the United Nations Security Council.

      <P>Ireland's position regarding the status of the territory formerly constituting the Spanish Sahara is based on <Col N="916" /> the principle that the people of that territory should have the right to self-determination. We have not, however, been in a position to recognise an independent state in the Western Sahara, or indeed any other arrangement affecting the future of the territory, before the people of the territory themselves have decided the issue of self-determination through a referendum.  Our efforts at the United Nations have been directed towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict and to this end we, together with our partners in the Twelve, have encouraged a consensus approach which, in our view, is most likely to assist progress towards a solution. We have also supported fully the efforts of the UN Secretary General to work out with the parties involved a basis for agreement on the holding of a referendum. These efforts are continuing and it is our earnest hope that they will prove fruitful.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to infer, as this question does, that there are precise criteria for deciding when the circumstances of any particular case are sufficiently exceptional to warrant disclosure of whether or not a person or organisation is the subject of a Garda investigation.  The practice has been for the Minister of the day to examine the circumstances of each case as it arises and to exercise his judgment in deciding whether disclosure is warranted.</P>

    <P>Depending on accommodation requirements, the TV room in the B Base as well as secure areas leading from the landings are used at Mountjoy (male) prison to provide non-cellular overnight accommodation.</P>
    <P>From time to time it is necessary at Mountjoy (male) prison to have offenders &mdash; generally new commitals &mdash; occupy bedding on the floor but precise records are not available relating to this practice.  However, it is resorted to the minimum extent possible and an indication of this can be gleaned from the fact that since about the start of last month there have been 571 bed-spaces at the prison as against the daily average population for the month of 570.  The Deputy will appreciate that one of the factors at play is the unpredictability of the number of committals to be accommodated and that, each day, the cases of new committals are reviewed with a view to providing accommodation in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, either in Mountjoy itself or in another institution.</P>

      <P>Pneumoconiosis arising from exposure to mineral dust in any occupation can be accepted as the basis for a claim for occupational injury benefit.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for a whole range of circumstances where persons have worked with particular substances which are known as probable sources of the disease.  These circumstances are specifically prescribed and where they arise there is a presumption of occupational origin for the disease.  These substances include not only coal and asbestos but an extensive range of other mineral dusts.  These cover many occupations and the majority of claims are dealt with under these provisions.</P>
      <P>While an automatic presumption of occupational origin does not arise in cases of exposure to mineral dust not specifically covered by the precribed list, each case is decided on its merits and accepted where it can be shown that the disease arose from an occupational origin.  The provisions for the scheme in relation to this disease are accordingly considered to be adequate.</P>

      <P>Section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as inserted by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides that, in assessing the means of a person who is one of a married couple for unemployment assistance purposes, the means of that person shall include the estimated value of their household which is derived from all income earned by the claimant's spouse.  This amount is calculated by reference to the net income of the spouse and a further deduction of £45 a week from the net income is also made, as an allowance for expenses incurred by the spouse in earning the income.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, her husband's net earnings are £8,151 per annum.  The deduction of £45 a week (£2,340 per annum) from this results in a means assessment of £5,811 per annum. As this assessment exceeds the statutory limit in her case of £4,784 per annum, her unemployment assistance has been disallowed.  She appealed against the disallowance on 5 June 1987 and her case will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of weekly disability benefit from June 1982 to 9 May 1987 when as a result of failure to attend for examination by a medical referee of the Department payment of benefit was disallowed for the statutory period of nine weeks from 11 May 1987 to 11 July 1987.  The person concerned submitted an explanation for his failure to attend which was received in the Department on 3 June 1987.  This explanation has been accepted as showing good cause for his non-attendance and payment of disability has been restored.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has applied for invalidity pension.  However, one of the conditions necessary for receipt of that pension is that an applicant must be regarded as being permanently incapable of work.  He has been examined on five separate occasions by medical referees of the Department in order to assess his incapacity but at no stage has he been found permanently incapable of work. He has now been referred for another medical examination.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed on receipt of the medical referee's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> There does not appear, from the records of this case, to have been any undue delay in dealing with the matter and in fact the person has been in continuous receipt of benefit from the commencement of his claim in 1982 to the disallowance of benefit from 11 May last. Benefit has now been restored and will continue to issue at regular weekly intervals on receipt of medical certificates which are required at monthly intervals.</P>

    <P>Each of the schemes established has been examined by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the context of its review of industrial performance and the resulting report <i>Review of Industrial Performance 1986</i> has been considered by the management committee on industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I feel happy that the schemes initiated on foot of the White Paper are currently Operating quite successfully.  The Office of Trade and Marketing at the Department of Industry and Commerce will, however, continue to review the operation of the schemes to ensure that they are the appropriate schemes for Irish exporters endeavouring to improve their performance in overseas markets.</P>

      <P>Córas Tráchtála;</P>
      <P>Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> In addition, two Irish exporters are represented on the committee.  The committee has met on nine occasions.</P>
    <P>A major marketing programme was launched by ICI following on from the work of the committee.  This involved the appointment by ICI of a full time marketing executive to encourage wider usage of the export credit insurance and finance schemes and greater co-ordination between ICI and the banks in the promotion and operation of the export credit finance schemes.</P>
    <P>As a result of a recommendation made by the committee, the requirement of insuring entire export turnover under comprehensive policies issued by ICI was modified to the extent that in certain circumstances an exporter may be allowed to exclude from his policy with ICI exports to one or more countries. This has led to a greater degree of flexibility in the provision of insurance cover to exporters.</P>

      <P>Two officers were given responsibility for this task in addition to their normal duties but one of them has since retired from the Department.  I propose to ask my officials to reactivate the matter and to re-establish liaison with the National Archives Office.</P>
      <P>Archival material in the remainder of my Department is minimal.  However, steps have been taken to ensure that any documents which may be required to be deposited in the National Archives are preserved.</P>

      <P>The question of the legislation which is needed in relation to psychiatric care is under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The provisions in existing legislation to safeguard against wrongful detention of patients include: (1) Patients have a right to have a letter forwarded to the Minister for Health, the President of the High Court, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, the Registrar of Wards of Court and certain other bodies.  The Minister or the President of the High Court may require the inspector to visit and examine a patient and furnish a report; (2) The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has a duty to give special attention to the condition of any patient where the propriety of the detention is doubtful or the patient or another person requests him to do so; (3) Any detained person may apply to the Minister for an order for the examination of that person by two doctors of his choice and on consideration of their report the Minister may direct that the person be discharged; (4) There is a statutory requirement that a patient who has recovered be discharged; (5) Penalties are imposed under existing legislation for the detention of a person otherwise than in accordance with the legal provisions.</P>
      <P>The detention of patients is a diminishing feature of psychiatric care and, in practice, the developments now in progress in the psychiatric service will afford patients much greater freedom and independence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 205, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In the years 1983 to 1986 all categories of persons were entitled to hospital inpatient services as a public patient in a public bed or out-patient services as a public patient, without charge, except that those in category III were liable for the fees of the consultants involved in their treatment.  Persons opting to be private patients were liable to charges irrespective of category.</P>
      <P>A person receiving casualty services in the years 1983-1986 was, therefore, not liable to charges unless (i) he/she was a private patient or (ii) he/she was in the category III eligibility group.  Some hospitals, however, in that period collected a voluntary contribution from particular groups of patients attending casualty.  These contributions applied mainly to attendances that should normally have been at a general practitioner's surgery and for which the person concerned would have been liable for the general practitioner's fee.</P>
      <P>The amounts collected from such voluntary contributions is not specifically available in my Department as they would have been included with other receipts by the hospitals concerned.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to determine accurately the numbers of deaths attributable to the misuse of drugs.  Such deaths may be registered as due to various direct causes but it is not posible to isolate the number of deaths in which drugs mis-use was a factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of causes of death are <Col N="981" /> regarded as smoking-related.  These include coronary heart disease; diseases of other blood vessels (including stroke); bronchitis and emphysema; cancer of the lung, bronchus and trachea; cancers of the mouth, larynx, oesophagus, pancreas, bladder and kidney and peptic ulcer.  The number of deaths attributable to all these causes amounted to approximately 17,321 in 1985.  While tobacco smoking is involved as a cause in many of these conditions other factors such as environmental conditions and old age are also involved.</P>
    <P>The number of people who died from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver in 1985 was 96.  This disease is associated with alcohol abuse which may also be a contributory factor in deaths registered as due to other causes.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on the prevention of harm caused by the misuse of drugs, smoking and alcohol from the Health vote in 1986, to the extent that such expenditure can be separately identified and quantified is as follows:</P>
      <P>Drug abuse: £200,000 to the Coolmine Therapeutic Community for both treatment and preventive services.  Coolmine is actively involved in prevention, particularly through education of parents; £160,000 by the Health Education Bureau for education about drug abuse; £30,000 to Trinity College for the Diploma Course in Addiction Studies.  This course provides specialised training for workers in direct contact with drug abusers and their families; $5,000 to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.  The principal aim of UNFDAC is to limit the supply of drugs to legitimate requirements by putting and end to illegal or uncontrolled production, processing and manufacture, making use of enforcement, crop substitution and other methods as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> The work of the Drug Unit in Jervis Street includes an educational and preventive element.  It is not possible to quantify the amount of expenditure involved as it is included in the overall budget of the unit.</P>
    <P>Smoking: £447,000 by the Health Education Bureau on measures to combat smoking.</P>
    <P>Alcohol: £71,000 to the Irish National Council on Alcoholism for educative and preventive work on alcohol abuse; £43,000 by the Health Education Bureau on prevention of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>At present treatment services for persons with alcohol-related problems are mainly based in psychiatric hospitals.  The services are run by alcoholism counsellors who are also involved in educational and preventive work in the locality.  It is not possible to quantify the cost of the preventive aspect of the services.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau and the health boards provide health education services which are part of the campaign to prevent substance abuse but which cannot be separately costed.  These services include grants to voluntary bodies, the employment of health education officers, drug addiction counsellors and the library and research services of the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    <P>Important preventive work to combat substance abuse has also been funded from the votes of the Ministers for Education, Social Welfare, Labour, Justice and by the activities of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Formal adult education is that for which students are enrolled; by contrast non-formal adult education is that for which none of the learners is enrolled or registered.  Within these constraints the following are the most recent figures available.  In the school year 1984-85, 218 vocational schools and 38 community/comprehensive schools provided courses in adult education for 77,304 and 36,835 participants, respectively.  The data excludes students following part time courses such as apprenticeships and professional/technical courses.  The cost of adult education courses is not readily available in respect of individual schools; but adult education courses, apart from literacy and community education are, in the main, expected to be self financing.
