      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a new <Col N="674" /> Department of the Marine is evidence of this Government's commitment to a policy of development of all aspects of our marine resources.  The questions tabled by the two Deputies raise issues of considerable complexity which will require very careful consideration.  These issues are being examined.  I expect that it will be possible to indicate the outcome of this examination to the House within a reasonable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor said there were legal and other constraints preventing him from granting justice to the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  Has the present Minister examined that position?  Can he tell us whether there is some way in which those legal and other constraints can be overcome?  Could he also inform us what were those legal and other constraints?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal and other constraints problem will be dealt with in the examination to which I referred in my reply.  All aspects of the problem, with regard to the workers and the shipping company to replace Irish Shipping Limited are under consideration.  As I have said, we will be reporting on them to the House within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that he continues to have the concern he expressed when in Opposition and that he intends to overcome these legal and other constraints, if necessary, by way of legislation in order to grant justice to the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister is investigating the whole position in particular with regard to Question No. 4.  Could he advise us whether the Committee on Strategic Shipping <Col N="675" /> Requirements, established by the previous Government and which were due to report in 1985, have reported?  If they have, would he say whether he would be in a position to make known to us their conclusions at the earliest possible date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that the committee did report, that certain recommendations have already been revealed to the House and elsewhere, and that their report will form a strong plank in our study of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the number of Private Notice questions, Private Members' motions and questions on the Adjournment which the Minister when in Opposition put before the House, is he now telling us that he has no policy at this stage to help the people about whom he was so concerned when in Opposition? Is he saying he had no idea that the letter of redundancy which he was proposing at the time was not available then but that this will now be put somewhere into the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy recognises the deep interest I showed and I can assure the House that this interest continues.  I know that the Deputy, having been concerned with a redundancy payment in his own constituency, has a particular interest in the reply to that question.  I assure the Deputy that the Government are examining the situation along the lines indicated by me in the official answer and they will come to the House with their conclusions in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the report in respect of the committee on strategic shipping requirements has not in its entirety been made available to the House.  Will the Minister undertake to release it for the consideration of Deputies at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>From the other side of the House I made some efforts to get a copy of that report.  As I have already indicated, it will come up for study now by us in the context of the two questions that are down on the Order Paper and we will report to the House in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that the position of the Irish Shipping workers has already been considered at length both in his Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Labour and that he will make every effort to live up to the promises he made in Opposition to look after the workers of Irish Shipping?  Will the Minister also assure the House that the extensive shipping package announced by the previous Government some months ago will be continued by the Government so as to ensure the resurgence of the Irish fleet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister is quite right in saying that in his former Department and in the Department of Labour the subject matter of the question attracted a great deal of attention and study.  The proposals put forward in January 1987 are ones I find very interesting and I will take them fully into consideration in developing and announcing new policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's final reply does not mean the will give the same consideration as the preovious Minister to the Irish Shipping workers.  Is the Minister now prepared to tell us about the legal and other constraints which prevent justice being granted to the Irish Shipping workers? As the Minister will recall, the previous Minister refused to give us this information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer subvention for CIE is being settled in the context of the decisions in relation to the 1987 budget.  The allocations to the individual CIE subsidiaries will be a matter for settlement by the board in the light of the global subvention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has correctly stated that I am not in a position to give a breakdown, the reason being that in the normal Book of Estimates when the global subvention is given a breakdown of where the subvention applies is also given.  In the provisional 1987 Estimates the global figure only is given.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I have no policy with regard to the privatising of Dublin city bus services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not considering it as of now.  I am considering the possibility of developing the Dublin city bus services to the extent that they should be viable services making a profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been listening to the first part of my reply it would indicate the difficulty as of now. As I stated in my reply, the breakdown has not been given in the Book of Estimates. We are very near the moment of truth with regard to all those matters. Last year £18 million was mentioned in the detailed Book of Estimates for 1986. No such breakdown has been given this year, but no doubt, today being budget day, these figures will be available.</P>

    <P>Proposals submitted by Aer Lingus to my Department concerning the company's fleet replacement programme and its financing are currently under examination by an interdepartmental review group.  As soon as the review group complete their work a submission will be <Col N="681" /> made to the Government in the matter.

      <P>I take it that the review group have not as yet reported to the Minister.  Do the Minister and the Government consider that the figure of £1,000 million as the cost of replacement of the fleet, as was suggested in the media, is a greatly inflated figure and that the cost to Aer Lingus would be of the order of one fifth of that sum in the medium term?</P>

    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications his view on the safety standards of car ferries operating out of Irish ports; if any changes are planned for safety procedures following the capsizing of the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i>; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there are four passenger car ferries registered under the Irish flag, namely, <i>Leinster</i> and <i>Connacht</i> operated by B &amp; I Line, <i>St. Killian II</i> and <i>St. Patrick II</i> operated by Irish Continental Line.  The four vessels fully comply with the standards laid down by the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, which came into force in May 1980. They are fitted with a number of watertight bulkheads up to car deck or freeboard deck level, these bulkheads being so spaced that in case of flooding of any two adjacent watertight compartments the vessel will stay afloat with the car deck above sea level and in addition will still retain positive stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement on the four Irish registered vessels is different from that of the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> in that <Col N="685" /> the bow ramp for loading vehicles serves as a watertight inner door and must be closed before the outer door.  The outerdoor or visor is part of the bow of the ship and as such is in full view of the master while open and if left open could be an obstruction to his line of sight while navigating.  All doors are required to be closed and secured before a vessel proceeds to sea.  Apart from bridge indication that the doors are closed, there is also a communication procedure between the officer closing the door and the master on the bridge.</P>
    <P>The operation and watertightness of the doors are checked out very thoroughly by my Department's surveyors on an annual basis and the owners concerned are obliged to report to my Department immediately any defects affecting the efficiency of the closing arrangements.  Since the recent casualty to the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> the surveyors have been carrying out special inspections of the door closing arrangements and procedure on Irish Flag vessels. This has already been done in the case of three vessels, and the fourth vessel, <i>St. Patrick II</i>, which is currently withdrawn from service, will be checked out before returning to service.</P>
    <P>Finally, I may add that my Department's survey staff have always in the past made, and will continue to make, owners, masters, etc., acutely aware of the importance of maintaining watertight integrity and, in this regard, from a structural point of view, have always insisted that Irish flag vessels are fitted with an extra locking device or &ldquo;Atlantic Lock&rdquo; on the bow visor or door.  The Brittany Ferries Service to and from Cork has recently recommenced and my Department's surveyors will be inspecting the vessel shortly.  The Polish car ferry chartered by Cork-Swansea Ferries Limited will also be inspected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very detailed reply but my original question related to ferries operating out of Irish ports.  To that extent I would like <Col N="686" /> to ask the Minister whether his investigations and survey cover the operations of Sealink ferries out of Irish ports? Recently, we were shown in the national media a photograph of one of those ferries at sea clearly indicating that the nose bow was still open.  Does the Minister's survey cover those boats?  If any accident occurs involving them we will have the responsibility once they are in Irish waters.  Do the inspectors of the Department check, by travelling on a regular basis, on the ferries operating out of Irish ports for the purposes of an ongoing review of the safety standards involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his appreciation of the reply.  I want to tell him that the very first thing I did on becoming Minister was to idicate that I wanted a report immediately on the Irish flag ferries.  With regard to what the Deputy has raised about Sealink, as he knows, Sealink are privately owned and do not own an Irish flagged ferry.  I will call the attention of my technical officers to the point made by the Deputy in his supplementary question.  I have travelled on all the Irish flag ferries.  Three or four members of my family have worked on them at various times.  I am very glad to have had the assurance that our own ferries are being so carefully and punctiliously looked after from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard has the Minister any intention of making it a criminal offence for a ferry to depart dock in this jurisdiction without having its doors properly sealed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the relevant officer of my Department to look at the possibility of preparing legislation to meet other eventualities.  I will take cognisance of what the Deputy has said in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, will the Minister tell us the safety drills which are enforced on our ferries with regard to advising passengers when they board?  As we are all aware, before aeroplanes take <Col N="687" /> off there is always a safety drill.  Are similar type drills in operation on our ferries?  If not, has the Minister any proposals to introduce that type of information for passengers on boarding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The ferry companies do stress the safety requirements and the course of action which should be taken in the event of any kind of emergency. The ferry company concerned will be asked to ensure that they are right up-to-date in so far as the current regulations are concerned.  My notes indicate that my Department have covered all eventualities such as the Zeebrugge disaster but I hope we will never experience such a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

I am awaiting the outcome of those negotiations.</P>
      <P>Ryanair applications for approval to operate on the Dublin-Manchester, Amsterdam and Paris routes, were refused last October on the grounds that market conditions did not warrant the introduction of an additional carrier on those routes.</P>

      <P>I am in support of that and I want to tell the House that as my brief now covers both transport and tourism I will be committed to whatever action I can take in this Department to make fares as low as possible because I want as many tourists as possible into the country this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is great news. Will the Minister now tell us about the other routes mentioned in the question &mdash; Dublin-Manchester, Dublin-Amsterdam and Dublin-Paris?  I welcome his agreement with the necessity to reduce fares as much as possible but will he not agree that it is ridiculous, for example, that the return fare from Dublin to Liverpool or to Manchester is substantially higher than the return fare from Dublin to London even though London is much further away from Dublin than either Liverpool or Manchester?  Since the advent of competition is the only factor which has in recent times caused a reduction in fares will the Minister immediately allow competition on those other routes so that fares will be reduced by the substantial <Col N="690" /> amount by which they were reduced on the London route?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to the second paragraph of my reply. Applications were refused last October on the grounds that market conditions did not warrant the introduction of an additional carrier on these routes.  I will be looking at this to see if market conditions now warrant the introduction of an additional carrier on these routes.  I should like to take the opportunity of telling the House that I spent two hard days helping a past pupil of mine, the present Commissioner, Peter Sutherland, working in the Council of Ministers of Transport in Brussels on the question of a more liberal air transport policy and the reduction of fares, PEX and APEX. We discussed a general liberalising, particularly of fifth freedom rights, in the area of our transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is desirable that in this matter he should learn from his former pupil on the question of air fares rather than <i>vice versa</i>?  Does the Minister not realise that the market between Dublin and Paris would be a very different one if somebody was allowed to provide a return fare of £200 as opposed to the present market where the unrestricted fare is in excess of £400?  Will the Minister take steps to create a new market to bring many additional people into the country by allowing extra carriers on these routes and creating competition?</P>

Where he deems it not possible to license additional carriers will the Minister consider introducing a fare regime on a fare per mile basis similar to that on routes where there is competition?</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department for the extension of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit system to any new areas in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for such an extension would have to be considered in the first instance by the Dublin Transport Authority in the light of the transport requirements of the Dublin area as a whole.</P>
      <P>Given the fact of a dispersed residential development prevalent in the Dublin area and the very high costs that rail-based options involve, all possible options &mdash; including bus-based options &mdash; will fall to be considered by the Authority. In November last the Authority were requested to give priority to the question of public transport services to be provided for the developing areas of the suburbs and whether such services should be provided by rail, road or busway.</P>

We now have the Howth-Bray system upon which we can make judgments.  The Dublin Transport Authority will be able to study the system in action and this will be very helpful to them.

The options for rapid rail transport are quickly closing off and it does not really need further study for definite decisions to be taken to provide a commuter rail service to the satellite towns.

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to our share of those Americans visiting Europe, including Ireland as part of their itinerary, and known in the trade as &ldquo;back-tracking&rdquo; business.  The need to ensure that Ireland is included in the itineraries of multi-destination tourists was recognised by the Government in our pre-election document &mdash;<i>Putting Growth Back Into Tourism</i>&mdash; which outlined our objectives and strategies for developing the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Because of the new competitive air sea fares from Britain, which is the major source of our back-track trade, Ireland has increased its share over the last two years of US traffic to Europe, reversing a decline earlier in the decade, With a view to maintaining and increasing this trend, Bord Fáilte have been pursuing a strategy of organising promotional workshops in areas like Detroit, San José and Phoenix.  These are major international centres served by the main American carriers operating to Ireland and should provide a source for developing and attracting new business outside of the ethnic sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy <Col N="700" /> raised this matter because a perusal of the Book of Estimates published in January indicates that the outturn in the Book for 1986 covers only ten months of 1986. January and February, which were covered by Deputy Bruton's ministry, were excluded from the outturn and the ten months for which the former Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, was responsible were included.  Indeed, the period of ten months was in itself a cut and cuts were indicated during that time also.  The substance of the Deputy's question was if we intended to concentrate our expenditure on promotional activities and the answer is yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if, in light of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster, which was caused by the inability of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> to cope with excessively bad weather, he will introduce legislation to strengthen the powers of port authorities <Col N="701" /> and/or his powers in relation to the movement of ships in such bad conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I have already made arrangements for a review of domestic legislation covering marine safety and pollution in the light of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> casualty and any legislative changes that are considered necessary in the light of this review will be introduced as soon as possible.  The insurers for the owners of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> have stated that they will meet their legal liabilities arising out of the incident.  Legal action will be taken, if necessary, to enforce these liabilities.</P>
      <P>Removal of the wreck is primarily a matter for the owners.  I am selecting a marine consultancy firm which will, subject to my approval, make arrangements for the safe removal and disposal of all oil remaining on the wreck.</P>
      <P>Exhaustive inquiries have been made by the Department of the Environment and my own Department regarding the reports of the presence of TBT paint on board the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  On the basis of information received to date, I am satisfied there is no TBT paint on board the vessel.</P>
      <P>I understand that Cork County Council have begun their final clean-up of beaches and other contaminated areas in west Cork and are aiming to have the clean-up finished by the Easter weekend.  Bord Fáilte have continued to promote west Cork in the various markets as an attractive holiday destination.  Within their ongoing publicity programme the board will ensure that the unspoilt, clean and beautiful image of west Cork is maintained. Strong advance bookings on the new Cork-Swansea ferry service indicate good prospects for the region in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this legislation incorporate the ratification of the Convention for Intervention on the High Seas in the case of oil pollution casualties which would give the Government greater power of action in, for example, <Col N="702" /> the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>?  Will it also include the ratification of the 1969 convention on civil liability and the 1971 convention for the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage?  Will the Minister comment on the statement by the Taoiseach that the owners of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> will be pursued relentlessly by him under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894?  If so, is he aware that the maximum compensation which would be paid under that Act is £8 per tone or £750,000?  The estimated damage to our coastline and the environment amounts to about £80 million according to a recent article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> which seems a more realistic figure than the miserly sum of £750,000 which may be gained under the 1894 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Kavanagh that the conventions to which he referred will be studied by the people preparing the legislation.  I should also like to endorse what the Taoiseach said in regard to making those responsible pay.  Of course they may pay for the damage caused but, if necessary, we shall pursue the matter through the courts.  The insurance company, the P and I, are on record as saying they would be responsible for what happened.  Compensation may not necessarily be under the 1894 Act or any subsequent Acts.  As the Deputy knows, where insurance is concerned the matter does not necessarily have to come before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not answering my question.  Can he say under which Acts he is pursuing?  It would appear to me that the type of money which would relate to the damage that has been caused would not be achieved under the Act I have mentined, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977 and that the only Act under which he should or could pursue is the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 which would allow Cork County Council far greater latitude in achieving a higher amount of compensation.</P>

We were more than impressed by Cork County Council's actions in this area, by the Cork County Manager, Mr. Dowd, and by their engineer in charge of clearing the pollution, Mr. Mullins.  That local authority in this instance deserve great credit.</P>
      <P>The legal advisers of the Government will use whatever Statute is available to them if the matter comes to law and if the insurance company do not pay before it comes to law to recover the money from the company.  This will include the one mentioned as being utilised by Cork County Council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court has been in almost constant session since 4 p.m. yesterday in an attempt to resolve this dispute.  The court has just issued proposals to the parties involved for the settlement of the dispute.  The parties and my Department and myself will now consider these proposals as a matter of urgency.  I appreciate that a difficult situation exists on the <Col N="705" /> ground in many hospitals and at this stage I would appeal to the radiographers and the other health professionals involved to ensure that a minimum and, in keeping with the traditions of the health services, an effective emergency service is provided and that no patient's life will be put in danger.  I would, therefore, ask that the pickets be lifted pending consideration of the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that apart from emergency treatment for patients suffering from fractures, patients suffering from cancer or who are in need of heart operations and transplants are affected by the dispute, does the Minister not think that the situation is entirely unacceptable?  While we all hope for and expect a speedy outcome of the problem, will he undertake to review the procedures, and the legislation if necessary, governing these disputes with a view to ensuring that this sort of situation does not occur again?  It is entirely unacceptable that lives be put at risk in this fashion.</P>

      <P>It is time to give a new sense of direction to the economy and to harness more effectively the resources that are available to us.  People are dispirited because the economy has been on a downward path.  There have been too many failures, too many missed opportunities and a prevailing lack of confidence in our ability to achieve progress.</P>
      <P>The first priority of this Government on coming into office has been to prepare a budget for 1987.  Despite the short time available, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of budget options.  It is evident that conditions are extremely difficult and that there is no room at all for soft options.  On the contrary, it is in all our interests that the Government follow a very strict discipline.  There can be no concessions to interest groups and all sections of the community will have to bear some of the burden.  Today's budget has been framed on the fundamental principles that:</P>
      <P>&mdash;public finance targets must be consistent with good management of the economy,</P>
      <P>&mdash;there must be a special focus on productive economic activity and on employment, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;borrowing and the cost of servicing <Col N="778" /> the national debt must be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that firm action and clear signals as to the direction of policy are now necessary if interest rates are to be reduced and confidence restored.  The objective, therefore, has been to reduce the budget deficit and the borrowing requirement below the targets proposed earlier.</P>
    <P>For 1987, it is proposed to follow generally the spending profiles in the Abridged Estimates Volume and the Summary Public Capital Programme, as already published, subject to a wide range of adjustments under individual headings.  The taxation proposals announced by the previous Government will largely be implemented and further taxation measures, in line with the policies in the Programme for National Recovery, are being introduced.</P>
    <P>Real opportunities exist to speed up the development of the economy on a properly balanced basis and to exploit new employment possibilities.  Opportunities for growth have already been identified and it will now be the responsibility of Government to provide the right guidance and the right support facilities for the new initiatives that must be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The performance of the economy has been disappointing over a long period. The level of national output in 1986 was lower than in 1980.  The economy has thus shown no growth at a time when other economies have been experiencing steady, if unspectacular, growth. Employment levels have fallen significantly and unemployment is on an unprecedented scale.  Investment has been declining steadily and last year there was no growth in exports.  There have been some positive aspects, such as a substantial improvement in the balance of payments, a reduction in inflation and containment in annual Exchequer borrowing. The challenge to this Government is to make the decisive breakthrough and to initiate economic <Col N="779" /> recovery after several years of decline.</P>
    <P>There are good prospects that the international economic environment will remain favourable over the next few years.  Growth in world trade could be reasonably buoyant and, even with some recovery in oil prices, inflation is expected to remain low in most industrialised economies.  The Government are confident that, in these conditions, the potential exists for a significant and sustained improvement in our economic performance.  This improvement will not happen, however, without radical and courageous policies and significant changes in attitudes and patterns of behaviour throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>The strategy and principles outlined by the National Economic and Social Council in their report entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo; will form the basis for the Government's general approach.  It is well to note what the council have to say about our difficulties and the solutions.  The council warn that, if existing policies are not changed, unemployment will be significantly higher in 1990 than it is now.  Prospects for economic growth through the policies followed up to now are not good.  The existing state of the public finances acts as a powerful brake on economic growth and it is imperative that the level of debt be stabilised as a prelude to reducing it. The council set out a range of policies for increasing the productive capacity and efficiency of the economy to create more jobs.  They also identify the present tax system as a major source of economic inefficiency and outline tax reform leading to a more effective and equitable system.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to set the economy on to a higher and sustainable growth path over the medium term.  This will require the restoration of confidence, better management of the public finances, the active pursuit of development opportunities and maintaining stability of the exchange rate within the European Monetary System. It will also require sacrifice broadly spread across all groups in society, while <Col N="780" /> protecting those most in need.  A disciplined economy where sectional interests do not prevail to the detriment of the common good is essential to a strong and balanced recovery.  Today's budget is a first step, but nevertheless a critically important step, along that road and is a clear earnest of the Government's determination to see the task of national recovery brought to fruition over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Some of our difficulties, especially those related to the high level of interest rates, follow from the unidentified outflow of funds in recent years.  While we cannot be completely sure as yet about the nature of such outflows, we must reverse the trend without further delay. We must do more to encourage nonresidents, and especially expatriates, to invest in the Irish economy.  They will do this only if they have sufficient confidence in the economy and feel that their investment is secure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The success of any strategy for growth and higher employment will depend critically on developments on the incomes front.  Pay increases in excess of what employers can really afford and of the economy's capacity to bear have contributed greatly to our economic difficulties &mdash; the dismal growth performance, the decline in investment, heavy job losses and inadequate job creation.  Over the past decade, earnings in Irish industry rose 50 per cent faster than in the countries with which we trade. This trend must be reversed if we are to achieve sustained economic growth on foot of expansion of the trading sectors. There should now be a better understanding of the need for moderation in regard to pay.  Pay increases, if warranted at all, must be below the rate of inflation and every means of containing costs must be fully explored.  This is the only way to improve competitiveness, increase exports and improve job opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>European Community</i>
    </P>
    <P>Developments in the European Community <Col N="781" /> will be of critical importance for us in the next few years.  In several areas, and in particular in agriculture, regional and social policy and taxation, major changes are envisaged which will have a very big impact on our whole economic well-being.  It is the Government's wish to be fully supportive of developments which help to bind the Community into a more cohesive economic and social unit.  At the same time, we expect that there will be full and proper recognition of our particular difficulties and an acknowledgement that, without special arrangements, we cannot fulfil the role we wish to play in the development of European economic and social unity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The annual cost of servicing the national debt is a severe burden on the economy as a whole and on the individual taxpayer.  The stage has now been reached where virtually all the receipts from PAYE are absorbed in servicing debt.  It is not sufficient that we contain the rise in debt which generates such a cost; we must at the same time be fully satisfied that the large portfolio is managed with the utmost efficiency so as to keep service costs to a minimum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Policy for 1987 and Future Years</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government recognise the essential importance of reducing dependence on borrowing, which means that public expenditure must be curtailed.  The commitment was made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that public expenditure will be contained in real terms at or below the 1986 expenditure levels measured as a percentage of GNP and that the budget deficit will be reduced. The alternative is a substantial increase in taxation which is just not acceptable.</P>
    <P>This is the basis for budgetary policies in this and future years.  It requires continuing curtailment of public expenditure which will have a widespread impact on the provision of public services.  It is the Government's intention that this impact should be spread across the full range of public services as far as is reasonably <Col N="782" /> possible, taking economic and social considerations into account.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OPENING BUDGET POSITION</P>
    <P>The opening deficit position, based on the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, was £1,343 million, after allowing for the deduction of departmental balances. From this must be deducted £48.5 million, the expected receipt from excise duty increases already implemented, giving an actual position of £1,294.5 million. The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement on this basis is £2,028.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer receipts and issues for the first quarter of this year will be published tomorrow.  The figures overall are as expected.  While the deficit for this quarter will be higher than in previous years, this reflects the pattern of spending and collection of revenue at this stage and does not indicate any deterioration in the underlying position.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>We simply cannot afford our present level of public services.  For as long as public expenditure and, in consequence, taxation and borrowings remain at their present levels, productive activity in the economy will be stifled and we will not achieve the recovery in output and employment that this Government are determined to bring about.</P>
    <P>In the three weeks since taking office, the Government have conducted as searching an examination as possible of all departmental spending programmes, looking closely at the justification for the expenditures and the scope for reductions.  The message I have to deliver is unpalatable but it is critical to the revival of our economic prospects.  We cannot be content to announce our intention to curtail spending while at the same time deferring action.  We have to act now.  Some schemes must be terminated, others must be reduced in scope and all public services must become more cost-effective. I am only too well aware of the number of lobbies for increased spending <Col N="783" /> and how vigorously they will contest any curtailment of State services.  But the national interest must take precedence over sectoral concerns.</P>
    <P>The Estimates Volume published on 20 January by the previous Government proposed that non-capital supply services this year should amount to £6,013 million. A further £14.5 million was added to this figure in the budget proposals of 20 January, making a total of £6,027.5 million.  This is too high.  The Government have decided on substantial further reductions in departmental estimates amounting to over £63 million gross. When allowance is made for modifications decided upon by the new Government, the net saving amounts to over £35 million.</P>
    <P>I am publishing today a separate document showing revisions to the previous Estimates Volume and Capital Programme which sets out the departmental allocations, current and capital, decided upon by this Government.  The main decisions and assumptions underpinning these estimates are set out in the Principal Features of the Budget.  Copies will be made available to all Deputies.  I will also present as soon as possible after the budget a revised Estimates Volume incorporating these changes.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the more significant features of the revised Estimates Volume.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>We have studied closely the proposals of the previous Government for reducing spending on social welfare and we consider that some of them would bear too harshly on those who have no option but to look to the State for income support. We have decided to modify them in the following respects.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent increase in social welfare allowances will be brought forward from November to July.  In this way we are ensuring that those who have to rely on welfare payments will not fall behind.</P>
    <P>We will not shorten the duration of entitlement for unemployment benefit from 15 to 12 months because the saving <Col N="784" /> involved would have been achieved at the expense of one of the most vulnerable and deprived sectors of our community &mdash; the longer term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend the waiting days for disability benefit from three to six and the imposition of waiting days on transfer to disability benefit from maternity allowance will not be implemented.</P>
    <P>For extended entitlement to disability benefit, the required number of paid contributions will be increased from 156 to 208, not to 260 as was proposed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>We intend to proceed with the proposals of the previous Government to reduce pay-related benefit for new applicants from rates of 25 and 20 per cent down to a new uniform rate of 12 per cent and to increase the contribution test for disability, unemployment and maternity benefits from 26 to 39 contributions.</P>
    <P>The PRSI ceiling is being increased to £15,500 with effect from 6 April.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to introduce a living alone allowance for the over-45s on long term unemployment assistance.  This proposal cannot possibly be given priority in present circumstances.  The problems of those on long term unemployment assistance have already been recognised by giving them specially increased rates of payment.</P>
    <P>The extension of treatment benefits to the spouses of qualified insured persons will take place in October.  This is necessary to give time for the new administrative arrangements to be put in place. Finally, the increase in the rate of payment under the family income supplement scheme from 33? per cent to 50 per cent will be paid with effect from July.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Job-Search Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided to initiate a national job-search programme commencing tomorrow.  The objective is to interview 150,000 unemployed persons by the end of the year and to offer them a minimum of 40,000 Manpower scheme opportunities.  The programme will also <Col N="785" /> provide job-search courses for an additional 12,000 people.  The agencies involved are being geared up for the campaign. The additional resources necessary to carry out the nation-wide job-search process will be made available by redeployment of staff to the Department of Social Welfare from other areas in the civil service and by the re-allocation of resources within the Department of Labour and their Manpower offices.  With adequate resources and a determined effort that will be sustained, we are confident that the programme will both enhance the prospects of those genuinely seeking employment and ensure that the live register more accurately reflects conditions in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The effect of the measures decided upon by the Government is to increase the cost of social welfare services from £1,549 million in 1986 to £1,592 million, or £6.5 million above that fixed by the previous Government.  This will be more than offset by further reductions in other public spending programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>A total of £1,111 million is being provided from the Exchequer for non-capital expenditure on the health services in 1987, as against the 1986 outturn of £1,115 million.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial provision given the severity of the budgetary problem and the manner in which it is to be used reflects the Government's determination that, in particular, economies will not be achieved at the expense of the less welloff.</P>
    <P>We have decided to reverse the previous Government's proposal to impose prescription charges on medical card holders and their proposal to abolish the dispensing doctors scheme.</P>
    <P>The charge of £10 for hospital outpatient treatment, as announced on 20 January, is being retained and a daily charge of £10 for public ward maintenance will be introduced.  In addition to generating income the charges should have the effect of reducing unnecessary recourse to hospitals.  Medical card holders will, of course, be exempt from these <Col N="786" /> charges.  The charges will be brought into effect to coincide with the introduction of VHI schemes to cover those who wish to take out insurance cover.</P>
    <P>As already decided, consultants will be required to contribute to the cost of public facilities used by them for private practice.</P>
    <P>Legislation necessary to allow outpatient charges to be made will be introduced tomorrow.  Other necessary changes will be made by way of regulations or administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>Overall, every effort must be made throughout the health services to achieve savings by enhanced efficiency in the delivery of services and in the purchases of supplies in order to ensure that essential services are maintained while respecting the allocations decided.  Substantial savings will also be made by a reduction in recruitment and pay &ldquo;extras&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As decided on 20 January, the Health contribution income ceiling will be raised to £15,000 from 6 April.  At the same time, the rate of contribution will be increased from one per cent to one and one-quarter per cent to yield about £11 million extra in 1987.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EDUCATION</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the net non-capital provision for Education will be £1,051 million which, when account is taken of increased resources, involves an £11 million reduction on allocations decided by the previous Government. Expenditure on Education will be £106 million above the 1986 outturn which is an increase of 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government have reversed the decision of the previous Government to bring career guidance teachers within the &ldquo;quota&rdquo; in second-level schools because of the importance of career guidance in current economic conditions.  We have, however, decided on a substantial number of steps that will secure savings over all levels of education.  None of these will restrict access to education, or remove any essential part of the educational system.  The main steps are set <Col N="787" /> out in the document, Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer cash that will be available to educational institutions will be reduced. The Government recognise that many of these institutions are already operating under tight financial constraints, but further economies are unavoidable.  I would emphasise that reductions in Exchequer aid must be accompanied by real economies; the Government will not accept that the outcome of the decisions which they have taken in the education area should be increased borrowing by educational institutions, no more than they will be in other areas, such as health or local government.</P>
    <P>Other policy measures will also be taken. For instance, the Government have decided to defer the computerisation of the certificate examinations. They have also decided not to implement the previous Government's youth policy pending re-examination of the youth area.  In the light of that re-examination the Government would hope to make such further provision as financial circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Employment Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government intend to increase participation in the social employment scheme by 1,500 in the current year to provide additional opportunities for unemployed workers to regain a foothold in the labour market.  The cost of this measure will be offset partially by a reduction in the allowances payable to single participants, from the present £70 per week to £60 per week for new recruits to the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>In determining the allocation for agriculture for 1987, the Government have decided, as in other sectors, that priorities must be established in order that essential services are maintained. Exchequer support for certain schemes such as the livestock improvement programme which, although desirable, are <Col N="788" /> not of paramount importance, is being scaled down.</P>
    <P>Beneficiaries will be expected to contribute towards the cost of some of the essential services.  Some new charges are being introduced, while other existing charges are being increased.  The most significant increase in charges is that in the disease levy where, in line with the previous Government's approach, higher rates of levy are being introduced to finance an increased level of BTE testing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>Public Service pay is obviously a key element of this budget.  The previous Government's Estimates, framed on the basis of no further general increase after the expiry of the current public service Pay Agreements on 30 June next, put the Exchequer Pay and Pensions bill in 1987 at £2,840 million.  The Government are seriously concerned at the size of this bill and the problem of financing it in present circumstances.  There are two major factors accounting for the size of this Bill &mdash; the rates of pay and the number of public servants.  Action must now be taken on both fronts.</P>
    <P>As regards pay rates, although the present Government are prepared to honour the previous Government's commitment to pay the third phase of 2 per cent under the 25th Round Pay Agreement from 1 May next, we intend to adhere firmly to that Government's decision to make no provision for any further general increases on the expiry of the present agreement on 30 June. Indeed, we now find that we have no option, given the present state of the public finances, but to go further and direct that as from today no public service employers are to pay any special increases other than those already approved and for which provision is being made in the revised allocations for non-capital supply services.  Similar restrictions will, of course, apply to claims for improvements in conditions of employment. Deputies will be aware that the Government have already set a headline as regards pay restraint by the announcement on 13 March of the decision to <Col N="789" /> postpone indefinitely any action in relation to the Interim Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
    <P>I propose to arrange for discussions with the various staff organisations on the implications of these decisions for the existing negotiating machinery.</P>
    <P>As regards numbers, the public sector in its widest sense today employs 300,000 people.  Some 187,000 of these are in the public service area which is directly financed from the Exchequer at a cost, as I have already said, of £2,840 million. Over the past few years, reductions have taken place in some areas but there has been no overall reduction because of increases in other areas.  The cost of the public service still represents too great a burden on the Exchequer.  This burden must be eased in the interests of putting the public finances on a sound footing to allow a shift of resources to the private sector.  In particular, it is of the utmost urgency that the wealth-creating sector of the economy should be expanded.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the measures being taken in relation to pay rates.  These must be matched by measures to secure a reduction in the numbers employed right across the public service.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, with effect from today, the Government have decided on the following measures to reduce public service numbers:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the Civil Service no vacancy may be filled without the consent of the Minister for Finance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Minister for Finance will have authority to redeploy staff within the Civil Service as required;</P>
    <P>&mdash;no vacancy will be filled in any other area of the public service funded from the Exchequer without the express approval of the Minister responsible for that area with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these measures is to reduce the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill in 1987 to £2,813 million. <Col N="790" /> Despite the reduction, this figure still represents an increase of over 5 per cent on last year which is much higher than the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government have, of course, to consider the question of public service pay not just as it bears on the 1987 budget, but also in a longer term context. What happens to the pay bill over the next few years will have a crucial bearing on the scope for re-orienting the balance of public expenditure more towards promoting growth.  The greater the share of State resources that the pay bill absorbs, the less will be available, against the background of the overall budget constraint, for other purposes.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult for individuals and particular groups to accept the necessary restraint on pay, especially if they consider themselves to have fallen behind their colleagues, but they have to bear in mind the compensating advantages, such as job security and pension arrangements, which they enjoy.  Moreover, the State, in remunerating its employees, has to be as sensitive as any employer to borrowing and revenue constraints. Otherwise the security of public service employment and the level of public services will be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Lottery</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Lottery was launched last week and I am pleased to note that it is enjoying considerable popularity.  As a revenue-earning operation it enjoys the dual advantage of being voluntary and offering those who buy tickets the opportunity of a substantial prize.  I would like to congratulate An Post on their very effective launch and wish them every success in the future.  I have made a provision of £7 million in the budget, on both the revenue and expenditure sides, for the Exchequer's share of the lottery proceeds in 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have had a searching look at the State's capital expenditure. We have decided to reduce the Public Capital Programme from the level of £1,721 million, previously announced, to <Col N="791" /> £1,655 million &mdash; a reduction of £66 million, just over £59 million of which related to Exchequer-funded elements of programmes.  The outturn for 1986 was £1,645 million.</P>
    <P>As with current expenditure, all individual programme areas have been closely examined and reductions have been made in almost all categories.  We have considered the demands likely to be made for non-programme outlays and have decided that a provision of £75 million, £15 million less than proposed by our predecessors, will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Details of the main programme reductions are set out in the Principal Features of the Budget.  I would, however, like to refer briefly to two items.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Housing grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a massive build-up of commitments under the house improvement grants scheme.  The previous Government increased the allocation for this scheme from £27 million in 1986 to £100 million in 1987.  We considered carefully whether this could be reduced but had to conclude that it could not.  The day is past when we can accept every new service as simply an addition to all existing services.  It has, therefore, been necessary to terminate a number of housing grant schemes and to make adjustments to other Environment capital programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to terminate three of the four housing grant schemes operated by the Department of the Environment with effect from 27 March 1987.</P>
    <P>The schemes terminated are:</P>
    <P>the house improvement grants scheme,</P>
    <P>the £2,250 builders' grant for new houses,</P>
    <P>the £5,000 surrender grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers moving to the private sector.</P>
    <P>

      <P>These steps will lead to savings of £6.5 million in 1987, and much more in 1988 and later years.  A scheme of improvement grants will continue to be available to disabled persons and for essential repairs.  The new house grant of £2,000 for first-time purchasers of new houses will continue in operation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Decentralisation</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Government believe that the more widespread location of public service employment is a desirable long-term objective to help reduce regional imbalances and the pressures on the Dublin region.  The decentralisation programme initiated in October 1980 was cancelled by the previous administration in the context of the 1983 Estimates.  This Government continue to believe in the efficacy of decentralisation in the promotion of these objectives and I have made an additional allocation of £1 million to the office of public works this year for this purpose.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for Capital Purposes</i>
      </P>
      <P>The adjustments I have announced today, together with buoyancy in Exchequer capital resources, mean that borrowing for capital purposes will now fall to £658 million this year, £77 million less than the figure set by the previous Government and £92 million less than in 1986.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personal taxation is at an all time high and is a serious deterrent to our development. There must be reform in order to remove barriers to economic activity and to make the system demonstrably fairer. <Col N="793" /> There must also be radical improvements in tax collection.</P>
    <P>In the short-term it is not possible to reduce taxes.  The Government will, however, give early consideration to major changes, as soon as the budgetary position allows.  We have now reached a point of diminishing returns in relation to some taxes.  The loss of trade to Northern Ireland, in particular, because of high taxes is an intolerable drain on the economy.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with new tax measures, I would like to refer briefly to the proposals put forward by the previous Government on 20 January.  These are being implemented with the exception of the proposals to change the terms of the travel tax and to extend the farm tax to an increased number of farmers.  The appropriate legislation will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  The full details of the 20 January proposals, amended where necessary, are outlined in the Principal Features of the Budget. The tax yield from the proposed increase in the stamp duty on life assurance premiums will, however, be down from £4 million to £2.4 million for this year because of the delay in implementing the change.  An order has now been made to bring the increase in duty into effect from 1 May.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the new taxation measures which are being introduced by this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>First of all I have to say that, because of the difficult budget situation, it is not possible on this occasion to provide for reductions in income tax.  A choice has had to be made between reducing borrowing and reducing income tax and the more responsible course for all concerned at this time is to lower the borrowing figure.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention, as soon as circumstances permit, to move to a stage where two-thirds of taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate only.  It is an essential element of income tax reform that the proportion of taxpayers liable for <Col N="794" /> tax at the higher rates should be reduced. In the past six years this proportion has increased from 14 per cent to over 43 per cent.  The present figure is altogether too high and, with an improving budget situation, it will be a Government priority to bring substantially more taxpayers down to the standard rate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mortgage Interest Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief will cost about £160 million in 1987-88 in terms of tax revenue foregone.  The present ceilings for this relief are £4,000 in the case of a married couple and £2,000 for a single person.  It is an extremely expensive relief and it is now proposed to claw back a small proportion of this revenue for the coming tax year.  Accordingly, the interest qualifying for relief is being restricted to 90 per cent of the amount which at present qualifies.  This will mean a small reduction in the relief available to all claimants, with the biggest claw back from those who are currently benefiting most.  The tax benefit will still be very generous and at the present mortgage rate will be, at maximum, the equivalent of full relief on a loan of nearly £29,000.  The yield from this change will be £10 million in 1987 and £16 million in a full year.  The position for future years will be reviewed in the light of interest rate developments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Withholding Tax on Fees</i>
    </P>
    <P>Substantial sums are paid annually from State sources in fees and similar payments for professional services. These include payments for medical, legal, financial, training, engineering and similar services.  It is considered that tax should be deducted from such payments at source because employees generally are subject to an immediate deduction system under PAYE.  Accordingly, from 6 June next, there will be a withholding tax of 35 per cent on all payments for professional services made by Government Departments, local authorities, health boards and certain other State agencies.  This will have a cash flow benefit for the State which is estimated at £25 million for this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> The gross payments before withholding of tax will continue to be included in the normal way in the calculation of profits for the year for which they form all or part of the basis of assessment.  The resulting tax charge will be reduced by the amount of withholding tax deducted. Where no tax liability arises for that year or where the liability is less than the withholding tax deducted from the fees included in the profits assessed for that year, an appropriate refund will be made by Revenue.  There will be provision for interim refunds where the deduction of the withholding tax gives rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Treatment of Expatriate Remittances</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present under the &ldquo;place of abode&rdquo; rule Irish people working abroad are liable to Irish tax on their remittances home if they maintain a place of abode here and return, even for short periods, during the tax year.  I propose to abolish this rule so that remittances home will in such cases be free of tax.  This will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  It is entirely appropriate that Irish people working abroad should be able to visit home and transfer their savings here without being subject to tax simply by virtue of such visits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Resident Accounts</i>
    </P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier our desire to attract more funds from abroad.  There appears to be some misconception about the tax status of non-resident deposits. Let me make the position clear.  Such deposits are entirely free of retention tax in our jurisdiction.  I can give assurances that we have no intention of changing this arrangement.  Non-residents can lodge deposits here in complete confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that farmers should be taxed in the same manner as other sections of the community, that is, on actual income.  It has been decided, therefore, to discontinue the farm tax &mdash; normally called the land tax &mdash; from 1987 onwards and legislation to this effect will be introduced shortly. <Col N="796" /> Farm tax liabilities due and unpaid in respect of 1986, which total approximately £5 million, will be pursued by the local authorities and there can be no question of an amnesty.</P>
    <P>The number of full-time farmers actually assessed now for income tax purposes is approximately 55,000.  The expected yield from income tax on farmers this year after abolition of the farm tax and on the basis of existing collection arrangements is £35 million.  It is the intention that all farmers likely to have taxable incomes will be assessed for income tax as soon as possible and to this end the system of issuing simple profile forms for smaller farmers, which was first introduced in 1983, will be extended.  Completed farm profile forms enable the inspector of taxes to make a speedy judgment as to whether or not a particular farmer is likely to have a taxable income.  Formal income tax assessment can then be confined to such cases.  This system simplifies procedures considerably both for the tax authorities and the individual farmer and will in many cases avoid the need for a specialist accounting service.  The increased use of profile forms is expected to bring in an extra £1 million this year.</P>
    <P>The abolition of farm tax involves a reduction of £9 million in taxation from farmers this year.  This shortfall must be made good by the farming community from another source.  Accordingly, I propose to reduce the flat-rate VAT addition to farm prices from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent with effect from 1 May.  Farmers retain, of course, the right to be registered for VAT and thus to recover any VAT paid by them on inputs.  This change is expected to give a yield of £9 million this year.  In consequence of the abolition of farm tax or land tax the Farm Classification Office is being closed down.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Business</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tax contribution from the business sector is small by comparison with other countries.  This is primarily due to the exceptionally generous tax concessions that are available.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to continue with the <Col N="797" /> review of the structure of the corporation tax code, initiated by the previous Government.  This review will investigate in particular the feasibility of reducing initial allowances and free depreciation with a parallel reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Selective incentives, however, geared towards specific objectives can make a very significant contribution to business development.  One such incentive, which is making a useful impact, is the business expansion scheme.  Up to now it has been restricted to manufacturing and certain service industries.  While the Government intend to maintain this restriction generally, it is proposed to extend the scheme to certain export tourism activities. This means that in future total relief from income tax on amounts up to £25,000 in any one year will be available to individuals who invest share capital in qualifying tourism activities.  This kind of investment is essential to maximise our share of the fast expanding specialist holiday segment of the tourist market.  The appropriate legislative provisions will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  The Bill will also provide for extension of the business expansion scheme to certain Irish shipping activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Financial Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The growth of the financial services sector internationally, stimulated in large measure by advances in technology, has been one of the more significant features of economic life in recent years.  We must aim to share in the benefits to be derived from this growth.  Modern communications mean that we are no longer isolated from the main financial markets and so now have the capacity to develop here a strong international financial services sector if we provide the right conditions and a favourable taxation climate. It is the Government's intention to provide incentives to promote this sector. There will be considerable benefits to the economy, in particular the creation of well paid and highly skilled jobs and increased demand for telecommunications and professional services. <Col N="798" /> This development will generate further substantial investment opportunities that will attract capital from abroad and give a further welcome impetus to the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of excise duty increases were introduced from midnight on 20 January by Government order under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, as amended.  These increases applied to cigarettes and tobacco products, road fuels, gas oil, kerosene and the like, and non-auto LPG.  The yield from these changes is estimated at £48.5 million in 1987 and £51.8 million in a full year.  I do not propose to make any further changes in the levels of excise duties.  The House will today have the opportunity to debate a motion noting the changes in excise duties already made.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Travel Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been widespread abuse of the measures permitting duty free allowances by persons who are not genuine travellers who make short journeys outside the jurisdiction for the sole purpose of exploiting these allowances.  These duty free allowances are intended to benefit the genuine traveller in respect of goods in his own personal luggage and which are of no commercial character.  A person whose sole purpose of travelling is to benefit from the duty free allowances cannot be considered a genuine traveller.</P>
    <P>The nature and extent of the abuses to which I have referred have led to a distortion and a deflection of trade of substantial proportions which require urgent action.  For the purpose of preventing this widespread abuse, the distortion and deflection of trade and to clarify the law, I have today made regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, which provide, with effect from midnight tonight, that travellers' allowances will no longer be permitted for persons whose journeys outside the jurisdiction of the State are less than 48 hours' duration.</P>
    <P>Existing limited travellers' allowances relating to frontier zone residents and <Col N="799" /> international transport crews will continue to apply.  I also intend to enter into consultation with the European Commission and our European partners in connection with this problem with a view to preventing any further or continuing abuses or distortions of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Administration</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government recognise the essential need for further improvements in tax administration.  Reform of the structure is of limited value in practice if the administration is not properly geared to take advantage of improvements.  As a result of the departmental re-organisation now taking place, in particular the merger of the Department of the Public Service with the Department of Finance, staffing resources have been freed for essential urgent tasks.  I am, therefore, forming a task force composed of some 25 highly qualified and experienced officers from the Department of the Public Service to be put at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners to concentrate on the collection of tax arrears.  It is expected that this arrangement will result in an increase in revenue this year of £10 million.</P>
    <P>The Government favour the principle of self-assessment for income tax and corporation tax and this will be given priority. The implications of a change of this nature will be examined in the light of comments being received from interested parties.  In view of the significance of such a development and the changes that would be required to make it work, the Government may consider publication of a further paper, outlining requirements in more detail.</P>
    <P>A measure that has been particularly successful has been the introduction of a tax clearance certificate as a precondition for securing public contracts over £10,000.  It is estimated that as much as £12½ million in back taxes has been recovered directly as a result of this requirement. To date, however, a number of public bodies have failed to implement this requirement satisfactorily in awarding <Col N="800" /> contracts.  The Government will not tolerate this further.  These bodies must now comply with the requirement without further delay or account for their failure to do so.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are going ahead for the introduction of a requirement whereby applicants for all grants from State and public authorities must give their tax number and confirm that their tax affairs are in order.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deficit and Borrowing Requirement</i>
    </P>
    <P>The current deficit and Exchequer borrowing requirement proposed by the previous Government on 20 January were £1,293 million and £2,028 million respectively. The expenditure and taxation changes which I have made today will significantly lower these targets to £1,200 million and £1,858 million respectively. In terms of GNP, today's figures translate into a current deficit of 6.9 per cent of GNP and an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 10.7 per cent of GNP. The corresponding percentages proposed on 20 January were 7.4 per cent and 11.7 per cent of GNP and the figures for 1986 were 8.5 per cent and 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>The planned reductions in the current deficit and Exchequer borrowing requirement compared to those proposed by the previous Government represent a significant achievement.  They are firm evidence of this Government's determination to improve the public finances and to maintain the stability of our currency.  They are also a clear signal to all that borrowing will be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to ensure that there will be no overrun on the budget targets and that the individual decisions underlying the figures will be implemented fully.  Any additional expenditure or shortfall in taxation will have to be balanced by adjustments elsewhere because there is simply no room for any relaxation of these targets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we all have the obligation to work together to overcome our difficulties.  We must generate a new <Col N="801" /> sense of purpose and a new confidence. We must identify both our strengths and our weaknesses and develop new avenues for investment and employment.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the need to provide a stable economic and financial environment and positive attitudes towards investment.  The economy is essentially in a sound position, and we have advantages in terms of raw materials and a skilled labour force which are not being used to the best advantage. Indigenous industry has been stagnant for too long.  There is an air of despondency that is unwarranted.  We have problems but it is well within our ability to correct them.</P>
    <P>We have the essential resources to get out of the depression that has enveloped the country in recent years and to open up new possibilities for growth and employment.  We simply cannot afford to let opportunities slip.  Optimism does matter.  We must provide the best conditions for the inflow of capital into the country, for lower interest rates and for higher investment.</P>
    <P>This budget is the first step in providing the right balance for a new outlook based on a sound financial situation.  New possibilities for steady economic growth and <Col N="802" /> employment are being opened up.  The policies being implemented this year will be continued and developed over the next few years in line with the Government's programme and people can plan in the certainty that there will be no change of direction.  The public finances will be managed prudently; there will be a better distribution of the tax burden and the economy will become increasingly competitive.</P>
    <P>We must not be intimidated by the difficulties or give way to defeatism.  Let us take the opposite course.  Let us talk of opportunity.  Let us work together in a new spirit of co-operation, determined to get things right.  This requires a contribution from all sections of the community. The essence of consensus is that the various interest groups will each make some contribution to the public good.</P>
    <P>As things come right, success will become self-sustaining.  Jobs will become available again.  Taxes can be lowered. We will have a stronger economy that will allow us to improve social conditions. These are the rewards for exercising the necessary discipline and restraint in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I commend this budget to the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, since you exercised your casting vote three weeks ago amazing things have been happening in this country.  We welcomed the conversion of the Taoiseach to the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We further welcomed his conversion to the fact that there was no problem with Article 1 of that agreement I have great pleasure today in welcoming Fianna Fáil's acceptance of the Fine Gael analysis of the problem and of the targets which we have set down.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is grand larceny of our policy as put before the electorate.  The road to Aras an Uachtaráin will now take precedence over the road to Damascus.  Only one conversion took place on the road to Damascus.  We had 15 on the road to Aras an Uachtaráin. If the Government were subject to the Trades Description Act they would be in the dock tonight for putting before the Irish people a product totally different from what they were contracted to deliver.  I am glad they realised there is a better way.  Of course there is, we told them that weeks ago.  We debated it in public, on radio and on TV.  The better way is the Fine Gael way and I am glad the Government have come around to that position.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> During the last session of the Dáil between October and December the party opposite when in Opposition put down 13 motions, almost one every second day, each of which involved irresponsible extra public expenditure.  We should welcome conversions when they come and this indeed is a great conversion, although not the first.  We had conversions before.  In the first coming of Mr. Haughey, he arrived on the scene in 1979 when the current <Col N="814" /> budget deficit had overshot by £233 million. In one of the best analysis of the economic problems facing this country, he went on TV explained what was wrong and did nothing.  At the end of that year he overshot the budget deficit by £193 million.  In 1981 the target was overshot again, this time by £304 million.</P>
      <P>When we went out of power, Mr. MacSharry was appointed Minister for Finance and he introduced his first budget. Deputies will recall the policies during that first budget of Fianna Fáil.  Targets were set and we thought that Fianna Fáil were accepting our economic policies but at the end of that year they overshot by £310 million.  This was despite the Taoiseach saying on the 1982 budget that they intended to adhere to these targets, to have rigid control of the public finances, that should any additional expenditure become necessary it would be met by a corresponding reduction in expenditure elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Yet, at the end of the year they overshot by £310 million.</P>
      <P>This is a conversion all right, but we have seen conversions before and the targets were not adhered to.  If there is any indication of funny money in this budget, if there is any indication of deferred expenditure in this budget, the Government will not have the support of this side of the House.  We will mark Fianna Fáil man for man and woman for woman; we will insist that Fianna Fáil adhere to their targets, if we know what they are.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I apologise. The Taoiseach's targets in 1982 were totally overshot.  At the end of that year manufacturing output had fallen by 1.3 per cent, the purchasing power of industrial income was down by 3.7 per cent, consumer sales were down by 5.5 per cent and gross national product was down by 1.6 per cent.  We came into this House, the Government told us those targets and we accepted them, but they were not adhered to.  Prayer without good works does not achieve salvation.  We will insist that the Government stick to the targets this time.  If they do not, they will have to face the public because the electorate in their wisdom put them in power.  To be fair, the graph was not going down in every area at the end of 1982.  There were some increases.  Unemployment was up by 26 per cent, interest payments on foreign debt were up by 97 per cent and inflation was up by 17.2 per cent.  That is the record of previous conversions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome the Government's targets but I question their enthusiasm to implement them.  As I have said I would like to have the specifics spelled out.</P>
      <P>I note the Government depend a lot on a decline in interest rates.  The market has already discounted 1 per cent on the basis of the current budget deficit coming in at around 7.4 per cent.  If the targets are believed, the Government may get another 1 per cent on interest rates.  This means they may achieve a reduction in interest rates, and I hope they do, but they must remember they do not control the whole scene.  A Minister for Finance in this economy is like a cork bobbing on the ocean.  As late as this morning orders which had been placed on the gilt markets were cancelled, not because of an expectation of a bad or a good budget, but simply because there is uncertainty in Wall Street about relationships between the United States and Japan.  All I am saying is that the Minister for Finance does not hold the destiny of this nation in his hands when it comes to interest rates.  I hope the signal to the market is strong enough to bring down interest rates because this is the hinge on which economic activity turns.  If the Government's targets are correct and they stick to them, we will underwrite them because we want to reduce interest rates.</P>
      <P>There are items in the targets with which I find difficulty and I would like to deal with them.  The Minister restored about £1.2 million to the education budget when we had introduced a mechanism to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio by action on career guidance and vice-principals. Elsewhere he has taken £11 million out of the Education vote, but he has not said how this will be done. Knowing the Education Estimate, these changes will have a devastating effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister provided money for the <Col N="817" /> better collection of tax revenue and set up a task force.  I have experience of task forces from the other side of the House. When Deputy Woods was shadowing me in Justice, the solution to every problem was to form a task force.  If a bicycle was stolen in a rural village and the local sergeant investigated it, it could not be effectively done unless you called him a task force.  Now we have a task force for the collection of revenue and £10 million is provided.  Who comprises the task force?  People from the Department of the Public Service who are unwillingly being assigned to the Revenue Commissioners and have no experience of revenue collection or enforcement.</P>
    <P>The concept of a retention charge is being introduced for the payment of professional fees.  A figure of £25 million is mentioned.  I assume this means that a doctor under the GMS scheme will have 35 per cent deducted from his cheque before it is sent out to him.  I assume the same will happen where a chemist is concerned.  Does this apply to the Voluntary Health Insurance?  If it does, I want to remind him that VHI cheques are paid direct to the patient, not the doctor.  I would like that point clarified. Will this apply to architects and engineers? These people are working on a turnover figure, not an income figure.  All over the country there are engineering consultants and architects employing 20 or 25 people, and the Minister will now take 35 per cent of their cash flow.  Of course, because of what this Minister and this Government are doing to the building industry, these people will not have very much work and they will be forced to let a number of their employees go.</P>
    <P>On the tax side, I am disappointed with the measures taken.  I have dealt with the retention tax and I would like to deal now with the farm tax which is being removed. The farm tax was a fair tax and was welcomed by many farmers.  It was doubly welcomed when we introduced the concept of self-assessment.  I cannot understand why the Government are taking this out completely, unless they are giving in to one of the biggest lobbies <Col N="818" /> in this country, the IFA.  Many farmers around the country, and the majority of farmers in the intensive dairying areas, are happy with the land tax.  What this Minister is doing now is removing the land tax and jigging with the VAT rates to compensate.  I do not believe a proper income tax or land tax system should be removed while the Minister jigs with the VAT rates to recover the £9 million revenue lost.</P>
    <P>As regards the health charges, this Minister did something we would never have done.  He introduced a £10 charge for beds in public wards on one of the most vulnerable sections in society.  I realise people on medical cards will be exempt and that the VHI will introduce a scheme to compensate their members, but what about that group whose income is too high to qualify for a medical card but who are not in the VHI scheme, that is the majority of low paid workers whether in industry or the public service? The Minister is introducing this charge of £10 a day, £70 a week for people with a take-home pay of £110, £115 or £120. What are these people to live on?  Did the Minister understand what he was doing when he introduced this £10 charge for people in public wards?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputies on all sides of the House know that people on medical cards have their bathroom cupboards filled with drugs which they are not taking.  Something has to be done about the abuse of prescribed drugs and a small charge on prescriptions would have done that.  It would have improved the health of the country far more than <Col N="819" /> many of the measures which are being brought in today.</P>
      <P>I would now like to proceed to one of the main planks of the Minister's economic policy which is the question of pay and numbers.  Again, I would like to put down a marker.  What is the Minister telling us?  He is saying that he is going to honour the agreements; we are <i>ad idem</i> on that.  We have always honoured agreements on this side of the House.  He is saying that no new specials will be paid in 1987 but that the specials which are in the system are being paid.  Therefore, there is no saving.  He is also telling us that from the end of June no money is being provided for any extra pay increases.  That is exactly what we had in our budget, but how is he going to achieve it?  Is he going to introduce a statutory wage freeze?  Is this a negotiating position? Is it an opening shot in the 26th round?  Yet, he has provided no money and no strategy.  We have been informed of no strategy.</P>
      <P>I am sure he is aware, for example, that if the Aer Lingus deal was applied right across the public service, an extra £70 million would be required in 1987.  If the ESB offer was applied right across the public service, an extra £95 million would be needed in 1987.  What is the Minister's policy on pay in the wider public service?  What is he going to do with the offer in these areas and what is he going to do when the pressure comes on?  Are we going to be faced with industrial action with concessions in the autumn and are his figures going to askew on the pay side?  I would like an answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like an answer to a question on the Minister's policy on the extended embargo.  We carried an embargo of replacing one in three for a long distance and it resulted in a reduction of 9 per cent in the Civil Service. We had increases elsewhere.  There are more children and there are far more teachers.  Obviously, more teachers were employed during the past four to five years.  We had problems with crime and security.  Therefore, more gardaí were <Col N="820" /> employed.  We had more people in prisons. Therefore, we needed more prison officers.  We probably even employed more nurses.  Therefore, during the past 18 months by a cash limit system the embargo was extended to health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put in a figure of £27 million for his extended embargo.  The only exception in the Civil Service will be if the Minister for Finance authorises a replacement.  The only exception in the public service generally will be if the appropriate line Minister sanctions the exemption.  Does that mean no more gardaí and no replacement if any garda retires?  Does that mean that if there are retirements in Mountjoy Prison they will not be replaced?  More seriously, because the numbers are bigger &mdash; I say more seriously in terms of current expenditure &mdash; does it mean that if a teacher retires or goes on a career break there will be no replacement?  Does it apply to doctors and nurses in hospitals?  Does it apply to the officials of health boards and county councils?  It has to if the Minister is to achieve the figure of £27 million because to squeeze £27 million out of numbers for the remainder of the year is some achievement.  It must mean that every line Minister is being instructed by the Minister for Finance that there will be no concessions whatsoever unless it is absolutely vital, such as the appointment of a key medical specialist in a hospital.</P>

I would like clarification on that before we commit ourselves to supporting that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to move to the capital side.  The Minister did not specify what he is doing on the capital side but he did give general figures for the cuts he is <Col N="821" /> making.  There are colossal cuts in the public capital programme.  He is taking out a total of £79.5 million on the public capital programme.  Where is that going to hit?  The Minister has not told us.  It might have been circulated since I got on my feet but the people who were listening on radio did not hear it and I do not know where he is making those cuts or whether they are achievable or not.  But I do know this: if you take that much out, it must affect the construction industry.  The Minister is cutting the public capital programme by almost £80 million and he is taking out the housing grants.  The expectations of a reduced VAT rate on the building sector have not been met.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is one aspect of the Minister's policy on the building industry, specifically in regard to housing, I want to take issue with.  We brought about a situation by encouraging people to build their own houses where the housing lists of local authorities were at an all time low.  Deputies on all sides of the House know how the situation changed over four or five years.  People with one child and sometimes with one not quite <Col N="822" /> arrived got three bedroomed houses in some counties.  That was an enlightened policy and it encouraged people to do things for themselves.  One of the main planks of that platform was the £5,000 grant for those who gave up local authority houses and bought their own homes. We know the effect of the grant.  It provided the incentive for people to buy their own homes and it left a good supply of local authority houses to be used by other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will see.  I now want to raise something akin to that.  A corollary of our policy in controlling the public finances was that we cut drastically the provision for local authority houses because we no longer needed to make those provisions as people were housing themselves and new houses were becoming vacant which were in good condition.  After removing the £5,000 grant, as far as I can see the Minister has not increased the allocation for local authority houses.  I think he has reduced the £79 million on the capital side further.  I am informed that on the specifics of the budget he has reduced it by £12.5 million.  The first thing that is going to happen is that local authority housing lists are going to lengthen and lengthen over this year and the Minister will not catch up with them.  It is a reversal of the very strong social policy which was followed by the outgoing Government especially as it related to housing the homeless.  That is a disgraceful change in public policy.  I am amazed that the Minister has taken that decision.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the employment effects of the budget.  Obviously, this is a deflationary budget.  The Minister is cutting both the capital and current sides.  He may get some boosts from a decline in interest rates.  If the markets take the Minister seriously that might transfer into street rates.  I hope it does.  The Taoiseach is quoted in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, I presume correctly, on 6 February as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> It is an inevitable outcome of cuts in Government spending that they result in unemployment &mdash; that is the iron law of economics &mdash; not just in the public sector but right across the economic spectre.</P>
    <P>I presume he means spectrum and that he was misquoted there.  He mentioned the iron law of economics and yet today he took £80 million out of the capital programme, abolished all grants in an unspecified way and slashed current expenditure also.  Where are the programmes for jobs?  Where is the developmental approach?  Where is the going for growth?  Where is the 2½ per cent increase in GNP between now and 1991?</P>
    <P>I am not too sure what growth figure the Minister put in because it was not specified in his speech.  I am not sure what inflation figure he put in but, at first glance, from the <i>prima facie</i> evidence I have it appears the Minister has not increased it very much beyond what our figures were, a 1 per cent growth rate built on top of 3 per cent inflation approximately.  May I take it they are the figures which underpin the Minister's GNP projection, 1 per cent plus 3 per cent?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fianna Fáil made great play during the election campaign of development policies and growth in the sectoral areas.  A lot can be achieved there whether it is in marine, aquaculture, forestry, technology or food processing.  If Fianna Fáil build on the achievements of the previous Government there will be scope for improvement but they will not provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, not even thousands of jobs.  They are more likely to provide hundreds of jobs rather than anything else.  I do not think the Government's economic approach should be to go around trying to pick winners.  I do not think it is their job to pick winners.  In my view it is their job to provide the <Col N="824" /> atmosphere and environment in which winners can be developed.  In doing that I hope one peg of their economic platform will be realised, that they will get low interest rates.</P>
      <P>The Government have not given any indication of what they propose to do in other areas.  While interest rates are very important in deciding which way investment will go and in terms of the cost to industry, there are other cost factors.  The Minister did not mention pay in the wider area.  Has he a policy in regard to pay in the private sector?  Is that to be allowed to fall where it will, a free negotiation of individual in-house agreements?  What is the Minister's policy in regard to the private sector?  We must compete for jobs and the only way jobs can be created is by people filling order books abroad, and when the capacity of their plant at home is taken up by employing others to fill those orders.  How can we compete for jobs if the environment at home is not right?  I do not think the Government can pin their whole economic or employment policies totally on a putative reduction in interest rates.</P>
      <P>For example, diesel fuel in the UK is £1.70 per gallon while it is £2.30 here. There are at least two Ministers in Cabinet who are aware of that because of their location in a Border constituency. Haulage costs are 50 per cent higher here than in the UK and vehicle insurance for staff is four times higher here than in the UK.  Employers' liability insurance is 7.5 per cent on average of the wage bill here while it is about 1 per cent in the UK.  Electricity charges and telecommunication charges are 25 per cent higher than the EC average.  Interest rates, as of today, are 4 percentage points higher.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to get those matters right.  Sending a task force in to sort out the ESB and make them pay the rates that have been levied on them is great stuff, good macho-politics but it drives up the cost of electricity.  Is that the Government's only policy in the area of energy?</P>

We had included many specifics and I take it that the Minister is accepting them, although I did not hear him state that.  Another lamentable fact is that the Minister ignored completely the relevance of what has come to be known as privatisation of the semi-State sector.  The State is involved in activities that it should not be involved in.  Unlike another party in the House, we would advocate the selling of those companies and using the resources to reduce the borrowing requirement.  I do not think it would be right to use whatever money might be obtained by selling Ostlanna Éireann or Irish Life for tax reduction purposes.  The bill for tax reductions goes on from year to year but the advantage from the sale of an asset is <Col N="826" /> a once-off.  If the Minister is contemplating the selling off of such assets, and I advocate that he should, the proceeds should be used on a once-off basis to reduce the debt.  On the other hand, there are very sound, effective and efficient semi-State companies here. They are sounder and more efficient now thanks to the activities of Deputy Jim Mitchell when he was Minister for Communications. They are all showing a profit.</P>
      <P>The Minister can see from an examination of the arithmetic of the budget that whether he likes it or not he will not have the resources to provide the capital that will allow semi-State companies to expand.  Many of the semi-State bodies have played a crucial role in the economy of the country but the blunt fact is that some of them are starved for capital.  The way to get the capital is to sell off shares against their assets and use the money to expand those companies and increase employment.  I have no ideological problem with such a policy and I doubt if the Minister has.  In my view he should do that.  His rejection of our proposals during the election campaign was totally shortsighted.  The Minister should look at this area again and he should not feel embarrassed doing so because he has turned on his head so often in the past three weeks that he will not get dizzy from another turn.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Now that Deputy MacSharry has sat around the Cabinet table I am sure he can imagine the difficulties Deputy Dukes faced in trying to frame a budget against an inflation rate of 21 per cent.  If we exclude borrowings and interest payments the budget is balanced but Deputy Dukes faced total disarray in 1982.  There is a balance of payments surplus now but Deputy Dukes faced a balance of payments deficit of between 13 and 14 per cent of GNP.  The task is much easier for Deputy MacSharry because of the firm foundation laid by the previous administration over the past four years.  It is a good time to be in Fine Gael because there is a certain sense of satisfaction in looking around the House at all the people who have been stealing our clothes for so long.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see that interruption came from the former Minister for Defence.  I should like to comment briefly on our colleagues on my extreme right.  First of all they adopted the Anglo-Irish Agreement; then it was Fine Gael's social policy and Fine Gael's economic policy.  The PDs with all the zeal of the convert advocated those policies in a frenetic manner which caused one revered Deputy in this House to refer <Col N="828" /> to them as the military wing of the Fine Gael Party.  I prefer to think of them as the provisional wing of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have made amazing progress in three short weeks.  We have heard about the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and not a word about any constitutional difficulty with Article 1. There is no problem with the Single European Act &mdash; as a matter of fact, it is a good thing if you look at it closely.  The ACOT Bill is marvellous stuff.  On extradition, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, did a soft shoe shuffle around the perimeters of <i>prima facie</i> requirements and as the year goes on we will see how that moves.</P>

It was a good speech and it predicted many of the things he is trying to do today.  There was a gem in the middle &mdash; the NDC has suddenly become a Fianna Fáil baby.  It is good for the country and good for employment and is fundamental to sectoral development. This is the NDC which they wanted to kill at birth and they claimed they would no sooner be back in office than they would strangle it, but now the NDC is a very good thing indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have today's budget, renowned for the things it does and the things it hides and renowned most of all for the things it does not do.  I remember the election campaign when we were all together walking the roads.  Many of us have a fairly clear memory of what happened.  I remember the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, during what has become known as the &ldquo;Limerick shout-in&rdquo; on the first Saturday of the campaign, telling me that DIRT tax would be abolished as soon as they got back into office.  It would be no problem.  I heard the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Kennedy, on television informing us all that <Col N="829" /> there would be social welfare increases of at least 7 per cent.  There would be no difficulty with this, the night before the Fianna Fáil election policy was published. We know Fianna Fáil and we will be watching them.  In every division which took place over a period of four years they cast their votes for the good of Fianna Fáil.  They put down 13 motions between October and December, each one requiring extra public expenditure. They are marked men and we will mark them man for man and woman for woman.  If they depart from those targets we will have them walking and there is only one destination.</P>

      <P>This debate is one in which we are reminded, especially by the speech given by Deputy Noonan, that this is an adversarial institution where people come together to argue what is proposed by the Government rather than to get together to do what is best for the country.  Listeners at home who heard <Col N="830" /> Deputy Noonan's speech on the radio, if it was broadcast, cannot fail to have been impressed by the derision and scorn he cast upon the Fianna Fáil benches for doing what his party were too gutless and too afraid to do themselves.  I find it remarkable that somebody could be so abusive and so scornful when on the Fianna Fáil benches we now see a change of heart of a very substantial kind which has been made in the interests of the country at large.  Everyone should have the generosity to accept it.  It ill-befits Deputy Noonan or any of the laughing people behind him in his party to forget that when people choose to do the right thing, albeit at the eleventh hour, they deserve support for it and not derision. The people will remember the behaviour today of Deputy Noonan and his colleagues and they will pay for it in the long run.</P>

      <P>It is in the nature of this institution that the Government introduce all money Bills and that the Opposition do not have a direct say, at least at the outset, in the money Bills passed by this House.  Therefore there has been a habit, exemplified today by the Fine Gael reaction, to oppose, cast scorn and abuse rather than attempt to understand or to find the good things in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been founded as a new and separate political party not for the purpose of stealing anybody's political clothes.  I will remind the Fine Gael Deputies that they do not own any policies.  What is best in the interests of the country belongs to the country at large.  They have no monopoly of virtue and no monopoly of policy.  The pulpit from which Deputy Noonan has lectured this House for the past few minutes is, in fact, the dock in which he stands adjudged for his economic failures and those of his colleagues over four of the worst years of Government this country <Col N="831" /> has ever experienced.  Let us not have any double standards here.  He is not let off the hook, and neither are any of his colleagues, for the mismanagement for which they were responsible during the past four years.  We will not permit them so to be.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats were founded as a new and separate political party in order to make the Irish political process not more devisive but more decisive. I venture to suggest that the tone of the debate today and what was done by the Fianna Fáil Party in bringing forward this budget would not have happened had the Progressive Democrats not come into being.  People will judge that issue for themselves.  Our response to the measures and proposals put forward today will be constructive, positive where possible and critical where necessary.  We will not make the best the enemy of the good in this debate.  We will support any proposals which are necessary and point out where proposals made by the Government are insufficient.</P>
    <P>We believe in an economic approach which is different &mdash; in some respects radically different &mdash; from the thinking underlying this budget.  Because we believe that these measures are insufficient we will criticise them but, to the extent that they are necessary, they will receive our support.</P>
    <P>The context of this budget makes it stand apart from others.  First, it is a budget which has been the subject matter of a general election; secondly, it is a budget which largely falls to be implemented by those who sought to prevent others from implementing it; and, thirdly, it is a budget introduced by a party who, with the greatest respect to them, sought and failed to obtain an entirely different mandate on very different policies and attitudes.  I say that without rancour or discrimination because the self-justification and &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; which we have just witnessed are pathetic and futile and do not add anything to the debate on the economic crisis confronting us.  I merely emphasise the difference between what is being done here today <Col N="832" /> and what was offered by Fianna Fáil to the electorate in order to make the point that an opportunity was lost.</P>
    <P>The radical changes needed in the way we conduct our affairs nationally and in the way we finance the Government's activities need a strong political will to sustain them.  That political will would have been immeasurably stronger if the Fianna Fáil Party had gone to the people and sought a mandate for the kind of budget they are introducing here today. Their mandate would also have been immeasurably stronger if they had indicated what they propose to do over the next five years because none of what was done today is consistent with the document <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is all one way traffic in the other direction on another street.</P>
    <P>If there is a weakness in the extent or quality of the mandate which Fianna Fáil received from the electorate it is, to a large degree, explained by the weakness and lack of courage on the part of Fianna Fáil in seeking a mandate for these measures. Things might have been very different today and in what could happen in the future if lessons had been learned and if the people had been told directly what mandate was being sought.</P>
    <P>We take the view that these measures are indirect and insufficient from a particular economic and political standpoint. It is reasonable, in the circumstances, since I intend to criticise, that I should set out that standpoint.  The greatest and single most important agent for achieving economic and social justice is to encourage employment and economic participation by those who cannot find, strictly speaking, employment, such as the self-employed.  A society which consigns its weakest and youngest to the economic margins will never achieve political justice.  Therefore, I suggest &mdash; particularly to Deputy Noonan &mdash; that everything we consider in this House, every penny we spend, every pound we borrow, every asset we own, every law or regulation we enact must be judged by one criterion only &mdash; is it calculated to foster or to hinder economic participation in the form of jobs, work and business by <Col N="833" /> the greatest number of people?  That is the dominant political ethic and yardstick by which the Progressive Democrats act and by which we propose to be guided during the course of the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the House see the Progressive Democrats as the prejudiced handmaidens of enterprise alone without any regard to justice.  Equity, enterprise and employment go hand in hand; none can be achieved without the other and, therefore, we do not apologise for putting forward our point of view.  This is not simply ideology; it is common sense.  We are not speaking in the sectional interests of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; who are interested in maintaining some form of <i>status quo</i>.  The whole point is that there is no such thing as a <i>status quo</i> which can be maintained. The destructive process of spiralling indebtedness and increasing taxation which pass for a political <i>status quo</i> cannot be maintained.  The present situation cannot continue and the way in which it will end is the business of this House.  It is on that issue that the House should debate and divide.  What alternative is there to the present set of economic circumstances?  That is the question, and not whether we can continue as we are.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by the Minister are inconsistent with his <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Perhaps it is just as well because that programme, in so far as it was meant to be understood clearly, suggests that progress could be made by restoring our economic well being by Government led economic activity coordinated by at least 27 new semi-State bodies or committees.  I am happy to say that, on the face of the Estimates brought forward in this House, there does not appear to be a commitment to the establishment of such bodies on the part of the Minister.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> put forward by Fianna Fáil on the basis that they were seeking support from the people for its implementation, the fact that we are an over-taxed nation was stressed heavily and at great length. If you look at the increase in taxation involved in the budget, it is obvious that a step has been taken in the diametrically <Col N="834" /> opposite direction.  The effect is that income tax will increase by more than 13 per cent which is a 10 per cent increase. That is not consistent with what was said to the people and is a fundamental flaw in the budget.</P>
    <P>My party and I consider that pay-related social insurance is no longer an insurance in any shape or form; it is just another employment tax.  Any scheme of insurance which permits &mdash; as has been the case here today &mdash; the person who holds the insurance fund unilaterally to change the manner in which it is paid out and to increase the amount of premiums without any change in the risk involved is not insurance; it is taxation.  It is quite clear that any pretence that maintaining the PRSI scheme as a system of insurance has been abandoned here today and, for the first time, its taxation nature has been explicitly recognised by a Minister.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the 25 per cent increase in health charges.  They are not a special levy any more than they would be if they were described as a Defence, Justice or any other form of charge.  They and the PRSI charges which are provided for and increased in this budget are all increases in tax on income and should be viewed as such.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that as long as the question of taxation and its levels remains unconfronted the country will not come to terms with the basis of its economic problems.  The country is overtaxed and employment and enterprise are being stifled by the high rates of taxation.  We must concede that, if there is to be a reduction in taxation as part of the process of regenerating our national fortunes and if the economy can take on the debt we have inherited, there must be substantial cuts in public spending. Although the figures suggest a lower budget deficit as a percentage of GNP, the level of Government spending has not been tackled and the gross size of public spending has remained relatively static.  The narrowing of the gap between tax revenue and expenditure is made up mainly by increased taxation and that is exactly the process which has led to those problems, and it is sad to see that a start <Col N="835" /> has not been made on this occasion at reducing spending for the purpose of reducing taxation.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the vague and inflated promise made by Fianna Fáil in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to bring two-thirds of people down to the ordinary standard rate of taxation is a gross deception here in our circumstances. To reduce the number of people who are paying the higher rates of taxation to two-thirds means that only 33 per cent of those people will be paying them when Fianna Fáil have had their way.  At the moment, according to the Minister's figures, that figure is 43 per cent, so he is talking about changing the rates of 10 per cent of taxpayers as his contribution to making the change in our taxation system, and the effects of that will be insufficient.  It will not be achieved. The reason is that altering tax bands to give the figure of 43 per cent to which he referred in his speech will mean that it will be 45 per cent, 47 per cent or 48 per cent before this year is out.  That is the problem.  The higher rates of taxation will be greatly increased at the end of this year rather than reduced.  That is the inexorable logic of what has been told to us today and there is no point in pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>We are walking away from tax reform in this budget.  An interesting acknowledgement of the fact that high taxation has a disincentive effect is the arrangement which applies in relation to building society and bank deposits and the confidentiality which has been afforded to banks in order to outweigh the DIRT taxation scheme.  If it is seriously felt that higher rates of taxation would be a disincentive to people to make deposits at even those very attractive interest rates we have today, those higher rates of taxation would also have a disincentive effect on every other form of enterprise. The truth shines out that the high rates of taxation which we suffer under have a very strong disincentive effect and will prevent us making any recovery.</P>
    <P>Even if we accept that the existing deficit makes any progress towards tax <Col N="836" /> reform far more difficult there is still room for political thinking as to how assessment of taxation should be changed in the short term and the long term.  I suggest that no party in this House has attempted to consider seriously the Commission on Taxation Report.  No party in this House has ever suggested what they believe the level of personal and corporate taxation should be.  These matters have never been the subject of honest appraisal by any of the parties in this House save our own party and for having the bravery to do that we have received nothing but abuse.  I am also going to suggest that the question of taxation is not one which this country can afford to ignore.  With the perfection of the internal market in the EC we are going to be forced into approximate and in direct taxation in our excise taxes.  Even if that is postponed until after 1992, more than five years from today, it will not be postponed for more than five years thereafter. Therefore, in the next decade the question of indirect excise taxes will have to be tackled by this House.</P>
    <P>The obligation to bring them into line with the spirit of the rest of Europe will be forced upon us.  In that matter our sovereignty in regard to fixing tax rates will be undermined by the advancement of the unification of the EC.  Once the internal market is perfected it will be as possible and realistic to have a different rate of income tax in this jurisdiction as it would be to have different rates of tax between Kerry and Cork.  There will be no possibility of stemming the outflow of enterprise capital and workers, so maintaining the widely developed tax system which this House has had for the last 15 years.  It is not a question of this House saying that lower taxation is something which we cannot afford; it will be thrust upon us.  In addition to that, even if it were not for the EC our standing geographically between the British economy and the American economy &mdash; although we are separated from America by distance at least we have a community of language &mdash; means that our taxation system will never be capable of a radically <Col N="837" /> different solution, and Britain's movement of capital and labour is high.</P>
    <P>We are an avowed party of low taxation confronted with a budget which causes a problem.  The effect of the budget, even though disguised and implicit rather than explicit, is to raise the burden of taxation, but, having regard to the dramatic refutation which this budget represents in relation to what was put forward for the people by Fianna Fáil and having regard to the fact that it is a necessary if insufficient step on the road to righting our economic wrongs, we believe that the increase in taxation implicit in this budget is not a feature the public will support.</P>
    <P>I turn to a number of areas of the budgetary policy as put forward.  First there is an increase in taxation in excess of £20 million due to be achieved if the Minister can enforce the regulations.  He says that from today he will prohibit duty-free carriage of goods by persons who have remained less than 48 hours outside the State.  This regulation meets the Minister's statement that he proposes to discuss the matter with other European nations.  This falls foul of the Treaty of Rome.  I do not believe that he will be able to sustain it but if he does, if he is capable of doing that, then I am sure that there are areas along the Border which will be very grateful to the Minister for stemming the flow of money North of the Border, but one wonders whether he will be able to sustain this.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the moneys which it is alleged will be saved by reason of this efficiency programme in relation to the unemployed.  Who is going to interview these unemployed people, these 150,000 people?  How are they going to be interviewed?  Who is to be the interviewer? Is this, under the guise of an interview, an effort to sort out those who are in the black economy and to flush them out in order to examine their circumstances more carefully?  How are the 40,000 jobs the Manpower service are to provide to be financed and in what circumstances are people to be employed <Col N="838" /> in this way?  These matters have not been outlined to the House.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of the £25 million which the State expects to gain by virtue of introducing a withholding tax on certain fees paid to professional people.  I have no doubt there are many cases where the State pays fees to professional people who are tax defaulters and tax dodgers.  This cannot be seen as anything but a temporary bringing forward of revenue.  In the last analysis there are, as has been correctly suggested by Deputy Noonan, many cases in which this withholding tax will cause chaos in the ranks of those who are providing services of a professional kind to the State. Architects with very substantial overheads will find that a 35 per cent withholding tax will throw their cash flow into total confusion.  If that 35 per cent is withheld in the context of a loss-making concern or a concern that is only breaking even, the effect of its implementation will be to drive professional firms dealing with the State into liquidation or at least to make them raise their fees when dealing with the State to compensate for this cash flow loss.  Therefore, the £25 million which is sought to be recovered under this heading will not be as substantial in the long run as is thought.  The £25 million may never materialise, even in this financial year.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 10 per cent in the amount that can be claimed on mortgage interest relief is also, under any disguise, increased taxation.  It is not increased taxation, as suggested by the Minister, which hurts the rich more than the poor; it is a proportionate tax which will hit very hard the families who are least able to afford it.  The rich who may have larger mortgages, but who have a larger surplus and discretionary incomes to meet it, will be affected less by it.  It is not progressive as suggested by the Minister; it is purely proportionate among householders and, in the last analysis, it will probably cause injustice.  It is not supported by any theoretical argument as to why it should be brought about.  Why is it being reduced to 90 per cent and why is this rate to be <Col N="839" /> considered later in the light of interest rates?  Is it a progressive abolition of mortgage interest that has started here today?  If so, let us hear the reasoning behind it.  Are we going towards 50 per cent of zero per cent?  Is the official departmental thinking which advised the Minister to introduce the 10 per cent in this case based on any long-term conception as to whether mortgage interest relief should be retained?  I query that.  I wonder to what extent we will be enlightened in the course of the passage of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the moneys which it is assumed will be generated by the task force on tax collection.  As I understand it, this task force consists in the main of 25 public servants with no experience in the area of tax collection.  It is my understanding they are a remnant of the Department of the Public Service who found themselves physically isolated in another office and who have been told that henceforth they are to become experts in tax collection.  It is not that easy.  Anyone who has carefully read the contents of the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation can only draw the conclusion that there is a great deal more wrong with our tax collection process than could possibly be remedied by bringing together the efforts of 25 inexperienced and inexpert people to swell the ranks of those who are already labouring under an inadequate and inoperable system.  Where are the additional remedies to recover tax?  Where is the Government's serious concern to implement the additional methods of recovery proposed by the Commission on Taxation?  I suggest that these 25 people will not generate £10 million or anything like it.  They will not succeed in unleashing untold sums in tax which have been withheld from the State by taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The real problem lies in changing the relationship between the Collector General's department and the inspectorate. One is assessing at a great rate liability to taxation and the other is unable, because of a lack of power, to do anything about it.  There is not merely lack of cooperation <Col N="840" /> between the two bodies, there is hostility between them.  In many cases tax inspectors in rural areas assess tax which they know to be due but because the Collector General's office operates from Dublin none of that tax is collected. Many people who have some acquaintance with the system of tax collection are driven to the conclusion that merely to throw 25 people in these circumstances into a losing battle against bureaucracy, outdated legislation and so on is to do nothing to solve the problem.  This £10 million which the Minister says he will collect in that way is funny money.</P>
    <P>Some £20 million is likely to be recovered by way of eliminating short-term duty free importation of goods, £14.2 million by way of job search interview scheme, £8 million in relation to efficiencies, £25 million in respect of the withholding tax and £10 million as a result of the efforts of the task force on taxation. That amounts to £77 million which is a vital element in reducing the percentage deficit to the low level which the Minister claims will be reached.  There is a large question mark over much of that money.  A lot of it is clearly suspect.  I want to put on record my suspicion that these sums of moneys will not be available to the Exchequer and the deficit will be greater than what is now suggested. On the other hand, if the Minister is correct and if I have arrived at these suspicions too quickly or if I am wrong, then I fully concede that some, if not all, of those steps are a sensible way of trying to bridge the gap.  However, in general terms, I have reservations about their practicability.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the Minister's budget speech which was commendably short was what was not stated in it.  The public sector borrowing requirement was not stated or articulated.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement was stated.  I am left with the suspicion that it is the Minister's intention to increase non-Exchequer borrowing and to describe borrowings by semi-State bodies as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister came to the House with a speech and he outlined certain proposals.  However, the proposals are unintelligible as outlined by him because of his brevity.  They are mainly contained in tables which were handed to some Members of the House at a late stage in the debate.  I must pay tribute here to the proposals brought forward by Deputy John Bruton, when he was in a position to do so, for the reformation of the budgetary process.  We face here today a budget which was set out in tables.  We do not see in place a budget which is fairly and squarely set out in the Minister's speech, nor would anyone listening to that speech have a clear view of the effect on ordinary people of the implementation of the measures he is outlining in these tables.  It is regrettable that the development has taken place in this budget speech that it has become more detached from reality and less intelligible than was the case.</P>
      <P>Our budgetary process is bad enough as it is.  The Estimates as provided are difficult enough to follow.  There are cynics who say that they are compiled with a view to making them obscure and that the documents which arrive in the autumn of each year, which sets out the programmes and explain them nine months too late for anybody to decide whether those programmes are justified or not, would be far better as a basis for a budget debate than the Book of Estimates with which we are confronted. There are those who say that categorisations of moneys and of expenditures set out in the Books of Estimates are wholly inadequate and wholly antiquated, being based on mid-19th century legislation at the most recent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these are valid criticisms of our budgetary process.  This House is not now in a position, even with all the documentation which has been handed out after the Minister's speech, really to understand the exact intent of the <Col N="842" /> Government in relation to each of the changes they have proposed.  That is undesirable.  Even if the ordinary budgetary process had been followed here the House would be at a disadvantage, as would the ordinary Deputies of the House.  I am suggesting that the Minister, with the public accounts committee, should expedite the implementation of the programme <i>A Better Way to Balance the Nation's Finances</i>.  He should expedite, with that committee, a real change in the manner in which the budget is reviewed by this House.  I have grave doubts as to whether what we are doing today is constitutional at all because we are not doing what the Constitution requires us to do, today certainly.  By the time the Estimates have been passed most of the money will have been spent. The 1956 Act which permits 80 per cent of any particular Estimate which was voted last year to be spent this year is of doubtful constitutionality.</P>
    <P>This House is supposed to approve each Estimate, to be able to understand each Estimate.  The budgetary system as heretofore falls far short of what the Constitution requires of us.  Anything the Minister does to improve the budgetary procedures and to bring the reality of what we do in this House into line with what the Constitution requires us to do and to make the debates on Estimates a real examination of a forward budgetary process rather than a retrospective validation of things which cannot at that stage be cured will be supported by this party.  I have a personal suggestion that the Committee on Public Expenditure and the Committee of Public Accounts should be one single committee, or that the Committee of Public Accounts should be given the functions of the Committee on Public Expenditure so that a good super-committee of this House could address these issues other than in the now entirely narrow confines in which the public accounts committee find themselves at the moment and the rather unreal and pointless activities which the public expenditure committee under Deputy Keating found themselves involved in on many occasions because <Col N="843" /> they could not change anything even though they could criticise.</P>
    <P>There are many features in the budget which I believe require some degree of amendment.  One may appear small at this stage because the Minister found it in place when he came into office; this was the excise increase of 9.9p per gallon on non-auto LPG.  That was the same increase per gallon as was applied to heating fuels.  The problem is that LPG cannot be equated on a one to one basis, gallon per gallon, with heating fuels.  I am aware of one factory in Arklow making glazed ceramic ware for export and the domestic market which have converted to LPG as their primary source of power and which, as a result of the increase in the rate of excise on LPG, will have to face this year an increase in their energy budget of £25,000.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that LPG cannot be marked and one cannot differentiate between its use by some visible characteristic, but it should not be beyond the Minister's capacity to allow a rebate for industrial users if the import of what he was doing was to catch home users of LPG for heating purposes and put them on the same basis as central heating oil users.  Even at this stage it is not too late for the Minister to consider whether it is unfair, artificial and arbitrary to ascribe to LPG per gallon the same value as heating oil when the two fuels are not comparable and when they have the effect of increasing disadvantageously one form of energy as against another, with no particular national interest involved.</P>
    <P>I want to make as strongly as I can a point in relation to the charge of £10 per night for patients in public hospital wards who are not covered by the GMS.  It is well appreciated by everybody in this House that it is not just the rich who will be caught by this measure.  Those with very modest incomes indeed, of less than £6,000 or £120 per week, will find themselves paying, if they are hospitalised say, for four weeks, a vast amount of money. Unless there is some scheme to compensate these people, some method by <Col N="844" /> which they will be saved this expense the financial damage and hurt it will do to them and their families will be incalculable. It will absorb most of their disposable incomes and leave their families penniless.  It will send them to moneylenders and banks.  It will eat into any savings they may have.  It will be an extremely grave imposition on those people.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Minister that they are the people who are being asked to pay more under the legislation to be proposed tomorrow by way of health levy &mdash; if that means anything, which I doubt.  Some of these people are paying more in terms of PRSI.  Is it not the case that they deserve particular consideration and that the introduction of a charge of this kind, which is designed to eliminate waste to some extent and to prove an incentive to people not to be unnecessarily hospitalised, will come hardest on those who are the sickest and the weakest?  Can it not have some feeling put in it?  Is there some provision which the Government can come up with even now, to suggest that it should not exceed a certain amount in each week or each month, or that some allowance should be made for people who are crippled by bills of this kind?</P>

Is this the beginning of a process or is it to be the end of the matter?  Is there a long-term plan for that scheme?  The House deserves to be informed.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters I want to briefly identify which do not appear to have been dealt with in this budget and which the people were told would be dealt with.  There is no provision for the product identification centre mentioned in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  What is proposed in relation to the promotion of Ireland as a major financial centre is entirely vague; there is no concrete proposal in relation to it.  There is nothing new proposed in relation to research and development.  The business development scheme has not been extended as promised. There is no new provision, as was promised for expansion of the national gas grid.  There is no indication of promised tax incentives for mineral exploitation. There is no financial provision made, of which we are aware, for the agricultural food council.  As far as we are aware neither is there any provision made for the land authority or its funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision made, as was promised, for drainage in western areas. There is no provision made for reorganising the half bred horse industry under a reorganised Bord na gCapall.  I am under the impression, contrary to what is contained in the Fianna Fáil programme, that that body is to be abolished. There is no provision made of which we are aware for the promised horticultural development authority. There is no provision made for the proposed investment programme in horticulture or for the new forestry semi-State body about which we were told. There are no moneys made available for <Col N="846" /> the marine research and technology institute about which we were told.  There is no money made available for investment in shipping even though the business expansion scheme has been extended in that direction.</P>
    <P>No new moneys have been provided for the inland fisheries research and development process, no new resources provided for the implementation of the provisions of the Air Pollution Bill now before the House or for the prevention of water pollution mentioned in their programme. No moneys have been provided for development of the financial services areas, whether that is to be undertaken; it may be that they have been provided but we are not told.  No provision has been made for reliefs of any kind for the entertainment industry which formed such an important part of the programme for national recovery.</P>

No new moneys have been provided for regional manpower boards or for counselling services.  No new moneys have been provided for the decentralisation programme with the exception of £1 million.  I should like to hear from the Minister at some stage what £1 million he has in mind.  For example, we are talking about a decentralisation to Sligo? Is there one particular scheme in mind? There appears to be £1 million provided for that.  Neither is there any provision made for the costing of a local broadcasting authority and, of course, none for reducing &mdash; as was pointed out by Deputy Noonan &mdash; builders' VAT rates from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.  Nor is there any provision, of which we are aware, for the construction industry development board or for the five year plan for local authority roads maintenance.  Neither is there provision made to finance the promised reduction in planning and development charges or to finance the proposed advisory body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I must advise him that that is not the custom on a statement.  Unless the Deputy is advocating that the Budget Statement is all the weaker for having omitted those, then the point would not appear to be appropriate in respect of this statement. On Second Stage debate the Deputy can refer to what is not proposed but, unless the Deputy is going to proceed to make the statement that he regrets the omission of the expenditure that would provide for that miscellany, then it would seem to me to be rather fruitless to be making the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  It boils down to this, that this budget is one which increases taxation, which seeks to eliminate a number of heads of public spending.  In so far as it does the latter we commend it because it is important that this House comes to grips with the level of public expenditure.  In so far as it increases taxation we regret it.  In so far as it represents, as I have pointed out, a departure from what was promised, an improvement on what was promised and for which a mandate was sought, we breathe a collective sigh of relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the effect of this budget I must say it is not consistent with the 2.5 per cent growth rate on which the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was predicted.  There will be no growth of that kind this year.  This is a deflationary budget.  I shall finish on this point.  Had a mandate been sought with honesty and courage from the people for measures of this kind, for the measures which must inevitably follow in order to reduce taxation to render this country one in which private enterprise can thrive, had the <Col N="848" /> people been asked to pass judgment on a programme which would have taken a number of years to implement but which had the inherent promise of a major reform of public spending, taxation, reduced taxation and a reform of our methods of borrowing this Government would be immeasurably stronger.  I dare say they would not be relying on the support of others in this House to push through these measures.  Rather such measures would have constituted the first step in a sustained programme in respect of which there would be a clearly stated political mandate.</P>
    <P>What I regret so much is that this reversal, though welcome, leaves us in the position that the Government have forgotten completely the very basis on which they sought support.  I look back with some degree of regret &mdash; and I am not saying this bitterly &mdash; to the huge billboards around this city stressing what would happen if there were cuts in health and who they would hurt.  I look at the thinking that went into that and the effort implicit in that advertising campaign to build up a strong constituency against any reduction in public expenditure.  I contrast that with what has happened here today.  I say it is a welcome surprise but I express a deep and lasting disappointment that what could have been achieved has not been, that a great opportunity to build the political will to rebuild this country's finances was thrown away in the interests of political opportunism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to tease out the precise implications of the budget in terms of its deflationary impact on the economy, on the new figure for GNP which has not been stated and on its exact redistributive impact.  For example, there is a substantial reduction in the environment programme of approximately £35 million on the capital side.  One must pose the question when the details are available, what will be the precise impact of that on the live register?  For example, the various measures are outlined in the current Estimates which also indicate an impact on employment but the details are very imprecise at present.  One way or <Col N="849" /> the other, with those two reservations &mdash; in that as yet we do not know the new live register figure for 1987, and presumably there is a revised figure; we do not know the revised GNP figure for 1987 and presumably there is a revision in that also &mdash; it is noted that we are down to a current deficit of 6.9 per cent of GNP and an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £11.7 million.</P>
      <P>How that was calculated has not been disclosed to this House as yet.</P>
      <P>Pending that information we will suspend judgment on the accuracy and correctness of the figures.  Certainly I intend to make some comments on the way the Estimates have been constructed here. There are some quite alarming statements made which give grounds for grave doubt as to whether by mid-year we will be at 6.9 per cent of GNP or at around 8 per cent of GNP.  From what I have read so far all the indications are that we will rapidly go back up to 8 per cent if the internal inconsistencies in the revised Estimates are adhered to.  Indeed, inconsistencies are manifestly evident even in the documentation we got here today.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all that, this is quite an extraordinary budget.  It is extraordinary in that it has an element of conversion on the road to Damascus in it. The Fianna Fáil budget of 1982 fell apart by the middle of June and one has to go back to the early seventies to find a budget which has as many surprises. Officially, Deputy Haughey, now the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance are prepared to accept that there is a great need for control of public expenditure and for simultaneously increasing taxation in order to maintain the essential social services but the way they have gone about it poses very considerable questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point which must be made relates to the massive increase projected for income tax revenue for 1987, a projected increase of from £2.388 billion to £2.721 billion, a projected increase in income tax of close on 14 per cent.  This is probably the highest ever projected increase in income tax yield and it will <Col N="850" /> impose an exceptional major increase in income tax on those who pay virtually all the income tax, namely, the ordinary PAYE workers.  If we are to pay for essential public services, inevitably taxation will tend to go up.  Yet, notwithstanding the figure for income tax we have the abandonment of the land tax by the Fianna Fáil Government, and the substitution of a mere £9 million in VAT revenue receipts.  The inconsistency of attempting to do anything at all in relation to PAYE or income tax revenue is manifestly evident for all concerned. When Deputy Haughey came into the House last June in a long polemical statement on a Private Members' motion of no confidence at column 180 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>Within the income tax category the estimated proportion of tax from PAYE as opposed to income tax from farmers and self-employed has risen from 87 per cent in 1982 to 90.3 per cent in 1986.  They are not my figures, they were given in an oral answer by the predecessor to the Minister for Finance on 20 February 1986.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:</P>
    <P>Income tax and PAYE as a proportion of total tax has increased from 31.3 per cent in 1982 to 32.3 per cent in 1986.  These figures do not however, include levies deducted at source.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey then went on to confirm that with the levies included, income tax from the PAYE sector would grow to 34 per cent.  I would hazard a guess that the PAYE contribution now has gone up from 90.3 per cent in 1986 to 94 per cent or 95 per cent of total tax revenue.  We have this extraordinary budget which copperfastens the fundamental inequity in our tax system, whereby for the most part those who bear the burden of taxation are those who are liable for PAYE contributions of income tax, and for the most part the self-employed and the farming community do not pay a fair contribution.  That is the fundamental issue at the moment in meeting the cost of running our social services and the country.  This has not been faced up to <Col N="851" /> by any party in the Dáil other than the Labour Party who, through Deputy Kavanagh, managed to get a land tax established.  This was done despite great difficulty in Government at the time in having any kind of a land tax introduced giving any kind of a yield.  We introduced it and today it is being abolished.  We are reaching a stage in relation to contributions from that sector where it looks as though it will be one unending constitutional wrangle from one High Court case to the next and from one Supreme Court decision to the next because as the Taoiseach knows now all hell will break loose in relation to VAT returns as they affect registered farmers and non-registered farmers.  After they get working on the back benchers, the Taoiseach will be running in here with modifications which will reduce the yield again.</P>
    <P>My heart does not bleed in the slightest as a result of the special plea made by Deputy McDowell on behalf of the legal profession in relation to withholding tax. It is about time it was put on.  That was one of the proposals of the Labour Ministers in Government.  We fought tooth and nail to get that in, but we did not succeed.  I am glad it is in now and I welcome it.  The £26 million, small as it is from those sources, is welcome.  With due respects to those concerned in those professions, they are not singularly ill-paid. I know a lot of people in my constituency would not agree with me in that regard, but we must all pay and that includes the self-employed in those professions.</P>
    <P>We are now down to the reaction, the understandable reaction.  A great deal of anger at this budget will be generated by PAYE workers.  Not only is there no tax relief but there is a substantial tax increase.  The health contributions will be increased to 1.25 per cent and the income ceiling will be raised to £15,000.  The level of contribution in respect of PRSI will also be substantially raised but in return we will get a substantial reduction in benefits and entitlements.</P>
    <P>I can foresee the reaction of the <Col N="852" /> employee who finds himself paying substantially more income tax and who, if he has been in hospital for a week, will get a bill for £70 to pay for a bed to which up to now he had free entitlement.  I remind the Taoiseach that under the national understanding public beds in hospitals were provided free of charge. That is now being abolished and a charge of £10 for a bed in a public ward is being imposed.  That will provoke great anger among insured workers.  From next Monday, a worker with a wife and two children who is made redundant, goes to his employment exchange and, assuming his average earnings have been £200 a week or £10,000 a year, his unemployment benefit claim will be reduced by £17.50 pay-related benefit, the result of the halving of the pay-related benefit. In any town, such a worker may meet a farmer neighbour who has a medical card by virtue of the non-existence of an income tax return or of a declared income.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach now wants to introduce an accounts system.  I foresee great difficulty in this.  Here we go again, from farm tax to VAT clawback, then the notional system of farm tax assessment. I foresee enormous problems facing the Government when they attempt once again to construct a farm income assessment system with the farming community paying tax under an income tax system in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I suggest with profound respect to the Taoiseach that the Government have abolished the farm classification and have decimated much of the fundamental work done in terms of the basic assessment of incomes.  The Revenue Commissioners are inflexible.  They could not even operate a simple system of child benefit clawback in respect of the farming community.  God protect us if they attempt a system of income taxation assessment for the farming community.  I say that harshly because I hold the view <Col N="853" /> that there should be a separate Minister responsible for taxation collection.</P>
      <P>Once again I see the fundamental difficulty in raising the necessary revenue to pay for social services when 200,000 people do not pay the same proportion of tax as the PAYE workers.</P>

How will it affect the GNP aggregates?  Where does it appear in terms of the final outturn of 6.9 per cent of GNP?  If this information is available, perhaps the Minister would tell the House.  I believe these Estimates are contrived to say the least.  I was very critical of the last Government's Health Estimate.  It was contrived not by any malintention but largely due to the events which occurred towards the end of that Government's decision-making process.  In the end it was put in the Estimates and now it comes up like a sore thumb here.</P>

      <P>Under the Education Estimate there is an extraordinary series of statements. The savings projected are £3.860 million. It said in the original Estimate that the proceeds of the National Lottery would be available to fund sport and sport-related activities.  Under this Estimate the savings are to grow from £3.860 million to £6 million.  Here we have a unique statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving is increased to £6.060 million on the basis that some of the proceeds from the National Lottery will be devoted to sports organisations <Col N="854" /> and that the National Youth Policy is not to be implemented....</P>
    <P>That requires close examination.  God help the poor National Lottery.  Its projected yield is only £7 million.  Since health, the arts and sports are to get allocations from this lottery, I would be very interested in hearing the Minister's explanation of that statement.</P>
    <P>I notice that the overall budgetary cost of abolishing the farm tax will be £9 million and that by way of rate support grant the local authorities will be given an additional £13 million.  That needs examination. Is that going to be given or is it a formal Government decision to allocate an additional £13 million rates support in lieu of the £9 million which would accrue to the local authorities?  The first quarter of the year has passed and by the time the circular is issued and we get bureaucracy moving, April will have passed and one-third of the year will have passed.  I appreciate that there can be great difficulty in controlling 14 Cabinet colleagues &mdash; although I assume they are very acquiescent, unlike the Coalition Cabinet.</P>

An interesting concept.  It goes on to say that the economies in the provision of the third level services will grow from £1.875 million to £4.525 million. Arising from what?  Greater efficiency.  It says that greater efficiency will be achieved in the running of the HEA institutions. That is a tricky way of saving money.  I remember being berated by very competent mandarins in the Department of Finance when I dared to suggest that we had achieved savings in health by greater efficiency.  They said I must be specific and that it must be a policy decision.  They told me I had to go through my savings line by line saying <Col N="855" /> who, where and what.  I know from negotiations with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, that that kind of statement would not be passed by a Cabinet seriously concerned about controlling the public Estimates.</P>

      <P>In addition, there are going to be increases of up to £2 per pupil per term.  These are to be introduced from 1 September and are included in the £700,000.  Community and comprehensive schools have been docked £500,000.  They are going to save £500,000 by greater efficiency.  I would love to know the community schools currently wasting money to the tune of £500,000.  In the regional technical colleges £1 million is going to be saved by greater efficiency.</P>
      <P>Any third rate Minister for Finance can take any Book of Estimates and he can take out £1 million here and cut out £1 million there and write in the words &ldquo;greater efficiencies&rdquo;.  There is only one slight problem.  Come September it will be hung around his neck.  I have great doubts about the capacity of the Minister for Education, tough woman and Deputy as she is, in the context of that kind of Government decision, to implement the provisions of the Estimate.  All this builds up to 6.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extraordinarily, there is going to be an extra £5 million on ESF moneys arising <Col N="856" /> from greater than expected receipts.  I wonder where Deputy Bruton was a few weeks ago.

I am aware that there have been substantial increases in terms of ESF receipts into the country but I was not aware that the Department of Education were going to be allocated an extra £5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take your word on it but I have grave doubts about consistency in this regard.  It is important to look at the precise analysis.  There is a further £400,000 to be saved under ACOT and AFT by savings through greater economies.  Specifically, one must ask exactly what are these economies to be.  A third of the year has now gone and, by the time these measures leading to greater economies are implemented, I am quite certain we will be well into the summer and I can see little prospect of their being made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the Labour vote.  Again, I do not know of any socially justifiable reason for the cut.  I do not want to sound unduly personal, but there has always been an enormous antipathy within the Department of Finance to the various schemes, such as the social employment scheme, the Teamwork scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme, and the many other proposals put forward. Having docked another £930,000 from AnCO on top of the £50 million which on a totally regressive basis was being docked, there is the appalling decision that new single participants in the social <Col N="857" /> employment scheme will have their payment reduced from £70 to £60 per week. I do not know what the rationale behind this move is.  The former Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, is well aware of the discussions in Government as regards the payment of £70 per week.  That payment is now being reduced to £60 per week while simultaneously it is hoped that there will be a substantial uptake under the social employment scheme. Recruitment to the scheme is being increased by 1,500 in the current year. The consistency of that policy decision is open to question in a very big way.</P>
    <P>Likewise, under the Teamwork scheme the reduction in allowances payable to new participants will be from £70 to £60 per week.  That reduction is expected to produce a saving of £500,000 in the current year.  It most certainly will. The statement went on that the new rate is still set at a level which is attractive to young unemployed people participating in the scheme.  It is going to be rather difficult to explain to young people as and from tonight that their payments under the Teamwork scheme will be reduced from £70 to £60 per week but they should still find the scheme attractive.  That is a regressive policy change and one which does not stand up in terms of attracting a young person into the scheme.  Again, that decision is open to question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to refer briefly to some of the other points before going on to some of the major ones. There is a cut of almost £750,000 in the allocation of CTT.  CTT have been given a very simple policy decision.  Their original estimate has already been reduced substantially and now it is going to be cut by a further £750,000 and they are being told to achieve this reduction through greater economies.  Apparently, no other aspect of the Government decision is included here.  Obviously, a great many decisions have been taken on a global basis.  They have not been confirmed by way of precise Government decisions which, in effect, would put the cuts into operation.  Where they have been adopted a number are very regressive.</P>
      <P>I now come to the position with regard to social welfare.  I have the greatest doubts about the intensified job search programme.  I do not know who dreamt that up.  It certainly did not exist in my time in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, there were three pilot schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilot schemes were under the aegis of Manpower.  To suggest that there would be a saving of £11.5 million in unemployment related expenditure &mdash; according to the estimate as constructed &mdash; by virtue of the introduction of an intensified job search programme is not realistic.  I will read what is proposed to be done.  According to the Principal Features of the Budget a major expansion of £150,000 in the throughput of the NMS-operated job search programme &mdash; this is based on three pilot schemes and would refer to a couple of hundred people &mdash; which helps the unemployed through retraining, job placement or participation in various Manpower schemes, will yield a significant consequential saving in unemployment payments. We have pencilled in £11.5 million but I would find it difficult to get an uninvolved higher executive officer in the Department of Social Welfare to stand over that figure.  I have no doubt that no <Col N="859" /> principal officer, or assistant secretary, would stand over that figure.  If I know the senior officers in charge of the public expenditure division of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance I doubt very much if they would produce that £11.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are agreed figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an ingenuous effort to construct a 6.9 per cent budget deficit of GNP.  It will not stand together. With regard to the social employment scheme the Principal Features of the Budget states that the expansion of 1,500 in recruitment to this scheme would reduce the 1987 average live register by 1,000 with a consequential saving to Social Welfare of £2.6 million.  In my view the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare by the middle of the year will be well and truly out of plum. Although I do not have much money left after the election campaign I would put a couple of pounds on that forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Health the Government made an extraordinary decision.  I was in total disagreement with the decision of the previous Government to save £3.4 million by reducing pay levels in 1987. However, the Government have decided on that £3.4 million reduction on top of the <i>Building on Reality</i> provisions which amounted to £10 million, making a total of £13.4 million.  I disagreed with those figures because I did not believe it was possible to attain them or, if it was, it would impose enormous hardships resulting in the removal of 1,300 jobs out of the health services within nine months. In my view it would completely destroy any allocations to agencies.  However, in the budget savings have been increased from £3.4 million to £14.4 million through &ldquo;no new recruitment&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance, are well aware that in the health services there is no such thing as &ldquo;no new recruitment&rdquo;. A cardiac surgeon who retires is replaced by a cardiac surgeon or else a hospital will cease to function.  If a senior theatre <Col N="860" /> sister retires she is replaced.  It is not possible in the health services to implement a policy of &ldquo;no new recruitment&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be very attenuated if the Government had given time to discuss that legislation.  I will not have another opportunity to discuss it.  I do not accept that the decrease in the Health Estimate of a further £11 million can be achieved in 1987, despite the statement that key vacancies will be filled by redeployment or promotions.  If that is done at least 1,000 jobs will not be filled in the health services this year.</P>
      <P>I must disagree with the statement by the Minister that as an offsetting measure against the decision not to go ahead with the introduction of prescription charges which would, allegedly, have saved £16.5 million, he will now be able to obtain £6 million in charges for public wards on the basis of £10 per day for non-medical card patients.  Is it the intention to charge maternity patients the £10?  I would be glad to hear that they will be exempt.  Will children under the age of 16 be exempt? According to the draft Government decisions there was a major effort to impose that provision on me but, for obvious reasons, I would not wear it.  Will children, currently legally exempt from charges, be exempt from the £10 charge? Since section 62 of the Health Act, 1970, prohibits charges in relation to maternity I should like to know if that exemption will continue to apply.  Under the Health Act, 1947, those with infectious diseases &mdash; I presume we can include AIDS in that category &mdash; were not liable for public ward charges and I should like to know if that prohibition will continue.  We need a lot more information on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out that that move will affect about 600,000 people.  Many people will automatically find themselves obliged to pay the £10 charge.  Only about half of those outside the medical card category are in the VHI.  I understand that about 350,000 people are members of the VHI which means that there will be 300,000 other families caught for the £10 charge.  That will be a substantial imposition by any stretch of the imagination. The imposition of a £70 a week charge with the consequential difficulty of endeavouring to introduce a new system of administration will affect many <Col N="862" /> people.  How does one bring in a new system of administration and a £10 charge when there will be no new recruitment in the hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Deputy to desist from elaborating on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are totally opposed to the introduction of that draconian measure.  It is a fundamental withdrawal of the public health entitlements of the vast bulk of middle income families who are paying their taxes.  I had no hesitation whatsoever in bringing in a £100 charge in relation to farmers who did not pay their health contributions. That was quite fair and reasonable, but it is totally wrong to bring in a £10 charge in this budget.  We reject it adamantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the other major change in social welfare proposed in the Budget Statement.  I am sorry that the Government have taken the retrograde decision to increase the minimum number of social insurance contributions from 26 to 39 before a person qualifies for disability benefit, unemployment benefit and maternity allowances.  Many of the people affected by this live in Deputy Haughey's constituency.  A person must now have nine months' contributions before qualifying for any of those major benefits including maternity allowances. It is a pretty mean and vicious decision to take.  It is bad enough having nine months of maternity but now one must have nine months' contributions before one is eligible for maternity allowances. Ten thousand people will fail to qualify this year and great hardship will be imposed on those insured workers who are ill, unemployed or pregnant.  They will not qualify for eligibility.  There will be a very irate reaction from insured workers when they discover that not only is the ceiling for social insurance going up but their eligibility is being substantially reduced.  This is one of the reasons we resigned from Government.  We could not accept a draconian proposal of this nature.  There was a proposal for a five-year contribution requirement for long <Col N="863" /> duration disability benefit.  Now it is going up from three years to four years.  It is being modified somewhat by the Fianna Fáil Government but nevertheless it means that this year about 3,000 people will fail to qualify for long duration disability benefit.  What will they do?  Off they will go, <i>á la</i> PDs means test, to the community welfare officer.  These are people who have been on extended disability benefit but will now be debarred from long duration benefit because they have not four years' contributions. They will be obliged to resort to the health boards' supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I do make the point that insured workers are having their social welfare disability reduced substantially.  We in the Labour Party reject this.  It was the late William Norton who brought into this House in 1949 the fundamental concept of social insurance.  We produced a White Paper in 1949 on social welfare and produced a Social Welfare Bill in 1951.  Progressively we introduced social insurance.  We now have a social insurance fund of £900 million a year which is being frittered away and decimated because there are people in the community who do not want to pay for social insurance.  I contrast that with the fact that we are paying about £180 million a year in non-contributory pensions to farmers, shopkeepers who have given up their shops and the self-employed who have decided they want a non-contributory pension.  They will continue to have their benefits in no way affected by this budget.  It will not be suggested that somebody should not get a pension by automatically handing over a farm to his son.  Why should there not be some contribution requirement?  There is none at all.  The insured worker is crucified under this system of claw-back of entitlements while at the same time we hand out non-contributory pensions and benefits.  That is why the Labour Party are strongly opposed to these measures and that is why we will vote against them on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House much further but I want to refer to the quite exceptional decision on the part of the Government to decimate the capital programme. It is easy to be glib about capital moneys and to decide to cut them.  This is the PD business, although at the end of Deputy McDowell's peroration he listed about 18 measures on which he wanted to spend an extra couple of hundred million, <Col N="865" /> but simultaneously he wanted a reduction in taxation.  I deplore the decision of the Government to cut another £2 million from the special amenity grants scheme. The scheme has not been cut &mdash; it has been terminated.</P>

      <P>Whither the heritage of Ireland?  One would not have contemplated that such a decision could be made by a Government of which Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach.  The funding for the Metropolitan Streets Commission is suspended.  Whither the ould Dub?</P>

      <P>I would suggest the Taoiseach might even be tempted to have his dear statue on top of the pillar but I do not think he could rise to that extravagance now because the £3 million for the Metropolitan Streets Commission is gone.  The Dubliners will not even be able to sing a song about it.</P>
      <P>A sum of £12 million has been slashed from the local authority house building programme.  I acknowledge that we are the best housed people in Western Europe and that there has been a decline in demand for local authority housing, but to slash the programme by £12 million is a drastic step.  In my constituency during the election campaign a widespread slogan was &ldquo;Bring back the JCBs and CJH&rdquo;.  The only JCBs we will see on the streets now will be those chasing Fianna Fáil Deputies in irate procession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £3 million has also been slashed in the sanitary services programme. A sum of £2 million of non-Exchequer funding has been provided for the necessary site acquisition and clearance cost of the development at the Custom House docks.  It is extraordinary that there should have been such a hooha regarding the press conference about this project when it will cost well in excess of £2 million to clear even half the site.  The <Col N="866" /> Minister, Deputy Flynn, will be windblown and windswept when he comes back looking for the other £3 million which was taken out of the capital Estimate today.  He certainly looked incongruous as he walked on the site.  He seemed to think he was back at Knock Airport when he stood on the seafront and said work would commence in midsummer and that anything up to 4,000 jobs would be provided.</P>
    <P>The allocation to the IDA has been reduced by a sum of £9 million.  Any Minister with a good felt pen &mdash; they are used quite a lot in Government &mdash; could go through the capital vote and knock off £7 million here and £8 million there and, hey presto, it will all come out at 6.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I thought my eyesight was defective when I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27 March that the Taoiseach said that the National Development Corporation would &ldquo;play an important role in helping firms to grow in strength and provide viable long term jobs through share capital and management expertise&rdquo;.  What has happened?  The allocation has been reduced by £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stood in the foyer of Beaumont Hospital and waxed eloquent about the faults of the previous Minister but I notice that the allocation for hospital building equipment and furnishing allocations has been reduced by a further £3 million.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party, in Government or in Opposition, accept the overriding need to keep a reasonable balance in terms of public finances and taxation but we reject the prescription in today's budget as we did in Government. In Opposition we cannot, for the most part, accept what Fianna Fáil did today. I support their taxation measures but the mixture is wrong because the balance of taxation once again has swung quite sharply against the 880,000 people who pay their income tax and PRSI every week and who have established a fundamental entitlement to benefits.  It has not had an impact on the rich apart from the mortgage interest relief provisions which, in any event, apply to those on a relatively high income and who are quite capable of contributing towards the maintenance of social programmes and public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, the Labour Party do not support the budget.  In many respects, it is quite extraordinary and when the details are fully thrashed out it will be regarded as a budget which most people <Col N="868" /> would not support.  Indeed, I have great reservations regarding its prospect of maintaining cohesion and consistency because, although the Taoiseach underwent a major political change of mind, I am not so sure that the Cabinet will have the determination or the confidence to push through measures which are so inherently regressive that they will provoke a backlash within the Fianna Fáil organisation which will not enable them to be implemented.  Even with the tacit support of the Fine Gael Party and the confused support of the Progressive Democrats it will still be seen as a socially unbalanced budget which has done nothing for employment, exacerbated taxation imbalances and caused further social divisions between town and country, taxpayer and non-taxpayer, tax evader and tax contributor.  For these reasons we do not support the budget and I regret the fact that we must pass all these measures by Thursday evening.</P>

      <P>I doubt that many Radio I listeners have survived that marathon. I must open with a nice quote from the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&ldquo;Every day in every way Fianna Fáil grow more like Fine Gael in all respects and next Tuesday's budget will provide final confirmation&rdquo;. That has been proved true in this budget.  People now must be scratching their heads wondering what was the point in having an election at all.  All that has changed is the faces around the Cabinet table.  The actors have changed but the script remains the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of the last two months show why so many people are cynical and disillusioned by Irish politics.  In January the detested former Government introduced a savage budget which led to the collapse of the Government and a general election. The election was fought on the basis of the budget, with Fine Gael defending it and Fianna Fáil attacking it vigorously. The Taoiseach and his colleagues portrayed themselves during the campaign as the defenders of the poor and the weakest sections of society, opponents of health and welfare cuts, champions of the working class and defenders of the public <Col N="869" /> sector, every sector which is hit in this budget.</P>
    <P>The people voted on 17 February, leading to some of the heaviest losses the Fine Gael Party had ever suffered as the authors and defenders of the budget. Fianna Fáil were returned to power but the people now find to their cost that Fianna Fáil election promises has about as much value as a national lottery ticket, an &ldquo;Instant 3&rdquo; with two stars.  The very same budget that people thought of voting decisively to reject in the election is now reintroduced by Fianna Fáil in an even more severe and heartless form. There is a better way, as they said.  We all knew that Fianna Fáil were masters of the U-turn and we began to suspect what things might be like on budget day when we saw the U-turn on the Single European Act, first when Deputy Haughey was in Brussels, and then the extraordinary and remarkable turnabout in regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement while he was in Washington, but this budget has really proved that they are masters of the art.</P>
    <P>In the budget debate of last year on 5 February 1986 Deputy Haughey said that the existing levels of taxation, particularly personal taxation, were in a very large measure responsible for the prevailing mood of frustration, low morale and lack of confidence.  That was true and we agreed with him totally at that time, but the existing levels of taxation, in particular personal taxation, still remain in this budget.  The mood of frustration, low morale and lack of confidence that Deputy Haughey spoke of last year continue under this Government.  In the same debate Deputy Haughey said that the increase of 4 per cent on social welfare was completely inadequate and that it was deplorable it would not be paid until the third week of July.  Of course, in this budget it is there as a proposal of 3 per cent, not 4 per cent, on social welfare, also to be paid in the third week of July.  He said in that debate that no matter how difficult the economic and financial situation a Government had a moral duty to protect living standards of those who are their special responsibility. <Col N="870" /> As I say, they are masters of the U-turn because those principles are all thrown overboard in this budget.</P>
    <P>There is undeniable evidence for many years that the taxation system is unfair. Hundreds of thousands of people marched when the previous Fianna Fáil Government were in office in 1979 and 1980 because of the unfair taxation system.  The result was that a Fianna Fáil Government set up a Commission on Taxation.  That was all they achieved after all the marches.  This Commission on Taxation did tremendous work and produced volume after volume or reports for a period of four or five years all of which have not been reopened since by any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We are told by a number of parties here, the PDs, and Fine Gael in particular, that the overall level of taxation is too high.  That is untrue.  The overall level of taxation is not too high.  The level of personal taxation is too high.  The level of taxation on the PAYE worker is far too high, but the overall level of taxation outside that is much lower than in other countries in Europe, in Britain and elsewhere. The PAYE workers &mdash; the latest figures I have is that there are 816,000 of them &mdash; pay 90.3 per cent of all income tax.  When they were marching in 1979 and 1980 they were marching because they were paying 87 per cent of all income tax and the others were paying only 13 per cent of all income tax.  After all that marching, after all the reports of the Commission on Taxation, after all the speeches and all the demonstrations, the level of taxation for them has increased from 87 per cent to 90.3 per cent and the level of taxation for the self-employed and farmers has been reduced from 13 per cent to 9.7 per cent.  The situation is worsening all the time and now the Minister for Finance brings in a budget where the tax take from the PAYE workers is going to increase by £333 million or 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have called repeatedly and again in the general election for a beginning to be made in reducing that burden by 10 per cent, from 90 per cent of the tax <Col N="871" /> take to 80 per cent of the tax take while transferring that burden to the others who are not paying their fair share.  The PAYE sector would still be overburdened by having to pay 80 per cent of the tax take.  Of course, nobody listens; nothing is done because they take it and they vote for the various parties who are beating them into the ground.  For some reason or other they vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and now for the PDs whom they think will reduce the burden of tax on them.</P>
    <P>The budget says the Government are going to put the task force to work on the tax dodgers.  Unfortunately when you read it again you see that they are going to put 25 people, a task force, to work on bringing in the money that is outstanding. There is a difference there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said £707 million was outstanding in taxes on 31 May 1985.  That is the last figure I have.  Last year the figure was probably higher.  The self-employed, including farmers, owed £201 million.  This was money that has been assessed and is legally due and they have refused to pay. PAYE and PRSI taken from PAYE workers and not paid over by employers amounted to £104 million, health and other levies £17 million, corporation tax £207 million, taxes on capital £25 million, VAT £149 million, other taxes £3.5 million making a total of £707 million.  Why do you need a task force to bring in that money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it will not come in, as the master and expert on these matters here tells us from the back benches of Fine Gael.  When the ESB did not pay up their £16 million the Minister was very quick to take it from them, to pull it out of the till practically.  There are other people who stole money, who took money from PAYE workers in PRSI and PAYE contributors and did not hand it over to the Government.  This amounted to £104 million.  That is robbery; they are thieves, robbers, frauds.  They are acting <Col N="872" /> criminally but yet they are not in jail with the other thieves and robbers.  Why are they not prosecuted?  Rather than setting up a task force, why not simply make it plain once and for all that we will not tolerate this?  Anyone who takes money from his employee and does not hand it over is a criminal and should be prosecuted in court for robbery, thievery or fraud.  We do not need a task force consisting of people who know nothing about taxation or legal proceedings knocking on their door and asking them to pay up. We need the task force to follow up the people who are avoiding tax.  What we are dealing with is non-payment of taxes due which have already been processed. The numbers in the Revenue Commissioners have been reduced by 11 per cent.  There are now 850 fewer people in the Revenue Commissioners than at the time of the tax marches.  What is required is a serious attempt to tackle the whole area of evasion and avoidance of tax as well as prosecuting those who refuse to pay.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly been accused of being anti-farmer.  I believe the farmers are a very special case.  They say they want to be treated like everybody else, that they want to pay their income tax like everybody else but they are not like everybody else and we discover that in every budget.  In 1979 farmers paid £39 million in rates and £16 million in income tax.  Last year they paid £33 million in income tax and did not pay rates.  In this budget the Minister for Finance said he will take £35 million from the farmers, an increase of £2 million.  Last year unregistered farmers got back £17 million in VAT refunds.  That is a gimmick, a hand-out from the Exchequer to the farmers.  Why not tell them to register like everybody else?  If they want to be like everybody else then we should treat them like everybody else.  Only registered farmers should get VAT refunds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time since 1978 the Minister, in this budget, has reduced the amount of VAT refunds to farmers by £9 million.  It should be abolished and farmers should be told to register.  Even <Col N="873" /> after the reduction in VAT refunds farmers are getting back twice as much as they pay in income tax.  In addition, they get all the health services, education services, local authority services, all the services of ACOT and the services of the TB eradication scheme which costs us millions of pounds.  The money for all those services comes from the other taxpayers. The PAYE sector pay 90.7 per cent of that income tax in order to help farmers to eradicate TB, to get a decent education for their children &mdash; most of whom are in third level education &mdash; to help them with their health services, with their ACOT services and so on.  How long can society stand that?  The farmers know they are not paying enough.  They are embarrassed at the fact that they are not paying anything like their fair share. Yet, the Minister is now abolishing the land tax.</P>
    <P>I referred to the tax marches in 1979. They took place at a time when Fianna Fáil abolished the 2 per cent levy on farmers.  Workers were very annoyed that this small levy was abolished.  Later a resource tax was introduced and in 1981 Fianna Fáil abolished that tax.  In that year they refunded the money to the 10 per cent of farmers who had paid that tax.  The Coalition Government brought in a land tax which was reduced considerably, especially under Deputy Bruton who has a very big farm.  Now the new Minister has abolished the land tax. Previously farmers with 40 adjusted acres or less, the vast majority of small farmers, did not pay any land tax.  A 200-acre farmer would pay only about £30 a week under the land tax but that has been abolished now.  We are now left with a totally unjust tax system where some people pay too much and others do not pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>In the social welfare area we had hoped the Government might attack poverty rather than the poor.  I pointed out what they said this time last year.  They contributed 3 per cent, which is now less than the current rate of inflation, to those on social welfare.  A commission on social welfare has shown that the minimum income should be £60 for a single person. <Col N="874" /> One would think the new Minister would work towards that and would gradually improve within a reasonable period, for example, four, five or six years.  The single person's allowance is £37 a week. The most unjust aspect of it all is that if that person is living at home the Government take £20 or £25 a week from him which leaves him with £10 or £12.  If that person is living in a a flat, he gets £37 so that he can pay £21, £22 or £25 to his landlord.  He does not get £37 to enable him to pay £21, £22 or £25 to his mother or father who are keeping him at home. That is most extraordinary and most unjust and I cannot find a satisfactory explanation for it.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Minister has not tackled any of the real problems of those on social welfare.  The real problems were shown in the distribution of the EC food over the past number of weeks.  We have all seen long queues for this free food. Many of these people had not had meat for months and months.  They are people who have insufficient money to buy enough milk, cheese, butter and meat for their families.  They went out and queued publicly where they could find this free food.  One sees references regularly to queues for food in other countries.  If this happens in a socialist country, the news is splashed all over the front pages.</P>
    <P>You do not see queues for food here. Why?  Because if you have not the money, there is no point in queueing.  If you have the money you buy the food, but if you have not you stay at home and starve.  There is no point in queueing outside Quinnsworth, Superquinn or elsewhere if you have no money in your pocket.  As soon as the food is available, you see the queues.  That shows the problems of so many families today.  I know that it broke people's hearts that food was being distributed by the St.  Vincent de Paul Society; it meant that they were looking for charity.  They did not want to have anything to do with that society. They are a very independent people. However, they were prepared to queue publicly for that food which they needed for their families.</P>
    <P>If that is not sufficient demonstration <Col N="875" /> to the Minister of the position we have reached, what is?  That shows the level of poverty and the difficulty that people have in feeding their children.  This budget has not in any way considered that.  If the Government had abolished the VAT refund to farmers they would have had £70 million in their hands and would not have had any problem of cuts in health, or social welfare, or anything of that nature.  What do the cuts in health mean?  A woman who has a sick child goes to the doctor who now charges £10 for the visit &mdash; this charge goes up by £1 per year.  The doctor advises that the child be sent to hospital for a check-up and for one day's stay this amounts to £10, for two days £20.  There is no conception of what this means to parents and how they must struggle and fight to try to give their families a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of speaking for an hour and in general I have made the points which I wanted to make. However, I did seriously expect this budget to be a jobs budget from Fianna Fáil.  I told somebody recently that the Government were making big cuts, that they were going to cut the budget deficit but still borrow the same amount so that they would have more money for capital programmes for jobs and such things. The man to whom I was speaking said that was fair enough, that they might do that and get away with it.  What have they done?  They have cut the capital budget. They have cut the house building programme. After this, Fianna Fáil can never again say they are the party of the building industry.</P>

      <P>Last autumn, all house building by Dublin Corporation was stopped.  They are building almost no more local authority houses.  They might build 15 to 30 but the 1,500 houses they used to build are a thing of the past.  They said the £5,000 grant was releasing local authority houses because people were buying houses elsewhere.  That £5,000 <Col N="876" /> grant has now been stopped.  In addition, there is a £12 million cut in the Department of the Environment housing programme. One would expect when the £5,000 grant went that money would have to be put into local authority housing. Where will the houses be in a few months time?  By summer, there will be no more vacancies caused by people taking up the £5,000 grant and there will be no new houses being built.  Where is Fianna Fáil's commitment to the building industry?</P>
      <P>I am also wondering what happened to Deputy Haughey's specific proposal that he would make available another £300 million to the building industry.  That has disappeared also.  The construction industry have been set back considerably. Apart from three house improvement grants being abolished, mortgage relief is abolished and there is the £12 million reduction in the housing programme. Presumably, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission have been abolished. The funding has been suspended.  The commission will probably be able to pay themselves somehow or other, but Nelson's days are numbered anyway.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach seemed to promise that VAT would be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. <Col N="877" /> That was being looked forward to by the building industry because it would put about another £30 million into that industry. However, it seems to be gone.</P>
      <P>I have not had time to go in depth into the education aspect of the budget but it seems that £10 million is being cut on post-primary education, which includes something that I am involved in.  There is a £2 million cut in the VEC programme.  I cannot see how the VECs will survive, considering the expansion which is needed there.  One must consider the numbers coming through from primary level to post-primary.  There is also the £2 increase in school transport.</P>
      <P>My last disappointment concerns overseas development aid.  We made a commitment some years ago that we would increase our contribution gradually until it was 0.7 per cent of the budget.  Previously there had been some small increases.  I had hoped that promise of previous Governments would be honoured &mdash; that we would at least be showing an increase, even a small one, each year.  I had hoped that we would be heading up to that target, which seems a very small one.  That would bring us barely into line with other countries' contributions. However, we have reduced our overseas development aid and are now down to 0.25 per cent, a total of £43.3 million, which I find very disappointing.</P>

    <P>(12)  THAT this Resolution (so far as relating to income tax) shall be construed together with the Income Tax Acts and (so far as relating to corporation tax) shall be construed together with the Corporation Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>(13)  IT is hereby declared that it is <Col N="890" /> expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides, with effect from 6 June 1987 for the deduction, at source, of tax at the rate of 35 per cent from payments for professional services made to individuals and companies by Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, the major noncommercial semi-State bodies and the other bodies listed in the Resolution.</P>
    <P>The amounts deducted will be allowable against the tax chargeable on such payments and when there is an excess it will be refunded.  Provision is included for interim refunds to alleviate hardship in cases where a substantial proportion of the fees in question are expended to meet the expenses of the business.</P>
    <P>A considerable group of persons &mdash; corporate and non-corporate &mdash; are engaged in the provision of professional services on a regular basis for various agencies which are paid for, directly or indirectly, from the public purse.  It is, therefore, only equitable that such persons should make their contributions to the Exchequer in a correspondingly regular manner.  The new scheme being introduced by this resolution will go some way to ensuring that this position will be reached.  It will be followed by appropriate legislation in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main elements of the new arrangements.  The tax will apply generally to fees and similar payments made by the bodies listed in the resolution described as accountable persons. All professional services are included and many of these are specified in the resolution.  These include professional services in the medical, veterinary, financial, legal, and engineering fields and some training services.</P>
    <P>The deduction at source system will not, however, apply when the payments are subject to PAYE or come within the terms of the construction industry scheme, that is, the C2 scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The deduction system will only be operated by the bodies listed in the resolution. It thus extends to payments by Government Departments, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Public Works, the Attorney-General's Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It also applies to payments by local authorities, health boards, and harbour authorities. It applies in the educational area to vocational education committees, regional technical colleges and most institutions of higher education.  It applies to payments to doctors and pharmacists under the general medical services scheme.  It applies to payments for such services by such semi-State bodies as AnCO, the IDA and CTT.  Therefore coverage is very wide.</P>
    <P>Any person, including a company, receiving a payment from an accountable person in respect of professional services will be liable to the tax.  Non-residents will come within the ambit of the scheme but they will be entitled to receive a full refund if the income is not chargeable to Irish tax.</P>
    <P>The rate at which tax will be deducted will be 35 per cent, which is the rate that already applies in the case of the retention tax deductible from deposit interest, subcontractors' payments and emergency basis PAYE in the initial weeks.  The tax will be deducted from payments made on or after 6 June, 1987 in respect of professional services and will be charged on payments net of value-added tax.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the deduction of tax at the standard rate any fees represented by the payments will still have to be taken into account in calculating the profits or gains of the recipient for tax purposes. The tax deducted will, however, be available for set-off against the tax chargeable on those profits or gains.</P>
    <P>The resolution makes provision for interim refunds to alleviate hardship in cases where a substantial proportion of the fees in question are paid out to meet the expenses of the business.  Generally, in order to qualify for an interim refund, the person will have to establish that, <Col N="892" /> first, his accounts for the year prior to the year in which the deductions are made have been agreed, and the tax has been paid on the agreed profits, and, second, that the tax deductions from fees exceed the amount of such agreed and paid tax.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, the amount of the refund would be the excess of the deductions over the sum of the agreed tax, any unremitted PAYE and VAT, and any outstanding direct tax liability on foot of earlier years.</P>
    <P>A special measure to provide relief for a person who is setting up a trade or profession is also included in the resolution while, in circumstances of particular hardship, the Revenue Commissioners may authorise an interim refund of tax notwithstanding that all the conditions necessary for granting such a refund may not be complied with.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the deduction at source does not alter the person's tax liability for a year of assessment or accounting period.  The measure is not a new tax.  It is a variation of existing taxes, that is income tax and corporation tax. The time and method of their payment are being altered.  Deduction at source is on account of liability for income tax and corporation tax.  When the amount of such liability is determined, the amount withheld is credited and any excess refunded.  There will be an initial cash flow of £25 million to the Exchequer from the charge for 1987.  However, the conditions to be met to secure a refund of the tax are likely to result in an improvement in compliance generally.  This is an important aspect of the new arrangement. Would it be in order for me to move Resolution No. 2 now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have some clarification from the Minister?  The tax being proposed by the Minister is something with which I am in favour.  Will the Minister explain if he and the Department of Finance have been able to distinguish between turnover and profit, if that is the intention, or is that why we have the <Col N="893" /> mitigation which the Minister spoke about which strikes me as yet again starting up another process when we are already setting out a process within a process?  Will the Minister give the House some idea of the basis of the calculation of the £25 million which this is meant to bring into the Exchequer in 1987?  Will there be any distinction between profit and turnover, because obviously we should be getting income tax on the profit?  I assume that many businesses may have a large turnover but also large expenses.  I would like a breakdown of how the figure of £25 million was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Initially I will ask a few questions and I will come in again when the Minister informs the House why he thought it necessary to introduce such a tax.  The professional services which are listed in the resolution, with the exception of the medical profession, would be subject to VAT.  Would it not be possible, from VAT returns, to establish absolutely what was due, certainly on the portion of the company's or the individual's income which would be paid by the accountable person listed on pages 2 and 3 of the resolution?  Is this merely a method of bringing forward £25 million of revenue due from 1988 to 1987, or is there an anti-evasion element involved?  If there is an anti-evasion element involved, could the Minister deal with the point I raised about VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like further clarification on the basis of the £25 million inclusion.  Is this 35 per cent of the total of professional fees paid by all the persons and agencies defined as accountable people?  The Minister also says there would be an added module of bouyancy because it would encourage people to make their returns quicker, I presume on the basis that they could avail of the interim refund.  That will multiply the difficulties because if somebody has not got his tax agreed for 1986, by 6 June 1987, if he claims under the hardship clause that the 35 per cent demanded is in excess of what he would rightfully have to pay, the only way he can avail of the alleviating measures is to <Col N="894" /> submit his returns for 1986, get agreement with a tax inspector, and then claim a remission on the grounds of hardship, on the basis that the 35 per cent which has already been taken would affect his cash flow adversely.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking today I thought it was simply a matter of an architect's firm, an accountant's firm, or a consultant engineer's firm having to pay on turnover rather than on income, with all the adverse consequences that will arise, but now it seems that the alleviation of hardship clause makes it worse rather than better because he would have to pay twice in the current year to prove the hardship in the first place.  I would like clarification on that.</P>
    <P>On the list of accountable persons, most of it is reasonably clear and it seems to include everybody who works for any agency in the State but I would question the position of the VHI.  Are the VHI in, paying medical bills, especially doctors bills, included here or are they exempt? As I remarked already today, the cheque in these cases is paid to the patient or the former patient and not to the medical practitioner.  I presume they are excluded but I would like confirmation of that. What is the position of people brought in on emergency service of any sort for any of the agencies?  Will this also apply, or is it somebody who is on the approved list, whether it is in the Attorney General's office of legal representatives or in the Department of Finance, as architects, engineers and consultants?  How does that work out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the two points raised by Deputy Spring. It is not to be distinguished on the basis of turnover and profit; it will be on the gross payments.  I will give the details of the way figures are made up to give the £25 million for 1987.  The amounts of money paid out by Government Departments are, for example, the Department of Agriculture payments to veterinary surgeons, £17 million, Department of Social Welfare payments to dentists and opticians, £18 million, legal services for <Col N="895" /> Departments, £4.5 million, general consultancy services, £3 million, fees element of the public capital programme, £35 million, general medical services payment board, payment to doctors and pharmacists, £44 million, payments to external trainers by AnCO, approximately £10 million and other detailed smaller ones, amounting to £10 million, giving a total of £141.5 million.  Witholding tax of 35 per cent in a full year would be approximately £50 million and for six months it would be £25 million as is in the budget figures today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked why we introduced this.  There is nothing new in it.  It has already been done under PAYE, the retention tax introduced by Fine Gael last year and so on.  It is mainly done for reasons of equity in the tax system as a whole.  The Deputy also asked about VAT arrangements that are made and asked could it not be done in that way. It is a separate situation.  I have outlined that payments are made on this basis as a percentage of the payments outlined in the various figures I have just given. The main reason is to have compliance with proper and suitable timing for the payment of tax due, and of course, it can, and probably will show that there has been some evasion in that period.</P>
      <P>The VHI, not being a State company, are not included in the scheme.  The Deputy raised points about hardship cases and I referred to that in my initial remarks.  The Deputy appeared to be asking about somebody who might have to pay on the double in one particular year, but that would not arise because if the tax deducted in a year happens to be more than his profits then he would get a reduction and a refund from Revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this would be a tax on gross payments of the kind set out here by the bodies listed.  He has also said there is an element of equity involved, that part of the reason for making this imposition is in the interests of equity and to encourage compliance in time on the part of taxable persons. Could he indicate what, if any, portion of the £25 million expected revenue this <Col N="896" /> year, and £50 million in a full year, is attributable to better collection or to improved compliance?  The Minister gave a list of the various payments made by the accountable persons, 35 per cent of which gives roughly £25 million in a half year and £50 million in a full year.  There may be an expectation of a more rapid payment but there is no evidence of an expectation of any more complete payment unless the Minister is keeping some expectation of revenue up his sleeve.</P>
      <P>There is provision for interim refunds which, unless I am mistaken, is a separate matter from the payment for hardship.  I wonder why the Minister feels it necessary to provide both for interim refunds and for hardship, particularly if the intention is to improve compliance and speed up payments.  Why provide for interim refunds if the result is, as the Minister seems to suggest, that the total amount of tax paid is unchanged?  On the provision for hardship, on a quick reading of this provision, it seems that that is provided for in paragraph (9) (e) which provides:</P>
      <P>in circumstances where the specified person claims and proves the presence of particular hardship, the Revenue Commissioners may waive (in whole or in part) one or more of the conditions for the making of a refund specified in this paragraph and, where the Revenue Commissioners so waive such condition or conditions, they shall determine, having regard to all the circumstances and taking into account the objects and intentions of the previous provisions of this paragraph, an amount of a refund or a further refund which they consider to be just and reasonable and they shall authorise the inspector to make such refund or such further refund, as the case may be, accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience of presenting matters of this kind from the other side of the House that none of that appears without a particular reason, although I am bound to say that that particular provision is very hard to get to grips with. There is very little in it that is definite or <Col N="897" /> that the taxpayer can seize upon as being a guide for the conditions under which he can either apply or make an assessment as to the possibility of his success in making an application.  First, there is no definition of hardship.  What is hardship? I suppose every taxpayer would regard the payment of taxes either on time or before he has to as hardship, but I do not think that can be the definition intended here.</P>
    <P>The text, as drafted, gives a very wide discretion to the Revenue Commissioners and, let me hasten to add, very little guidance as to what they should do.</P>
    <P>.... they shall determine, having regard to all the circumstances and taking into account the objects and intentions of the previous provisions of this paragraph, ...</P>
    <P>What exactly does that mean?  What kinds of criteria will they bear in mind? Will they have to be satisfied that there is hardship or will they simply take the taxpayer's word that he finds himself in hardship?  What basis will they have for deciding that a particular refund would be just and reasonable?  In whose eyes should it be just and reasonable?  Should it be just and reasonable in the taxpayer's eyes or in the view of the Revenue Commissioners? I think the Minister will agree, and even if he does not it is my belief that the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners as to what is just and reasonable is more than likely to diverge from the opinion of the taxpayer.  There is a degree of impression about this convoluted text which I think could do with some light being cast upon it.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (a) (i) the definition of &ldquo;appropriate tax&rdquo; is given:</P>
    <P>where such payment does not include value-added tax, a sum representing income tax on the amount of that payment at the standard rate in force at the time of payment, and</P>
    <P>The standard rate at the moment is 35 per cent.  I take it that it would be intended that the rate of tax would vary <Col N="898" /> in the event that the standard rate of income tax varied.  What proposition of the payments we are talking about does not include value-added tax, because a specific provision is made here to cover the cases where the payments do not include value-added tax?</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (c) reference is made to the appropriate tax referable to an accounting period.  This seems to suggest that it is possible that there may be some payments which would be made by accountable persons that would not be included in the assessment of this tax. What kinds of payments by the accountable persons are envisaged here?</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (2) (xx), what payments made by an institution of higher education within the meaning of the Higher Education Act, 1971, are included here?  Is it the case that institutes of higher education pay substantial sums directly out of their own budgets to persons who would be liable to this tax? Paragraph (5) says that remittances shall be paid to the collector within ten days from the end of every income tax month. Can I take it that that is the same period as it provided for the making of remittances in relation to income tax and PRSI contributions?</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) provides that all provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to the collection and recovery of income tax shall apply to the collection and recovery of appropriate income tax.  Does that mean that if remittances are not made within the period provided for in paragraph (5) (a) the amounts outstanding begin to attract interest and other penalties in the same way as overdue amounts of income tax?</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies have offered; Deputy McCreevy, Deputy G. Mitchell and Deputy McCartan.  If the questions they are about to raise are of a similar nature, perhaps we could take them now and the Minister could reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reply very briefly. A number of points were made and perhaps a summary reply can deal with some of them.  On the final point raised by Deputy Dukes the ten days provision is the same as in the construction industry. The tax we are now talking about is the same and the same conditions apply. Deputy Dukes also asked about the definition of &ldquo;just and reasonable&rdquo;.  This definition has already been specified in section 76 (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That Act already provides that the revenue can make adjustments where it is just and reasonable to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes also raised the point about the ratio of VAT.  Medical fees do not qualify for VAT.  There is VAT on legal and architect fees.  But that is a technicality which will be worked out with the Revenue.  Thirty-five per cent will be deducted from the gross amounts I have read out.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question on paragraph (9) and what is meant by hardship, the object of the paragraph is to refund on an ongoing basis deductions at source which exceed or seem likely to exceed the probable tax liability arising.  It is not intended that interim refunds will be made where the amounts deducted represent a fair payment on account of the taxpayer's liability.  Hardship could arise only if the deductions exceed that fair payment on account.  Those were some of the points raised.  It is very difficult to pick up all of the details but if there are more we will do our utmost to reply to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I agree with a few of the points made by Deputy Dukes but I would argue against his interpretation of paragraph (9) in that it is left open to the Revenue Commissioners to decide what is just and reasonable.  In case the impression is given that this tax is similar to existing ones in the construction industry and that we are only extending it now to cover professional fees I would like to point out that this is a very different tax.  It may look the same but it is not.  It may look on all fours to be the same idea but it is fundamentally <Col N="900" /> different from the system which operates in the construction industry.  It is a follow on to the type of thinking which we have been witnessing in the Revenue Commission since we had the 1970 Finance Act as amended by subsequent Acts. Those Acts have tightened up that area to a great extent.  At present it is practically impossible to get what is known as a C2 subcontractor certificate of authorisation.</P>
      <P>Under the system that operates under the 1970 Act, as amended, the position is that anyone who is not on PAYE on a construction contract must be either a registered or unregistered contractor.  If he qualifies as a registered contractor and gets a C2 he will be allowed to receive payment from the principal contractor of the gross amount without deduction of 35 per cent tax.  If he is not a registered contractor, and most people with labour only contracts are not, tax will be deducted at 35 per cent.  At the end of the year the person works out his tax.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the House seems to be under the impression, apart from Deputy Gay Mitchell and me, that this is the same type of tax but it is not because tax is going to be deducted at 35 per cent right across the board whether a professional person has his tax affairs up-to-date or not.  If it was similar to what operates in the construction industry presumably a person would have to apply for an exemption certificate when he would be paid gross payments.  This is a totally different idea and it would be wrong to give the impression that it is similar to the one which operates in the construction industry or is similar to the one which was announced last year regarding adjustments in local authority payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone who is providing a professional service to any of the bodies mentioned in paragraph (2) will be liable to tax at 35 per cent irrespective of whether they have a taxable income for that year or whether their tax affairs are up-to-date or not.  I can see the sense in the proposals put forward by the Minister for Finance. I am sure various Ministers for Finance had the same idea in the past but did not get around to doing it.  This tax will have <Col N="901" /> two effects.  It will be an anti-evasion measure.  The inspector of taxes will always get a list from local authorities or Government Departments of professional persons who have carried out work for them.  If a doctor deals with a local authority he will make sure to return the gross fees from the local authority. Whether he would do so for private patients is another matter.  As this will be an anti-evasion measure some tax will be saved.</P>
    <P>The greatest effect this tax will have is that it will bring tax into the Exchequer at a quicker rate.  It will be a once off measure.  Extra tax will be collected this year and for part of next year when it will peter out as people will be allowed to claim against this tax.  This is not similar to a previous tax; it is a fundamental change.  The resolution is very technical but the basic principle can be readily understood.  If this is to be the case I can see great difficulties for certain groups of professional people who supply services to local authorities.</P>
    <P>In large professional bodies it must be remembered that 90 per cent of their costs go on salaries.  In contrast, in the construction industry most of the costs are for materials which can be credited. In professional bodies 90 per cent of the costs relate to salaries which must be paid out at the end of the week or the month. They cannot say at the end of each month that they do not have the money to pay them because they got only so much from the local authorities.  For such firms this tax will create enormous problems.</P>
    <P>If 35 per cent of fees is to be stopped it will create enormous cash flow difficulties. I am too long in the accountancy profession to accept from a Minister for Finance at face value that the Revenue Commissioners will take undue hardship into account.  Their definition of hardship and the taxpayers' definition do not always agree.  This tax will cause grave problems in particular for large professional practices most of whose costs relate to salaries.  It will create enormous cash flow problems.  It will have the benefit of bringing in extra tax this year and next year and more speedily than it would <Col N="902" /> come in before the tax liability was agreed.  There may be a saving on the evasion element but there are provisions in the resolution I should like explained to me.  This may appear similar to the legislation dealing with subcontractors but it is not and I can see it presenting enormous difficulties for a number of professional practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy has put his point in regard to this very well.  I do not think these tax proposals can in any way be compared with the construction industry division retentions or the practice followed by the inspector of taxes in the CID division of the Revenue Commissioners.  The idea of retaining fees is not necessarily a bad one. Indeed, where the State is paying out huge fees to those engaged in tribunals and so on, such a provision should be considered.  Members of the Public Accounts Committee have often expressed the view that this should be looked into but the effect of this provision will be that the State will be getting a £25 million positive cash flow once-off without taking into account the ability of the taxpayer to pay.  For example, I should like to consider the position of a person who receives fees from the State in the month of April or May and whose tax year ends on 31 May 1987.  That falls in the tax year 1987-88 and could form the basis of assessment for 1988-89 but if in the year 1988-89, following on the assessment, it is found that there is a nil liability and a refund is due it will take from 1987 to 1990, or longer, for a person to prove that there is no tax liability in the first instance.  The person concerned may be happy to produce all the evidence required but on the basis of the accounts a person with a nil assessment and no liability to tax may have to wait for three years for that refund.  Presumably a person with a nil assessment of tax does not have any income and we are, therefore, asking people without any income to make a loan to the State interest free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the implications for a person whose tax year ends on 31 May 1987 and who receives fees during April <Col N="903" /> and May of this year?  How long will that person have to wait for a refund if his tax liability at the end of the assessment is nil?  How long will a person whose tax year ends at the end of June or July 1987 have to wait for a refund if that person is found to have a nil liability?  This is a further widening in the tax treatment of people who conduct their affairs with the State <i>vis-á-vis</i> those who conduct their affairs in the private sector and I do not think there is any precedent for it in our tax laws.  Even if one goes back to the days of poll taxes I do not think one will find any precedent for treating people's tax affairs quite so differently when they are dealing with the public sector as against the private sector.  It does not have any foundation in equity although there may be some justification for it.  I am not suggesting that this is all bad but the faults need to be teased out.  The Minister should give consideration to any amendments proposed to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we constantly run off in directions which tend to grab taxes from sections of the community that are not always in a position to pay them is that we sometimes get carried away with the type of emotional arguments put forward by Members like Deputy Mac Giolla.  In the course of his contribution this evening he said that outstanding taxes are assessed as legally due.  That is a very valid statement but the important word there is &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;.  In the final analysis it may be that nothing like the amount of taxes outstanding, as shown in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, will be due.  The practice is that what is outstanding for the year is only a small proportion of the assessments. We should try to state annually not just what is outstanding according to those inflated estimates issued by the Revenue Commissioners in order to make people prove what they owe but the proportion of that that is likely to be collectable.  Those figures give rise to divisions in the community and to the belief that those who work for themselves are creaming it off and making a fortune. <Col N="904" /> That is not the case and many self-employed people suffer losses and experience great difficulties.</P>
    <P>I note in Financial Resolution No. 1 the list of State bodies defined as &ldquo;accountable persons&rdquo; but I wonder why the Minister has included the IDA while CIE, RTE, the ESB and other State agencies are not included.  There may be a good reason for excluding them. Another provision in that resolution states:</P>
    <P>(6)  That all the provisions of the income tax Acts relating to the collection and recovery of income tax shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to the collection and recovery of appropriate tax.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if that includes interest on late payments.  Will the Revenue pay interest to a taxpayer who is due a refund of tax which he was not liable to pay three or four years previously? If a person pays tax at present when that liability is not due he will, when getting a refund, be paid interest on the refund.  I should like to know in the case of the retention tax where it is subsequently found by the Revenue Commissioners that the money should not have been retained because there was no liability if interest will be paid.  On the other side of the coin, a person late in making a payment will have to pay interest but if the State retains funds belonging to a taxpayer who is not liable to pay tax will that individual be entitled to interest under the provision I quoted?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House the guidelines he will use to assess hardship? What guidelines have been set down? Will it depend on individual inspectors of taxes?  In some towns people will know the inspector of taxes but in Dublin such an official may be a junior.  Will it depend on an inspector of taxes making a subjective judgment on the day, perhaps through a hatch in one of the tax offices?</P>
    <P>Another provision in the resolution states:</P>
    <P>(9) (c)  The amount of the tax to be refunded shall be the excess of the total of the appropriate tax included in the <Col N="905" /> forms furnished in accordance with the provisions ... (i) under the Value Added Tax Act, 1972... (ii) under Chapter IV of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967 ... (iii)  in respect of employment contributions under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 ...</P>
    <P>How long will it take to cross-check those records before a refund is made?  Will it be necessary for an individual to provide all the information to the State in order to get from the State what is his or her due?  I agree entirely with the principle of everybody paying what is due to the State but I do not think that at this stage one should throw out the baby with the bathwater.  We are in danger of departing from the rules of equity if we put undue liability on an individual to prove to the State that the State should not take portion of his income as tax.  That is not fair or equitable.  A poor, badly off taxpayer could be funding the State by way of interest-free loans and all sorts of obstacles could be put in the way of that taxpayer in seeking to justify a refund.  I hope the Minister will deal with that.  Will the Minister tell us what the situation would be with regard to a person whose tax year ends on 31 May and who receives fees in April and May?  When will that person be able to get a refund?  Will it be 1989 or 1990 or will there be some provision whereby that person can get a refund this year?</P>

      <P>I want to correct something I might have said wrongly in replying to Deputy Dukes regarding the ten day delay and the possibility of charges. We are dealing in the main with public bodies and we would expect that they would pass over the money immediately, so there should not be any question of having to impose interest charges for delays.  Deputy Mitchell has raised a number of points.  When he talks about a person's tax year ending in a particular month, it could be any month in the year. This matter will come into operation in June, therefore payments will begin over <Col N="906" /> the following 12 month period.  The deductions will be made on the basis of those payments.  They will not all be paid out on 1 July if the tax year ends on 30 June.  No matter which month is taken, the same sort of situation could emerge. I will come to this matter in a few minutes when speaking about reliefs for any hardships that might be involved.  Commercial State bodies are excluded but non-commercial State bodies are included and specified.  The restrictions in this proposal are exactly the same as those in the proposal affecting the construction industry. There is nothing new there.</P>

      <P>That will come under the other question on hardship.  Deputy McCreevy made some very important points and described it as an anti-evasion measure.  It may turn out to be so and in certain respects would that not be a good thing?  The main thing is to get earlier compliance with the tax which is due.  It will encourage all the professionals involved to get their accounts in order more quickly than heretofore so that they can make settlements on a per annum basis with the Revenue.  That is what it can and will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of relief for hardship has been raised in the course of this discussion and it is best to give information in relation to that relief.  The resolution makes provision for interim refunds to alleviate hardship in cases where a substantial proportion of the fees in question are paid out to meet the expenses of the business.  Generally in order to qualify for an interim refund the person will have to establish that the accounts for the year prior to the year in which the deductions are made have been agreed, that tax has been paid on the agreed profits and the tax deduction from fees exceeds the amount of such agreed and paid tax.  In such circumstances the amount of the refund would be the excess of the deductions over the sum of the agreed tax, any unremitted PAYE and VAT and any outstanding tax liability on foot of earlier <Col N="907" /> years.  A special measure to provide relief for a person setting up a trade or profession is also included in the resolution. In circumstances of particular hardship, the Revenue Commissioners will authorise an interim refund of tax notwithstanding that all the conditions necessary for granting such a refund may not be complied with.  I know it is very hard for us to take in all the details, but I think the House can accept in all fairness that there will be due recognition given under these clauses to each individual who may be affected.  These interim and hardship clauses will take due account of those.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the proposals contained in the resolution before the House in respect of the levy now being introduced.  In doing so we agree with the Minister that the proposals are good in principle in that they attempt to move towards an element of equity within the tax system.  We wonder why the Government might not have called it what it is called when imposed on the greater proportion of taxpayers, namely Pay As You Earn.  It is not a new tax but a new method of collecting tax that would otherwise be due. For the greater proportion of the taxpaying community it is already imposed <Col N="908" /> and known as PAYE.  It is the method by which tax is taken from working people on a weekly basis and I do not see how anyone can voice a reservation when the Government turn in a small way to impose it on the private professional group who are now to be drawn into the PAYE net.  Having said that it is good in principle in the small step it takes, we want to emphasise that it is a very small step indeed.  The envisaged take is in the order of £25 million this year and a sum approaching £50 million in a full year.  If one compares that against the currently outstanding sum of £700 million in properly levied and assessed tax, one begins to appreciate just how small a step it is in drawing into the tax net the private professional people and the business community who for so long have been avoiding the payment of just taxes.</P>
      <P>It is to be asked of the Fine Gael Party whether they support this method of collection in principle.  There have been immense tears shed, even on the back-benches of Fianna Fáil, for those persons who might be considered for a refund for hardship reasons.  When does a PAYE working man or woman get a refund for reasons of hardship?  Never.  They must pay on a weekly basis directly from their income without any hope of being heard at any level within the tax appeals system on their right to be refunded.  We would call on the Government to look very carefully at the principal structure they have introduced in this new scheme.  We hope that in coming years they will extend it. The Workers' Party have made the point time and again that the ingenuity employed in devising the PAYE scheme should be extended to cover the private sector, businessmen, professionals and farmers, so that they too could be expected to pay as they earn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial reaction to this proposal when I heard it mentioned in the budget today was that I could not see any great objection to it in principle or in equity.  When I saw, subsequent to the speech, the Financial Resolution we are debating and which <Col N="909" /> runs to no less than seven pages to achieve what we are told is very simple and equitable, I began to wonder and I tried to read the seven pages.  I am not unfamiliar with some of the contents but it was not easy, between about 5.30 p.m. when we got the resolution and now, for me to say that I understand it and all its implications.  I dare say that the same is true of any other Member of the House, we simply do not understand it properly, we could not in a few hours without access to considerable advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On first hearing the proposal I immediately thought of someone like a barrister and I felt it not inequitable that the State should deduct 35 per cent tax from the payments they make to him because he is the sole proprietor.  Normally he does not employ staff, except perhaps a secretary, and he does not have any significant overheads and so on.  That is all very well until you look at the list of people included, in particular those who come under the heading of purveyors of services of an architectural, engineering, quantity surveying or surveying nature and related services and ask yourself what is the position of those people.  Particularly, and in a sense paradoxically, one must ask what is the position of the larger firms in those businesses?  One must also ask where are so many of those people today who were in the country five or six years ago.  The truth is that firms who employed over 100 people in those types of businesses today often employ 20 and fewer.  More of them who enjoyed substantial practices in this country now enjoy substantial practices in the United States or in Britain.  I doubt if there is an architectural firm in this country who employ anything like the number of people they employed five years ago.  To suggest, therefore, that the gross fees they get from State Departments represent income or profit and that they can be precisely paralleled with the wages someone gets on a weekly or monthly basis, as Deputy McCartan sought to do now, is totally untrue because the profit element in those fees may be as low as 1 per cent or 2 per cent.  Only the profit element of a practice can be subject to <Col N="910" /> tax or could equitably be subject to tax. One is not yet charged income tax, thank God, in any country on turnover, one is charged income tax on profit if running a business in which a number of people are employed, where they must be paid and where there are other expenses and overheads. If the profit element in fees is as low as 1 per cent or 2 per cent &mdash; which is regularly the case nowadays for many of these firms &mdash; it does not seem to be equitable to deduct 35 per cent of their gross fees which may be very substantially more than their ultimate profit.</P>
    <P>There are elaborate provisions here about getting interim payments by way of refunds and so on but we all know that many people are owed money who just wait and wait and who may be paid six months later with the greatest difficulty or indeed who are never paid.  The principle sounds grand but people should think about it and realise that a substantial number of firms of this kind have closed down in this country over the last five years or have reduced their operations enormously.  Will this be the straw that breaks the camel's back for the survivors? It could well be because their margins are minute.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this also applies to people abroad who provide these services to State Departments.  I wonder if they will be prepared to provide services on this basis.  I do not understand the distinction between the long list set out in paragraph (2)  of this resolution and all State bodies.  Why is it confined to this list, even though it is a long one comprising 20 different types of State institutions?  However, it does not apply to all of them and I wonder why.  In the cases of the type of firms where clearly their profitability would only be a very small fraction of their gross fees, I cannot see any equity in such a provision.  It is different for a barrister on his own or a solicitor in a small practice without substantial overheads.  The same would apply to an engineer working on his own who also has small overheads but this could be the means of putting large firms out of business.</P>
    <P>The other point is that in so far as there <Col N="911" /> is liability to tax on these payments &mdash; presumably there is liability for some tax on the profit that arises from these payments &mdash; it is payable in the following year anyway and this is simply accelerating the payments by one year.  The danger in that is that it is simply bringing forward certain payments for next year to this year.  I was accused during the latter part of last year and the beginning of this year of doing that and indeed the Government of which I was a Member about five years ago were also accused of doing it in relation to VAT at point of entry.  There may have been validity in that criticism because it did bring forward payments but it did not mean that you would get the same payments every year after that on a current basis.  If there was validity in the criticism of VAT at point of entry, the same criticism would be valid in relation to this because the principle is the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave some figures a short time ago in relation to this.  He said that the State paid out £151 million last year in fees of this kind, that a 35 per cent tax on those would amount to approximately £50 million and that the half year, which will operate this year from June, will amount to approximately £25 million which was the figure shown in the budget statement.  Mathematically, it is approximately correct.  I wish to remind the Minister that that £151 million represents gross fees.  It presupposes they are direct profit to those in receipt of them but they are not.  The firms or partnerships to whom they are paid have to turn around and meet all their expenses and pay all their staff, and the profit on growth fees of £151 million may well be as low as £10 million nowadays.  That is conceivable with the times that are in it. Therefore, the tax on that £10 million, applying the standard rate is £3.5 million or, assuming that some of the firms would pay a higher tax or pay corporation tax at 45 or 50 per cent, the tax at the outside could not be more in those circumstances than £5 million.  Yet here we have in a half year £5 million deducted and in a full year £10 million.  Refunds would have to <Col N="912" /> be made on the difference between that and the real tax due which it seems is being collected from people some of whom are liable but many of whom are not and could not be liable.  Is it equitable?</P>
    <P>Because of a genuine concern for people from whom tax was collected on a PAYE basis, are we going too far in trying to collect tax from others who are not on a PAYE basis, to tax them not on their profits, not on what they made, but on their gross turnover?  If you tried to apply that to industry or ordinary commercial business there would be an outcry.  It would not last at all.  The House should think about this.  While on the surface it seems all right, it may well be very inequitable and may deserve deeper consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach &mdash; and I think I am right in surmising that this is the case but it is better to check it &mdash; if this measure is going to be written into the Finance Bill and the Finance Act when it is subsequently passed; in other words, that the whole matter will come up again for consideration at the time we discuss the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach nods agreement, so there is at least the possibility that we can examine this matter in a good deal more detail than will be possible this evening.  One question the Minister for Finance did not answer &mdash; I understand he is a little pressed at the moment &mdash; is the question I put to him about just what is what I might call the evasion component in this.  The Minister indicated that the figures are roughly £150 million worth of payments.  During the course of one year 35 per cent retention of that would give £50 million.  That is broadly what has been put forward.  If no evasion component is involved and if the Government expect no evasion component, then one wonders if there is any point in this other than the transfer of revenue from one year to the previous year.  If the main <Col N="913" /> intention is to transfer revenue, for example from 1988 to 1987, would it, at least on the surface, be as valid an approach simply to look at the kinds of provision involved to see if there is not a case for shortening the delays within which returns have to be made or shortening the time scale within which payments have to be made?  The House will remember we did a considerable amount of that kind of thing with regard to corporation tax in the past four years.  This measure, for all the sophistication and complication of the language, is a very blunt instrument.  Unless the Taoiseach can tell me otherwise, I have to conclude there is no real evasion component in this unless, as I said, the Minister for Finance believes there is something he can keep up his sleeve in the operation of a measure of this kind.  I regret to say it but I warn the Minister against feeling rather too comfortably that because they are public bodies who will be paying over this money they will be diverting 35 per cent of the payments they make to the concerned persons away from those same persons and directly to the Exchequer. He should not think that simply because they are public bodies who are paying the money there will be no delay in payment. I can think of at least one example of one of the kinds of bodies referred to here where there was quite a problem with delays in the remittance of PAYE and PRSI&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Probably this should be a technical discussion but I cannot resist the temptation of taking Deputy McCartan at his word &mdash; of course, we all take one another at our word in this House &mdash; to welcome him into the PAYE net and remind him that had we been talking <Col N="914" /> about this in a recent year some £35,000 would have been diverted away from payments made to him which would have taken some of the shine off the Royal Saint George Yacht Club.</P>

      <P>I assure you, Sir, that that remark was made with the utmost tranquillity on my part.  I would not make it in any other way.  I come back to the question of interim refunds and the making of hardship payments.  It seems that if there is a strong case for having a measure of this kind, then the strength of the case for making it, if it is a compelling case, almost by definition rules out the requirement for interim refunds.  If there are sums payable, and the whole intention of the measure is to speed up the payments, I cannot see the logic of having interim refunds.  On the other hand, if there is a strong case for making interim refunds, then surely there must be a case for wondering whether the reduction should be made at all in the first place. Unless the Government can say there is a strong anti-evasion component in this which has not yet appeared, then I wonder what the purpose of the operation is other than simple concern with bringing forward to 1987 revenue that would otherwise accrue in 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make a few points at this stage.  The House should stick to first principles in regard to this matter because it is important that we tease out the technical aspects but, at the same time, it is important to keep in mind exactly what we are doing here.  There is a movement in the whole taxation system to get on to a current basis.  The classic <Col N="915" /> example is, of course, the PAYE sector who pay on a current basis, month in month out.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned that we went on to a current basis in respect of VAT at point of entry.  We went on to current basis in a number of other areas.  The Commission on Taxation report is to the effect that we should get on to a current basis on the basis of self-assessment.  The whole movement, and rightly so, is towards getting on to a current basis.  It is not basically fair that the PAYE sector should pay week after week, month after month on a current basis when other sections of the community through the assessment process can pay 18 months, two years or three years later.  That in itself would justify the introduction of this mechanism, but Deputy Dukes, Leader of the Opposition, makes a point about the evasion component.  I am satisfied there is an evasion component here.  We are saying in the figures we give that this year we expect this mechanism will bring £25 million into the Exchequer.  There is a great deal to be said for taking money directly into the Exchequer at any time you can do so rather than going through the whole rigmarole of assessment and appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about that.  This tax has an evasion component in it.  We expect that it will bring in £25 million this year and £50 million in a full year but we do not know to what extent the normal tax assessment process for the self-employed is bringing in the full amount of £25 million with regard to these fees.  I am certain it is not coming in through the normal tax assessment process. There is an evasion component in it but even if there was not it is still totally justifiable on the basis that all sectors of the community pay on the same basis, namely a current basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley complained about the length of the Financial Resolution and the complex nature of the wording. By far the greatest proportion of that Financial Resolution and that wording deals with the hardship clauses.  What is proposed in the hardship clause takes care of the point the Deputy made about a lot of fees not being all profit, that a professional firm has to pay out expenses and salaries before they can decide how much of the amount in gross fees paid to them is profit.  The hardship clause, and I make this point to Deputy Dukes, is not a hardship clause in the normal sense of that phrase because it is not related to the condition of the taxpayer from the point of view of his social situation, his income and so on.  It is related to whether the amount we are deducting by way of withholding tax is far greater than it should be.  That is what the mechanism is all about.  That takes care of Deputy O'Malley's point.  If a firm can show that their profit in the previous year, allowing <Col N="917" /> for all the outgoings they have to incur, is far below the withholding tax they get interim refunds.  That is based on their profit and not on their gross earnings from the previous year.  If the taxpayer, a professional person, can show that, allowing for all the outgoings and payments to staff, the profits he made in the previous year are far lower than the amount of withholding tax he will get an interim refund.  That is what the hardship clause is about, to relate the withholding tax to more or less what the profit was in the year before.</P>
    <P>May I ask Deputy O'Malley to contemplate this situation?  In regard to one of the architect's practices about which he has spoken we find there are two people, the proprietor, a professional person, and an architect working for the proprietor.  The architect is paid a salary and he pays PAYE on that salary every month.  The proprietor, who presumably in the normal course of events gets far more out of the practice than the employee, does not have to pay income tax on what he gets out of the partnership until 12 months, 18 months or two years later.  If Deputy O'Malley is concerned about equity in this matter he should accept this mechanism we are now proposing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody in this House can argue the case that a salaried employee in an architect's office will pay PAYE month by month as it falls due while his boss, the professional owner of the business, will only pay 18 months or two years later, if at all.  It <Col N="918" /> would not make sense.  This is a reasonable proposal.  These fees are paid out by the State, from taxpayers' money, to professional people.  In the normal course of events the State will be lucky if it gets income tax on these fees in 18 months, two years or three years, if it gets it at all.  Surely it is fair, equitable, practical and realistic to apply this mechanism to these fees particularly when we have the hardship clause.  If the deduction mechanism results in an excessive deduction the person involved can get interim payments and have his situation put right.</P>
      <P>I welcome the support from The Workers' Party for this proposal but I am very disappointed that they, who have continually complained about arrears of tax, attack our very sensible and practical proposal to allocate a task force to help the Revenue Commissioners collect arrears of tax.  There may be some ideological reason for opposing this task force but I cannot see it.</P>

Regardless of whether it is the most efficient way, it is an extra collecting mechanism which we are putting at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners and I cannot see why any one in this House should oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are to some extent, though not to as great an extent as some Deputies would suggest, bringing forward revenue.  Any time you make this sort of change in the revenue laws you get that windfall. It happened when PAYE was introduced. I remember very well the negotiations that went on about the introduction of PAYE.  It brought in for the Government in a particular year a windfall of revenue brought forward.  The same happened when we introduced VAT at the point of entry.  I am not too sure to what extent it happened when the certificates in the construction industry <Col N="919" /> were introduced but it had some effect there.  Any time you move on to a current basis, apart from the equity of that movement you also get a windfall of bringing forward revenue to some extent from one year to another.  This year we are getting the benefit of revenue brought forward. Even if we were not, this move is still justified on the basis of getting ever nearer to a situation where everybody paying taxes pays on a current basis, as the PAYE sector are already doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that the two resolutions <Col N="920" /> which we are discussing here tonight are both resolutions to which, in general, there would be virtually no opposition. Perhaps it is a bit of clever footwork on the part of the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip to have these motions debated rather than other financial motions on which a division might have been called.  Perhaps the Taoiseach's luck is holding out on this occasion as it has in the past.</P>
    <P>In brief, as a way of leading into my remarks on the resolution before us, it is remarkable that we are discussing non-contentious resolutions in relation to taxation of professional people who offer their services to State agencies and in relation to a reduction in the VAT which is reclaimable by unregistered farmers. At the same time we have a budget which is fairly swingeing in relation to other aspects of taxation.  As mentioned already, more than £300 million extra will be taken from the PAYE sector over the coming year.  People on social welfare certainly cannot look forward to a life of high style on the basis of 20p to 30p extra per child and perhaps £1 to £1.40 for adults from July.  There are very serious elements in the budget which we will not be discussing tonight.  It seems that what has been achieved in this House is something which many outside this House have been attempting to achieve for some time, that is, an alliance of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and newly emerged PDs &mdash; a consensus approach to the economy.  This is a consensus which, incidentally, was never demanded &mdash; in relation to how it is being implemented, at any rate &mdash; by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or any of the trade unions, or the working class, whether on social welfare or getting a week's wages.  Certainly, it has not been demanded by The Workers' Party or the Labour Party.  It is worthy of note that this alliance is obvious here tonight on this budget.</P>
    <P>I shall address myself to a number of points in relation to the resolution before us.  The question of hardship has been raised regarding professional people who are paid by State agencies.  First, we are talking only about practices which are being paid money by State agencies.  This <Col N="921" /> does not take into account at all the fees which the professional people will collect from the private sector.  Has the Taoiseach or the Minister a figure available on the precise &ldquo;take&rdquo; in fees by the professionals covered in this resolution?  I must try to work it out some time.  It should not be too difficult to do, certainly with regard to doctors, architects and so on, on the basis of the fees they charge. I would hazard a guess that the £150 million gross which the State pays out is a very small proportion of the total fees which accountants, solicitors, architects, doctors, dentists, chemists and so on actually take from the population of the State.  To argue that in some way all these good professional people will be put to the pin of their collar to fork out, or fail to receive, 35 per cent of the fees they get from the State is not realistic.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out by Deputy McCartan, the PAYE sector already pay out their share on a week to week or month to month basis.  Deputy O'Malley attempted to say that on that basis Deputy McCartan was trying to equate the PAYE sector with the self employed or professional sector.  Clearly he was not.  He stated that the PAYE sector were not in a position to claim hardship, and that is a fact.  If a man or woman is having £20 to £30 a week taken out of his or her wage packet every week, there is no point in telling the tax man that school fees have to be met next week or the week after, which will cost £30 to £60, but that is a hardship to the person involved.  Presumably, the professional people who will have this 35 per cent deducted can claim hardship on the basis of extraordinary expenses and so on. That is where the difference lies.</P>
    <P>There is also a significant difference between the PAYE sector and self-employed and professional sector in that there are far more allowances which the latter can claim in relation to their running expenses.  There is no point in people on PAYE, who may have to travel 20 to 40 miles a day to work, trying to claim petrol expenses, or wear and tear on a car, or for the cost of providing themselves <Col N="922" /> with a car in order to get to work. That just will not be listened to.  On the other hand, professional or self-employed people can claim for the car and the petrol or, if they are wise, they will get a diesel-run car and be able to claim back VAT on the diesel as well as claiming for expenses on the car and running costs.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the self-employed and professional on the one hand and the PAYE sector on the other in that regard.  The first category virtually write their own tax bills.  That is what is done with regard to many who operate exclusively in the private sector. I should think that any professional or self-employed persons who can avoid taking work with the State would probably be advised to avoid it in that they can write their own tax bill and decide how much income they declare.</P>
    <P>I hope what the Taoiseach said about this being a first step is true, that in the not too distant future a similar situation will apply to the private sector as well, where they also get fees and income from sectors other than the State sector.  There are a number of matters which should be pointed out in comparison with the socalled hardship which the professional people may suffer as a result of having this 35 per cent deduction applied to them.  The PAYE element has been referred to already.  There is another sector with very little capacity or power with which to withstand deductions from their incomes.  I refer to tenants of local authority houses.  If any part of their income is deemed to be derived from self-employment the local authority will impose the maximum rent on them.  It is then up to such tenants to prove they are not earning what the local authority maintain.  I know from experience that it is extremely difficult for such tenants to prove that the amount the local authority maintain they were earning does not represent their earnings.</P>
    <P>There is one point at which this proposal may fall down, that is with regard to the question of hardship referred to already.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify <Col N="923" /> this matter for us.  Is it not a fact that the resolution before us is too loose in terms of definition of hardship, or leaves it too much to the discretion of the tax office to decide whether a person or company has suffered hardship?  I appreciate that VAT is not deducted at source by the tax man, that the company or whoever must furnish appropriate returns. There are vast amounts of VAT remaining uncollected from companies, some of which have gone into liquidation owing vast sums of money.  It appears to me that there has been a fairly lenient approach on the part of the taxman or woman &mdash; I am not sure how many females act as tax inspectors &mdash; to claims by companies that they were experiencing trouble of some kind or another which, in turn, allowed these vast sums to accumulate.  I wonder whether it would be better to have a tighter definition of what constituted hardship and the criteria therefore in this resolution.  I wonder why commercial semi-State companies have been excluded.  They, too, must engage a wide range of professional services.  It would appear to me, given the number of such semi-State companies, many providing excellent services, that there must be a significant amount of professinal services provided to them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach raised a point in relation to the task force to be put at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners.  He must have misunderstood the point we were attempting to make in relation thereto, that is, that we have argued for a long time &mdash; as the Taoiseach will be aware &mdash; for a more effective and better staffed office of the Revenue Commissioners so that tax, properly assessed and due, is collectable, indeed to ensure that all taxes are properly assessed and collected on time.  We are not opposed to the strengthening of the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to us odd that a task force of 25 people, drawn from another Government Department altogether, should be given the task of pursuing tax already assessed.  It would appear to us to be preferable to restore the staff of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="924" /> to full strength in order to pursue arrears of tax in a professional and coherent way.</P>

      <P>The substance of Financial Resolution No. 1 must be welcome.  That is not to be taken in any way as approval of any other measure in this budget, much of which is reprehensible and will be contested in every way possible by the Labour Party.  This measure is broadly to be welcomed.  Virtually all of the arguments in its favour are identical with those put forward in support of the deposit interest retention tax, when introduced but which was opposed by the present Taoiseach and his party consistently until quite recently.  The first argument in favour of this resolution is that it contains an anti-evasion element. I do not know to what extent that may apply.  The same argument applied on the <Col N="925" /> imposition of the deposit interest retention tax.  In favour of the present proposal is the fact that it introduces a current liability element, as did the deposit interest retention tax, as a withholding tax.  For those reasons it introduces some small measure of equity into the system.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has said, its main attraction is that it constitutes a windfall or once-off benefit.  Going back over a number of years the Taoiseach analysed previous windfall arrangements introduced by successive Governments.  That is all right as far as it goes.  But it is high time in this country that we stopped organising our financial and tax affairs, as it were, on a basis of lurching from one windfall to another.  That is not the way in which to organise an overall equitable taxation system.  It must be remembered that we do have to tackle the overall taxation system and not deal with it by picking up a specific amount of money from this windfall one year and from another the next year because eventually those windfall arrangements will expire, if they have not already expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moneys involved in this taxation system have been given at approximately £151 million.  By any reckoning that consititutes a substantial amount.  I do not know whether the number of firms involved is available &mdash; probably it is not that great &mdash; but the amount of money is substantial.  It is fair to say that the overwhelming majority, if not all of the firms that reap the benefit of that £150 million, are strong, substantial firms.  I suppose the irony of it is that those firms that are weak and small, that might be taken to be suffering from hardship, for some strange reason are not the ones that are given Government contracts.  The Government contracts go to the biggest and strongest rather than to the smallest and weakest firms.  There has been much talk about those who might be affected by hardship arising out of the imposition of this measure.  The hardship falls on those firms who are unfortunate enough not to get the benefit of those Government contracts and of that £151 million coming in, in their fees, emoluments and <Col N="926" /> charges.  Many of those firms have gone to the wall, perhaps because they did not get their fair share of those Government contracts.  It is a major plus for any professional firm to be in that league.  It gives them the same kind of advantage talked about earlier by the Minister for Finance, of being employed in the public service. There are great advantages.  There is the security that one's money will come in, and one does not have to worry that the firm for which one is working might go into liquidation or whatever, as would apply to many workers working in the private sector.  The money is safe, secure and substantial.  I see no reason why they should not make a contribution on a current year basis.  The bulk of those firms are big firms, doing a lot of work other than in the private sector.  This is not their only income.  The PAYE sector make their contribution on a current year basis.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points on the technicalities I want to query.  A list of bodies is given here setting out accountable persons.  The National Building Agency are possibly included under paragraph (2) but I would like a clarification on that.  If they are not they should be because they would be involved to quite a degree in professional employment, particularly in the field of architecture, quantity surveying, engineering and so on.  A further point on which I want clarification is whether there is any opening here for avoidance of this tax on the basis of hiving off one of these substantial contracts that would involve these professional services.  It appears to be drawn on the basis that it is only when the actual accountable person is making the payment that the deduction applies.  If the placement of a contract is handed over to an agent and that agent is making those payments, does that mean that because the accountable person is not making the payment the deductions would not arise? How would this operate in the case of sub-payments?  It could apply in any of the professional service categories.  To illustrate my point I will relate it to the item dealing with solicitors, barristers and other legal services.  When a solicitor submits his bill for having conducted a <Col N="927" /> case, for instance on behalf of the Legal Aid Board, he will include in his bill the barrister's fees.  Let us say the barrister's fees are £1,000.  The accountable body, in this case The Legal Aid Board or the DPP, makes the payment to the solicitor and deducts the tax on the solicitor's fee and on the barrister's fee.  When the solicitor goes to pay the barrister, presumably he seeks to make the deduction but the solicitor is not an accountable person and the barrister may say to him, &ldquo;you may have your own arrangement with the accountable person.  You are paying me.  You are not an accountable person; my fee is £1,000 and you must pay me in full&rdquo;.  This may be covered in the resolution.  It could apply in other circumstances with an architect paying a quantity surveyor in like manner.  I would like some clarification on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my general views on the resolution but I would like the Minister to clarify a few points.  Is it intended that a new tax district will be set up to deal with these payments?  In the construction framework there is a special tax district which deals with construction tax and so on.  Will there be a new tax district through which all this will be channelled? If we are going to have tax inspectors throughout the country trying to deal with these issues it will lead to mass confusion and inconsistencies.  If anyone is under the impression he will get his money back when his income tax is cleared up under paragraph 9 (d), he will have to make sure that his VAT, PAYE, PRSI and the interest on same is paid.  If this comes within all the income tax Acts, is it intended that interest will be paid to the taxpayer on excess tax deducted?  It is not paid in the construction area.  The delays in dealing with tax in the construction industry are inordinate.  By the time a person fixes up his income tax affairs and then goes to another district and to the collector general to sort out the VAT, PAYE and everything else, it will be years before he will get a refund. Nobody should think that he will get a <Col N="928" /> refund overnight when this provision comes in.</P>
      <P>In relation to the last point Deputy Taylor made, a strange situation could arise with regard to the type of third party payments to which he referred.  In the construction industry when the principal contractor pays the sub-contractor he must deduct tax at 35 per cent.  If the second person pays to a third party involved in that contract the same principle applies.  The third person is a sub-contractor to the second contractor, so the 35 per cent is deducted.  It is not clear in this resolution that that is the case.  For instance, a large firm of solicitors acting for a local authority would send in the bill at the end of the month.  Made up in that bill would be barristers' fees or other third parties' fees.  The main firm of solicitors will have 35 per cent deducted on the total fee but the sub-agent will have got away with a gross payment.  In the construction industry it is not possible to do that.</P>
      <P>Under this resolution there is an opportunity for avoiding tax.  Many of the payments being made by architects' firms, engineering firms and so on would be made to third parties.  They might have to commission reports from the IIRS, consultant engineers or whatever.  It would be grossly unfair that when they send their final bill to the local authority they would deduct 35 per cent tax on the whole fee.  From my reading of the resolution it would be possible for that to happen.  I presume we will have another opportunity to discuss this on the Finance Bill as I presume this resolution will be incorporated in some section of the Finance Bill and perhaps the matter can be clarified then.  Paragraph (4) reads:</P>
      <P>(a)  the specified person shall furnish to the accountable person concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in the case of a specified person resident in the State or a person having a permanent establishment or fixed base in the State, details of his income tax or corporation tax number, as may be appropriate, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> (ii)  in the case of a specified person, other than a person mentioned in clause (i) of this subparagraph, details of his country of residence and his tax reference in that country.</P>
    <P>What happens if a payment is to be made to a person who does not have a tax number?  Does he get off scot-free?  I am sure that is not the intention.  A person must provide his tax number but the simplest way out for him is to say he does not have a tax number.  Perhaps this provision is mentioned elsewhere, but I cannot find it.  As regards payments to third party agents, I cannot see a Department sending them bills for, say, £50,000 because the agent might claim his fee was £1,000 and the balance of £49,000 had been paid to other firms.  This would mean that the 35 per cent tax would be charged only on £1,000 rather than £50,000.  This point needs to be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed at some of the points made in this debate because the reality seems to be obscured.  To say this proposal bears any relation to the retention tax or VAT at point of entry is not true, because those taxes are clearly a liability which was being brought forward. In this case we are talking about a straightforward confiscation for one year of a little more than one-third of the turnover of a business which provides a service to the State.  I do not see how this could be said to be fair when this proposal bears no relation to the ultimate tax liability of the consultant or the person providing those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression in this House tonight is that we are dealing with very wealthy solicitors, very well heeled doctors and so on, but the reality is we are dealing with people who are providing milk for school children, people who provide basic services such as hedge cutting for local authorities and very small businesses which cannot afford to have one-third of their turnover from State business deferred for one year.  Many small businesses will not be able to absorb the <Col N="930" /> effects of this decision.  I should like the Taoiseach to confess that this is a confiscation of a proportion of turnover.</P>
    <P>As Bord Fáilte and Córas Tráchtála are included in this provision, there might be consultancy contracts involved providing services which are needed to promote marketing efforts abroad.  These people would not be interested in getting involved in this bureaucratic nightmare of trying to get one-third of their fees paid one year later.  Would the Taoiseach consider exempting any such payments to overseas consultants?  I greatly fear that a step such as this, which on the surface seems to be an effort to put everyone on the same tax paying level, is closing the door to an option which up to now was open to the State.  I have in mind a number of services evolving with the local authorities moving away from direct labour and having contractors do the job, having debt collection of taxes computerised and so on.  In many of these areas companies could provide these services much cheaper than the State bodies. I fear that this opportunity could be lost at this stage and that the end result will be increased fees because we are dealing with restrictive practices in some cases. The professionals will very quickly revise their scales of fees so that any benefit to the Exchequer will be shortlived and a future Government may find that this measure cost more than it was worth.</P>

      <P>As Financial Resolution No. 2 is a direct consequence of the policy decision made by the Government to abolish the farm tax, the Labour Party will be opposing this resolution this evening. It is ironic that on a day when we have had what is being described as one of the most severe budgets in the history of the State we are discussing resolutions which are relatively inconsequential on their own when we should really be discussing the guts of the budget.  I believe the acceptance of the resolutions this evening is a test of whether the House is in favour of the budget <i>in toto</i>.  I find it hard to take, at a time when the total tax take, for example, from property taxes has decreased from 15.1 per cent of total tax in 1965 to 3.9 per cent, and when corporation tax has decreased from 9.1 per cent of total tax to 3.9 per cent that the Government today abolish what in my opinion was a very modest tax on farm land.  Despite the generous statement by the Taoiseach earlier that we were trying to evolve a current tax system to bring everyone in line with the PAYE sector, who are carrying more than their fair share of the tax bill, we are not bringing forward any indexation or any relief for the PAYE sector.  In fact, the contrary is true.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the 80 per cent plus of the taxpayers who have been watching the proceedings of this House will be fully aware of the severe impositions being made on their take home pay by the measures introduced today &mdash; the increase in the PRSI ceiling, the increase in the PRSI contribution, the increase in the health contribution coupled with the outpatient charges and the public ward charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am directly addressing the question of the value-added tax and the proposal on Resolution No. 2.  Perhaps, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance would clarify, for us how many farmers are at this point registered for VAT.  I suspect that many of the smaller farmers are not registered for VAT and as of now, because of having to register for VAT, they will have to undertake once more the expense of hiring accountants; because of the meagre incomes they have been earning during the past number of years the expenses they are going to incur will be far greater than any tax they would have paid under the land tax or under any other system of farm taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the abolition of the land tax is a retrograde step and a step in the wrong direction but I believe <Col N="933" /> also that it is a sure sign of the unwillingness of Fianna Fáil and other parties in this House to tax vested interests.  Until we are prepared to do so we will not bring about any relief to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Resolution No. 1 is concerned, I described the measure earlier this evening as a blunt instrument. The Taoiseach's explanation of interim payments has confirmed that belief.  The Taoiseach explained the matter of interim refunds and I think I am doing justice to the resolution and to the Taoiseach's explanation when I put it this way: he said that where the amount of the deduction to be made on foot of this measure was disproportionate to the tax liability of the professional service concerned in the previous year, interim payments would be made.  In other words, if the amount which fell to be paid on a monthly basis was going to be substantially in excess of the net tax liability on the profits of the previous year interim refunds would be made so that the amount of the deduction would be brought down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, it casts a lot of doubt, to say the least, on of the prospect of getting £50 million a year out of this measure because it is very clear that a great proportion of the people concerned will be applying for interim refunds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said earlier that roughly £150 million worth of business comes within the orbit of this measure. If you examine the list of the services covered by the measure you will see very quickly that in a number of these groups of services the State is actually a very large customer, if not the largest customer. I take the case of the veterinary practitioners, for example, where the State is by far the largest customer through the disease eradication scheme. If large numbers of these people are entitled to interim refunds on very large <Col N="934" /> proportions of their business, there must be a serious doubt as to whether the revenue to be raised would match up to the kinds of figures the Minister and the Taoiseach are talking about unless it is also claimed that there is a massive evasion by those people in relation to their potential tax liabilities on that part of their business which does not originate with the State.</P>
    <P>If there is that kind of massive evasion it is not a measure of this kind, which deals with only part of their business, that is required, but a completely different approach.  Given that large numbers, in fact almost by definition the vast majority of these people, are registered for VAT and income tax and that many of them are also registered as employers, I conclude that there can only be the most serious doubt as to whether the measure is going to raise revenue on anything like the scale the Government suggest.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to Resolution No. 2 which deals with value-added tax.  This resolution goes hand in hand with the Government's proposal in the budget to abolish farm tax.  The proposal to abolish farm tax sits very ill with what the Taoiseach said earlier in regard to his concern to bring all taxation onto a current basis. In fact, the farm tax, whatever else one might say about it, did bring farm taxation onto a current basis.  The intention was further reinforced this year by the proposals my colleagues and I brought forward in January to move over to a system of self assessment as the basis of the farm tax.  The Taoiseach now is going back from what was a measure of a directely current nature in relation to farm taxation to a system which under the present rules and on the basis the Minister set out this afternoon will not be to the same extent a current type of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I have about one and a half minutes left to speak on Resolution No. 2.  Resolution No. 2 is designed to replace the revenue that the Government are going to lose this year by abolishing the farm tax, by making an adjustment to value added tax.  I do not think that is the proper way of going about it.  If there is a change in one kind of tax measure that is going to lose revenue and the Government wish, there is an argument for doing this, to recoup that loss of revenue from the same people, they should look at a similar type of taxation system.  They should look to income taxation in order to recoup it.</P>
      <P>It is totally inappropriate to turn to the value added tax system to make up a shortfall on the income taxation side.  It is like saying, for example &mdash; I do not think the Government would say this &mdash; that in a given year corporation tax is not yielding enough revenue so the Government are to undermine the basis of the value added tax system in order to recoup the loss.  Value-added tax is a consumer tax.  The basis of the tax is that it accumulates in stages and is paid, by the final consumer.  It is not a tax on production. The proposal before us makes value-added tax under the flat rate refund system a tax on production because it is designed to leave a part of the burden of the value-added tax on the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Spring seems to think, I do not expect that even this measure will cause a huge rush of farmers into registration.  In fact, it will not, but that is not the point.  We decided back in 1972 that we would opt for the flat rate refund system in relation to VAT on farmers for reasons which had just as much to do with the convenience of the State and of the Revenue Commissioners as the farmers.  I know that, having been <Col N="936" /> rather intimately involved on the other side of the fence at the time.  It is not a valid procedure to go messing about with the type of tax in order to make up for what the Government have deliberately decided to do in moving away from that current base of taxation which the farm tax gave to us.</P>

      <P>While we welcome this resolution we do not agree that it will rid the tax system of the inequities and anomalies that exist.  I have heard reference to taxes on profits but we know that those in the PAYE sector when making application for education grants cannot take into account the amount of tax paid to the State.  However, it is my understanding that the tax on profits will be of benefit to the professionals and those in the private sector.  I find it surprising that the House has devoted so much time to a debate on this resolution. Why is the House spending so much time considering whether to bring professional people into the tax net when it is agreed by all and sundry that there is wholesale evasion and avoidance here?  That has resulted in the House having to consider a budget that will cause untold hardship to many people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach agrees that there is tax evasion but he is not sure where it occurs. He made a statement to that effect in reply to a question about the proposed task force.  In 1981 a census was conducted in the State and the information obtained was computerised.  Therefore, the State has on computer information about the professional and private sector, the work they are engaged in and so on. I suggest that that information should be used to ascertain the amount of tax they have paid in the past four or five years. If that is done, the State will be able to identify if there has been tax evasion or avoidance by those people.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will <Col N="938" /> have to accept that the result of Resolution No. 1 will be that there will be an increase in the cost of services to the State.  I have no doubt that those affected by the measure are planning ways and means of alleviating what will be seen by them as a very unjust provision.  With regard to Resolution No. 2 &mdash; I will not have an opportunity to go into detail about that resolution &mdash; it is my view that the direct impact of it will mean an increase in the price of a gallon of milk of 7 per cent from 1 May and an increase in the price of animals.  More important it will impact on those who can least afford to pay because those who are unregistered will be small farmers who own 14 or 15 cows.  Most of those farmers were never involved in farm tax and those who were involved were at a nominal level.  Those people will be expected to contribute towards the £9 million shortfall which the Exchequer will experience as a result of the abolition of the farm tax.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with the question of farm tax first.  I am very surprised that the socialist party, the Labour Party, are objecting to what we are doing because for as long as I have been a Member of the House it has been a simple elementary principle of socialist doctrine that everybody here should pay income tax, that everybody should pay tax on the basis of their income.  That is what I have always understood to be the approach of the Labour Party.  What we are doing is totally right.  We are putting farmers, finally, on the same basis as everybody else in the community, paying on the basis of their income.  This should mean the end of this argument once and for all.  Farmers will be in the income tax net paying on the basis of their income the same as any other single sector of the community.  I cannot understand why the Labour Party, as socialists, object to that. The land tax or farm tax was a joke.  It brought in £400,000 in 1986.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of Deputy McCreevy I should like to state that the NBA are not included &mdash; it may have been Deputy Taylor who put this question &mdash; on the principle that no commercial semi-State sectors are included because they are in competition with each other, with the private sector and so on. However it is something we can look at. It should not be forgotten that we brought this forward in three weeks; we have had three weeks to create this whole structure. The only reason we are dealing with this now by way of financial resolution is in case the Finance Bill has not come into operation by 6 June.  These matters will be dealt with again when we come to the Finance Bill and any mistakes that appear to have been made or anomalies that may arise can be discussed in the course of that debate.  The principle of introducing this withholding tax on professional fees is impeccable.</P>
      <P>There will not be any interest involved on refunds or anything else; it will be the same as in the case of the PAYE sector.  The accountable person or State body paying out the money will deduct from the solicitor and it is up to him to make his own arrangements with the barrister. The State will just collect its 35 per cent on the fees and that will be that.  Regarding an agent paying out fees, it will not matter to the accountable person, namely the State body, whether or not the services are given directly to that State body. The fees will still be deducted by the accountable person even though the services may not have been rendered to them.</P>

      <P>The Government fully recognise the potential of the tourism industry as a <Col N="707" /> major source of employment.  Prior to taking office the Government published a comprehensive document &mdash;<i>Putting Growth Back Into Tourism</i>&mdash; which details the Government's strategy for developing the tourist industry.  Central to this strategy will be a more co-ordinated and effective approach to promotional expenditure and exploitation of recent favourable developments in the cost of air and sea access to Ireland.  A more forceful marketing stance will be adopted in those markets offering the best potential for development, with emphasis on the targeting of specialist groups in particular areas of activity such as angling and golfing and also conference related business.</P>
      <P>We also recognise the urgent need for investment in the further development of tourist products, particularly those activity holidays which I have mentioned, and one of the proposals in our document under active consideration is the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism.  The establishment of the Department of Tourism and Transport, bringing together responsibility for our access transport arrangements and for the development of the tourist industry, is designed to provide a new impetus to tourism growth.  In formulating plans to stimulate such growth I will have the benefit of the study of the effectiveness of all directly tourism-related public expenditure commissioned from a firm of international consultants, whose report I expect to receive by mid-May.</P>

The finding has been implemented in full in respect of all persons to whom it applies, i.e. gardaí who retired on or after the date fixed by the arbitrator, and the widows of such gardaí.</P>
      <P>I understand that following publication of the arbitration report and on a number of occasions subsequently, the Garda Síochána Pensioners' Association has requested that the scope of the finding be extended to include pensioners who are not covered by its terms (i.e. those who retired before 1 October 1982) but that cost considerations have hitherto precluded acceding to these requests.</P>
      <P>I regret that the current critical state of the public finances means that it is not possible, for the time being at least, to extend the scope of the arbitration finding to cover the pre-October 1982 pensioners. I am conscious of the disappointment which will be felt by the pensioners affected by this outcome and I wish to assure them that their case will be reviewed sympathetically as soon as it is opportune to do so.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the inspector of taxes will not be in a position to determine if, or to what extent, the taxpayer is entitled to a rebate of income tax until he receives certain outstanding details which were requested from the taxpayer on 28 January 1987.  The inspector will now communicate with her again on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, the only television programmes which must be relayed by cable television companies are those broadcast by Radio Telefís Éireann.  While my approval is required for any other services which a cable company relays, it is a matter for the cable company to decide which non-RTE services it wishes to provide. It must also be said that cable companies are restricted by their licences to the use of radio frequency bands allocated to broadcasting for relay purposes, which, coupled with the technical characteristics of some systems, limits the number of channels which can be relayed. Consequently, it is not possible at this time to relay all available satellite services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the physical limitations which apply to cable systems and the necessity at the present time to make choices as to which of the available services should be relayed, I do not consider it unreasonable that cable companies should be left free to provide those services which they perceive will meet greatest demand. <Col N="716" /> However, I am aware of the interest in the Dublin area in receiving TV5 and I have brought it to the attention of the cable company especially having regard to educational values.</P>

      <P>The Government's proposals to stimulate growth in the tourist industry were set out in our pre-election document &mdash;<i> Putting Growth Back Into Tourism.</i> This document is indicative of the Government's commitment to realising the enormous potential of the industry and details our strategy to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central to this strategy will be a more <Col N="717" /> co-ordinated and effective approach to promotional expenditure and exploitation of the recent favourable developments in the cost of air and sea access to Ireland.  A more forceful marketing stance will be adopted in those markets offering the best potential for development with emphasis on the targeting of specialist groups in particular areas of activity such as angling and golfing and also conference-related business.</P>
    <P>We also recognise the urgent need for investment in the further development of tourist products, particularly those activity holidays which I have mentioned, and one of the proposals in our document under active consideration is the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Department of Tourism and Transport, bringing together responsibility for our access transport arrangements and for the development of the tourist industry, is designed to provide a new impetus to tourism growth.  In formulating plans to stimulate such growth I will have the benefit of the study of the effectiveness of all directly tourism-related public expenditure commissioned from a firm of international consultants, whose report I expect to receive by mid-May.</P>

RTE state that reception of their services in County Galway is in general satisfactory; they are aware, however, <Col N="718" /> that the quality of reception may vary in different parts of the county because of the nature of the terrain.  They say that they would be happy to investigate individual cases and advise viewers on how to optimise reception from the available signals.  At present the only legitimate method of providing non-RTE television services, where such services are not directly available off-air, is by relay via a cable system.  Cablelink (Galway) Ltd. currently provide cable television service in Galway city.</P>

      <P>At present there are two low interest rate schemes available to members of the farming community.  The £200 million exchange rate guarantee scheme for farmers and private peat producers, enables participants to convert part of their existing term debt and working capital requirements into low interest loans.  The interest rate is in the region of 5.5 per cent, but varies depending on the rate at which EMS currencies can be borrowed abroad.  Virtually all of the <Col N="719" /> original sum has now been allocated but some limited funds are still available; in addition, since the scheme is operated on a revolving fund basis, some further lending will arise from loans being paid back and then reallocated.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate guarantee scheme for new agricultural development purposes, of £35 million, offers loans at interest rates in the region of 9.5 per cent; the rate depending on the cost at which EMS currencies can be borrowed abroad. The purpose of this scheme is to encourage diversification into non-surplus products such as sheep, protein crops and vegetables; farming activities which although non-land using, can supplement income and provide employment for farm families; diversification into &ldquo;minority&rdquo; activities, e.g. horses (hunters and ponies); deer farming, etc. Two-thirds of the funds covered under this scheme are still available for on-lending to farmers.</P>
      <P>Both of these exchange rate guarantee schemes are administered by the Associated Banks and the ACC.  Application forms and copies of the terms and conditions of the schemes are available in the branches of these lending institutions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 8 January 1986 and was paid to 31 July 1986.  Payment was discontinued after that date following an <Col N="727" /> examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  The case was passed to an appeals officer who decided on 5 March 1987 that the person concerned was incapable of work for the period 1 August 1986 to 29 October 1986 (the date of the latest medical evidence before him at that time).  Arrears of benefit payable from 1 August 1986 to 29 October 1986 were issued on 11 March 1987.</P>
      <P>The person concerned continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity, however, payment was not issued because of an administrative error.  Payment has now been issued from 30 October to 8 January 1987.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 130 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurable employment. Based on this record she exhausted her entitlement to payment of disability benefit on 8 January 1987 having been paid for 52 weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should explain that my primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that companies meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to charge economic premiums and I cannot compel insurers to provide insurance at a particular price.  The cost of insurance is related directly to the number of accidents, the cost of claims and the consequent underwriting losses sustained by insurers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the adverse impact which the high cost of insurance can have on industry and on the cost of living generally.  As I see it, the important task is to reduce or at the very least stabilise insurance costs.  I will be examining closely measures which can be taken to improve the insurance environment and thereby ameliorate costs.  I have in mind, particularly, improvements in safety in the workplace and on the roads and reform of the legal process.  In the area of safety at work, for example, employers can benefit from the expert advice and guidance available from insurance companies over years of experience.  Despite recent encouraging trends, the number of accidents on the roads is still high and greater road safety would have a very beneficial effect on premium levels.  I hope that the momentum created by the work of the Barrington Commission on Health and Safety at Work and the National Road Safety Association can be continued so <Col N="739" /> that the numbers of accidents will decline, the number of claims will fall and the cost of claims will stabilise.  Ultimately, though, the onus is on each and every one of us to improve safety standards and safety awareness generally.</P>
    <P>In the area of reform of the legal process, I would like to see certain steps taken to help control this element of costs.  These include:</P>
    <P>abolition of jury trials,</P>
    <P>better pre-trial procedures to deal with subsidiary issues in cases going to trial,</P>
    <P>the compilation of a Book of Quantum of Damages,</P>
    <P>increasing the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts,</P>
    <P>abolition of the three counsel rule.</P>
    <P>Early progress must be made on all of these issues if the problem of high insurance costs is to be tackled in an effective manner.  I will continue to pay close attention to this whole area to ensure that improvements are brought about wherever possible.</P>

      <P>Nine former employees of the company have applied to my Department under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, for payment of awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, also for payment of arrears of wages and holiday pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, protects certain wage-related entitlements in the event of the insolvency of the employer.  The Act, however, only covers <Col N="757" /> cases where the employer is formally declared bankrupt or put into liquidation or receivership.  The problem in this case is that the company concerned appears to have ceased trading but has not been formally put into liquidation or receivership. Consequently, the employer cannot be regarded as insolvent under the 1984 Act and these claims cannot be paid under the Act.</P>
    <P>It may be possible to make regulations under the Act which would provide that employers who have ceased trading might be deemed to be insolvent for the purposes of the Act thus bringing cases such as this within the scope of the Act. The making of such regulations is under consideration, but there are complex legal and administrative problems involved.  If these problems can be resolved, the necessary regulations will be made.  If the regulations are made this will necessitate the appointment by the Minister for Labour of a relevant officer to perform the functions which would normally be carried out under the Act by a receiver or liquidator.</P>
    <P>The case has been noted in my Department and it will be considered as quickly as possible if the proposed regulations are made.  The employees concerned have already been paid their full statutory redundancy entitlements from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>

      <P>In the past few years there have been many changes in the observed needs of persons with mental handicap and in the services which are best designed to meet these needs.  The Gortroe project was designed in the seventies and is not now in full conformity with these requirements.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Southern Health Board to examine the needs of those mentally handicapped adults for whom the Gortroe project was intended and to establish the extent to which group homes located in the community would meet their needs.  In the present economic climate, however, the establishement of this service will be dependent on a reallocation of existing resources within the Southern Health Board.</P>
