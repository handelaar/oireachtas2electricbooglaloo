    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach his views on Ministers of State retaining positions on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in this House on 7 April and 12 May 1987 it has been a general principle for many years that Ministers of State should, as soon as conveniently possible after appointment, resign from membership of any local authority to which they belong, unless only a short time remains of their term of office or other special considerations are involved.  This principle continues to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if some of his Ministers of State are still serving on local authorities and if he will identify them to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a number of Ministers of State have not yet been able to resign their membership because of the principles that were enunciated.  They are: Deputies Vincent Brady, Michael Smith, Joe Walsh, Seán McCarthy, <Col N="1962" /> Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Ger Connolly, Terry Leyden, Pat the Cope Gallagher, Denis Lyons, Frank Fahey, and Noel Treacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Which ones have resigned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Candour and honesty are this Government's motto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the impression at times that the members of the Taoiseach's party do as he bids. Will the Taoiseach give an instruction that his Ministers of State should now resign forthwith from local authorities?  It is quite disgraceful that that number of Ministers of State have failed to resign since April this year.  Will the Taoiseach now give an instruction to those people to resign so that they can give their full time to the duties of their ministerial posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that the former Tánaiste and member of the Labour Party should be raising this issue in view of the headlines set by that party in previous Administrations.  I would like to assure the Deputy that we had a general meeting of Government, including Ministers of State, last Sunday to carry out a complete review of the economic situation and progress being made in economic recovery and, as a result of that meeting, I am satisfied that each and every one of these Ministers of State is, to put it mildly, playing a blinder in his or her Department.  They are fully discharging, in a most competent, thorough and meticulous way, the duties I have entrusted to them so the Deputy need not have any worries about that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include Deputy Joe Walsh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to offer the Taoiseach spectacles so that he can examine the quality of the blinder at closer range.  Will the Taoiseach ask his Ministers of State to resign?  As he said, in <Col N="1963" /> general policy terms he does not approve of Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I can assure you I will be the most relaxed person if the Taoiseach will answer the question.  Is he going to issue an instruction to the Ministers of State to resign from the local authorities, eight months after they came to office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Ministers of State serving on local authorities are eligible to claim travelling expenses in respect of attendance at meetings of local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but I expect that, as they are receiving travelling expenses as Ministers of State, there would not be any question of duplication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he will investigate that matter to ensure that there is no double claiming of expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to do so because I share the Deputy's anxiety in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate if there are any particular features or problems which prevent the Ministers of State in question from resigning, whether he has made any inquiries into this matter and whether there is anything which is preventing them from writing out letters of resignation this afternoon?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the whole process of local government be properly carried on.  Local government in its own way is just as important as national Government and indeed in many respects, from the point of view of the ordinary everyday lives of people, local government impinges on them more than national Government.  I am concerned that there should be no disruption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if there are any official estimates on the level of adult illiteracy in Ireland; the way in which illiteracy is defined for this purpose and the way in which the Irish figures compare with those in other EC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no official estimates of the level of illiteracy in Ireland.  It is extremely difficult to estimate the level of illiteracy in any country at any particular time.  Also, illiteracy may be defined in many ways depending on the purpose for which it is being defined, and illiteracy is to a large extent a question of degree in the developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> It is recognised in the EC that illiteracy is a problem of greater or lesser proportions in all member states.  There is no evidence to show how the position in Ireland compares with that in the other member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the National Adult Literacy Association published a survey which indicated that in their view 18 per cent of the adult population had difficulty in reading and writing and that less than 1 per cent of these were receiving any help from any quarter in remedying that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the agency to which the Deputy refers have issued many interesting and valuable documents.  The figure which they have quoted comes from their own compilation. With regard to the appropriation of money to deal with adult illiteracy, the amount afforded in the Estimates for 1988 is £400,000 which is on a par with the level for last year, and that will be expended to great advantage. One is always worried about the problem of illiteracy and the ways and means of combating it at all levels of society must be constantly explored.  My Department and I are very aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has introduced, freely and voluntarily, the question of money, will she state whether it is a fact that she has cut the grant to the National Adult Literacy Association which she praised a few seconds ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant for 1988 to the National Adult Literacy Association will be as it was in 1987.  The moneys to which I referred are the moneys used in the main by the VEC in dealing with the problem of illiteracy.  I am pleased we have been able to continue that funding. Deputy Bruton's own party brought in £1 million to be phased in over three years with no further commitment.  I have been enabled to maintain that funding at last year's high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not <Col N="1970" /> agree that she has cut the allocation to the National Adult Literacy Association by £28,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the main mandate in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> under the heading of education is to assist disadvantaged groups and working-class children at all levels of education and particularly refers to adult literacy and community education and will she agree that the organ for carrying this out is the VEC?  With the huge reduction in the allocation for the VEC, does the Minister think that this mandate can be adhered to particularly in relation to adult illiteracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident this can be done because a specific part of the funding to the VECs will be apportioned to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's reply that it is difficult to measure illiteracy since her own Department have been quoting a figure of over 400,000 people who would benefit from the pilot programme.  Will the Minister frankly state that she is leaving the three year programme intact?  In other words, the figure planned for this year was £500,000 and it was reduced back to £400,000.  Is the programme as planned in place or not?  Will the Minister further agree that even if she and her officials have difficulty defining literacy, such obstacles have not stood in the way of <Col N="1971" /> UNESCO and the World Health Organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in UNESCO last week and met with many people speaking of that problem.  Arising out of that we hope to consider new initiatives for dealing with it.  To go back to the Deputy's earlier point about the £1 million, this amount was announced in the previous Government's national plan, and it was envisaged that there would be an all-out effort to combat illiteracy which could be encompassed within three budgets. There was no further commitment after that period.  The money given last year was £400,000 and, in line with our national plan, there is a provision in the Estimates of 1988 of £400,000 for the problem of illiteracy.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 6, 49 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal to replace the national school building at Whitechurch, County Dublin, with a new building of traditional construction.  Tenders had been invited for the project by school authorities and recommendations submitted to my Department.  However, because of prior commitments and the pressure which these commitments placed on the capital resources available to my Department, it was not possible at the appropriate time to authorise the placing of a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whitechurch is one of several national schools whose accommodation problems are particularly acute.  These projects <Col N="1974" /> have been held up at the stage where in less difficult times the authorities might have entertained reasonable hopes of having by now had their contracts placed. These authorities have in each case made representations to me regarding their difficulties and I have indicated that I am prepared to respond with short term relief in the way of grants for refurbishing existing accommodation or providing prefabricated classrooms as appropriate. I have also indicated that I would sympathetically respond to those schools' own initiatives for a solution to their difficulties provided their proposals are reasonable and can be achieved at modest cost.  Discussions with the authorities of Whitechurch national school are proceeding and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>First, is the Minister aware that this school was built in 1923, that it was built with capacity for 60 children but that there are 140 children currently in the school and that the building in which the school is operating is not amenable to temporary works?  Is he aware that the building has been condemned as totally unsuitable by senior medical officers of the Eastern Health Board and that some of the pupils in the school are now housed in an old stable building which also is totally unsuitable for use as a school building and which cannot be structurally improved to facilitate the provision of proper primary school education for Church of Ireland children?  Could the Minister indicate, with specific reference to this school, what steps he intends taking to provide adequate school facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the previous Government before they left office authorised a number of projects to proceed in January and this project was not one of them.  The problems are acute.  The accommodation is far less than satisfactory.  I shall not be in a position to provide any capital for new school buildings in 1988.  We shall be in a position to carry out improvements and the nature of those improvements is the subject of discussion at present with the school authorities.  Improvements need not necessarily mean improvements to the existing accommodation.  I assure the Deputy that this project has a very high priority in my Department.  I am satisfied there will be a satisfactory outcome to the discussions taking place at present between the Whitechurch school authorities and my Department.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the many demands on the Minister, I, too, would like to make sure he is aware that these pupils are being taught in a stable condemned by the Eastern Health <Col N="1976" /> Board.  In view of the special circumstances, will he take a personal interest in this project?  In the event of the discussions with the authorities progressing, when does the Minister see a building on site, as all the local Deputies are very anxious to have a building on site in the very near future?  It is a very special situation when children are being taught in an old stable and I wish to add my personal support in this.</P>

What improvements does the Minister propose and what will be the cost of those improvements?  Will he further indicate if it is now the policy of his Department to scrap the building of this school?  In particular, having regard to the fact that this school provides for a minority Church of Ireland population, what improvements does the Minister intend to have carried out by way of emergency to provide better facilities for children for whom there are no alternative facilities in the whole of south Dublin?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's last reply, is he aware that the school intended to be built, and for which tenders went out recently and the time limit ran out, was a four-teacher school and that the school as it exists has more teachers and is an expanding school?  The question of reducing the costs of building such a school simply does not arise.  I have not been able to ask a supplementary question with regard to my own question and would like to ask what the Minister is referring to when he speaks about the school's own initiative and about supporting their own initiative.  Their initiative has been to raise £120,000 plus towards the building of this school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of this Government since taking office has been to try to reduce as far as possible the cost of projects.  It is agreed all round that the cost of constructing schools had gone completely out of order and it was simply costing too much to provide school buildings. On coming into office we carried out a survey as a result of which we found that at the rate of progress for the past two years it would have taken nine years to complete building in the case of sub-standard schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided, therefore, it was necessary to look at construction costs and the type of design in order to see if we could bring about a reduction in costs.  We are now doing that and I am satisfied, as a result of the arrangements which are now being made with communities, that we can reduce costs considerably.  I am glad to say that there has been progress in our discussions with the school authorities in this regard.  As those discussions are still <Col N="1978" /> in progress I do not wish to give any further details at this point in time.</P>

The question as submitted read: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Education if it is her intention to arrange for Carysfort College to continue to play a role in education&rdquo;.  The question which appears on the Order Paper asks &ldquo;the Minister for Education if she will arrange for Carysfort College to continue <Col N="1980" /> to play a role in the education system&rdquo;. Will the Minister address herself to that question?  Can the Minister tell us what is the status of the report of the committee headed by Mr. Liam Lane which was submitted to the previous Minister for Education, where he gave his agreement for a continuation of Carysfort College? Does the Minister agree with what is contained in that report?  As there is no money in the Estimates for 1988 for Carysfort College, can the Minister tell us whether money will be provided under any other subhead to allow for a continuation of the college?</P>

      <P>In answer to the first point made by Deputy Hussey, I will deal with the question as submitted on the Order Paper.  As regards the status of the report which was submitted by Mr. Liam Lane, it was a report submitted by the working party which was set up to examine the future role of Carysfort College. As I explained in my reply, no new students were enrolled in Carysfort College in either 1986 or 1987.  The present students will graduate in June 1988.  As I also said, my Department are at present holding discussions with the staff of the college and it would be incorrect of me at this point to engage in any further discussion on this question.</P>

      <P>It was hoped that the class would be in operation from the start of the current school year.

      <P>Approval in principle was taken quite some time ago.  But on 11 September the Department's inspector reported that, of the original ten children proposed for enrolment to the class, the admissions committee had selected four only for placement in the class.  It was subsequently reported that an additional two children were proposed for enrolment. This was the reason for the delay. We had to be assured that there were six eligible children before we could finally approve the appointment of a teacher. On 11 September four children only were selected by the admissions committee. Therefore the Deputy will see that the delay was not the fault of the Department. I am glad to report that the other two children have now been brought in and that the school is up and running.</P>

Remedial teaching posts have always been allocated in accordance with priority of need and not in accordance with pupil/teacher ratios.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable that larger classes will render the situation more difficult; nobody would wish to deny that.  However, my Department, and in particular the Minister herself, is anxious to ensure that, where there is a larger class, where there is an increase in the need for remedial teachers, that position will be examined.  It is very difficult to generalise.  That is what we are attempting not to do.  We will certainly examine closely any particular school or any area where it is evident that there is an increased need for additional remedial teaching.</P>

      <P>How has the Minister of State come to the policy conclusion that there is an exact equivalence between the need for remedial teachers arising in the future and those that are no longer required because the need disappeared in the past?  If one interprets his remarks one finds he is saying that <Col N="1985" /> there will be no new remedial teachers, in addition, appointed and that effectively the appointment of any new remedial teacher will have to be balanced by the loss of a remedial teacher where his Department suggest the need no longer exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance we are guided by the overall financial constraints placed on us.  Let Deputy M. Higgins be in no doubt about that.  Therefore this factor is one which must be considered carefully.  That is not to say that the whole area of remedial teaching cannot be assessed to ensure that the quota of remedial teachers we have is used or deployed in the best possible way. It is with that in mind that we will shortly be issuing new guidelines on remedial education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister of State is speaking, then, of the redeployment of remedial teachers which will involve the withdrawal of remedial teachers from areas where his Department believe they are no longer needed and sending them to other areas but that there will be no new remedial teachers appointed.  Is this what the Minister of State is stating?</P>

Does the fact that half of the schools in the country will be catering for bigger classes mean that there will be flexibility in the pay estimates?

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that, because of the increase in class sizes, there will be a deterioration in the degree of attention a teacher will be able to give to weaker students in his or her class and that, therefore, the likelihood is that in a year or two remedial teachers &mdash; where already appointed &mdash; will have to undertake an increasing workload?  Does he not accept that it would be much better at this stage to retain at least the present pupil/teacher ratio and not allow it to deteriorate in the way he and the Minister are proposing at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody in the teaching profession, including the Minister and I, accept that an increase in class size will inevitably mean some decrease in the level of attention to all students, weaker students included.  But the House would not want to believe that there will be a major upheaval.  The increase, in practical terms, in the classes affected may be as small as two or three additional pupils per class.  That is not to say that there will be other classes depending on the numbers where the increase will be quite significant.  The Minister and I are satisfied that there will not be a major reduction in the quality of teaching to our children as a result of this change.</P>

      <P>The £230,000 as envisaged in our budget and as announced for 1988 will be used to oversee the work of the primary review and to conduct the work of the curriculum council.  That is in line with our Government policy of increased productivity from all sectors. Having met yesterday the curriculum council and their chief executive, I am satisfied that they have with great confidence accepted the dual role assigned to them.  Work has already commenced on the primary review.  They are meeting quite regularly and they are carrying out their work.  I understand that the chief executive of the curriculum council will now convene the next meeting following the nomination from constituent bodies of the various members to the board.  The Deputy asked if the two bodies will meet in the one office.  The offices of the curriculum council remain as they always have been as do the chairperson, the vice-chairperson, executive and staffing.  The Primary Curriculum Review Body have to this point met in a certain place.  I do not know if they intend to remain in that place but they have been holding their meetings very effectively and have been serviced in their secretariat, collection of data, compilation of research and so on <Col N="1990" /> by what was the interim board and is now the curriculum council.</P>

I am not surprised the Minister is confused because she set up two bodies to do the work which one body were doing extremely well.  Would she not agree that this desperate setting up of bodies to conduct work which was already under way and being extremely well done by the body in existence is a total waste of resources and an example of Fianna Fáil's fear of any initiative that was undertaken by any other Government?</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I know what is wrong with the Deputy.  She is annoyed.  I have decided my priorities and, as I said here some months ago, I will never come into this House to apologise for my educational beliefs.  I saw two tasks ahead of me with regard to curriculum reform.  One which the Deputy's interim board saw as a major priority was that they would initiate a review of the primary school curriculum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In four years they never got round to doing it but they identified it as a major area of need in the review of primary schools.  They then <Col N="1991" /> identified an ongoing and very thorough review of the post-primary curriculum which I am now doing.  The Deputy's second question knocks the argument of the first one which was whether the one amount of money was to be used to do the two jobs.  Her second question was to ask what was the idea of the two bodies. One body is overseeing the work of the primary school curriculum review.  They have been set up and are proceeding with great gusto to do their job.  They will report to me in about 12 to 15 months. They have a limited, tight brief and a tight schedule of work.  They will issue their report and then their work will finish.  The newly formed, re-constituted curriculum council who were set up yesterday are glad to have the expertise of the chairperson and vice-chairperson whom the Deputy herself appointed to the interim board and the secretariat and funding available to them.  I have absolutely no doubt that both of these committees are going to work with great confidence and very rigorously to oversee all of the work of curriculum reform.  Any confusion which existed in the area of curriculum reform up to now will be cleared away by the clear brief which has been given to each of the committees. Let me put on record Deputy Hussey's commitment to curriculum reform.  I admit freely she started the process and I am glad she did so.  I wish the two bodies great success in their work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the economies she intends to introduce in order to save £6.5 million on school transport in 1988; when these changes will be introduced; and if she will make a statement in this regard in order <Col N="1995" /> that parents may prepare for the additional costs and/or changes in eligibility conditions for their children's school transport.</P>

      <P>Details of the measures to be introduced to effect the savings provided for in the 1988 school transport budget are being finalised at present. These will be circulated to the relevant parties as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinarily insufficient reply.  The Minister announced in this House on 22 October that she intended to bring in a range of economies to save £6.5 million.  Bearing in mind that there are 156,000 eligible students using school transport, she has now placed their parents under threat that they may not have a bus, that the fares may be doubled or that they may have to walk more miles.  Does the Minister not understand the anxiety caused to parents in rural Ireland as a result of her statement in the Dáil on 22 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hussey asked in her question if I would make a statement in order that parents could prepare for the additional costs and/or changes.  I do not like doing this but I must bring Deputy Hussey's mind back to 23 December 1982 when she announced to the world at large that there would be an introduction of school transport charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has introduced an unfortunately contentious note, that announcement was made two days before Christmas in order to keep faith with parents and make sure that they would not go through Christmas unaware of the fact that they would have to pay charges.  This Minister announced that there would be pilot schemes but she did not specify where these pilot schemes would be.  Parents need to know if their area is to be the subject of a pilot scheme and what the effect of such a scheme would be on their children.  What does the Minister mean by the term &ldquo;pilot scheme&rdquo;?  On what exact date will the <Col N="1996" /> Minister tell the parents what they are facing in terms of school transport in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell them before 23 December.  Regarding the question on the nature of the pilot schemes, &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; means once off.  I announced very clearly in my Estimates speech that they will be in operation in the month of September, so there will be nine months notice to the areas involved.  On 1 September next year or on whatever dates the schools reopen I intend to initiate a pilot scheme in four areas.  The content and scope of the pilot scheme and the involvement of various local interests &mdash; management boards, parents, teachers and so on &mdash; has yet to be worked out.  The changes in charges for school transport will be announced shortly to the interested parties, certainly long before Christmas Eve. The pilot schemes will come into operation in September 1988.  An indepth independent report was commissioned in September involving an outside agency and my own Department.  A very interesting report emerged which envisaged the pilot schemes among its findings.  Successive Governments since 1979 have been toying with the idea of doing something about school transport.  I intend to do something quite radical about it by establishing the four pilot schemes and then evaluating them.  We will build on that experience in the following year.  We are all aware that the huge bureaucratic cost of the school transport system is climbing at a frightening rate.  It is simply not enough to keep on charging as we all have been doing and must continue to do until we have in place a worthwhile countrywide alternative system.  I am very much aware that parents will want to know what is envisaged so that they will be planning and saving and moving towards whatever new charges will be introduced.  Very soon the interested parties will know.  The four pilot projects will operate as and from the beginning of the academic year, September 1988.</P>

      <P>Circular Letter M85/85, which issued to post-primary schools in October, 1985, introduced the requirement that, with effect from the beginning of the 1986/87 school-year, the junior cycle be of three years' duration, and the leaving certificate course be of two years' duration in all schools.  Schools which at that time were providing an authorised three-year leaving certificate course were permitted, however, to finish out that course for existing senior pupils. Schools which were then providing an authorised four-year junior cycle course were permitted to finish out that course for existing junior pupils up to the end of junior cycle.</P>

      <P>The Minister has answered that question in the same manner which she uses in any other discussion on this topic.  Since the Minister announced in the Dáil on 22 October that in future all schools would have three years and two years, is that to apply from September 1988?  In other words, are all second level schools to be reduced to five years from the next academic year?</P>

      <P>The circular issued by Deputy Hussey, when Minister for Education, to post primary schools in October 1985 introduced the requirement that, with effect from the beginning of the 1986/87 school year the junior cycle was to be three years and the leaving certificate course was to be two years.  A phasing out was permitted in the case of existing pupils in approximately 100 schools in which there had been a recognised four-year cycle and a small number with the recognised three-year senior cycle prior to September 1986.  With regard to those schools, these courses will have finished after the 1988/89 school year.  That will allow for the last phasing out of the follow through of the circular M85/85.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present projections of the demand for third level places in 1988, 1989 and 1990; the present numbers at third level; the way in which she plans to provide for the additional demand in view of the seven per cent cut for the higher education authority sector in the Estimates for 1988 and the abolition of the building plans announced by her on 22 October 1987; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated number of students in third-level education in the present academic year is 58,400.  The projected numbers for the academic years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91 are 59,500, 61,100 and 63,800 respectively.</P>
      <P>This increased demand will be met by the educational institutions examining critically every area of expenditure so that the best possible use will be made of available resources and with a view to effecting economies and increasing productivity while preserving the essential aspects of services and maintaining academic standards.  I am confident that the institutions in the HEA sector will overcome any difficulties which may arise. The system will become more efficient, more cost effective and more productive if we are to meet the challenge presented to us by increasing student numbers in a time of scarce financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having a study carried out which, <i>inter alia</i>, will look at the savings that could be made, or the additional students that could be accommodated at no extra cost by reducing the length of courses for qualifications awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.  This is similar to a provision in an action plan proposed by Deputy Hussey when she <Col N="2000" /> was Minister for Education.  I have asked the Higher Education Authority to carry out a similar exercise in their own sector by examining the question of shortening four year degree courses to three years.</P>
    <P>I will also be presenting proposals to Government on the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to examine the provision of third level places, the rationalisation of third level departments and institutions, and the funding of these institutions.  This committee will take account of the two studies I have mentioned and such factors as demographic trends, personnel requirements and the existing number of student places in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>This latter proposal is broadly in line with a decision taken by the Government of which Deputy Hussey was a member shortly before they left office which envisaged no commitment to new third level capital projects pending a review of the long term requirements for third level student places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect the two studies to be completed? When might we expect to know the plans for accommodating in the next few years the 5,000 extra students?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the sudden stopping of all capital projects at third level has created an emergency which will have to be tackled very quickly?  In the interest of preventing a crisis within the next few years would she consider calling into her Department a team of special advisers to look at this question of the third level emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am doing.  As I said, in line with the previous Government's decision, we too are deferring all further capital projects at third level pending this review, and this was in a Government memorandum <Col N="2001" /> issued by the Coalition.  As regards the second point raised by the Deputy, the two committees have been set up, and indeed with a sense of urgency, to deal with interdepartmental matters, consulting with the Higher Education Authority and the National Council for Educational Awards, and if they need outside consultants or advice on any matter outside their ambit, they will be able to call on experts.  However, my Department, the Government and I are conscious of the very rigorous attention which must be paid by the third level sector to increase throughput and productivity so that we will be able to cope with the increased number of third level students.</P>

If it can be shown that she has grossly under-estimated the number of teaching jobs which will be lost following 1 January 1988, will she withdraw the circular?  Would she not agree that the increasing of class sizes and the reduction in the number of teachers will, <Col N="2002" /> as she so often pointed out, have a bad effect on teaching at primary level?  Will she tell the House if she is confident that the number of teachers she previously mentioned as being made redundant will be as she stated then?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the important issues raised by the proposed sale of the H. Williams Group to Aviette Ltd., and Aviette's reported plans to re-sell four of the stores and a major warehouse to the Quinnsworth Group he will refer the whole deal to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices; if he will withhold his approval for any deal which does not provide adequate guarantees for the employees of the H. Williams Group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed sale of the H. Williams company was notified to me late yesterday evening pursuant to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1987.  The proposal is being examined in my Department and I will be taking a decision very shortly on whether or not to refer it to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for investigation under the Act.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns in looking at the proposed takeover of H. Williams is to see that the maximum number of jobs is protected.  This is because of the people involved, many of whom have given lengthy service in their jobs, and because redundancies and unemployment cost the State substantial amounts of money.  I will be looking closely at this and the other important aspects of the proposal in relation to developments in the grocery trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to <Col N="2007" /> comment further on the matter at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In arriving at his decision will the Minister take into account the fact that if the present scheme is allowed to go through the sole beneficiary will be the Bank of Ireland who will lay hands on the entirety or the bulk of the £14 million to the detriment of the workers who will lose their jobs, to the detriment of the suppliers and their employees who will be adversely affected and to the detriment of the State who will be committed to perhaps a couple of million of pounds in redundancy and social welfare payments? Will the Minister take into account the excessive concentration of supermarket power that will be vested in Quinnsworth, a non-national company, if the deal is allowed to go through and they acquire additional substantial outlets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that I will take all matters he has raised into account but I must point out to him that strict criteria are laid down under the Act.  This, or any other take-over proposal, must be examined under nine different headings.  I have already stated that my concerns relate to employees, suppliers, consumers and the State but they must be examined under the strict criteria laid down.  I am sure the House will appreciate that bearing in mind that the notification was handed to my Department at 5.20 p.m. yesterday it would be inappropriate of me to comment any further on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the proposal has more an appearance of a property speculation deal than a grocery trade deal?  Will he agree that serious questions hang over the role of the Bank of Ireland in this process, a group that previously refused to accept a deal that would save the H. Williams Group?  Will the Minister agree he must give serious consideration to this aspect?  It is unacceptable for the bank to be acting purely in the interest of saving <Col N="2008" /> its financial face in the matter at a cost of 1,600 jobs, as seems to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In my two responses so far I have stated that I will take all aspects into account but I must point out that my Department and I must have regard to the criteria laid down.  I will take into consideration all aspects when the proposed take-over is analysed and judged. We must carry out that examination in a studied and balanced manner.  All aspects mentioned by Members, and those to which I referred, will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that if the referral of this issue to the Examiner goes on for a matter of days that there will, in effect, be in the region of 1,700 people made redundant next Friday?  Will he agree that the stores will be closed and the customers will transfer to other multiples as a result?  Has the Minister any proposals to deal with the problem of the concentration of control by a few multiples in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House that I am concerned for the suppliers, employees, consumers, State and the state of the grocery trade and that those aspects will be taken into consideration when analysing the notification that was sent to me.  I am not prepared at this early stage to speculate as to the decision that may or may not be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How long does the Minister expect to take before he reaches a decision?  In the event of the matter being referred to the Examiner, how long does the Minister expect the Examiner to take before coming to a decision?  I will accept a rough estimate.  Is the Minister aware that under the terms of the proposed deal <Col N="2009" /> a number of outlets will be transferred to a group which is not obliged to publish its accounts in Ireland and in respect of which, therefore, credit information is not available to the Companies Office or to creditors?  Will the Minister consider taking action to remedy that as part of his investigation of this issue?  Is the Minister aware that this involves a number of outlets being transferred to a group which already has outlets in the western part of Dublin to such an extent that it could effectively give them a local monopoly on one side of the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, is familiar with the exact procedure that must be followed.  He is aware that I cannot speculate, particularly in view of the fact that the notification arrived at 5.20 p.m. yesterday.  It may well be that additional information may be required before we can finalise the examination.  The Deputy and the House will be aware that I am taking up all aspects in relation to the grocery trade and how it is carried on.  There is legislation in that regard before the House at present and more will follow.</P>

All the authorised share capital has been issued and all the shares are beneficially held by the Minister for Finance, except for one each held by the 12 directors.  Similarly, successive legislative Acts have increased the Minister's power to guarantee NET's borrowings up to a limit of £150 million. This facility is currently fully utilised.</P>

      <P>We will get them to you in a moment.  NET was formed for the purpose of manufacturing nitrogenous fertilisers and the company commenced production at its plant in Arklow in 1965. The chief products were ammonium sulphate and the fertiliser, calcium ammonium nitrate, both of which were based on ammonia which in turn was produced from heavy fuel oil.  Then the discovery of the natural gas field off the <Col N="2117" /> Kinsale Head offered NET the opportunity of using an attractive feedstock for the manufacture of ammonia.  At the beginning of 1974, NET received an allocation of gas from the field and at the end of that year with Government approval they commissioned Kellogg to build a worldscale ammonia and UREA plant at Marino Point, Cork, with annual capacities of 435,000 tonnes of ammonia and 310,000 tonnes of UREA.  However, as Deputies are only too well aware, major problems were incurred in the construction of the plant which resulted in its construction being delayed by 17 months. The final cost of the Marino Point plant was £137.3 million, an increase of 116 per cent on the first detailed estimate of £63.5 million.</P>
      <P>This cost overrun, coupled with net trading losses, placed the company in extreme financial difficulties resulting in the State having to inject £50 million in extra share capital in 1981.  This share capital is, of course, included in the issued share capital of £77.5 million to which I have already referred.  Despite this capital injection, NET did not immediately move into profit.  It lost £12.2 million in 1982 and £25.3 million in 1983.  However, it made a profit of £2.9 million in 1984 and £4.8 million in 1985.  These profits were significant results as they were achieved after the servicing of the company's heavy debt burden.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this trend did not continue. The company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and lost about £14 million to end September 1987, by which time its total debt was £180 million.  In fact, 1986 was a most difficult and unrewarding year for the fertiliser manufacturing industry and all European producers suffered losses due to a slump in world prices which resulted from cheap imports into the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing losses, combined with difficult trading conditions in Europe, compelled the senior management of NET, following a review of NET's strategic position, to conclude and recommend that an association with a major fertiliser producer was necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the company.  Their <Col N="2118" /> review identified Richardson's Fertilisers Ltd., Belfast, a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries plc, as the most suitable partner.</P>
    <P>The strategic need for an association with a major fertiliser producer arose because NET's prospects in the medium term were uncertain.  The company's debt placed an enormous strain on its cost base and on its ability to develop or survive.  There seemed little prospect of NET making any significant reduction in its debt in the medium term.  It was quite obvious that unless some significant remedial action was taken NET's ongoing losses could not be sustained and that these would place in serious doubt the very future of the company with a possible total loss of employment.  This currently amounts to 615 people of whom 301 are in Arklow, 277 in Cork and 37 in Dublin and other locations.  It was against this background and the belief that a strong native manufacturing fertiliser industry was of strategic importance to any agricultural country, that the Government decided that discussions should be opened with ICI aimed at creating a joint venture company involving NET and RFL.  In January of this year the Government approved the joint venture arrangements which had been agreed in principle following lengthy, detailed and complex negotiations.</P>
    <P>Under the joint venture arrangement the business of NET has been merged with that of RFL to form a new company, Irish Fertiliser Industries Ltd., to service the fertiliser markets in the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland.  NET at present manufactures straight nitrogenous fertilisers at Marino Point, Cork and Calcium Ammonium Nitrate at Arklow. Both of these products are based on ammonia which is produced in Cork.  By contrast, RFL &mdash; which employs approximately 340 people &mdash; manufactures a compound fertiliser at its factory in Belfast.  The new company will, therefore, be able to supply its customers with a broad range of fertilisers through its own production and also, of course, if desirable, by trading with other suppliers. It will also supply the Richardsons plant <Col N="2119" /> in Belfast with ammonia about equal in quantity to that imported by Richardsons from the United Kingdom at present. This ammonia has been surplus to NET's requirements and by its transfer to Belfast the necessity to sell it on the open market at whatever price it could obtain will be removed.  The company also intends to produce and sell intermediate products and by-products of its fertiliser manufacture.  It will also sell on foreign markets products surplus to the requirements of the home territory.  It is the company's intention to establish and maintain a competitive cost base and a strong distribution/sales system throughout the country and to utilise, wherever possible, indigenous raw materials, services and labour.  It shall also be open to the company to develop further investment opportunities, which in the opinion of the board can be separately and economically justified.</P>
    <P>The structure of the joint venture provides that Irish Fertiliser Industries will be a subsidiary owned 51 per cent by NET and 49 per cent by ICI.  NET will, of course, continue to be a 100 per cent State owned company.  NET has retained its gas contract with Bord Gáis Éireann. It will sell the gas purchased under this contract to IFI at a price which has been subject to detailed commercial negotiations between the Government, NET and ICI to ensure that it is a market related arms length price.  Through the sale of the gas NET will obtain a profit and this, plus its share of the dividends of IFI, will be used by it to service its debts.  These debts now stand at approximately £160 million following the transfer down to IFI of about £20 million of NET's debts in respect of working capital.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the joint venture was never envisaged in terms of asset sales. It was negotiated as a pooling of resources to create a stronger indigenous fertiliser company.  The financial terms were structured to ensure that the returns to the two parties would be commensurate with their relative earnings contributions.  From NET's point of view this has been achieved through a fully <Col N="2120" /> commercial gas price coupled with 51 per cent of the dividends from IFI.  On this basis, approximately 75 per cent of the profits of IFI will come to the Irish State and 25 per cent to ICI.</P>
    <P>This latter company which is a world leader in the technology of ammonia production will contribute to IFI through the input of Richardsons and its technical expertise in ammonia production.  It will also contribute through its purchasing and marketing facilities and through the sheer size of its presence in the international market place.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated NET had heavy losses over the past two years. These losses have been funded largely through short term borrowings which were due for repayment in the near future.  With the implementation of the joint venture the opportunity was taken of putting these borrowings on a longer term footing and also to provide some additional facilities.  In addition, as I have already indicated, NET has £150 million of guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>When approving of the joint venture in January 1987 the Government decided that if possible the additional medium-long term funding should be obtained from the banks on an unguaranteed basis, but that if the funding were not available on terms acceptable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance the Government would introduce legislation to guarantee the required borrowings.  Following this decision, discussions took place with a number of banks and while offers to provide the funding on an unguaranteed basis were received, the terms attaching thereto were not acceptable.  Consequently, the Government decided to introduce legislation to guarantee the additional borrowings required, that is £30 million. The banks were notified of the decision and, in anticipation of the introduction of this legislation, they provided the funding on terms acceptable to myself and to the Minister for Finance.  Medium and long term facilities of £30 million have been arranged on acceptable terms, replacing NET's existing short term borrowings <Col N="2121" /> and providing the company with a contingency margin during the initial, transitional period of the joint venture in what remain unpredictable market conditions.</P>
    <P>The provision of these facilities cleared the way for the establishment of the joint venture which was put in place on 9 October last.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that NET's financial position was and is quite serious and that the joint venture will not of itself necessarily provide sufficient money to service the debts.  A company which lost £34 million over the past 21 months will not produce significant profits for its parent Irish company immediately after joining with a profitable company in Belfast.  It must be pointed out that NET will be very exposed to movements in oil prices and to exchange rates because of the gas price formula and it will also be exposed to changes in interest charges.  For example, an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would cost NET £1.6 million per annum.  Also if oil prices slump it could result in NET getting a reduced return from IFI.  Hence, the need to provide a hedge for NET to allow it scope to service its debts over the first year or so of IFI's operations.  However, the joint venture will create a stronger more viable operational company better able than an independent NET to meet the fierce competitive pressures existing in the fertiliser industry.  I am confident that through its price and dividend payments to NET the joint venture company will contribute much more significantly to servicing the debt than NET could if it had remained an independent company.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it will take a tremendous effort on behalf of all concerned plus a significant improvement in the international fertiliser industry and related markets if the debt is to be serviced out of the moneys to be received by NET and without recourse to Exchequer support. In this regard, it should be noted that it will be the responsibility of NET to monitor the performance of IFI on behalf of the State and to keep the Government and this House informed as to its progress and the contribution it is making towards <Col N="2122" /> the servicing of NET's debts.  In addition the accounts of IFI will be incorporated into the annual accounts of NET, which company as I have already stated will remain 100 per cent State owned, and will therefore be subject to Government and Dáil scrutiny as at present.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Nitrígin Éireann Teoranta Bill will commend itself to the Dáil.  I recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government decided in January that the additional borrowing necessary for NET would be undertaken on normal commercial terms without the benefit of a State guarantee.  That is the appropriate fashion in which any commercial enterprise should raise money because in that way the company must not only convince the Government and their own board of directors but also the banks whose money is at risk, of the wisdom of the investment. By changing their minds and agreeing that a State guarantee would be given, the Government have essentially absolved the banks of their responsibility in so far as vetting the project is concerned, in that they are going to be repaid whether or not the project succeeds. They therefore do not have to exercise their critical faculty as bankers and are not at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave no information as to why the Government decided to finance this deal on a guaranteed basis, that is, with a Government guarantee rather than on the originally envisaged unguaranteed basis, beyond saying that discussions took place with a number of banks and that where offers to provide funding on an unguaranteed basis were received &mdash; the banks offered to fund this deal on an unguaranteed basis &mdash; the terms attaching thereto were not acceptable. What was unacceptable about them?  That is the key question.  If these terms were acceptable we would not need this Bill.  I hope the Government did not take a short term decision and decide that because the terms of, perhaps, the rate of interest were finer on a guaranteed <Col N="2123" /> basis they would prefer to go for a guaranteed loan because it would improve the cashflow of the company in the short term rather than go for an unguaranteed normal commercial loan because the risks are high in the event of that guarantee being called in.  I expect that the savings in the case of a guaranteed loan are not very considerable.  That is at the heart of this whole debate.  We would not need this debate if the Government decided otherwise.  Since this is the whole core of the debate, the Minister rather surprisingly has not explained, beyond the words &ldquo;not acceptable,&rdquo; why he did not opt for a normal commercial loan to finance this deal which, in the event of failure, would leave the banks at risk rather than further expose the companies, the Government and the taxpayer to the vagaries of the fertiliser market.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the situation with regard to Irish Fertiliser Industries is extremely serious.  He said: &ldquo;I must emphasise that NET's financial position was and is quite serious and that the joint venture will not of itself necessarily provide sufficient money to service the debts.&rdquo;  If that is so, why give a guarantee on the £30 million when funds were offered on an unguaranteed basis?  That is the $64,000 question or even the £180 million question to which we have not had an answer from the Minister but I am sure we will get a reply before the debate concludes.  The Minister will understand that we will need to probe somewhat more deeply into this matter.</P>
    <P>At the end of September 1987 the Minister told us that the debt of the old NET was in the region of £180 million.  How much of that debt is being transferred to the new NET and how much of it will remain with Irish Fertiliser Industries?  Is it the case that the new NET is taking over, not just the capital debt but also the working capital debt?  If they are not taking over the working capital debt can the Minister tell us how much of the debt is represented by working capital and how much of it is represented by long term debt?  The reason I ask that question is to lead on to the following one: do we <Col N="2124" /> really need to guarantee £180 million at all?  Could we not get away, for example, with simply giving them a guarantee for, let us say, £165 million?</P>
    <P>I presume that a considerable portion of the debt is related to working capital. If the working capital debt is remaining with Irish Fertiliser Industries and there is no question of guaranteeing that &mdash; we are only guaranteeing the debts of NET, the new holding company &mdash; and if the debts of the new holding company are only going to be £180 million minus the working capital, say, £20 million, £30 million, £15 million or whatever, surely one could get away with giving a guarantee to NET of a lesser sum than the £180 million debt, only part of which will remain with the holding company.</P>
    <P>Those are the essential questions I want to put to the Minister about the Bill as it comes before us in the form of two rather brief sections.  I question whether we need to have this Bill at all as the money could, and perhaps should, be borrowed on an unguaranteed basis.  I question also whether we need a debt of £180 million.  Could we not do with less since it is probable that NET will only be taking over the capital and not the working capital debts of the old company?</P>
    <P>I have another question.  The Minister told us that the company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and about £14 million to the end of September 1987.  This would seem to suggest that they are heading for a loss in the whole of 1987 at least as large as the debt in 1986.  Would I be correct in saying that that is so, or has there been an improvement in their trading position in the latter half of this year which would tend to improve the situation in the last four months of the year?  What are the prognostications?  What is the Minister's forecast of the likely profit and loss situation in 1988, first in regard to NET, the holding company, and second in regard to Irish Fertiliser Industries in which the holding company will be the majority shareholder?  We need to have the best available estimate that the Minister can give for both of those for next year before we can come to a judgment about the <Col N="2125" /> wisdom of giving the guarantee on behalf of the taxpayer which would otherwise have to be met by the banks.  It would be normal in the context of his previous capacity as managing director that the Minister when going before the board would not just provide historic information but would give the best available information at least 12 months ahead as to what he expected to happen.  I know that the fertiliser business is inherently hazardous and can be affected by a change in, for instance, the purchasing policy of the Chinese Government or the blowing up an ammonia pipeline somewhere east of the Urals which can totally throw world price off the rails.  Two such events, in China and in the Soviet Union, happened in the last two years and caused these tremendous losses.  Neither the Minister nor his predecessors could have control over these events.  I have no wish to cause difficulty for the Minister but, before we agree to this, we are entitled to that information, that is, reasonable profit forecasts.</P>
    <P>I know also that it is a requirement for State companies generally to produce a five year rolling corporate plan.  Have Irish Fertiliser Industries provided the net holding company and the Minister with such a plan?  I do not ask the Minister to reveal the details to the House because I realise that this could be commercially sensitive information affecting the competitiveness of the company but the House should be at least assured that the Minister has such a plan in his possession so that we can know that the same disciplines apply to this company in its new mixed ownership as applied in its previous holding State-owned status.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is my firm conviction that, in so far as one can be reasonably certain about things of this nature, the joint venture with ICI and Richardsons is the best route forward for this company.  There has been a tremendous shakeout in the fertiliser market worldwide in recent times.  The number of stand alone fertiliser manufacturers in Europe has been shaken down in the last three years or so to about one third of the number of companies that existed <Col N="2126" /> three years ago.  There has been a rash of mergers and closures of companies in this area as a result of market pressures. Companies are seeking safety in size in order to maintain their competitive position. For a small one nation nitrogenous fertiliser industry to survive, as NET with its two plants in Arklow and Cork had to do, it was essential that it get involved in a joint venture with a larger organisation so that it would have the financial and market muscle and the availability of the research and development of the large ICI combine in regard to new product opportunities.  The balanced range of products that this joint venture gives NET is also an important reason for its going ahead.  Prior to the merger NET were producing straight nitrogen, either calcium ammonium nitrate or urea and nothing else.  It was only able therefore to provide a portion of the farmer's fertiliser needs.  It was not able to develop a brand image as the fertiliser company that could provide all the farmer's needs.  It was not involved in providing compounds containing phosphate and potassium.  Now, through its link with Richardsons which is involved in producing compounds, NET will be able to offer a much wider and more commercially defensible range of fertilisers.  This is very welcome.  When this deal was mooted about three years ago I was involved as Minister for Industry and Commerce and, right from the beginning, I have been strongly enthusiastic about the prospect of NET getting involved in a joint venture of this kind.  I feel that NET was on the road to extinction on its own.  It is now on the best possible road towards survival and growth.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points of detail to which I should like to refer.  Can the Minister give us some information on the remuneration levels of directors of NET as compared with those of directors of Irish Fertiliser Industries?  As I understand it, the NET directors will receive for their work a level of remuneration which is extremely parsimonious and is related to the failure of successive Governments to adjust the fees of non-executive directors upwards in line with <Col N="2127" /> their responsibilities.  I believe that Irish Fertiliser Industries being only partially State-owned &mdash; 51 per cent &mdash; will not be subject to the same controls on the remuneration of either the managing director or the ordinary directors.  How will these levels of remuneration vary? This was something with which I tried, not successfully, to deal when in Government. There is a need to review the levels of remuneration of part-time directors of State companies, which should not necessitate the sale of 49 per cent of the shares of the company to create the conditions in which such a revision can take place.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give me an estimate as to when he expects the debt inherited or retained by NET to be extinguished under the arrangements that are being made?  As I understand it, Irish Fertiliser Industries will pay a dividend on any profit they make and that, of course, will go towards the reduction of the debt of NET which we are now guaranteeing to an even further extent but the main contribution towards the extinction of this debt will come from the profit that NET will make on the gas they sell to Irish Fertiliser Industries.  NET have a contract in regard to gas which must rate as one of the best contracts in the world in the sense that they are paying probably 4p or 5p per therm when the going price is somewhere in the thirties.  I understand from what the Minister says that Irish Fertiliser Industries will be paying a commercial price.  Could I tempt the Minister to tell the House what that price is? Either he or his guardian angel will know whether he should resist that temptation. This would be useful public information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very large difference between what Irish Fertiliser industries are paying to NET and what NET are paying to Marathon.  It is that difference and the amount that flows which will determine when, if ever, the debt will be paid off and when, if ever, <Col N="2128" /> the guarantee we are now being asked to give will be extinct or diminished.  For us to know whether the guarantee we are giving is a wise one we need to know more about the likely profits that NET will be making annually on the sale of gas to Irish Fertiliser Industries.  We need to know the price, as Deputy Keating interjected.  I was perhaps being unduly easy on the Minister, having sat in his position and having perhaps too much sympathy for the problems with which he has to cope.  It is legitimate information that the House should have; otherwise we shall not be able to come to a judgment as to how long it will take for the debt to be extinguished.</P>
      <P>There is another question to which I should like to advert.  I understand that the worker directors who were previously in NET will remain but that they will not be worker directors of Irish Fertiliser Industries.  This is a matter which may be raised by some Deputies during this debate.  The system of worker directors in State companies has not worked as it should have done.  I understand that in some companies &mdash; and I have reason to believe that NET were one of them &mdash; the worker directors, in fact, became fulltime directors.  They were almost like local politicians rather than people who were working on the shop floor and who had reasonable time off to attend meetings and prepare for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That might explain a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a good practice.  There are problems of direct conflict of interest between worker directors of a State Company and the interests of the company in negotiating wage increases.  If the board of directors have the job of examining a claim for a pay increase for members of their staff, obviously they are getting involved in an industrial relations negotiation in which tactics will have to be discussed.  If worker directors are sitting in on the board of directors, hearing what management tactics will be and rushing around to advise the union the next day of what management are going to say to them at the <Col N="2129" /> next stage of wage negotiations, that will hamper matters.  Usually it is not just a matter as simple as wage negotiations, changes in working practices and matters of that kind may be involved where clearly much important work has to be done.  It is an inherently unsatisfactory situation involving a conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The solution is to go for the German system where there is a supervisory board who do not get involved in day-to-day management matters as a normal board of directors do, to which the working board report and that the workers' representatives would be on the supervisory board but not on the actual working board.  This, in fact, is what is going to happen in this case, in that the workers will be on the supervisory, or holding company board, of NET but not on that of Irish Fertiliser Industries and that is welcome.  Again, it is a change that should be made on its own merits without waiting for a joint venture prospect to come forward.  Would the Minister consider that a change of this kind to a supervisory board and a working board would be an appropriate solution in respect of other companies in which he is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I suggested that shares in Irish Steel should be made available on reasonably good terms to the workers in Irish Steel and that the Minister should dilute his shareholding with a view to allowing the workers to become shareholders in the company.  That was in the context of a possible joint venture operation which I believe is the best way forward for the survival of Irish Steel, giving that company the type of strength in the market that NET now have.  I regret that is not the case in this deal for shares in Irish Fertiliser Industries to be given to any of the employees.  I ask the Minister to discuss that matter with both Irish Fertiliser Industries and NET as part of a long term strategy for the company. Once the main deal is put in place on a 51:49 basis it is possible that shareholding could be made available to the workers of NET also.  That would be a useful development.  The prospect of a capital gain arising from the added value <Col N="2130" /> of the company as a result of their own efforts would be a valuable motivation for the workforce.</P>
    <P>I have another concern on the future of the company and on which I seek information from the Minister.  I understand that the European Community introduced recently an import duty on nitrogenous fertiliser, a common Community tariff in regard to imports of fertilisers to the Community.  It appears that this duty will be sufficient to keep low cost fertilisers from eastern Europe out of the European market and in the process make things a little easier for the Community's fertiliser manufacturers and a little more expensive for the Community's farmers.  However, I understand also that one of the principles of the GATT is that there should be a standstill and roll back of duties.  In other words, there should be a standstill on new duties and a roll back of the existing duties which were initiated four or five years ago.  I cannot remember the exact date.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements in the GATT negotiations is that all new or recently introduced duties should be rolled back. What are the prospects that the protective tariff which is being introduced to protect the European fertiliser market would be rolled back as part of the GATT negotiations and if it is rolled back what would that do for the prospective profitability of Irish Fertiliser Industries?  If it does ill to the prospective profitability of Irish Fertiliser Industries what is the likelihood of the guarantee we are agreeing to here being called into play?  We need to know a little more about the prospects of the European fertiliser market in matters such as its interaction with the GATT before we can satisfy ourselves that there is no danger to this guarantee.</P>
    <P>I understand that the company have been producing good quality and good volumes of fertiliser from their plants in recent times and that the problems they face are due to the market rather than to any internal difficulties.  I am very glad to say that the managment in Irish Fertiliser <Col N="2131" /> Industries and their workforce are cooperating fully to make the present venture work.  An atmosphere of realism, which is necessary, obtains in NET at this time.  It is fair to say, and this is only an historical exercise, that some unwise decisions were made in regard to the building of Marino Point.  I am conscious that that decision was made by a Government of which I was a junior member but that should not prevent one from learning from experience.  At that time new technology was being introduced whereby gas which was produced as a by-product of oil production and which until then had been flared off and wasted could be harnessed for the production of nitrogenous fertiliser.  At the very time that technology was being introduced, when a new production facility was coming on to the market, this State decided to produce nitrogenous fertiliser from natural gas. This natural gas could have been used for any number of other purposes.  In other words, we went into the market at a time when a whole range of new alternative, competitive and much cheaper production facilities were coming on to the market.  Of course, the prospects were bad.</P>
    <P>The new plant at Marino Point was the first plant ever built by Kellog and Company, the contractors.  Of course, anyone doing anything for the first time is likely to learn from their mistakes and that is fine if they are paying for the mistakes but in this case the mistakes were being paid for by the taxpayer. There are definite lessons to be learned from the mistakes which have been made.  We are not engaged in so many large projects at this time that the lessons are of daily applicability but we need to take note of them just the same.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity also to ask the Minister, as he is the Minister responsible for prices too, what are the prospects for an increase in the price of fertiliser charged to farmers for both this and next season.  Am I to understand that NET are likely to increase their prices considerably in the near future?  I have been so advised.  To what extent will <Col N="2132" /> these increases be due to the tariff I referred to earlier on?  Essentially, those are the points I wanted to make.  I welcome the NET-ICI deal.  It is the right way forward for the company and I welcome the fact that we have an opportunity of debating it in this House.  We could of course have debated it by way of an ordinary motion.  We did not have to introduce a Bill giving a further State guarantee to £30 million in order to have a debate on the subject.  I have serious doubts as to whether this additional State guarantee on top of the present guarantee of £150 million by the taxpayer is necessary at all and nothing that the Minister has said so far has allayed those queries and concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly we, in this party, are very unconvinced by the Minister's introductory remarks.  Indeed, we go somewhat further; we feel obliged to oppose the Bill and to give a clear reason for so doing.</P>
      <P>While this proposal appears superficial to some extent, in the sense that what it is doing is changing, or allowing to be changed, the liability the Minister can incur on behalf of this company, it affords us a useful opportunity to discuss more fundamental issues.  Those basic principles would lead us to redress and reassess fundamentally the role and involvement of the State in underpinning NET any longer.  From its very foundation this company has been, is now and without any shadow of doubt will continue to be a very substantial drain on very scarce taxpayers' money without any clear idea from anyone &mdash; in fact all the indications are to the contrary &mdash; that, at some point, it will become profitable in its own right and ultimately get off the backs of taxpayers.  That is not what is being presented to us today.  There is no suggestion that that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, we must ask ourselves some basic questions: what precisely is the role of the State in relation to NET in 1987?  For example, I wonder whether or not the basic premise, which is, that a factory of this nature producing, for <Col N="2133" /> strategic purposes, an essential requirement of the agricultural sector of our economy, is as relevant any longer as it was when it was the well-intentioned design of those who drafted the first proposal. The world has changed substantially since then.  I have no doubt whatever that if we were starting from a green field base &mdash; if the House will pardon the very bad pun &mdash; any Minister coming in here today suggesting that a company be funded to the extent of £180 million worth of State guarantees would be thrown out by this House unceremoniously. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the longer this has continued the stickier it has become.  I regret to have to say that the overriding characteristic of this company, of the various debates which have attended its fluctuating financial fortunes, has been that every undertaking, promise, indicator, every restructuring, every suggestion that tomorrow would be a better day has simply not come true.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position perhaps of throwing good money after bad.  That may be a bit harsh because I am aware that the joint venture proposal, the endeavours of genuine employees in the workforce, of management, all those who want to see things go right are well intentioned, that they are all working towards an ultimate outcome which would be successful. But, we must ask ourselves the basic question: will it be successful?  We have grave doubts.  We do not think that the problem is any longer one of supply. We do not think the essential requirement should be for the State to ensure that it has within its shores the capacity to supply the marketplace.  Basically the problem is demand.  In a world economy, bearing in mind the small role we play in that, it is simply not essentially economic for a State or economy of this size to have its production capacity in this respect with the kind of economic drain it makes on our resources.  Whatever way one wants to gild the lily, the essence of this request today is to provide another £30 million of scarce resources to continue to prop up a company which, unfortunately, regrettably and very sadly has, since its <Col N="2134" /> foundation, managed to under-achieve in terms of every target it set itself.  I know there are reasons for some of that, excuses which are entertainable, but that is the bottom line.  Yet, day after day, Deputies come into this House seeking the allocation of scarce resources to very needy areas or problems.  We are told the money is not there.  We know the money is not there.  If I had a spare £30 million and I had to take the decision as to where that money would go I have not the slightest doubt that I and everybody else in this House would find many higher priorities than allocating that sum of money in this manner today.  That is what is at the bottom of it.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that someone in this House has to say that by any reasonable standard time has run out for NET, that they have been encouraged, wheedled, invested in and restructured by successive Administrations representing various sides of this House and that it has not worked.</P>
    <P>A brief look at the history of the company will testify to that.  It was with some slight sense of bemusement I reverted to the Official Report of 23 January 1963 when the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1962 was being introduced in this House by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, latterly Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  He said, at column 215:</P>
    <P>I consider it desirable to stress the fact that all moneys advanced to the company will be repayable with interest, on the lines of advances made to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  There will be no grant or subsidy assistance for this industry and there will be no tariff or quota protection in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>He said a lot of other things too but what it boiled down to &mdash; all those years ago &mdash; was that the State was underpinning for a short period of time by means of loans which would be repayable.  Not merely have they not been repaid but subsequently the disastrous Marino Point project, which was the subject of a comprehensive report from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, their <Col N="2135" /> 13th Report produced on 16 December 1980, unfortunately painted a most depressing picture.  Here I might quote from page 59 of that report, paragraph 102:</P>
    <P>The continuing decline in the Company's situation is of serious concern to the Committee.  It is clear that under its present structure the Company's activities are totally uneconomic and it is incapable of meeting its loan commitments. Expected cash losses, loan repayments and working capital requirements cannot be met without further injections of cash either by way of permanent capital or increased borrowings. The Committee is of the opinion that further borrowings should not be resorted to since they serve only to aggravate the situation further through increased interest charges and foreign exchange risk which the Company does not have the capacity to service.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 103 of the same report reads:</P>
    <P>The Company maintains that continued support by the Government can be justified on purely economic grounds and has submitted to the Committee its strategy for survival, the successful implementation of which, the Company argues, would enable NET to break even in 1984-85...</P>
    <P>And the elements of that are listed.  The House can judge for itself whether those elements have been implemented.  They include the shut-down of uneconomic activities, a programme of productivity improvement, an increase in sales prices, where possible, an injection of £80 million equity by the Government and so on.  We had that tortured debate all during that period.</P>
    <P>In the debate in 1981, similar in nature to this one, when it was proposed that the guarantees available from the Government would be increased the House was told by various speakers including Deputy Des O'Malley, then Minister, who introduced the Bill &mdash; and <Col N="2136" /> here I quote from column 2631 of the Official Report of 12 May 1981:</P>
    <P>NET's accumulated losses at the end of 1979 amounted to £24 million and the loss for 1980 is expected to be £56 million.  The total amount of NET's medium and short-term borrowings at the end of 1980 was over £200 million, with associated annual financing charges of £30 million.</P>
    <P>Later in the same column, Deputy O'Malley had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Government have concluded that the immediate financial difficulties facing NET must be tackled now and the specific purpose of the present Bill is to enable the £80 million bridging loan to be repaid by 29 May 1981 and to provide formal guarantees for the existing unguaranteed medium-term loans of £50 million.  Failure to tackle these problems at this juncture would, in my opinion, inevitably precipitate the immediate closure of the company.</P>
    <P>Therefore, under threat of possible closure of the company, the House agreed. Later the then Minister indicated the kind of restructuring then required.  We can judge for ourselves whether or not that happened.  On that occasion Deputy O'Toole said &mdash; and I quote from column 2634 of the Official Report of 12 May 1981:</P>
    <P>This company have had problems from the very beginning and one cannot but look back at the question of their building, their construction, the contracts handed out at the time, the information on which the board at that time worked which was given to them by their advisers.....</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole was talking then about the disastrous and incredible Marino Point project for which unquestionably heads, if not any other part of the anatomy, should have rolled.</P>
    <P>But as is the way with public expenditure on gas, nobody pays the price except the suffering and silent taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond said in the same debate as reported at column 2638:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> It has been estimated that NET will lose about £31 million this year.  We are in the fifth month and this figure has not been denied.  Last year they lost £50 million.  If NET had been paying the normal commercial rate for their feedstock last year..... the loss would have been £80 million,.....</P>
    <P>And so on.  I will not quote other Deputies who spoke then but a whole succession of Deputies told NET that we wanted to do right by them, we wanted to give them a chance and not to be begrudging; we wanted to encourage employment in the area.  For example, Deputy Deasy said at column 2661, and I understand his plea:</P>
    <P>Could the money we are being asked to agree to here today be spent better in the building of hospitals or in the provision of employment or by way of grant-aid for industry and for farmers? We must ask ourselves whether this money might be put to more productive use.  We must also ask whether the gas might be used in a more productive manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Peter Barry said at the time as reported at column 2659:</P>
    <P>What happened in the past so far as this plant is concerned is both regrettable and appalling.  The report of the Joint Committee was alarming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, is it necessary to quote at some length a variety of Deputies from a previous debate? The Deputy should make his own speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention of doing that.  It is germane to what we are talking about here today to paint in the background to this Bill, which is an echo of other Bills which at previous times stitched into the record of this House clear expectations by Deputies from all sides, including the Minister's party, that there was a bottom to the well and that NET, or any other organisation presumably, could not continue to expect to get handouts from the Exchequer unless they performed.  I am asking today <Col N="2138" /> whether the time has at last run out and whether we should say that we are sorry, we are giving no more guarantees, that £150 million worth of commitment, apart from the other subsidies which NET receive, is adequate.  That is the view of my party and it is important to get that point of view across.  This is not a new suggestion.  This attitude is inevitable and it mirrors accurately the aspirations and the reasonable, civilised approach of Deputies over the years.  I do not think it reasonable for the Minister to come in here today and ask for more money, particularly when in his speech he suggested that it was possible for the banks to have taken up that guarantee but that for reasons they did not do so.  I have no doubt that the reasons they did not are the same as those which inhibited the Deputies I have mentioned and quoted in their enthusiasm about NET during the years.</P>
      <P>Nobody has put a price on the energy subsidy, for example, for NET yet we find an incredibly creative, fanciful type of approach in NET now going to make a profit from selling on gas which they get at knock-down price, courtesy of the taxpayer, to another company with whom they are now in joint venture.  That is doing it by mirrors and is less than honest.  Those supplies are sold on with a profit based on a cost to NET which is subsidised by the taxpayer.  That can hardly be deemed a step on the road to profitability.  That is creative accountancy of the highest order and can only result in artificially cocooning NET and the taxpayer in some kind of Disneyland from which it is impossible to extract the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint venture with ICI, if it yields results, is welcome but I notice that ICI were clever enough.  Quite rightly, they did not take on the accumulated liabilities, and they would be mad to do so. Nowhere in what the Minister said is there a hint that there is in this suggestion of proposed additional guarantees the hope that the company will at last become self-financing or profitable.  On the contrary, every such commitment, every such promise has been broken all down the years.  The Minister said that the <Col N="2139" /> banks had been somewhat less than enthusiastic about rushing in here, despite the underpinning by the Government. In passing let me say that it is about time that this House took on the banks, particularly in terms of the disgraceful role which some banks play in manipulating the economy of this small country to their own advantage.  When the full story of the H. William debacle comes to be written that case will be further evidence in that respect.  In this case the banks are involved but, be assured, be it a financial disaster or a nuclear holocaust, the banks will come out all right.  Whatever about the workers, suppliers, creditors, taxpayers or the Revenue Commissioners, the banks will get their moneys.  I would like to see at some stage in the near future a thorough and rigorous examination in this House of the role of the banks in the economy.  In this case I want the Minister to develop that aspect of what he said to us today.</P>
    <P>He talked about how the Government decided not to take up the option which appeared to be available to them and instead to propose what is in front of us today.  He said that when approving of the joint venture in January the Government decided that if possible the additional medium/long term funding should be obtained from the banks on an unguaranteed basis, but if the funding were not available on terms acceptable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance the Government would introduce legislation to guarantee the required borrowings.  I do not know if that second part was known to the banks when the Government went looking for the money.  If we say to the banks, &ldquo;Please can we have unguaranteed moneys?  By the way, if you are not going to guarantee them it is OK because we are going to introduce a Bill anyway.&rdquo; It is reasonably predictable what the answer will be.</P>
    <P>Following this decision discussions took place, the Minister says, with a number of banks and, while offers to provide the funding on an unguaranteed basis were received, the terms attaching <Col N="2140" /> there to were not acceptable.  Why?  What precisely were the criteria on which the Minister decided not to take up the offer of unguaranteed funding?  Was it because the banks' demands were too great, that they wanted some form of equity shareholding or too big an interest return or what?  Wherever possible this House should avoid adding to the burden on taxpayers at present and this is one case where it appeared there was an option. Perhaps the Minister was quite right and maybe the terms which the banks demanded were too great but, why did the Minister decide not to take up that option?  It boils down to the fact that a burden is falling now on those who cannot afford to pay it and they are the ordinary PAYE workers who will not benefit at all from this £30 million any more than they did from the previous £150 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there is no cause for optimism.  He said that medium and long term facilities and the £30 million have been arranged on acceptable terms &mdash; acceptable, presumably, to him &mdash; replacing NET's existing short term borrowings and providing the company with a contingency margin through the initial transitional period of the joint venture in what remain unpredictable market conditions.  Just in case we doubt what he said, he went on to emphasise that NET's financial position was and is quite serious.  It will continue to be so because nowhere in this proposal, either in the Bill or in the Minister's speech, are terms and conditions demanded of NET which will make them perform or ensure that they comply with reasonable commercial criteria.  If that means that we have to take on over-manning or urgent restructuring, then it should be done. There is no more importance to be attached to a job in NET than there is to a job in my constituency or in any part of the Public Service.  It is not that one job is more important than another because those jobs are being paid for by you and me.  It is time that someone said, &ldquo;Enough is enough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everywhere in the Minister's speech there is more of the same.  Compare the text today with the text of the last <Col N="2141" /> occasion and there are echoes.  The language in some cases is the same.  I do not know if the workforce were in place then but certainly the drafter is the same or else is the son or daughter of the person who set it up in the beginning.  The same kind of language is used, the same easy option, the same appeal to the centre, the same running in front of the problem instead of taking it on and saying, &ldquo;Gentlemen, you can get it this time but you will not get it again; these are the conditions and if you do not comply the guarantee does not stand.&rdquo;  I and my party colleagues will approve of this Bill only if there are explicit terms and guarantees attaching to that £30 million which will ensure by any reasonable commercial criteria that NET become selfsustaining and self-financing.</P>
    <P>A careful look at the joint venture which the Minister talks about or hints about as being the beginning of turning the corner will reveal that that is not the case.  I am not clear as to what precisely is the interaction between the two companies, although the Minister talks about 51 per cent/49 per cent ownership stakes. Presumably the liability which NET has incurred to date will remain exclusively NET'S and is to be paid off from the profits made on the spurious sale of gas to IFI.  Does the Minister expect that NET will become self-financing at any time in the future?  He referred in his speech to the fact that NET had heavy losses over the past two years, funded largely through short term borrowings which are due for repayment in the near future.  What control do the Department exercise on the incurring of such debts? What letters of comfort are issued?  What is the total liability of NET to the State, including the full costs of all guarantees, subsidies and grants, direct and indirect? My suspicion is that due to a lack of willingness on our part to take on this problem we are spending enormous sums of money to sustain the unsustainable and to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to be so negative about this matter.  One has to have a great deal of sympathy with the workers, particularly in these days when work is so scarce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> Our priority and obligation must be to all workers, not to workers in any sheltered area.  The 615 people who currently work for NET in Arklow, Cork and Dublin need every possible consideration.  It might be more honest to suggest, however, that over the next five years that workforce might be reorientated in the direction of some other industry, perhaps related to food production or agriculture. I see no future for this company and the evidence of the past 26 years littered throughout the Dáil debates bears me out.  It gives me no solace or comfort to say so.  It would be a lot easier to say the opposite and perhaps a lot more politic too, if I were to be cute about it.  The basic point my party believe is that people are sick of cute politics and that we must call a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>I know a lot of people who have no work.  They have no work because many of us in this House refused to face up to groups who were strong or in positions of relative power.  If we had £30 million here to spare, where would we apply it? I doubt that it would be in this particular area.  It is in the context of our obligations to all workers, particularly unemployed workers, that we raise our objection.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is identical in spirit and almost in letter to a number of other previous measures.  The Marino Point project was referred to by Deputy Bruton.  It was a debacle, but that was not surprising.  My insights gained over the past three or four years working on a Committee of this House indicate that whenever the State gets involved in this kind of project it usually makes a mess of it.  I find it incredible that people will come in here, having apparently done feasibility studies, and tell people what is going to happen &mdash; but then it does not happen and will never happen.  I can take no comfort from the one or two positive notes sounded by the Minister today.  He said that the company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and about £14 million to the end of September 1987, by which time the total debt was £108 million.  I do not believe those figures take into account the subsidies I referred to earlier in <Col N="2143" /> relation to energy and soon.  l am convinced that the total liability of the company in real terms is in excess of £200 million.  This Bill asks us to allow that debt to increase without any type of conditions or guarantees accompanying it.  It would be irresponsible of us to agree. I know there is a down side to it but unfortunately there is always a down side when one tries to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the joint venture company being able to supply their customers with a broad range of fertilisers.  The problem is not the supply; it is demand and economies of scale. There are other companies in Europe who can supply what this company supply but at a cheaper rate.  That is the real difficulty.  There is no way of overcoming it.  It is no reflection on the company or the workers involved.  The Minister said that ammonia has been surplus to NET'S requirements and that by its transfer to Belfast the necessity to sell it on the open market at whatever price it could obtain would be removed.  That is another example of an organisation locking itself into a preset arrangement which may work to its advantage in the short term. The market place is ultimately where money is made and profitability arises.  It is not made in tied arrangements which will always have a lower common denomination than the higher potential rewards available in the open market place.  The joint venture will work predominantly to the advantage of ICI because it allows for a good trading arrangement by them, without incurring the liabilities of NET.</P>
    <P>The problem still remains that NET, with their huge debt, are looking for more money today as they have done every few years since they were founded, and there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that this will be the last time.  It might be better to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; now than in two or three years' time when the bill will be £250 million or £300 million.  Inevitably and inextricably that is the route this company are going.  I hope I am wrong but I cannot see any other way forward because of the evidence of the past. Guarantees were given by company <Col N="2144" /> directors and executives, by Ministers in this House and by trade unionists involved but all these have been put aside.  On that evidence we rest our case. We do so with no sense of pleasure or jubilation.  It is a tragic and difficult situation. The overriding tragedy is for those who have lost severely already, who are disemployed, unemployed and disadvantaged because this State has spent recklessly and irresponsibly money which it did not have instead of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; in areas like this where it should have been said.  This kind of attitude will continue to exacerbate the unemployment problem generally, though it may solve a temporary problem locally for a few.  The majority of the people and the unemployed will pay the full cost of what is proposed if this Bill is approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion is long overdue as to the factual situation of NET and the contents of the merger or joint venture proposed between NET and the Belfast company.  I am not sure if what is before us is the correct method of bringing about that discussion.  It is very necessary for us to have a detailed discussion but I regret that the Minister's speech left more unsaid than said regarding the basis of negotiations with Richardsons and the agreement that has been arrived at and in relation to the breakdown between the NET holding company and the new company, IFI.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to clarify the many issues to which he has not referred, either in his closing speech or on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am glad this is not a take-over, or an attempt at privatising a certain State company, but the fact that the subsidiary will be 51 per cent owned by NET and 49 per cent by ICI should be acceptable, and NET continues to be 100 per cent owned by the State.  It is difficult to comment in detail on the financial aspects of this agreement because we have not been supplied with an adequate amount of information.  It is incumbent on the Minister to do this on Committee Stage but if he does not we will be pursuing him during Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many answers which need to <Col N="2145" /> be given about the negotiations, the basis of those negotiations and the detailed minutiae of the agreement between NET and Richardsons.  The Minister should outline in detail the negotiations which took place with the banks.  As I said earlier, I am not sure if it was necessary to guarantee this £30 million.  If the future of this company is being put on a sound or reasonably sound commercial basis, the banks should have been in a position to agree loans which did not have to be guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline the basis on which the loans have been granted and the details of those loans.  It is important for the House to see the attitude being taken by the banks in negotiating a loan of this size.  It would be of interest to see if the banks are treating the State, through a State company, in a reasonable manner but it would appear, since the Minister had to come before this House, that the banks are not treating the company in a reasonable manner.  This is not something which is completely unknown to us because, as has already been pointed out, the banks will always adopt the attitude to protect themselves, irrespective of the taxpayer or anybody else.  Admittedly that is their responsibility, but it is important that we have all the details before us to debate this matter.  It would also be interesting for the House to be informed of the exact details of this loan &mdash; the rate of repayment, the terms of the loan, any guarantees or form of guarantees which have been given and so on.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about certain aspects of industrial democracy and what the future holds in relation to worker directors and the workforce generally. It is all very fine for speakers to come into this House and point the finger at the workforce or at the weaknesses in having worker directors on the board, but I do not believe it is all one-way traffic.  In my view, comments like that arise from the outdated concepts to which we cling, the worst of the concepts we inherited from across the water, as regards the relationship between management and workers.  It is high time we <Col N="2146" /> decided to do things the Irish way and not follow the old management techniques we inherited from colonial Britain.  As long as we hold on to those outdated and outmoded concepts of bad industrial relations between management and worker it will not bode well for the development of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that we have active participation by worker directors in the new company.  Many questions remain unresolved and many questions still remain to be asked.  Deputy Bruton came into this House and complained about the role being played by worker directors, the amount of time they are given and the fact that they will be seen to represent workers at board level.  I wonder if, for example, he would have any objection to members of the Beet Growers' Association being on the board of the Sugar Company?  Who will they represent?  Will they influence the price of beet?  It is natural for worker directors to represent the workers in these companies, and, Gods knows, there are times when these workers need representation.  Perhaps, on Committee Stage, the Minister would clarify the role to be played by these worker directors.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have less rather than more information as a result of the Minister's speech.  Perhaps in his concluding speech he might tell us if there is a development plan for this new company, If so, will he outline in some detail what is that plan?  We are very aware of the fluctuations which can affect the sales, marketing and pricing of this company, as well as the fluctuations in currencies and the price of oil.  If there is a development plan, we should be told about it because it would be something on which we could base our judgments as regards the wisdom of guaranteeing the borrowings for which the Minister is seeking sanction.</P>
    <P>We would also like further details on the technical aspects of the plant.  For example, will there be an upgrading of the ammonia storage facilities and the Prill Tower in Arklow which has been talked about for many years?  I should like to know if the present management <Col N="2147" /> of NET will be part of the new deal.  I also want to know about the workforce. Have we arrived at a position where there will be no further redundancies either in Arklow or Marino Point?  It is of vital importance that the workers be informed of these matters before any further progress takes place.</P>
    <P>As regards the marketing department proposals which have been discussed by the company in recent months, will the new company, IFI be reviewing those proposals and if so, when that review will conclude?  Over the years there has been mention of a study to develop IFI as a fertiliser chemical industry.  Are there any prospects for further industries or spin-off industries under the new package? If so, perhaps the Minister will let us know.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very important that we and the workforce in NET are informed of IFI's proposals in relation to worker democracy.  The concept of worker democracy is long overdue.  Workers are entitled to more information about company balance sheets and marketing and pricing policies than they have access to at present.  If we are to have the co-operation of the workforce, then the directors and managment will have to be far more open when dealing with their workers because with greater access to information there will be a better understanding of the difficulties being faced by the company.  I assume that that will lead to better co-operation in areas where co-operation may have been withheld in the past.  Will the Minister say if there will be worker director elections to the NET holding board after the next election? Will the Irish nominees to the board of IFI be responsible to the holding board of NET?  What proposals have been put in place to ensure that NET'S substantial investment in IFI is regularly and critically reviewed?  Obviously, responsibility will ultimately rest with the House but I should like to know if there will be a procedure through which we can review this on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In the past trade union representatives have been appointed to the board of NET <Col N="2148" /> and I should like to know if the Minister has considered appointing a trade union representative to the new board because such appointees will be in a position to make a substantial contribution.  Many questions arise in relation to the general conditions of workers in the NET plant and many questions remain to be answered concerning the comprehensive agreement.  I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House if that agreement will be adhered to.  Will continuity of service be guaranteed?  Will there be a role for the Department of Finance? What procedures will be invoked in regard to ministerial input into IFI?  As this is a joint venture I should like to know if it will be necessary to invoke different departmental and ministerial procedures for communications and directions to the new company.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if existing agreements with workers will be altered?  It is of vital importance that the Minister give us details of the management structure of the new company.  He should also give us details about the scholarship and apprenticeship schemes that have been in existence for many years.  Will those schemes be continued?  I am seeking replies to those questions because it is important that the joint venture should start off on the right footing.  I do not think that the methods adopted by the board of management of the old company were satisfactory in regard to the position of worker directors.  In my view worker directors did not have access to the information they were entitled to under the Companies Act.  On many occasions management steamrolled worker directors when they sought access to information.</P>
    <P>It is important that worker directors are given access to all information.  The new company is starting out with many difficulties, including debt and world wide marketing, and if it is to pull through there will have to be 110 per cent effort by management and workers.  That will not happen if there is any prevarication by management when it comes to giving worker directors access to information. It is in the interests of the company that worker directors be fully briefed and that <Col N="2149" /> their assistance is sought to deal with the many difficulties the new company will face.  The Minister should give consideration to what has happened in regard to the appointments at board level and to the appointment of a managing director of the new holding company.  He should assure the House that everything has been done in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the position of the banks in regard to this.  I hope there was not a conflict of interest between those who negotiated this deal on behalf of the IFI board and the banks. The banks have cushioned themselves in regard to future fluctuations by virtue of the State guarantee.  One has to accept that a joint venture was the best way forward for NET.  There were many difficulties in the past but they were not brought about by the action of the workforce and it is important that that is kept in mind when we are addressing the question of industrial democracy or workers' rights in the new company.  I hope the Minister will respond to the points I have raised when we are on Committee Stage. Those matters have been taken up with the new management and it is important that the Minister responds to them before the House gives him the authority he is seeking.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we are being asked to guarantee borrowing to the tune of £30 million at a time when it is not easy to come by that amount of money. We must be satisfied as to the future prospects of the company and the protection of workers who have made enormous efforts since the company ran into difficulties some years ago.  The Minister should ensure that management co-operate in permitting workers to participate at all levels of decision making, as they are entitled to.  Their participation should be welcomed.  It is important that we shake off the outdated and outmoded concepts of management-worker relationships, the worst of which we have inherited from across the water.  Without that effort the new company will face many difficulties.  The company will be involved in a very competitive world <Col N="2150" /> market having to deal with under pricing from the Far East in particular.  I hope the Minister can tell us that the workforce will be given a fair crack of the whip. That is all they have asked for and they are entitled to it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  I see it as a recognition of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta's genuine efforts to restore order to its finances and general operations as a result of a major rationalisation programme which is almost complete.  When NET was the subject of debate in both Houses, criticism of its performance was deemed appropriate but perhaps the overriding thing was the over-expenditure in the construction of its Marino Point complex.  That criticism still applies.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at Deputy Keating's holier-than-thou attitude in relation to the over-expenditure.  The Deputy queried the wisdom of the Minister's approval and wondered why the State should guarantee cost overruns by this company. In whose period of office did the finances of NET run out of control?  Deputy Keating will remember that it was in the period of office of his party.  My searches through the records of these debates have failed to uncover any favourable or positive comments but I assure the House that there are favourable and positive aspects to this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET was set up by the Government in 1961 as a private limited company so as to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser industry here.  It was conceived that this homebased industry would provide nitrogenous fertilisers to supply our premier industry, agriculture, thus removing our dependence on imported products.  The company's original factory went into production at Arklow in 1965, the initial two fertiliser products being ammonium sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate. They subsequently constructed a plant at Arklow for the production of complete concentrated fertilisers and a range of NPK products was made available to the farmer.  Contrary to the impression given I by Deputy Bruton when he spoke, NET <Col N="2151" /> provided a full range of products.  Perhaps that was one of the errors of the company &mdash; going for such a wide range of products.  However, NET, satisfied virtually every single small requirement of the farmer.  They even embarked on the hazardous production of borinated products for the beet industry.  They concentrated on a range of products for the export market.  Non-fertiliser products such as sulphuric acids, nitric acids, liquid C02 and dry ice were also produced and distributed on the home market.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Government approved the construction of an ammonia and urea plan at Marino Point in Cork and production there commenced in 1979. Ammonia, as well as being used for the production of urea in Cork and calcium ammonium nitrate at Arklow was sold on the export market. NET in its lifetime of little over 20 years has pioneered and perfected sophisticated distribution and handling systems at factory, at depot and at farm level, and after over two decades of intense research and development, NET have lifted the fertiliser industry on to a new plane.  Having worked closely with CIE on the development of transport and distribution, the industry now has a network of storage depots strategically placed at railheads throughout the country.  This results in the farmer being facilitated not only with a sure supply but with supply at a standard price regardless of distance from production plants.  Custom-built rail wagons capable of carrying 40 tonnes of bagged products on pallets provides as sophisticated a delivery service as can be found anywhere in the world.  In conjunction with State agencies such as ACOT and An Foras Taluntais, major research and development activities have resulted in a quality product being available to the farmer either in bagged, bulk or liquid form.</P>
    <P>All of these activities have provided tremendous added-value to the economy as a whole in terms of providing large scale spin-off industry and employment. Concerns such as CIE, private hauliers, shipping agents, dockers, sawmills, pallet manufacturers, engineering suppliers, <Col N="2152" /> plastic manufacturers, plastic bag manufacturers and many more have benefited directly from NET.</P>
    <P>NET has been a great friend to the farmers in that they have been assured of the vital element of nitrogenous fertiliser. NET have never let the farmers down. One season in the late seventies when industrial problems were rampant there was a curtailment of calcium ammonium nitrate production at Arklow.  The company responded by importing a massive 240,000 tonnes of bagged product over a very short period.  They shipped this tonnage into this country through a dozen ports around our coasts and this was fed into the distribution network to service the Irish farmers in good time for the season.</P>
    <P>Had NET never been established, agriculture today could not count on an assured supply of nitrogen.  Rather, we would be totally at the mercy of foreign manufacturers.  Today NET employs 600 people having peaked at one stage with a workforce of 1,500.  Having shed all of its non-profitable operations, it is now an efficient sophisticated annual producer of 512,000 tonnes of calcium ammonium nitrate, 490,000 tonnes of ammonia and 365,000 tonnes of urea.  It also supplies for the soft drinks industry 15,000 tonnes of liquid CO2.</P>
    <P>The Minister by introducing this Bill has recognised the merit of this company and the important role they play in the industrial and agricultural sectors.  The Minister wishes to go forward rather than backward.  He wishes to concentrate on this type of company to see what we can do for the nationally important sectors such as the agricultural industry.  I compliment the Minister on his forward thinking approach to this matter.  With their fusing with ICI and the Richardson concern in Belfast on a 51-49 per cent basis, this company can go on to better things.  I wish the newly moulded firm, Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited, the very best for the future.  Regardless of the negative approach taken by Deputy Keating earlier in the day, I think we will be sitting here in a couple of year's time with a different viewpoint.  The Minister <Col N="2153" /> is adopting a positive approach to this matter rather than the negative approaches that were taken in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final plea to the Minister.  The streamlining of NET at Arklow, while setting the company on a viable footing, has had serious economic implications for the town and hinterland.  The reduction of the workforce has meant job losses of sizeable proportions both directly and indirectly and the area is now in critical circumstances. The adjacent town of Wicklow, in the aftermath of the Veha debacle, is also economically crippled and the western area of the county has also witnessed a significant increase in unemployment.  I urgently make this plea, that the Minister consider a temporary designation order under section 6 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, in respect of these areas of County Wicklow. This designation instrument has proven successful in other areas and perhaps it could now be used to breed new industrial and economic life into this ultra-depressed region of County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to hear the positive aspects of the NET operation as outlined by the Deputy after listening to the dreadful, doleful and typically negative attitude of Deputy Michael Keating who did not have a good word to say about NET.  I am glad Deputy Keating is opposing this deal.  I am opposing it, too, but for totally different reasons.  Although he did not give a positive affirmation of the intentions of the PDs in regard to NET, it seemed he was complaining about this deal because we did not entrust the whole company to ICI.  We are only giving them 49 per cent of it.</P>

      <P>He seemed to say that the State should not hold any portion of NET, in other words we should give the whole company to ICI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2154" /> The word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; has not been used by anybody in this debate so far.  Is this our first privatised company?  The Minister will say, no, that the State are retaining overall control of the holding company but it seems that this is our first step towards privatisation of this company. There is now a demand for an extra £30 million loan facility for NET while at the same time we are told that the privatisation element should eliminate the need for further loans.  The whole purpose of private enterprise coming into the State sector is to inject capital and to ensure that the State does not have to inject further money.  We are now discussing a Bill which will increase the borrowings of NET from £150 million to £180 million, an increase of £30 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating's attitude was that NET'S losses should be added to because of the subsidised price at which they are getting gas.  It is not subsidised. They are getting it at a lower price from the multinational company, Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited.  Does he want them to charge NET more for the gas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Who does the gas belong to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, Marathon got about a quarter of the seas in the area for £500 back in the fifties under a Fianna Fáil Government so it is Marathon who own the gas although the State should own it.  Deputy Keating seemed to say that NET are getting a subsidy in this area.  They have not got any loans or grants from the State apart from the £50 million equity in the late seventies.  If we are to consider Deputy Keating's argument it is an argument which should be considered within the context of every manufacturing company, taking into account all the loans, grants, subsidies, tax reliefs and so on which the private sector gets.  The manner in which Deputy Keating spoke about NET &mdash; and this is the typical attitude of the PDs &mdash; was that by virtue of the fact that they are a State trading company they must be bad, that there must be something wrong with them that <Col N="2155" /> they could not possibly be up to the standard of the private sector companies which are all going to the wall in debt and are looking for loans, grants and subsidies from Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and other Stage agencies.  He seemed to imply that there is nothing wrong with giving them money, that they are private sector companies and must be efficient.  That is not the right word to use to describe them. They may make money but in most cases it is through ripping off people, as can be seen quite frequently.  Unfortunately, this was the fate of NET from the very outset.</P>
      <P>Kellog, the multinational construction company, ripped them off to the extent, as is indicated in the Minister's speech, that the quantified costs were set at £65 million but eventually they had to pay in excess of £137 million. From then on this enormous debt was wrapped around the necks of NET, leaving them in an impossible position from day one of having to pay back that debt with interest.  The management of the company were brought to task about that matter.  In 1974 the trade unions called for a public inquiry in regard to the manner in which management allowed the Kellog construction company to rip them off and to escalate costs to 116 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case one would think that the private sector company would do better, let us compare Alcan which is a combination of three multinational companies whom one would say would be highly efficient in this regard.  Unfortunately, the construction companies were able to rip them off to almost exactly the same extent because Alcan's original costs were £326 million and the final costs were about £620 million.  That was a cost escalation of 90 per cent; the cost escalation for NET was 116 per cent.  Alcan was run by three multinational companies; they had a cost escalation of 90 per cent and were also 12 months behind schedule; the NET project was 15 months behind schedule.  NET were ripped off but so were private sector multinational companies ripped off by other private sector construction companies.  That does not <Col N="2156" /> excuse in any way NET allowing those costs to escalate and allowing themselves to be ripped off in that manner but it does show that they are no worse and no better than the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Despite the huge debt which they were given from day one, NET, year after year from 1971, increased their trading profits and eventually moved into profitability in 1984 with £2.9 million and £4.8 million in 1985.  Those profits were made after paying off interest charges and repayment of debt of over £23 million and £25 million in those years.  In other words, in 1982 there was a trading profit of £32.9 million, almost £33 million, and in 1983 there was a trading profit of £25 million. In 1984 there was a trading profit of £42 million.  They ended up with only £2.9 million profit because they had to, and did, reduce the debt by paying off capital and paying off the interest charges of approximately £23 million.  In 1985 they had a trading profit of £30 million.  In that year they made a profit of £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, 1986 was a disastrous year for fertiliser companies all over Europe because of cheap imports. In that year, while they had been moving rapidly forward into profitability each year, in 1986, as a result of this problem in the fertiliser industry in Europe, they lost £19.5 million.  The Minister said that this loss of profits in 1986 of £19.5 million compelled &mdash; and that is the word the Minister used &mdash; senior management of NET to conclude that an association with a major fertiliser producer was necessary. They were compelled by the losses in 1986 to look at an association with a major fertiliser producer.  If one is acting under compulsion one is not in the best position to make a deal.  Presumably the compulsions were added to by pressures from Government and Ministers, from the media and whoever else.  Under compulsion they went into this deal.  The question then is, did they get a good deal or were they, once again, ripped off as they had been in the original construction of the company?  I believe they did not get a good deal because the end result is that NET, the holding company, 100 per cent State-owned, are also the holding <Col N="2157" /> company for the whole of the debt. One hundred per cent of the debt is held by the State and the Minister has not given us any indication of what assets the company holds.  But they do hold all of this enormous debt of £180 million and they must repay this.  The obligation is on NET, a State company, to repay all of this £180 million.  At the same time, they set up a production company of which NET holds 51 per cent and Richardsons of Belfast, a subsidiary of ICI, get 49 per cent.  That production company has no debts whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in a totally new position.  If NET had been in this position from the beginning they would have been making fantastic profits every year; they would never have made a loss, except one year.  This production company, IFI, has no debt.  Deputy Bruton quite rightly made the point that we need to know the profits this company will be making.  To see whether we got a good deal or ICI got the best of the deal, we need to look at the trading profits NET have been making over the years.  If they had been making these profits and did not have to pay interest and capital off their debt, how much profit would they have had?  On that basis this new company should be making a very substantial profit each year.  Perhaps what Deputy Bruton means is that we should watch their accounting systems because, as we ought to know by now from association with many other multinational companies, they never show a profit in their accounts.  They can manage this by paying amounts into other subsidiary companies of their own and thus show a loss in the company that is reporting to us here in Ireland while the profits are going to some of their subsidiaries.  We are well aware of how that can be done and profits covered up.  We need to know their profits; we need to know their accounting system; we need to know the share we are getting and the share that ICI are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how a Minister <Col N="2158" /> can come in here and ask us to approve a deal of giving Richardsons 49 per cent of this company for nothing.  Not one penny are they investing.  When we heard of this deal at the beginning of the year everyone assumed that the purpose was to get ICI to put in some of their money. Then we heard last spring that they were only putting in £2 million.  We thought this was dreadful.  Now we discover they are not putting in one penny.  For no investment whatsoever they are getting 49 per cent control of a fertiliser company and we are asked in this Bill to increase the borrowing by £30 million.  Why not ask ICI to put in the £30 million?  It would be a good bargain for them.  It would be well worth it to them to put in the £30 million themselves.  They would have a 49 per cent stake in the company and they would have their £30 million in two or three years at the most.  It would be a really good deal at £30 million but they are not asked to put in one penny and the Bill is brought here for us to increase the borrowings by another £30 million.</P>
    <P>There is another part of the deal here which gives Richardsons the right to take &mdash; I have seen no mention of price &mdash; the ammonia.  They</P>
    <P>&ldquo;would supply the Richardson plant in Belfast with ammonia about equal in quantity to that imported by Richardson's from the United Kingdom at present.  This ammonia has been surplus to NET'S requirements and by its transfer to Belfast the necessity to sell it on the open market at whatever price it could obtain will be removed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I just cannot understand what point the Minister is making there.  He is telling us that by giving it away they do not have to sell it.  He certainly does not say that they are selling the ammonia to Richardson's. Perhaps I am wrong and I would ask the Minister to clarify that.  He simply says that they will supply that ammonia with which Richardson's can do what they like, sell it at their own profit.  This does not go into the new IFI company but to Richardson's in Belfast.  Unless the Minister can explain the manner in which <Col N="2159" /> that deal is to be made, this is an extraordinary give-away deal.</P>
    <P>I must agree with Deputy Spring's remarks in regard to worker directors on the board of NET.  These worker directors are there under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977. By Statute they have to be on the NET board.  Deputy Bruton totally disagreed with the manner in which they were acting on the board.  They actually had the cheek to be present at all board meetings and be acting fully within their rights and capacity and according to him they should not have done that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have sat there meekly and said nothing, or have attended meetings now and again and not pretended that they knew anything. They participated fully on the board, as they had every right to do, as other people on boards have a right to. The vast majority of the boards in the public sector are made up of people from the public sector, from other public sector companies, where they can pursue their own interests on those boards.  They have every right to pursue their own interests on those boards for their private profit and so also have the worker directors the right to pursue their interests fully.  That is what the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Act is all about.  In NET the worker directors took their responsibilities very seriously.  Elections for worker directors always had over a 90 per cent poll.  Because they took their work seriously, they are being criticised by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the new set-up they are being left at the top, holding the debt of £180 million, with no participation whatsoever in the company underneath.  They are not worker directors any more.  They are sitting on this holding company, holding the baby, the debt, nothing else.  One of the factors that ICI-Richardsons insisted on when making the deal with the Coalition Minister of the time was that there would not be any worker directors &mdash;&ldquo;No <Col N="2160" /> workers directors for us.  End of story.&rdquo; The Minister of the day conceded this.  I agree with Deputy Spring's remarks with regard to worker directors, but regret that he did not express these at the Cabinet table, that he did not deal with that issue at the time when he had the opportunity. This joint venture between ICI and NET was the last act approved of by the Cabinet before the Labour Deputies left it.  Why that joint venture agreement was agreed to without consultation with the worker directors, without having ensured that the worker directors would be on the new board, the board of the production company, I cannot understand. The discussion with them was minimal or nil, I am not sure which, but I think that it was nil.  It seems that the whole Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act is being rolled back and that this will be the guideline for the future in any privatisation efforts in which the Government intend to participate. Where there are public sector companies with worker directors, these will be pushed into a back room somewhere, with no participation whatsoever.  The whole idea of that Act was that they would participate.</P>
    <P>During the period when these worker directors were active &mdash; this is what Deputy Bruton was objecting to &mdash; the employment level in NET in 1980 was 1,498.  This was reduced by January 1985 to 809, that is 600 fewer, and in that time turnover rose from £72.1 million in 1980 to £123.4 million in 1984 &mdash; under these worker directors.  They were going for competitiveness; they were going for increased production because they knew that their company depended on it.  They were not in any way obstructive on the NET board; they were most constructive, most helpful.  In the whole industrialisation area the Minister will find that there will be great difficulties in this new company unless they pursue this issue of the right of worker directors to be on the board.  We are moving into the 21st century and there is no point in trying to slide back into the 19th century, as seems to be the case with the PDs and some others following them.  Unfortunately, <Col N="2161" /> Fianna Fáil are going back in the footsteps of the PDs.</P>
    <P>Lastly, what will be the accountability to the Dáil in the new set-up?  The Minister dealt with this but I am not quite sure what he meant.  He said:</P>
    <P>In this regard it will be the responsibility of NET to monitor the performance of IFI on behalf of the State and to keep the Government and this House informed as to its progress and the contribution it is making towards the servicing of NET's debt.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>In addition, the accounts of IFI will be incorporated into the annual accounts of NET.</P>
    <P>Will the accounts of these two companies be shown separately and made clear?  What does the Minister mean?  To what extent shall we have full accounts from IFI to NET and to the House and to what extent will the Dáil, through the Government, be able to control or affect decisions which are being made by the board of IFI through NET?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>By bringing this Bill forward the Government recognise the importance of an indigenous fertiliser industry to this country because it is an agricultural one.  To have fertiliser resources which are necessary to produce the maximum amount from our fields, it is important that there should be a native industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the present troubles go back to the time of the construction of the Marino Point plant when the overruns were of enormous proportions.  These overruns were due not alone to the main contractor but also to the many labour troubles which had been stirred up.  There is no point in closing our eyes to the fact that during the construction of that plant there was a strike almost every day many of which were completely unjustified. Since then there have been improvements in the returns of the company with profits being shown in the years 1984 and 1985.  The world market took a downturn in both 1986 and 1987 due to plants <Col N="2162" /> coming on stream in India and other Asian countries which resulted in an oversupply of the market.</P>
    <P>The company suffered losses in 1986 and for the period up to the end of September 1987 and the company had no option but to look in a realistic manner over the last 18 months at how they could survive.  There was only one way in which they could hope to survive and that was by supplying the full market in this country at least.  The company were not producing compounds such as the ones being produced by Richardson's of Belfast.  To supply the full market they needed capital investment and this was not on.  They looked at the options available to them and chose to enter a joint venture with Richardson's with units in Cork, at Marino Point in Cobh, in Wicklow and in Belfast.  That was the only option which the company had and they made a wise decision.</P>
    <P>Besides looking at the supply of material the company also had to look at the number of its workforce.  Their total workforce amounted to 667 with 277 persons being employed at Marino Point in Cobh, which is in my constituency.  Both direct and indirect services such as haulage services, the manufacture of plastic bags, export services and the shipping industry gained from the setting up of NET and it would have been inexcusable of NET if they had not looked at ways of keeping the company in existence with the least amount of disruption to their workforce and to the other services which depended on them.  If they did not take the best available option they would have had to take the blame for the consequences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring should stop codding the people.  The previous Government were responsible for the deal which was done and in saying this I am not lecturing them or saying they were wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that the Labour Party support this Bill.  Indeed, the Labour Party, as the previous speaker has said, were involved in the early discussions on the joint venture. While I was a Minister this matter was discussed.  Deputy Spring and others in the Labour Party were also Ministers at that time.  I am glad that the Government have decided to continue the policy of trying to bring forward a joint venture and to establish Irish Fertiliser Industries. The leader of my party, Deputy Spring, has spoken at length on this Bill.  Earlier I attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and as a result I was unable to be here to present the case for the Labour Party.  Deputy Spring made most of the points that I wished to make and therefore I can be relatively brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assertions which were made by Deputy Ahern as to the part which was <Col N="2164" /> played by the Labour Party in the joint venture seem to be at odds with what actually happened.  As I said, I welcome the setting up of this joint venture.  When in Government I realised that we would not have NET or a fertiliser industry in this country if this possibility had not been looked at.  I have represented Wicklow since 1969 and was a trade union official in Wicklow before NET were established.  I had many associations with the setting up of the company in the Arklow area.  In the good days over 1,200 full time and part time staff were employed by the company.  It is a sad commentary that because of international competition and mistakes made about certain capital construction works and investment over the years the company is now laden with debts to the extent of £180 million.  On any side of this House we could analyse why, suggest how those debts arose and cry crocodile tears, blaming different Administrations.  The fact is that this company was established to do a particular job which it did successfully over a number of years.  As I said in Wicklow, it was an excellent company providing employment in the town of Arklow for people from north Wexford and other rural areas including some from the town of Wicklow itself.  It is sad to see the workforce now reduced to just over 300 but we should remember that it does mean the employment of 300 people in the Arklow area.  Without the provisions of this Bill there would be involved another batch of redundancies if not the total elimination of the company.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the Cork section of the company but I do represent Wicklow and have a bias in that direction.  I do not mind declaring that bias.  Nobody has ever declared their biases from these benches but I declare mine as a Deputy who has tried to build up this company and seen the ravages that have taken place as a result, first, of various decisions taken internally and, second, from the dumping of fertiliser on the European market.</P>
    <P>When we first became a member of the EC we understood that Community <Col N="2165" /> preference constituted one of the cornerstones of the Common Agriculture Policy.  However, we now find that community preference does not extend to the fertiliser industry which is so closely associated with agriculture and totally dependent on that industry for the purchase of its products.  Because of the dumping of fertilisers from outside the Community all fertiliser industries within the Community are now experiencing difficulty. Those difficulties have brought about a unified response from the fertiliser industry within the Community.  It is natural that another company operating on this island &mdash; I did not hear anybody comment that, for once, we see unity between the Six Counties and the Republic brought about within the parameters of one company &mdash; should be welcomed.  In that respect I welcome that development.  I welcome it also because I believe it to be the only vehicle that would ensure the survival of NET.</P>
    <P>The workforce has been discussed at length here.  Undoubtedly that workforce have produced the goods, have been reorganised to the extent that the various plant productions, in Arklow and in Cork, have been exceptional bearing in mind the reduced numbers employed.  As recently as 1986 the production of CAN in the Arklow factory set a new record of 462,000 tons and the production of ammonia at Marino Point was way ahead of target.  This information can be gleaned from the latest report of NET. Therefore it can be maintained that, at operation level, the workforce have produced the product at the most competitive price possible bearing in mind the cost of input.  No matter how efficient any company producing fertiliser within the Community is at present it cannot withstand the dumping that has been going on in recent years from outside the Community.  Therefore we have not alone the problem of a company here established by the State losing money but we appear to be powerless within the Community to prevent or arrest the problems common to the whole Community. While the proviso of Community preference was included in the Treaty of <Col N="2166" /> Rome it does not appear to operate in favour of that industry or in the circumstances in which it now finds itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla said he will oppose this Bill while, in the same breath, speaking highly of the workforce and advocating their maintenance in Arklow and Cork.  I do not understand how one can deny a company the money it requires to continue its operations while at the same time being in favour of the maintenance of employment in the industry.  It is not good enough to make a few comments about the Labour Party in Government, the influence of worker directors on the board while saying: I will vote against the Bill which will make worker directors still maintained by the company redundant.  I am not sure how much one can say about discussions that took place in Cabinet while the Coalition Government were in office but when the relevant records are produced &mdash; after 30 years or whenever &mdash; they will show that the Labour Party did not sit quietly around that table without commenting on the position of worker directors either in NET or within what will be the new company which will be known as Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited.  The records will demonstrate that the members of the Labour Party did indeed make their legitimate contribution on behalf of worker directors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, having made that contribution, time has passed and there is now a different Government in office who must carry the responsibility. However, we are concerned about the position of worker directors in the new set-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will comment on the points raised by Deputy Spring earlier. The House should remember that there was a meeting of the board of NET on 1 and 2 October from which the worker directors were excluded.  I should like the Minister to investigate that matter because I know that decisions were taken at that meeting.  I know that under paragraph 94 of the Articles of <Col N="2167" /> Association of NET and the provisions of the Companies Act those worker directors should not have been excluded from that meeting and any decisions taken at it.  I believe any decisions taken at that meeting are void because those worker directors were excluded.  I have it in writing from a worker director that they were excluded.  Since the new company has been established those worker directors involved in the NET side of the operations have been told that they cannot attend to worker director duties in company time, a practice engaged in in the past.  They have been refused accepting telephone calls relating to worker participation business and have had their office facilities withdrawn. Indeed, they are not allowed to communicate with other company employees in company time.  Therefore, it will be seen that there has been a change in approach to worker directors in recent times, something I hope the Minister will investigate.  I hope the Minister has a commitment to worker directors because their commitment to this and other public companies has been beneficial.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the Bill before the House, it was wrong for Deputy Mac Giolla to contend that no debt commitment had been passed on from the original company to the present one.  The Minister said in his introductory remarks that £20 million had been taken off the debt commitment and passed on to the new company. So I assume that that is apportioned between the two companies who have now joined forces to make a new company. I hope that this company will make progress so that they can pay off the original debt and ensure the continuation and expansion of employment in both Wicklow and Cork.  As my colleague, Deputy Jacob from Wicklow, has said, employment has diminished substantially in the last eight to ten years not only in NET but also in other companies particularly in the Arklow area and other areas including my town of Wicklow.  I hope that the Minister listens to the proposal the Deputy made about the designated <Col N="2168" /> area for Wicklow.  It will stand investigation. The problems of unemployment there and right across the county demand some sort of reaction from the Minister considering the situation in the Dublin port area.  We hope that the Minister will consider County Wicklow where unemployment and emigration are as grave as in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill.  Questions have been asked about the joint venture which require answers but I come in here with a certain bias because I represent a constituency that has been ravaged by redundancy in this its largest industry.  I hope this new venture will be a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House anyhow but let me say that this raises an important issue in energy as well as in industry.  It is good to see that this agreement is being put together and that we can continue the company in operation.  It is right to regard past investments, be they mistaken or not, as some cost.  However, the key issue is that NET must pay a price comparable with the best alternative use of gas that is available to us.  After all, gas is a very scarce natural resource which we have available to us.  It is due to run out in ten years and NET have not been regarded as a prime user.  Therefore, it is crucial in any agreement that the price be on a commercial basis representing the best alternative use available of that gas.  Any other agreement would be selling the people short in regard to their natural resources.</P>
      <P>Despite what the Minister said, that the price would be on a commercial basis, in his own party's manifesto published before the last election there is quite an explicit statement that they will deviate from the principle of commercial pricing in order to help certain industries.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that there will not be a deviation from pricing natural gas sensibly, namely at the best alternative use available to people, in selling it to this new joint venture company, and that we will not see some deal made subsequently if the company find themselves in trading difficulties when the price will be marked down.  That seems to be suggested in the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>

      <P>When I came into power I had two options.  The first was to accept and put through the agreement and the decision of the previous Government who negotiated every detail of this agreement and concluded and approved it in <Col N="2170" /> January 1987.  It beats me to hear people asking questions here about various details of these negotiations that went on for a couple of years when the parties who ask the questions knew every single bit of information that was available then.  Nothing has changed since.  The other option was to close down NET because the Government had no funds to put into it.  It is quite clear that the second option was to break the agreement which the previous Government had concluded. They come in here and talk about Government guarantees and about me opting for a Government guarantee when the Government decision in January 1987 was, as I spelled out in my speech in this House, to look for money from the banks without a Government guarantee to do this deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>But they continued to say that if those terms were not acceptable to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce I should proceed to give a Government guarantee by legislation in this House. That is the purpose of the Bill before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms were unacceptable for two reasons.  One was that they were charging over and above the rate that anybody in his right senses would pay.  That would add an additional cost between £120,000 and £200,000 per annum.  Secondly, they were looking for a different type of security.  If Deputy Bruton were here he would not have given it to them either.  Neither of the two Deputies Bruton would have agreed to this additional security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly, but not.  To take bad terms with that, which is close enough to what the Deputy is talking about, to take the new terms, the much reduced terms with a State guarantee was the second option.  I expressed it quite clearly in my speech.  There are a number of questions here that I will not have time to answer this evening but I will be quite happy to answer them on Committee Stage.  However, let me say that we have appointed a very good board of directors to this company.  They are four of our top class businessmen.  I will not name them because everybody knows who they are. I was questioned about their remuneration. The question of their remuneration never arose.  Those people are prepared to give their time and services to work hard to turn a company around from their difficulties into a profitable Irish company for the Irish nation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress at the outset that our intention in bringing this Bill to the House was certainly not in order to score political points.  The whole point of having a statutory board is to take it out of the realm of politics altogether and to give the work of such a board a permanence and status which endures through the terms of office of different Governments and different Ministers.  In <Col N="2173" /> other words, it stops it being a political football.</P>
    <P>Having founded the interim board when I was in Government, I was extremely happy that the present Minister, then on this side of the House, enthusiastically endorsed the opinion that we should have a statutory board. She called frequently for the statutory establishment of the board.  In June 1986 she was anxiously inquiring about when the legislation would be introduced.  She wanted the legislation before the House to establish the board on a statutory basis. She wanted it to be ready for the autumn of that year and she was also anxious that the board would have the resources it needed.  There was a very eloquent urging of myself and the succeeding Minister to bring this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Picture my satisfaction when in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in February this year here was another commitment to setting up the curriculum board on a statutory basis.  The commitment of Fianna Fáil was there for the world to see.  I am glad the Minister is in the House tonight and I hope when making her contribution she will address these questions and not avoid them.  I hope we will have direct answers to direct questions.  I want to know what has changed since February 1987 to make the Government decide not to have a statutory body.  What forces have intervened to change the Minister's mind? Why has the climate changed to the extent that the Minister appears to be afraid to give a legal basis to the work of curriculum reform?  Why have the Government reversed everything they have said in this respect, contradicting everything they said and asked for during the past four years, including the election campaign?  We have had the complete Uturn in every other area of education and the Minister has frequently remarked on radio and television that she is no longer the same person &mdash; that she has somehow changed.  I think it is due to the fact that most of these things are to do with money and in Opposition she always refused to admit there was any financial problem for the country, despite having all the facts <Col N="2174" /> and figures in front of her.  I hasten to make it clear that we are not here talking about financial commitment because the 1988 Estimates already contain a provision for £230,000.  It is a mystery as to what has happened to change the Government's mind.</P>
    <P>A couple of main points must be made in opening this debate.  I underline the basic principle of drawing the educational interest into the work of the on going development of the curriculum in our schools, drawing them in on a permanent statutory basis rather than some impermanent and slightly uncertain basis.  That permanent establishment of the right of educational interests to work in close harmoney with the Department and the Minister was and remains a new and welcome development.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not stopped speaking to her neighbour since I came into the House.  It is a little bit unnerving to find she is not listening.</P>

      <P>The element of real democracy in education as well as the enrichment of the development process is also a new one for Ireland, though not for other countries.  Other countries have welcomed the establishment of different bodies to assist in the work of education. I do not think they have the same fear as this Government have.</P>
      <P>There is a third principle, the work of the interim board has been so farreaching and so effective that it overwhelmingly justifies its establishment as a strong, legally-based arm of educational policy-making.  That interim board were always assured of their future statutory establishment both by me, by my successor, Deputy Cooney, and by the present Minister up to the moment she took office.  I repeat that their work has been so outstanding that it overwhelmingly justifies their establishment as a strong, legally-based arm of educational policy-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three principles come together in this Bill which is before the House this week and next and on which we will see a vote on 11 November.  A technical point must be made that in order for this Bill to proceed to Committee and subsequent Stages and to pass into law it would need a majority in this House but the Government would also have to send a money certificate to the House to enable the State to authorise the expenditure required to set up this board.  That is, of course, a technicality since there already is money in the Estimates for 1988 for curriculum review.  Unfortunately, the Minister by hastily announcing the new advisory board yesterday has shown her unwillingness to listen to Deputies from all parties who are concerned with this question and it shows an apparently increasing fear of independent voices in <Col N="2176" /> education.  I hope she can explain that position to the House and to the country. It is inexplicable to me.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to all parties in this House and to Independents to support this Bill.  I hope they will find it possible to take a stand on the main principles which I have set out, the principle of full co-operation between the Department of Education and educational interests in developing and monitoring curriculum and assessment procedures and the principles of permanence and strength which can only be conferred by statutory status so that the voice of educational interests can be heard and cannot be stifled or easily cast aside.  The third principle is the endorsement of the work of teachers, parents, management and the energetic committees of the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board since 1984 in bringing forward serious, well-designed and relevant blueprints for change after an unprecedented degree of national consultation and dialogue, which was never experienced before, in the world of education. Perhaps it would be helpful to take a brief look at the history of this development.</P>
    <P>In 1966 there was some movement in the Department of Education and the then Minister was talking about an independent examinations board, but this suggestion was not carried forward.  The Coalition Government of 1973-77 prepared a Bill along those lines but it was never enacted, and it did not cover the curriculum.  In 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government proposed, in a White Paper, an advisory curriculum council along the lines announced yesterday, but no such council was set up and there was no mention of assessment of examinations.  In that same year Fine Gael, in an education policy document called &ldquo;Education in the Eighties&rdquo;, proposed a curriculum and examinations board on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The House will recall the turbulent times between 1980 and 1982 when we had various elections.  The next step was a very valuable debate in the Seanad during which a previous Minister for Education, Deputy Boland, made a detailed and admirable statement giving his plans for <Col N="2177" /> a board.  He circulated this document widely, inviting responses.  In the following election which was held shortly afterwards, the Coalition Government included the board in their programme as they had done in 1981.  Finally, after a year of intense and highly valued work in the Department, in January 1984 an interim Curriculum and Examinations Board was established.</P>
    <P>The preparatory work in the Department I recall was of a very high quality and spread over other countries.  I was very impressed then, and still am, by the degree of commitment and hard work to the design and structure of the board which existed in the Department.  As I said, the board was established on an interim basis in January 1984 with the commitment that plans would go ahead to establish the board by statute.  An interim board was established in advance of the statutory board so that the statutory board could benefit from the work and experience in action of the first board, as well as from the advice they would have to give.</P>
    <P>Preparation went ahead when the Government had seen the work being done.  The Minister's immediate predecessor published a Bill last November &mdash; and this is largely the Bill we have before the House today.  The Minister welcomed that Bill when she was in Opposition.  She was very enthusiastic that a Bill had at last appeared.  Perhaps she will tell us why she changed her mind. I found it heartening, as did the board, that Fianna Fáil decided to give a clear commitment in their election manifesto to set up the board on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the country was very lucky in terms of the chairperson and members of the interim board.  The degree of energy and skill which marked their work from the first day was remarkable.  The principle they established of continuing dialogue right across the country on each subject in order to have the willing co-operation of the people operating the system was remarkable and in the education world was unprecedented.  We have a prolific volume of documents from the board, various discussion documents <Col N="2178" /> culminating in the main report on issues and structures in education called &ldquo;In our Schools&rdquo; which followed other reports. &ldquo;In our Schools&rdquo; broadly covered their conclusions of what they felt should now be done.  This document was subtitled &ldquo;A framework for Curriculum and Assessment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another document they issued in September 1985 was &ldquo;Primary Education: A Curriculum and Examinations Board Discussion Paper&rdquo;.  That was a solid document which examined what needed to be done in the area of primary education and was drawn up by a primary review committee set up by the board, an expert committee with members from the teaching profession, management, education research and so on.  This was a very useful document.  I am mentioning this because this afternoon I was surprised to hear the Minister decrying the work of the board in the area of primary education, and basically accusing them of doing nothing.</P>
    <P>The documents the board brought out constitute a most up to the minute collection of educational signposts which will bring us into the nineties and beyond. A very small staff serviced the board most ably.  These documents were a measure of the motivation and commitment of the members who felt they were involved in something historic and worthwhile, something that would shape Ireland's education system in a new exciting way. Because they were happy with the assurances of the present Minister when in Opposition, they felt that this board would not be a political football but would be established on a statutory basis &mdash; perhaps with different personnel because nobody expects a board to have the same personnel all the time on a statutory basis &mdash; as part of our legal system backing and working with the Department.</P>
    <P>We all hope their major recommendations will be carried into legislation, particularly the new unified junior cycle system of assessment that needs to be put in place at the earliest opportunity. The Minister has appointed a different board to carry on the same work and <Col N="2179" /> fortunately that board still has some of the former members on it and will be able to continue the work of the old board. The board did a great deal of work on the primary education system, arts in education, language in the curriculum, science and technology and so on.  This was the result of work done by different committees set up by the board which called on the experience of people inside and outside the education system.</P>
    <P>When I am praising the board I am not in any way criticising the officers in the Department of Education.  It was always a source of amazement and admiration to me that the staff of the Department could achieve so much with rapidly expanding schools and the increasing student population which put enormous pressure on them.  The demands placed on the inspectorate in particular by the expansion of the examination system meant they were able to do less central, pivotal work &mdash; the monitoring, inspection and advice to schools, the nuts and bolts of the education system.  The inspectorate produced work on the curriculum in the past and proposed certain initiatives for change, all of which was available to the Curriculum and Examinations Board through the departmental advisers.  Of course, the inspectorate as civil servants and with responsibility for the maintenance and delivery of the service are, naturally, constrained from bringing forward ideas for public debate. Therefore, the board was a complementary and co-operative unit with the Department.  The Department could now interact in a clearly structured and legally established way with all education interests.  Their position as advisers to the board guaranteed that interaction.</P>
    <P>There were some misgivings inside and outside the Department about such a new and radical departure.  Some officials in the Department felt a little worried about what they perceived to be a dilution of what was hitherto absolute power over curriculum development.  In any large institution, particularly in a Government <Col N="2180" /> Department, there is always a natural inbuilt resistance to change.  There is an inbuilt resistance to change in this House and in many other establishments. However, it is the Minister's duty to be innovative, to do what is right and bring as many people as possible with her. Resistance was found among some of the bodies who were asked to participate in the board.  They were suspicious of being seen to be involved with Governments they might not always agree with but most of those misgivings have been put to rest because of the superb working of the board and the effective nature of its structures.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some details of the Bill.  I look forward to what will be a major debate on education that will accompany our consideration of the Bill. I have had correspondence from various groups about the Bill, particularly the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  That group put forward suggestions for consideration on Committee Stage.  I should like to emphasise that we are anxious to hear from the Minister if the Government will provide the certificate to enable the Bill to proceed.  In the absence of Government consent to sending that certificate, we will be voting at the end of Second Stage on the principles of the Bill.  It is unfortunate, if one is to judge by yesterday's hasty announcement which was intended to pre-empt this debate, that little attention will be paid to the opinion of the House on whether a statutory board should be established.  It is important that Members on this side indicate what they feel should be done and what they think of the attitude of the Minister in pre-empting decisions of the House.</P>
    <P>Members may have reservations about the composition of the proposed board. It is important to point out that when the interim board was being established if the Minister did not have a range of appointments to make to that board there would have been very few women represented on it.  The different bodies were not to be aware that other groups were nominating men and we might have had a board with one or two women at most.  That would have been quite unacceptable and for <Col N="2181" /> that reason it is extremely important for the Minister to have leeway to appoint people to make up that imbalance and any geographical or specialist imbalances.</P>
    <P>The functions of the proposed board include curriculum and asessment.  The two are inextricably linked.  The group which controls examinations governs the curriculum and I am sure the House will agree with that.  One of the reasons why there was a long period of delay in setting up the board &mdash; since 1966 &mdash; was the failure to recognise the crucial and central idea of the link between assessment and curriculum.  The areas to which the board will be required to have regard are dealt with in the Bill and the House should examine them carefully.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the requirement for ensuring favourable international comparability in our educational standards.  That is very relevant to a modern education system and particularly at a time when we are drawing closer in every respect to other European countries.  Our education system is held in high regard internationally and it is important that we should stand up favourably to international comparisons. Written into the Bill is a provision that the board must have regard to the elimination of any barriers to education on the grounds of sex.  I will not labour that point because I believe the Minister has a commitment in that area and I am sure she will agree with the provision.  It is unfortunate that, arising out of the Minister's decision yesterday, we will not have such a provision written into our laws.  That is a great shame.</P>
    <P>We ask the board to have regard to the development of a capacity for critical thought in pupils.  We consider that to be very important because one of the most fundamental elements in a modern education system is that it should develop the independent critical faculties of young people in an age when they are being bombarded from all sides by strong commercially-based interests in the media. We must emphasise the essential importance of a critical thought capacity.  It is unfortunate we do not have time to go <Col N="2182" /> into the section in any great detail but I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (4) requires the board to cost its proposals.  If the board spent time devising plans without costing them they would be planning in a vacuum.  The Minister made some play about that earlier today.  It is in the interests of all those who will benefit from the work of the board that such a provision should be included in the Bill.  I do not think any Member should underestimate the importance of the Bill which could open up a new era in education.  In my view we will be asked to vote confidence in the education system.  We will be asked to show a respect for and confidence in all those who work within the system by giving them formal links with the Department of Education.  In the Bill a range of bodies have been designated to have a right of close relationship with the board and they range from the industrial to the academic and the trade union movement. Those bodies will have the right to make submissions, to be consulted and receive copies of the board's publications.  That element of co-operation and involvement of the wider society in education is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The object of setting up a curriculum and assessement board on a statutory basis is to bring together the world of so many different curriculum initiatives across the country, to translate them into action.  Its design is the result of Irish and international research.  It brings the responsibilities of curriculum and assessment together in a major new arm of educational progress designed to work with and not against the Department of Education and the Minister because the Minister, in the final analysis, must hold the responsibility for the people.  In my view the setting up of this board will be the best educational practice and other countries will look to Ireland in the future, as they did in the past, to see our initiative in action.</P>
    <P>There is no reason, at a time of economic difficulty, to call a halt to the proliferation of ideas for the promulgation of excellence.  Many people believe &mdash;<Col N="2183" /> and I am one of them &mdash; that there is a strong wish in the educational world to move ahead, to welcome new ideas and to put them to work even if extra demands are put on teachers, students, parents and management in order to do so.  Teachers have risen to the challenge of change in recent years in undertaking new experiments and curriculum projects in classrooms across the country.  Parents have generously responded in helping to raise funds and communities and employers have shown a willingness to encourage and facilitate such initiatives. The establishment of this board on a statutory basis is a recognition of all that good work and all the involvement outside the Department in curriculum reform.</P>
    <P>I am more than slightly worried about one of the elements the Minister mentioned in a press release announcing the establishment of a new board, a new council for curriculum and assessment, to be known as the National Curriculum Council.  I understand that the Minister has given that body three years to fulfil their mandate.  I find that a very alarming aspect &mdash; apart from all the other alarming aspects &mdash; of yesterday's announcement. What happens after three years? Does education stop then?  Does society stop evolving?  The refusal to give a statutory and permanent foundation to the work of educational reform, thereby guaranteeing its continuation, is a major change in direction and a change for the worse.  It is, as I said at the outset, totally inexplicable but I hope the Minister will explain why she has taken this approach and why that main central initiative could not be carried through.  She called for such an initiative which her Government undertook to fulfil in their election manifesto. I hope the Minister can give a clear, succinct answer as to why she has this problem about setting up a statutory body.</P>
    <P>It is so important as well to encourage the people who met all the committees of the interim board.  They travelled the country and gave days, weeks and months to consultations and meetings in pursuit <Col N="2184" /> of their remit to undertake curriculum reform.  We have seen in their actions scores of educationalists fired with the commitment to working for their country. To stop that impetus, to deny them the next phase in that development would be to depress the genuine desire to serve which the interim board tackled so strenuously and effectively.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not too late to conclude with a renewal appeal to the Government and the Minister to take up this impetus, to tap into this great well of goodwill which is there for the asking by establishing the board on a statutory basis, giving it the backing of Dáil Éireann and the confidence of the country.  To do so, even at this late stage, would gain the applause &mdash; not only of all sides of the House &mdash; but of the country, in particular the world of education which so wholeheartedly welcomed the opportunity to involve itself in what it saw as great national work.  In the final analysis, we are talking about a commitment to our unique, inspiring young population who depend on this House to put political considerations aside in their interest.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in responding to this Bill.  However, before doing so I want to explode a few myths which have been enunciated here tonight and indeed in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to Deputy Hussey's remarks that the announcement was made hastily yesterday.  The choice of the continuance of the present chairperson of the board, Dr. Walsh, and the vice chairperson, Sister Eileen Doyle, was conveyed to both these very estimable people many weeks ago, which can be verified by anyone who wishes to do so. I quite deliberately did not want to rush into setting up the board out of deference to the work of the interim board, the members of which I had in my office in the Department of Education some weeks ago to thank them in a formal &mdash; although convivial &mdash; way for the amount <Col N="2185" /> of work which they had done in a voluntary capacity over the past number of years.  I join Deputy Hussey in paying tribute to the work of the interim board. However, it should be remembered that it was an interim board set up by the Minister with numerous appointees, including many of hers, and representations of all the constituent bodies. I listened to Deputy Hussey's incredible explanation as to why she saw fit to have so many of her own nominees on the board.  She said that nobody else would appoint a woman, which I thought a little odd.  I also had a nominee who is a woman.</P>
    <P>The board is far from being a political football.  Because I thought so highly of the existing chairperson and vice chairperson, chief executive and secretariat, I saw no need to disturb the serene regime they had established.  I wished to draw and build upon that security so that people would be relieved at the continuance of their work.  I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Hussey who established the interim board.</P>
    <P>The new curriculum council will advise me directly.  They will operate outside the Department in the original offices in which they have been sited for the period of their interim tenureship.  The chairperson, vice chairperson, chief executive and secretariat are the same as heretofore. I was extremely pleased to draw on their years of experience and acumen which they had so carefully built up. Indeed, as a Minister, I was very lucky to be able to draw on their combined experience.</P>
    <P>The Bill which Deputy Hussey introduced tonight was presented to the then Minister for Education, Deputy Patrick Cooney, in May 1986.  Strangely, nine months after that, the Bill had yet to be formally presented to Dáil Éireann.  I freely admit that I called several times for its introduction but I now know that there were great divisions within the Fine Gael Party on whether it should be a statutory Bill.  Among the objectors were Deputy Dukes, Deputy John Bruton and <Col N="2186" /> Deputy Cooney who were not happy with many of the terms of reference of the Bill, its scope and its inherent complexities.  I have an intuition &mdash; I will not go any further than that &mdash; that the then Minister was quite relaxed about the need to introduce the Bill.  The relaxation is apparent because of the number of months which went by with no sign of it being introduced. Indeed it was a case of <i>festina lente.</i> Of course, it will be all different when we go through the lobbies, if we get to that point.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased yesterday to implement my decision to reconstitute the <i>ad hoc</i> Curriculum and Assessment Board as a council for curriculum and assessment.  It will be a non-statutory body with responsibility to advise me on matters relating to the school curriculum and on pupil assessment.  Before taking this decision, I made a very careful study of the developing situation and I was moved by a number of considerations which seemed to me to have major significance. Chief of these is the fact that the main responsibility of the Council for Curriculum and Assessment will be of an advisory nature.</P>
    <P>At the core of the council's activities will be its responsibilities for advising the Minister for Education on all matters relating to the school curriculum &mdash; its aims, its content, its scope, and any other relevant issues; and for advising the Minister on methods of examining or otherwise assessing pupil performance and standards.  I note that these are also the primary functions proposed in this Bill for the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment.  To that extent I agree with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no need to enshrine advisory functions in legislation.  These functions will not be enhanced in any way by putting them into a statute.  An Act of the Oireachtas will not confer any greater powers for advising upon the curriculum council.  Neither will the council's powers to advise the Minister be reduced in any way by failing to confer them by statute. Once terms of reference for a body such <Col N="2187" /> as a curriculum council are laid down in an Act of the Oireachtas, they become quite inflexible.  They cannot be adjusted in any way except by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The curriculum council which I intend to establish on a non-statutory basis will have more flexible terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Hussey.  Education must be constantly updated to keep pace with the changing needs of society and the economy particularly in the area of new technology. The resources must be adjusted to meet the numbers explosion which is working its way through the system and creating short to medium-term pressures as the pupils move through the various levels.</P>
    <P>The curriculum can be more effectively tuned to cater for changing needs if the curriculum council's terms of reference are non-statutory and can be simply revised.  It will be a simple matter to adjust the focus of the council's operations to concentrate on whatever particular aspects of the curriculum need reform at a particular time and the council will be able to respond immediately to advise on the necessary curriculum revision.  On the other hand, if the advisory body is constrained by statute from undertaking a particular task, any revision in its terms of reference takes time.</P>
    <P>There is a gap in the organisation of curriculum development work which this Bill does nothing to rectify.  Curriculum development work is currently being carried out by a number of diverse groups or bodies &mdash; the local curriculum development units, the Educational Research Centre at St. Patrick's Training College, the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Trinity College, to name but a few.  This very worthwhile and extremely innovative work has been going on for a number of years.  When the interim board was set up I read screaming headlines to the effect that there would be no more inter certs.  I went into a classroom the following week and was told there would never be examinations <Col N="2188" /> again.  Throughout my four years in Opposition I fault the heady expectations which such hype created in peoples' minds.</P>
    <P>On reflection, it is often necessary for such development movements to come upfront and to be over the top in some respects, to seem to be pushing out the frontiers in a perhaps outrageous way. It is only when that type of movement emerges that we start thinking seriously about what should be done.  Although it has nothing to do with the subject, in the feminist movement we needed the shock waves created by those who perhaps seemed outrageous in their activities.  It made us think about the issues and made us prepare for a debate about them.</P>
    <P>For a number of years there has certainly been steady work done in the area of education, in the Department and in the sub-agencies.  When I was teaching I was honoured, when my school was picked to do a research curricula project. I was the teacher in charge of the project. All of this was very exciting and it went on all around the country.  We need a careful analysis of what has been done and a careful analysis of what we can now do in a realistic fashion.  When I came into the Department one of the first things I asked for was a compilation of all of the work of the various agencies involved in curricula reform.  I had already read the many documents which the interim board had compiled.  All of this work was very necessary.</P>
    <P>After my years of teaching I have no doubt that there is a constant need for teachers to change, for subject content to change and for syllabi to change. Everyone in the education system should be aware that there is an ever-changing world outside the school walls and that there is a need to cope with the changes. People in education should realise that young persons going through the system should not be judged on grades alone in a formal examinations system.  Young people should know that they are individually unique.  The true educationist works with his educational material but has a true regard for the character development and self-esteem of the <Col N="2189" /> pupils.  I remain committed to the idea that this precept must be the guiding light for education.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have greatly missed since I came into public life in a formal way is the daily contact with people in their teens.  When one goes into the classroom each day one can see how teenagers change physically and mentally day-by-day. They constantly demand change from the teacher, they demand responses and challenges.  The teacher constantly gives of himself but gains a lot in return. Teaching is an enormous responsibility. Nobody realises the work of the teacher except another teacher.</P>
    <P>There is a gap in the organisation of curriculum development work which this Bill does nothing to rectify.  There is no co-ordinating body to ensure that the work of the various organisations is rationalised.  One of the exciting developments in the setting up of the curriculum council is that this is what they will be doing.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that all curriculum development work which is funded by the State will be co-ordinated and integrated, and I will be encouraging a high degree of co-operation between the various groups engaged in curriculum development work.  I intend that the curriculum council will perform a co-ordinating role in this area.</P>
    <P>The only executive functions proposed in this Bill are the conduct of assessments and the awarding of certificates.  The conduct of the certificate examinations is carried out by the examination branch of my Department which is situated in Athlone. The administration of the examinations is a complex business by reason of the scale of the operation, and my Department's record down the years for efficient conduct and the integrity of the conduct of the examinations is an excellent one.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the <i>ad hoc</i> interim Curriculum and Examinations Board was in no great hurry and they expressed it quite clearly, to take over the conduct of the examinations.  Indeed, my understanding of the situation was that the <i>ad hoc</i> board would not have raised any <Col N="2190" /> great objection had the function of conducting examinations been removed from the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>The curriculum council will not have executive responsibility for running the examinations.  This does not mean that curriculum development will be carried on in isolation, without regard to matching adjustments in the methods of assessment.  The closer links between the council and my Department mean that the fundamental three-way interaction between curriculum design, assessment, and classroom performance will mesh with each other more smoothly than the provisions of this Bill permit.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, before taking any decision on the restructuring of curriculum development work, I made a careful assessment of the developing situation taking into consideration the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> Curriculum and Examinations board and the provisions proposed in the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment Bill.</P>
    <P>I found that under the Bill the Curriculum and Assessment Board would be permitted to plan and to announce elaborate proposals for curriculum reform without any regard for the practicalities or the resources necessary even though they had to cost each item, as Deputy Hussey mentioned.  The costing was one matter but the proposals could be produced independently without any real practical consideration of how they would be put into effect.  One of the proposals made by the <i>ad hoc</i> board would have cost as much as £2 million to implement. Under the Bill, which allows the board to publish their proposals, the board would be in a position to raise public expectations, a <i>modus operandi</i> which they were good at and which, in hindsight, was right at that point but would not be right in the operations of a statutory body.  In particular the board would raise the expectations of pupils, parents and teachers of costly developments in the curriculum with which few might disagree. The less happy task of explaining to the country why these very costly reforms could not be put into effect would be left to the Minister of the day.  The <Col N="2191" /> terms of this Bill would also permit the board to concentrate on their own perceived priorities rather than those of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Any Minister of any Department &mdash; every Government Department is highly important in its own specialist area &mdash; would have to take his or her role very seriously into account with regard to priorities especially in such an important area of life as education.  Welcome as the proposals of an advisory nature which will be put to me will be &mdash; the board will be reporting to me directly at three-monthly intervals &mdash; I would have enough confidence in myself as Minister, and I know any Minister for Education who has the interests of education at heart, being able to translate the advice which the council would give into practical realities.  It is quite another matter, particularly in the very sensitive area of education, to have a statutory body making decisions on what is a very onerous but a very challenging task and I would be very dubious about that.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the Bill I understand that the <i>ad hoc</i> board had set up an elaborate committee structure, a committee structure with which Deputy Bruton and Deputy Dukes found exception, a network of sub-committees reporting to co-ordinating committees which in turn would report to the board.  The operation of the board's advisory process would emanate through this committee system to the board itself and thence to the Minister and the Minister's advisers.  Recommendations to be reconsidered would have to move back and forward through the same route and that would be impractical and unreal.  The abnegation of responsibility by the Minister, which it would be eventually perceived as, would become more and more apparent.  In my view a much simpler committee structure, easily adaptable since it will not be part of statutory provisions, will be able to address itself straightaway to priority tasks.</P>
    <P>It may be unfair to remark, but I must put it on record, that almost four years <Col N="2192" /> after the establishment of the <i>ad hoc</i> Curriculum and Examinations Board we have had a number of thoughful publications, which Deputy Hussey has referred to, but as far as I am aware no single item of reform has been carried out in any classroom in any town or county as a result of the board's recommendations. They were thoughtful publications one of which I have adopted, the setting up of the primary review group, and I have also taken on board the unified system.  If there has been curriculum development in any classroom it is as a result of initiatives which have been taken by some of the various sub-agencies of the Department. It seems that the reasons for the lack of results in the classroom were either that the recommendations were too general in nature, the detail being still some way down the road, or were too costly to implement.</P>
    <P>What I intend to achieve through the curriculum council is a more practical method of operation which will structure reform and identify those stages which are capable of being put into effect immediately.  I am far from being convinced that there is no room for further improvement in the efficiency and the effectiveness of the education service, within the limits of existing resources. The main Opposition party have agreed with the exact amount allocated in the Estimates for each Government Department even though they take issue with the way in which it will be allocated. The economic implications of some of the recommendations are quite horrendous. In the explanatory and financial memorandum which accompanied the Bill in 1986 it is stated that the additional operational costs of the board would be £580,000, in addition to the £230,000 which was allocated to the board in that year.</P>

      <P>We are talking about financial considerations.  In the explanatory and financial memorandum which accompanied the Bill in 1986 &mdash; I would imagine it would be available in the Dáil Library &mdash; it is stated that the additional operational costs of the board in 1986 would be £500,000, in addition to the £230,000 already allocated.  I raise this point because I was greatly struck by the statement of the leader of the Opposition at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in which he stated very clearly that his party agree with the total amount of money allocated but they do not agree with the cuts. Therefore, that money would have to be costed and it would have to be stated where it would come from.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, responsibility for the maintenance of the nation's education standards must lie with the Minister and the Department of Education. Decisions about the curriculum and about assessment procedures will benefit from the setting up of the curriculum council, and I see it as an important segment of education strategy.  Its recommendations will be a major influencing factor in formulating and adjusting the overall education plan.</P>
      <P>The council itself will be constituted from various education interests &mdash; teachers, management, parents, departmental advisers, people from the business world and the various unions.  I was glad to be able to ask for a nomination of a member from the Irish Federation of University Teachers, a board which have not received recognition in the previous Minister's plan.</P>

      <P>It would be very difficult for them to have accepted because the letter is going out today.  With all the <Col N="2194" /> best will in the world they could not get the letter before tomorrow even with the Fergal Quinn hyped-up system.</P>
      <P>The people on the council will be chosen for their expertise and the background and experience they will bring to bear on the issues before them.  I hope that the various bodies that the curriculum council will be inviting to join them in their very exciting work will accept.  Not all invitations are accepted but we are hopeful that the various constituent bodies who have expressed such an interest will accept.  If some do not it will be a pity and I am asking them tonight to accept.</P>
      <P>I see the establishment of the non-statutory curriculum council as a major step towards restoring the momentum to curriculum reform but, at the same time, guiding reform work into a structured and effective operating system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey raised the matter of the three year term of office.  She was alarmed at what she saw as the short term of office of the council.  The constituent bodies may reappoint the personnel after their three years.  This was particularly put in because two or three of the constituent bodies that I had intended asking to join the council said that from time to time they may need to replace members for one reason or another.  So, after three years the constituent bodies will be reinvited to make their nominations and the Minister of the day will always have the right to reappoint or freshly appoint a chairperson and vice-chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity to have a very rational and so far very level-headed debate on curriculum reform.  I repeat my satisfaction that the people appointed by Deputy Hussey to the interim board have accepted our nomination to the curriculum council.  I again pay tribute to the enormous work of the chairperson and vice-chairperson and all the members of the various committees and sub-committees working over the last three years.  Their documents live after them and will be a source <Col N="2195" /> of inspiration in the real work which must now begin.</P>

      <P>The two items that immediately start are the primary review and the gradual and radical restructuring which will take place with the unified system of the group and intermediate certificates.  That will have to be very quick because the changes in curricula and syllabi will have to find their way into text books and various other publications. There is little time to be lost.</P>
      <P>Curriculum reform is the most important area of activity within any education system.  In a country like ours which has such a huge number of vibrant, lively people, we must constantly adapt and change.  It is a tendency to which I always subscribed in my years in education.  I still subscribe to it and I am pleased to be identified with this so early in my career as Minister.  I wish the curriculum council every success in its endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to both speeches.  Unfortunately, I was not in the House for the beginning of Deputy Hussey's speech but I listened to it on my monitor and I must say, candidly and honestly, that Deputy Hussey made a very much better case for the setting up of the Curriculum and Examinations Board on a statutory basis than the Minister made for her arrangment as announced this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that a good deal of curricular work was already carried on before the setting up of the interim board and there has been a great deal of innovation in a number of schools. But this is very uneven and a number of schools were very much left out and that is not good enough.  It is not the way we should be going in the future.  That is why, among other reasons, I find myself coming down totally on the side of the Bill brought into the House this evening by Deputy Hussey and why I pledge the support of my party to the main thrust of this Bill.  Having taught until last March, <Col N="2196" /> it is my experience that one of the most valuable innovations in education in the last decade was the setting up of that interim examination and curriculum board.  I would like publicly to pay tribute to Deputy Hussey who, as Minister for Education had the courage and initiative to set up that board.  By doing that she began very valuable work that we now must continue.  I would also like to pay tribute to the chairman and the members of that interim board for the valuable work that they did, to all those who worked on course committees and other sub-committees since the interim board's inception.  They have done sterling work for Irish education.  They have stimulated discussion and debate.  They have pointed the way in which Irish education must go in the future if Ireland and her young people are to achieve their full potential in the years ahead.  They have put the cornerstone of future educational development and progress firmly in place.  I would argue now that the next logical step is to set up that board on a statutory basis.  Unless that is done a great deal of valuable work done to date stands to be lost.  We cannot afford to throw away that work with a convivial meeting or by paying tributes here in the House.  That is not enough.  The greatest tribute we can pay to the good work done by that interim board is to agree here and now to keep that board, or a successor to it, on a permanent basis and set it up as a statutory body.  If we do that we will have guaranteed that the future of Irish education is in good hands.  That is why we in the Progressive Democrats give this Bill our total support.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have the good sense not alone to pass the Bill but also to recognise that if this Bill becomes law we will have to be prepared to put forward the wherewithal to ensure that it is effective.  The Minister is right when she implies that unless this is done this is all useless discussion. There is no point in having a very good, intelligent and effective board making recommendations to us unless we are prepared to vote the necessary moneys to implement in our schools their most urgent recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later. There was a time when other Ministers talked about investment in education and thought that education was worth investing in.  We need to bring back a little more of that spirit into our discussions. We need to have clear priorities as to where very essential investment must now be made.  Unless we do that in terms of curriculum development we stand to have a system of education that will be dear at any price, because we stand to have schools out of date and out of tune and out of step with the rest of society and below the standard of other schools in other countries with which our young people have to compete.  We have to face that and be honest about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to detend the point that not alone must we be prepared to do that but we must make the necessary resources available to guarantee that the recommendations of the board will be implemented in the classrooms as speedily and as effectively as possible.  This is something that must be borne in mind if we are to continue to make arbitrary decisions on pupil-teacher ratios.  There is no point in promoting worthwhile ideas if we are not prepared to put them into practice and to provide accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the other necessary question of the amount of money that will have to be provided for in-service courses for teachers and ongoing in-service training if we are going to take on board curriculum development and the updating and upgrading of curricular work in our schools.  This is an issue which we also must face.  We cannot hide behind the Minister for Finance on every issue. We must have a policy on education and that policy cannot be ultimately, finally and definitely dictated by the Minister for Finance.  We must have people holding <Col N="2198" /> the portfolio of education whose first commitment is to education.  After that, they will have to argue around the Cabinet table as to how their proposals are to be funded.  I want them to approach it from the point of view of education, not solely from that of finance.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for radical and sustained work on curriculum development. That comes sharply into focus when we remind ourselves that a child entering the school system next September will be only 16 years of age when this century expires, when we face the 21st century.  That is the time scale about which we are talking and that is the kind of future for which our children must be prepared.  Our schools must gear themselves to prepare our children to live in a world vastly changed and changing at a rate never before experienced in human history.  To do this adequately, our schools themselves must be open to change and provision must be made to ensure that our course content and our teaching methods are relevant to the times in which we live and that our educational standards are on a par with standards prevailing in other developed countries, as they always have been in the past.  We owe it to past generations and educationalists to ensure that that position holds for the future.  We were very proud, and still are, of our system of education, of our schools and of our teachers but we must continue to be so proud.  We must introduce, and very quickly, very necessary and very urgently needed reform at curricular level.</P>
    <P>The major agent for change is a dynamic curriculum and examinations board permanently placed and interacting effectively with the Minister, the Department and all those bodies and persons actively involved in the business of education.  To those who would ask why we should have a permanent body, let me make just one point arising out of my own experience.  I was teaching in schools when the new curriculum for primary schools was introduced in 1971.  It was a most exciting, a most dynamic new development from which we believed great things would come.  Indeed, many <Col N="2199" /> great things did come from it but, unfortunately, the aspirations, aims and objectives of those who devised that new curriculum were never fully met.  Once it was put in place, everybody assumed that it would take on a life of its own and would not have to be serviced at times, monitored at times and evaluated at times.</P>
    <P>That work simply was not carried out, so some extremely good ideas were lost for want of nurturing that curriculum, measuring its progress, assessing students at different times in their journey through the primary schools.  That work was not carried out on a level at which it ought to have been carried out.  That is my experience of what can happen when you make a sporadic effort to introduce curriculum reform and do not monitor and nurture it fully.  That is my main argument for the retention of an ongoing curriculum board which would bring in their changes and would be the force behind the Minister and behind the education authorities, ensuring that the changes recommended by them and accepted in this House and elsewhere not alone are put in place in the schools but worked dynamically there and that they go on to achieve results.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to make this investment in our education system, to make it now and to make an ongoing sustained investment in curriculum development which will take our children and our schools into the world of the future into which neither the Minister nor I will enter if the natural rule of life takes its course.  Moreover, we must recognise fully the absolute importance of education for the future of our country.  The world of yesterday, where great natural resources were great national assets and from which Ireland seemed to be permanently excluded is now gone, luckily enough.  Ireland was then in a state of permanent disadvantage.  However, in the world of tomorrow, the world of information technology, we can compete on an equal basis, if we keep our system of education up to date.  I am quoting <Col N="2200" /> now from an article in a recent copy of <i>The Economist:</i></P>
    <P>Education will be in the next century the most important service industry in the world.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to invest in that industry, our most guaranteed national resource will go to waste.</P>
    <P>In the past we could not compete in terms of coal, steel, iron and all the assets that made other nations wealthy but now, when we are told by people who analyse these things, that education will be the great resource in the next century, we will be able to compete on an equal footing with people from all other countries if we do our work properly and gear our system to the future.  If we fail to make the necessary investment now, we stand to lose out once again as we lost out in the last century and the previous one.  If we do that, we shall all stand condemned. The single most important investment that needs to be made now is not in buildings or anything else but in curriculum development.  Equally important is assessment.</P>
    <P>Here I come to what was said by the Minister, who did not seem to think that an assessment examination was as relevant to curriculum work as direct curriculum work itself.  I would argue otherwise.  If you ask anybody who has acted in the business of education, any teacher, why it is that he or she is not in a position to introduce more music, art, education of that type into the school timetable, the teacher will tell you immediately:</P>
    <P>We cannot do that because the parents are breathing down the backs of our necks.  They want to get results, they want to get points, they want to get their children to college.</P>
    <P>If you ask any parent why it is that they are prepared to put this amount of pressure on their children, they will tell you immediately that they have very little option, that their children who perhaps in the last generation could go confidently out into the world with a leaving certificate and hope to get a job in a bank, <Col N="2201" /> the Civil Service or a range of other areas, have no hope now.  Where a leaving certificate was a very good attainment for the children in the last generation, the parents are now going for third level attainment.  That is the only hope that they see of their children getting jobs in this or any other country.  Because of that, parents are prepared to subject their young children to the inordinate pressure that is now being brought to bear on young people at school.</P>
    <P>Ask any ordinary citizen making his or her way to work in the morning at the time when young people are going to school and they will tell you that they see very, very small children struggling to school with great bags of books on their backs and with worried expressions on their faces.  They ask why that burden is being put on children at this early age and, on thinking about it, they say that such children are already caught up in the treadmill of the points system.  Ask anybody who deals with children, with the large number who come out of our schools every year who have not mastered the basic skills of reading or writing, what in their opinion has gone wrong, why it is that we do not get around to teaching all our children the vary basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic. Inevitably they will list one of their reasons as being that the schools are too preoccupied with pushing children to achieving the number of points which are necessary to enter college that they do not have the time to deal with those children whose abilities and aspirations are otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to this House that the points system has taken a stranglehold of our education system and it determines largely what subjects are taught in our schools and how.  Until we free our education system of this stranglehold there will never be curriculum reform, no innovation in our schools or changes in what we teach our children in schools and how we teach them.  The Minister seemed to indicate in her speech that there will be less emphasis put on assessment following the setting up of <Col N="2202" /> this new body.  You cannot have one without the other.  There must be changes in the examination system and we must put alternative types of examination in place.</P>
    <P>We must put in place a system which will measure not alone what our children will learn for entry to university but which will also measure what they will learn for other purposes such as how to deal with the problems of ordinary daily life.  Until we put such a system in place no development of the curriculum will take place. We will still have the same teaching methods and the same subjects taught in the same old way.  I suggest that the Minister should reappraise her views on assessment.  It is absolutely essential that a system of assessment be introduced in our schools as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to course content, I am not going to list the subjects which should be taught in our schools and how they should be taught or a list of subjects which should not be taught in our schools.  I would like to make one point in relation to the teaching of languages.  For years the Confederation of Irish Industry and other bodies have been saying that we do not place enough emphasis on the teaching of continental languages.  It has been pointed out time and again that we do not place enough emphasis on the teaching of German.  Despite the fact that in this country there are 180 German companies who are sponsored by the IDA and despite the fact that we send our Ministers and Ministers of State abroad to cities such as Cologne to market our products, we tolerate the fact that only 4 per cent of our students have taken German as a Leaving Certificate subject this year.  That would seem to suggest we are not very forward looking in relation to the teaching of modern languages. Despite the great work which has been done by curriculum bodies it has not affected or influenced what is happening in our schools.  It is an absolute scandal especially when we consider the unemployment problem in this country and the future which is facing our children, that we tolerate the fact that so few of our children study German.</P>

      <P>Talking about the teaching of languages in general, it has to be said that an inordinate amount of time has been set aside for the teaching of the Irish language.  Judging from those who have left school, it appears as if a great deal of that time has been misspent.  I would like to make the point which I tried to make as Gaeilge nuair a bhí mé ag caint leis an Aire inniú.  This is a time when there are so many devices, machines, tapes and films of every kind to facilitate the learning of a second langauge in a very short time.  Large numbers of people learn a second language such as French in a very short time in their own free time.  It is amazing that despite all the expertise which we have now available at our finger tips and despite modern technology, we still spend so much time teaching the Irish language and tolerating the poor results. That is one area that needs to be looked at now.  If the setting up of a statutory body accelerates work in that direction, well and good.  A great deal more emphasis in our education system has to be <Col N="2204" /> placed on oral competence as opposed to achieving written results.  As communications are becoming more advanced we must teach our children communications skills.</P>
      <P>There is a need for urgent curriculum reform and we cannot wait any longer for it.  It must not happen in a haphazard kind of way.  Our system of education has served us extremely well in the past and at this time it is serving large numbers of our children extremely well.  Of course, they are the ones who will go on to third level education and achieve good results. What about those who leave school without any qualifications and who have not even mastered the very basic skills of reading and writing?  Their numbers increase each year and we cannot tolerate a system of education which continues in this way.  We must introduce the necessary reforms and we must introduce them now.</P>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of Deputy Hussey's Bill but there are a number of recommendations, which I think will improve the Bill, which I will make on Committee Stage.  There are one or two points which I would like to make now.  The interim board talked a great deal about a continuum between the senior section of primary school and the junior section of post-primary school but I do not see any reference to it in this Bill.  The transition from primary to post-primary school is one which presents a number of difficulties to a number of children.  We should recognise that fact and provision must be made in this Bill to allow for it.  A number of children never seem to make that transition properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see some kind of assessment taking place during the course of the primary school years.  A number of children face difficulties when they are not prepared even in the most fundamental way for the transition from primary to post-primary school.  I am not advocating a return to the old primary certificate system as that was far too narrow and far too rigid but when we threw out that system we should have put some other system in its place.  We did <Col N="2205" /> not do that and I think we will have to do it now.  It will have to be done within the provisions of this Bill so that children at their different stages of development through school will undergo a certain assessment suitable for the age and stage at which they are, so that they will not pass on from one age to another without having attained any level of achievement. Because we have tolerated that position for far too long we have had a number of failures in the 12 to 15 age group.  The time to remedy that is now and the vehicle for so doing is this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I have one or two amendments in mind for Committee Stage I have no hesitation whatsoever in giving this Bill and what it seeks to achieve my total support.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating me in raising this matter this evening.  In order to allow the Minister the maximum amount of time to reply I may not use 20 minutes. However, I want to explain the urgency which led me to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time now, but particularly recently, there has been brought to my attention the great hardship being experienced by many people due to the interpretation being placed on that part of the legislation in relation to social welfare which includes the words &ldquo;not available <Col N="2206" /> for work&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo; has created problems mainly because it has been interpreted narrowly. What I have to say is not a criticism of individual workers in the Department of Social Welfare, be they central or local, but rather to draw attention to the incredible hardship that has arisen in relation to the over-narrow interpretation of this phrase.  For example, people have been disqualified from unemployment assistance because, it has been suggested, they have adjudged to be &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.  Included among those is one case I raised last week and about which I am delighted to be able to say a little more now.  This involved an individual who had enrolled and was part of a class which lasted for two hours.  The class was organised by a competent education authority which had been funded under the literacy and community education scheme for which this House has voted £400,000 in the coming year.  The individual concerned found that the class clashed with the time at which he should register at his local employment exchange.  He was immediately questioned.  It was pointed out to him that, in attending this class, he was &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.  The case was then referred to Dublin.  It was then pointed out to him, and at this stage to the altruistic individual who had organised the class, that he could make an appeal and the person organising the class could accompany him, the appellant, in Dublin.  This was not acceptable to either of them and, in so far as my information is correct, the case has not yet been resolved.</P>
    <P>Another case, now resolved, was resolved after some time.  That case involved an individual, again unemployed, who was providing some hours of car maintenance courses for his fellow unemployed.  It was argued that, in providing these &mdash; even though he made no charge for his services &mdash; he had rendered himself &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware equally of some cases where women whose husbands have emigrated temporarily and who may be unemployed in Britain and are therefore getting benefit solely for themselves and <Col N="2207" /> not for their wives and children in Ireland, are being regarded as &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.  Because these women have not, it is assumed, made arrangements for looking after the family they are left without benefit.  Such cases are not met by any of the more destitute provisions in relation to social welfare, by telling somebody that they should qualify for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Equally I am aware of another case in which an individual who was repeating the leaving certificate, who had mentioned that she was taking grinds for the purpose of repeating the leaving certificate at the end of the forthcoming academic year, was informed that her taking grinds made her &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware of yet another case which has been resolved happily in which students who had failed their examinations and were anxious to work, there being no requirement on them to attend lectures they had already taken, simply wanted to resit their examinations at the end of the forthcoming year, were regarded, in an exercise of discretion, as being &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When one puts all of this together what one gets is a picture of the world of the unemployed totally at odds with a number of statements made of a public policy kind by the present Minister and some of his predecessors.  The assumption seems to be that any activity disqualifies unemployed people, be it voluntary, be it however unpaid.</P>
    <P>This has reached a peak of irritation in a number of other cases, perhaps the one which has been referred to in the public media most recently, the case of Lettermore/Lettermullen peninsula.  In this case I want to be extremely fair. Individuals in the Lettermore/Lettermullen area have said that they have been questioned as to whether they were aware that in completing a voluntary water scheme &mdash; the scheme having more or less run into difficulties, the requirement now being that it be completed by voluntary labour &mdash; they are disqualifying themselves by engaging in this voluntary <Col N="2208" /> work even though there is no remuneration involved.  One man in this area tells of having been questioned as to how he manages to put petrol in his car when he drives people to sporting fixtures.  It has been suggested that if he takes money for petrol for his car he is &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo; and there is the question of how he got the money.  It has been suggested by yet another individual who was seen repairing his house that he must be working in order to have the money to carry out the repairs.  One case quoted in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>&mdash; which I will not judge &mdash; suggests that people have been asked how they managed to buy turf.</P>
    <P>In these latter cases issues arise.  I read in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> published in Market Street, Galway &mdash; last Saturday's rural edition &mdash; the suggestion that the Department in Galway said that they had but one worker available for inspections of this kind and that they were certainly not involved.  Equally it has been suggested that what has been referred to colourfully as the fraud squad, which exists, within the Department of Social Welfare were not active in the islands either.  Then somebody put in, for good measure, that if people were being questioned in relation to these activities, they should ask the people involved to identify themselves and show them their departmental identification.  In Lettermore and Lettermullen in the last few weeks individuals have been travelling in blue and red cars &mdash; if the locals are to be believed &mdash; pretending to be from the Department of Social Welfare who are not from the Department of Social Welfare.  If they are imposters I would like the Minister to tell me what action he proposes to take to have them apprehended.  If we would amplify on the two statements that have been made, one locally and the other nationally, it would assist me in coming to an assessment of the veracity of the suggestions that have been made.  I have no difficulty in accepting the accounts that had been given from muintir Leitir Mór agus Leitir Mealláin.  Níl sé de nos acu bréaganna a insint.  Tá sé ag tarlú ró-mhinic chun glacadh leis go mbeadh <Col N="2209" /> daoine ag leathadh na scéalta seo agus nach mbeadh aon fhírinne iontu.</P>
    <P>All of this leads me to reflect on this collision of words &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo;.  In the report in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of last Saturday to which I have referred, the words are attributed to a spokesperson on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare to the effect that if individuals are involved in voluntary work, even if it is unpaid, they have to be regarded as not available for work, that if you took any other interpretation you would open the floodgates.  I have sat here in this House and listened to people hectoring me about the unemployed and suggesting that they have to be given the incentive to work.  The Minister is aware that thousands of people have gone through his six minute Jobsearch interviews around the country and have been referred to courses where they have been told how to use the telephone, how to write letters and, I suppose, many things more useful than that.  Let me not be too disparaging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic suggestion is that people should exercise themselves in pursuit of work.  Was the man who had the courage to acknowledge that he had basic reading and writing skills &mdash; it took an act of courage on his part to admit that &mdash; not trying to develop himself as an individual who would more easily be able to deal with a society that was living with approximately 19 per cent of its people unemployed and spending hundreds of millions of pounds every year servicing that unemployment figure?  Is it not sexist and discriminatory to ask a woman who is to look after the children? I can give many instances of people saying pathetically &ldquo;My mother-in-law will look after the child&rdquo; or &ldquo;My mother will look after the child&rdquo;.  By the way, notice the assumption that the child is one of those miraculous children born of one sex only. It is not the father's child.  Simply, it is the mother who has responsibility.  I would like an assurance that the Minister will issue a memorandum to all members <Col N="2210" /> of the different exchanges throughout the country clarifying what &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; means, and that he will establish clearly that it does not mean that people are to stay in some zombie-like, fatalistic assistance within their houses, afraid to stir.  If they put a slate on their house they can be asked where they got the money for the slate.  They are afraid to assist their fellow unemployed people or to become involved in communal activity. It is an appalling interpretation to suggest that &ldquo;non-availability for work&rdquo; means that one must not be involved in any activity, unrewarded or voluntary or community oriented.  Only in a barbaric society could such an interpretation apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately you raise an issue like this in this House where in recent times there is a reflection of a Ramboesque approach towards the unemployed and social welfare recipients, people suggest that there is a great deal of fraud going on.  I do not condone social welfare fraud.  Where it is detected it should be prosecuted. However, I object to the existence in legislation and in practice of forms of words that are visiting hardship on individuals and are being applied in a singularly discriminatory way against women and against people who are anxious to overcome the terrible demoralisation of unemployment.  My fortune or misfortune, depending on how you look at it, has been to have spent some time lecturing on social policy and sociology and at times looking at the social experience of becoming unemployed suddenly. One of the most demoralising effects of unemployment after the first year is that the person, be it male or female, begins to withdraw back from himself or herself into the house and to lose links with the community, with colleagues, with the trade union he might have been a member of, with friends and so forth.  We should do everything possible to try to mitigate the social effects and conequences of unemployment.  The kind of interpretation that I have alluded to is doing nothing to erode that kind of experience.  I would like to think that we are encouraging people and telling them <Col N="2211" /> that if they want to help their neighbours that is fine.</P>
    <P>In reply to this question let me not hear a litany of all the wonderful schemes from enterprise allowances to starting businesses, to going off searching, training skills and so on.  I am not interested in this paeon that might come out about what is impossible for people if only they could develop initiative.  I am looking for something very simple.  Will the Minister tell this House that the phrase &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo; will not be interpreted in the manner that I have described so that it will not injure the people who are involved?  I have described the kind of people and the kind of place.  It is not met by saying that each individual case will be dealt with.  It is met only by the Minister setting out an interpretation of these words in the legislation and sending it to officials of his Department centrally and then disseminating it throughout the country so that people can be dealt with in a humane and sensitive way.  It might be said, &ldquo;If such a dreadful thing as Deputy Higgins suggests or might have fabricated was to happen, are the procedures not there for the aggrieved citizen to go to an appeal system?&rdquo; The appeal system is there in the case of the man offering the car maintenance course. He got his benefit back after 12 months. The case of the man on the literacy course is, to my knowledge, not yet resolved.</P>
    <P>However, there is more than the cases I report.  There is the sense of fear that this sets up among people who are afraid of being questioned.  It might be said in many cases that this is necessary.  I doubt if it is necessary.  What is necessary is for the unemployment problem to be put at the top of the political and economic agenda and for people to begin to divert some of the hundreds of millions of pounds to that.  This year we will spend on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and lost PRSI about £750 million.  Add to that lost direct taxation and then lost indirect taxation between the benefits and what a person would have if he was on the lower wage. In a society, and particularly in a country, <Col N="2212" /> full of people but at the same time not full of jobs and with few job opportunities, it seems incredibly narrow, backward and inhuman and a gross insult to our own humanity here in this House to take from an Act the words &ldquo;not available for work&rdquo; and interpret them as saying that the individual should not be involved in activity, voluntary or community, or should have to account for every penny for everything he does in his house.  It reminds me of the notion that the unemployed should never take a holiday, that if they move away for a fortnight or three weeks if assisted, they will lose the benefit for that period.  That notion was around for a long time.  It is time for us to realise that we are responsible &mdash; not I but 90 per cent of the people who fill the benches of these Houses &mdash; for the kind of society and economy that we have and the numbers of unemployed that we have, and that the onus is on us, at least while we want to live with an island full of unemployment, to treat the unemployed better than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I see it as most important that people who are unemployed through no fault of their own are encouraged to engage in constructive activities and to develop skills which will not alone help them to lead a fuller life but also will assist them in gaining employment.  In particular, there is abundant evidence so show that people who leave the school system early are at a marked disadvantage in acquiring and keeping employment and I know that many people who had to leave school at an early age, very often through no fault of their own, find it a terrible handicap to overcome as they go through life.</P>
      <P>I have tremendous admiration, therefore, for those who take steps to overcome this handicap in later years by going to classes to learn literacy and numeracy skills.  I am sure everyone will agree also that those who give of their time, often on a voluntary basis, in teaching these skills, deserve our respect and gratitude for the wonderful work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the specific matter <Col N="2213" /> raised by the Deputy I would like first of all to outline the position in relation to participation by unemployed persons in education courses generally.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to unemployment payments is subject to the conditions that an unemployed person must be capable of work, available for and genuinely seeking work.  These are the statutory conditions which bind all of us, including social welfare workers.  The relevant legislation governing entitlement to unemployment payments is contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Deputy has said, I think he recognises that £2 million a day is paid out in unemployment benefits. The staff who deal with it manage to pay out enormous sums.  I resent any allegation that the staff are not considerate and helpful, though in any situation you will find people who may not be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such allegation. I stated the opposite.  The Minister should not make wild allegations. He should answer questions rather than cast aspersions which are not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person who is attending classes, whether full time or part time, claims unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, his case is considered on its merits in accordance with the legislation.  Each claim is decided by a statutorily appointed deciding officer.  There is no way to do it other than to delegate responsibility to people on the ground.  Of course we can say from time to time what we would like them to do and we can provide advice, but they must get out and do the job.</P>
      <P>In deciding whether a claimant satisfies the statutory conditions, the deciding officer would consider whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present and whether there are commitments which might limit the person's freedom to seek or accept work or training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the legislation which specifically precludes persons who <Col N="2214" /> pursue an educational course from claiming and receiving unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  However, all claimants must satisfy the statutory condition of being available for and genuinely seeking work and any claimant who, by reason of his or her participation in an educational course, fails to satisfy this condition in respect of any day, would not be eligible for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>If I might now turn to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, I am glad to state that the position is that unemployed persons attending basic reading and writing courses would generally be entitled to continue to receive their unemployment payments while attending such courses. This in fact has always been the case, the reason being that any unemployed person attending classes of this kind would in the normal way have no difficulty in showing that he or she would continue to be available for work.</P>
    <P>Arising from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Thursday in which the Deputy was reported as referring to two cases, one in County Louth and another in County Wicklow, where welfare payments were disallowed, an official of my Department made inquiries into the matter and discovered that nobody had been deprived of unemployment payments in connection with literacy classes. In fact, it transpired that one of the cases the Deputy had in mind was an unemployed person in Dundalk who was going to a wood-working class on one afternoon a week.  In this particular case inquiries had to be made to establish full details of the course before a decision could be given but at no stage was the claim disallowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, I am doing everything possible to enable unemployed claimants to engage in constructive activities.  It is my policy to adopt a flexible approach in relation to the schemes for the unemployed.  In this connection, I would like to mention the following measures which have been taken.</P>
      <P>Educational agencies have in recent years become increasingly interested in providing courses for the unemployed. My Department are prepared at all times to enter into discussion with those who provide educational courses to find ways and means of structuring the courses in such a way that any difficulties which might arise as regards the &ldquo;availability condition&rdquo; are overcome and thereby enable unemployed persons who wish to participate in such courses to continue to receive their unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The part time allowance scheme enables persons who work for under 24 hours in any week to receive a basic income maintenance payment from my Department regardless of their earnings from their employment in that week.  This scheme has been in operation for over a year now and I have made provision in the 1988 Estimates for its extension to other areas throughout the country.  It will now be a nationwide scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the voluntary work scheme, persons who engage in voluntary work may continue to draw their unemployment payments.  An unemployed person who wishes to avail of the option <Col N="2216" /> of voluntary work has simply to notify his local office in advance.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I am very conscious of the importance that education plays in helping the unemployed to improve their situation.  In this connection, I consider that the role which can be played by the educational opportunities scheme will be of increasing significance. In my speech on the motion noting the 1988 Estimates on 21 October I referred at some length to this scheme, but in view of its importance in the context of this debate I consider it desirable to restate some of the elements of that speech.</P>
    <P>This scheme was one of three pilot programmes introduced in a number of locations throughout the country.  Participation in the scheme was open to all unemployed persons aged over 25 who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for at least 12 months.  While on the scheme participants continued to receive an amount equal to their rate of assistance or benefit.  However, where this amount was less than the AnCO training rate applicable at that time, the AnCO training rate was payable.  In addition, participants continued to receive any miscellaneous allowance they had been in receipt of while claiming unemployment benefit or assistance such as fuel allowance and butter vouchers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is to give unemployed people over the age of 25 the opportunity to go back to school to complete a certificate-type course.  It gives a second chance to those people who up to now felt that they had little possibility of competing successfully with younger, better educated workers.  By guaranteeing a basic income, the Department of Social Welfare provide the opportunity of taking up a leaving certificate course to those who want to go back to study.</P>
    <P>The feedback from participants indicated that they were highly motivated and enthusiastic and most were prepared to work the 30 hours a week scheduled for them.  The subjects covered included <Col N="2217" /> English, mathematics, home economics and also woodwork, art, Irish, computer studies and personal development.  Aside from the improvement in the morale and motivation of the students, participation in the scheme also gave benefits to the families of the participants.  A significant number of those who participated in the scheme secured full time employment while some others are exploring the possibility of starting their own business.  I am convinced that this type of scheme is most worthwhile and the necessary resources to plan the continuation of the scheme have been set aside for next year.</P>
    <P>Regarding some other matters the Deputy raised, I will certainly, as he requests, issue a clarification relating to availability for work, part-time and educational opportunities.  Such clarifications <Col N="2218" /> are issued from time to time.  I have not time to deal with all the other questions raised.  Regarding voluntary water schemes, these would have to be cleared in advance.  That is the arrangement.  If people want to work on such a scheme they should come forward and say that is what they want to do.  I would envisage a further extension of this kind of work but it must be approved first, otherwise there would be no control from the Department's point of view.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy gives details of individual cases we will look into them and have them dealt with urgently.  It is my policy also to have flexible arrangements for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 November 1987.</P>

      <P>The Deputies are no doubt aware that there is a proposal to replace the national school building at Lisdowney, County Kilkenny, which is of prefabricated construction, with a new building of conventional construction.  Tenders have been invited for the new building and examined in my Department, but because of prior commitments and the pressure which these commitments have placed on the capital resources available to my Department it was not possible at the appropriate time to authorise the placing of a contract.  My attention has been drawn to the aspects of the matter referred to in Deputy Flanagan's question.</P>
      <P>Lisdowney is one of several national schools whose accommodation problems are particularly acute.  These projects have been held up at the stage where in less difficult times the school authorities might have entertained reasonable hopes of having by now had their contracts placed.  The authorities in each case have made representations to me regarding their difficulties and I have indicated that I am prepared to respond with short term relief in the way of refurbishing existing accommodation or providing prefabricated classrooms as appropriate.  I have also indicated that I would sympathetically respond to these schools' own initiatives for a solution to their difficulties provided what they propose is reasonable and can be achieved at modest cost.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the authorities of Lisdowney national school are proceeding, and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome in due course.  It would not be true to describe the position as one of deadlock.</P>

Having considered their replies I propose to hold a national conference in early December &mdash; the details of this conference will be circulated shortly.

It is not possible for me, at this time, to give the House exact details of that funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 19 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal to extend the national school building at Corracrin, County Monaghan, by the provision of a new classroom block of traditional construction. The existing school building is also to be refurbished.  Tenders had been invited for the project by the school authorities, and recommendations submitted to my Department.  Because, however, of prior commitments and the pressure which these commitments have placed on the capital resources available to my Department, it was not possible at the appropriate time to authorise the placing of a contract.</P>
      <P>Corracrin is one of several national schools whose accommodation problems are particularly acute.  These projects have been held up at the stage where in less difficult times they might have entertained reasonable hopes of having by now had their contracts placed.  The school authorities in each case have made representations to me regarding their difficulties, and I have indicated that I am prepared to respond with short term relief in the way of grants for refurbishing existing accommodation or providing prefabricated classrooms as appropriate. I have also indicated that I would sympathetically respond to these schools' own initiatives for a solution to their difficulties provided that their proposals are reasonable and can be achieved at modest cost.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the authorities of Corracrin national school regarding their difficulties have taken place, and I am hopeful that progress will be made at an early date towards a solution.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances outlined I am not in a position at this stage to authorise the placing of a contract for the project as originally proposed.</P>

A sum of £100,000 was provided by the then Government to assist in the start-up costs of the scheme.  This involved the payment of £55,000 in 1985 and £45,000 in 1986. In 1987, following Government decisions in February and March, it was agreed that the additional operating costs of <Col N="2017" /> Gaisce, the President's Award would be met from the surplus proceeds of the national lottery.  A sum of £168,693 has been paid in 1987 from the lottery surplus to cover liabilities incurred up to 28 February 1987.

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that any commitment to improve pupil/teacher ratios is conditional on improved financial circumstances.  In line with the policy which has been adopted by the Government and which has been acted on firmly in preparing the budget for 1987 and the Estimates for 1988, certain cost-reducing measures have been decided on for the education area.  In different circumstances these measures would not have been introduced.  The measures which have been adopted have been carefully selected in order to achieve the necessary reductions in costs in the fairest way.</P>
      <P>In regard to primary education, a revision has been made in the schedule of average pupil enrolment figures required for the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools.

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the results of the intermediate certificate examination should be available much earlier than they have been in recent years.</P>
      <P>There is no simple solution, however. The Department's examinations have been increasing in size and complexity and the Examinations Branch, in common with the public service generally, is constrained in the staffing available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term I am convinced that <Col N="2037" /> part of the solution, at least, lies in computerising the operations of the Examinations Branch.  The present financial restraints prevent us from introducing computerisation straight away but plans are in hand to proceed with computerisation at the earliest opportunity. The implementation of a fully computerised system will of course extend over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In the short term I am having the Examinations Branch examine its procedures and practices, and the organisation unit of my Department has carried out a management survey of the operations of the branch with a view to greater efficiency.</P>

      <P>With regard to road haulage the process of liberalisation is now virtually complete. The Road Transport Act, 1986, provides for the removal of all quantitative restrictions on the grant of licences to road haulage operators over two years.  Phase 1, which came into effect on 30 September 1986 provided for the grant of unrestricted licences called road freight carrier's licences to all existing licensees and to operators in the exempted areas who held current road freight certificates on that date.  The second phase, which will come into effect on 30 September 1988 will provide for the grant of licences to all applicants who satisfy the EC qualitative requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals that I am aware of for the deregulation of air fares to Canada, the Continent of Europe and provincial centres in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, proposals for increased flexibility in air fares <Col N="2051" /> (i)  under an EC air transport package, finalised but not adopted by the Council of Ministers last June.</P>
    <P>This package provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for more flexible regulatory arrangements in the area of air fares by granting airlines of member states operating within the Community greater pricing freedom by permitting.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the unilateral filing of fares;</P>
    <P>&mdash;automatic Government approval of certain fare proposals conforming to specified price and fare type parameters; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;a speedy arbitration procedure to remedy disputes.</P>
    <P>The proposals have not however been adopted because of a dispute between the UK and Spain over the status of Gibraltar Airport.  I am hopeful, however, that this issue can be resolved before the end of the year;</P>
    <P>(ii)  under an International Agreement of 16 June 1987 on intra-European tariffs drawn up by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) with 22 European member states, including Ireland, which provides similarly for individual filing of tariffs by airlines, automatic approval of fares within defined zones of flexibility and a more rapid disputes settlement procedure. I am considering at present whether Ireland should formally ratify this Agreement.</P>
    <P>In addition to developments at EC and ECAC, in May last I announced a new low air fares strategy aimed at increasing tourist numbers.  The campaign towards lower air fares is continuing.  Reduced fares from the Continent for next year, particularly from France and Germany have already been announced by Aer Lingus.  Innovative fares from provincial centres in Britain have also been arranged.  Ryanair are finalising contracts for next year in respect of charter traffic from the Continent, particularly France and Germany, and the packages they are <Col N="2052" /> putting together should also prove attractive in terms of overall fare levels.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am at present reviewing existing charter rules including those relating to charter fares.  This review is almost completed and I hope to announce the proposed changes to the rules shortly. These rules will apply, <i>inter alia,</i> to charter operations between Ireland and Canada.  As the Deputy may be aware, there are no scheduled air services between Ireland and Canada.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was examined on 28 May 1987.  The medical referee recommended that a further examination should take place in the near future.

The extension of the scheme to persons resident in the United Kingdom could not, if it were being considered, be confined to persons in receipt of Irish pensions. Furthermore it would raise the question of extending the scheme to Irish people resident in countries other than the UK.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Research into and standardisation of equipment for broadband telecommunications is part of the EC RACE (R and D in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe) Programme.  The long term objective of RACE is to establish an Integrated Broadband Communication (IBC) system for Europe (basically a telecommunications network which will carry all services at very high transmission rates) which will take into account the evolving Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) world wide and the national developments in member states.  It is hoped that by 1995 a Community wide network service will be in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme will cover an initial period of five years commencing on 1 June 1987.  The funds estimated as necessary for the Community contribution to the implementation of the programme amount to 500 million ECUs over five years.  The Commission will establish for each year a draft work plan defining the <Col N="2062" /> detailed objectives, the types of projects to be undertaken and the financial plans. The programme falls to be reviewed after 30 months on the basis of the results achieved and the Commission shall inform the Council and the European Parliament of the results of the review. After the completion of the first five year period of the programme, the Commission shall send to the member states and the European Parliament a report on the performance and results of the programme.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the programme is that at a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Research) on 28 September 1987, the Council adopted a common position on the RACE Programme.  This common position was communicated to the European Parliament under the co-operation procedure provided for in the Single European Act.  It is anticipated that the co-operative procedure with the European Parliament will be finalised later this month so that the RACE Programme can be formally adopted by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>No estimates of cost have so far been made of the establishment of a broadband communications network in Ireland and the additional capacities available to users will depend on the type of network which ultimately emerges in the wake of the RACE Programme and the level of demand which will exist for particular broadband services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Government are taking every possible action to seek <Col N="2064" /> the closure of Sellafield.  We see this as the only answer to lack of confidence in the safety of the plant and to the continuing discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.  In April, this year I wrote to the then UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Peter Walker, MP, calling for the elimination of discharges from Sellafield and its closure as soon as possible. I also expressed concern about the safety of UK reactors, especially the old Magnox reactors some of which are located at Sellafield which were not designed to meet modern safety standards and which have now surpassed their original operational life expectancy.  I requested that such reactors, particularly those at Calder Hall in Sellafield and Chapel Cross be phased out.  I repeated these calls at my meeting with Mr. Parkinson on 16 September last.</P>
      <P>We have established close ties with the Isle of Man Government which share many of our concerns about the UK nuclear industry, particularly Sellafield. On 25 September last I met with the Isle of Man Chief Minister and also their Minister for the Environment.  We agreed to co-operate in every way possible on these matters.</P>
      <P>Prior to the meeting of the Paris Commission last June, I carried out an intensive international lobbying campaign for the closure of Sellafield and for support for our recommendation for its closure, which we submitted to the Paris Commission. At a Ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency on 11 May, I sought support for our position from most of the Ministers representing countries which are party to the Paris Convention. I also had meetings with Ambassadors of the Nordic countries seeking their support.  While agreement on our recommendation for the closure of Sellafield could not be reached at the Paris Commission meeting, considerable support and sympathy for our position was expressed.  I intend to pursue this issue at next year's meeting of the Commission and I will continue my lobbying campaign towards this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in relation to radioactive discharges, significant progress was made at <Col N="2065" /> this year's meeting of the Paris Commission. A recommendation, which I tabled, concerning the application of the best available technology to minimise and to eliminate, as soon as possible, any pollution caused by radioactive discharges into the marine environment, was adopted by the Commission.  On the basis of another Irish proposal it was agreed to establish a provisional system for the reporting of unplanned discharges from nuclear installations.  Ireland, acting as a lead country, undertook to examine this system to see if it could be improved.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the problem of the safety and transboundary effects of UK reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant is not purely a bilateral one and that the European Community has a vital role to play in this matter. In April 1986 the Government formally requested the European Commission to establish a Community Inspection Force under Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty to report to the Commission and member states on existing or potential health or safety problems in individual nuclear installations in the Community.  This request was formally repeated in May 1986 following Chernobyl.  In this context I met with Mr. Clinton Davis, Commissioner for Environment Nuclear Safety and Transport on 7 May last.  In July, in response to the Commission's announcement of plans to resume inspection of national monitoring facilities, I again formally raised the issue of an inspection force with Commissioner Clinton Davis saying that, while we welcomed their initiative on inspection of monitoring facilities, it did not prejudice our long standing request for a nuclear safety inspection force.</P>
    <P>Ireland has proposed the establishment of an inspection force at Council level on numerous occasions, most recently at an informal Energy Council on 21 September last where I drew attention to the Sellafield question and again called for the establishment of an inspection force. I said that this would be necessary to independently ensure that uniformly high standards are applied at nuclear installations throughout the Community; that <Col N="2066" /> national regulatory authorities carry out their functions effectively and that any plants which cannot meet the highest safety standards are closed.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the recent statement by Commissioner Clinton Davis in favour of an inspection force and calling on member states to support its establishment. In effect the Commissioner reiterated what Ireland has been saying all along, that the Community provides the obvious legal and technical infrastructure for such a force.  I now hope that firm proposals for its establishment will be brought forward without delay and I will continue to press the Commission and member states in this regard. I will be meeting the Commissioner on 5 November to discuss these matters.  I met with the European Community Ambassadors to Ireland on 28 October and I sought support for an inspection force.</P>
    <P>The proposal of British Nuclear Fuels to construct caverns under the Irish Sea for the storage of nuclear waste from Sellafield or elsewhere is completely repugnant to me.  At my recent meeting with Mr. Parkinson, I stressed the total opposition of the Irish Government and people to this proposal and I called on Mr. Parkinson to prevent British Nuclear Fuels from proceeding with it.  Although this is just one of the options being considered in the UK, I emphasised to Mr. Parkinson that I intended to raise the issue at every available forum including the EC, and the London Dumping Convention.</P>
    <P>The Government are also opposed to any expansion of the UK's nuclear industry, including reprocessing of nuclear waste, which could cause a further threat to the health and safety of the Irish people.  I have made this clear to the UK Government both in my letter to Mr. Walker and also at my meeting with Mr. Parkinson when I requested that any proposed new nuclear plants along Britain's west coast should not be built.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to maintain their campaign on issues of nuclear safety and to seek the closure of plants which are unsatisfactory.  If we fail <Col N="2067" /> to achieve our objectives through bilateral and international discussions, I will review all other possible courses of action to pursue our legitimate demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide and up to date range of powers in relation to both dumping and litter control.  Each county council and county borough corporation is also responsible for all aspects of waste management in its functional area, including decisions on the extent and frequency of the refuse collection and disposal services.  I will continue to avail of every opportunity to urge local authorities to make maximum use of their statutory powers to deal with dumping in the areas referred to in the question and in other areas.  All authorities have been asked to consider assigning anti-litter duties, either on a full time or part time basis, to an appropriate number of employees.  The fine-on-the-spot system is intended to provide quick and effective action in relation to litter offences and the level of this fine was increased last year from £5 to £25.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, legislation will not on its own secure a clean and tidy environment and, even with the best will in the world local authorities will not succeed in eliminating dumping and littering without public co-operation.  I intend, therefore, to continue the promotion of environmental awareness activities and, in particular, campaigns to develop an improved public consciousness of the need for a cleaner and tidier environment.</P>

      <P>Instances where silage effluent has flowed on to public roads have come to the notice of my Department.  I appreciate that this may result in inconvenience or nuisance to road users and pedestrians and that the effluent could enter waters and cause pollution.  There is adequate provision under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, to deal with any such pollution incidents and to have appropriate measures taken to ensure that the escape of effluent ceases.  In addition, local authorities have a general duty to maintain public roads and this would include the cleaning of roads in the interests of traffic.  Sanitary authorities also have power to deal with any nuisance which may arise from the escape of this effluent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason a person (details supplied) in County Waterford was given an extra two years' endorsement on his provisional driver's licence when the two occasions on which he was late for renewal were a result of a delay in receiving his endorsement from Thomastown, County Kilkenny and while he was awaiting proof from Dublin of his application for a driving test for the local tax office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides for the carry over of endorsements on a driving licence to subsequent driving licences.  Under this provision a person whose licence has been endorsed must, before he can obtain a licence free from that endorsement, satisfy the licensing authority that he has held a driving licence either during a continuous period of not less than three years, or a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years after the date of the original endorsement.</P>
      <P>I understand from Waterford Corporation, who are the licensing authority involved that, in the case of the person concerned, Thomastown District Court ordered on 2 April 1984, that particulars of a conviction be endorsed on a provisional licence held by him at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence held by the person concerned expired on 8 May 1984.  It is open to a person to apply for a licence up to one <Col N="2082" /> month before the expiry of his current licence.  While the new licence subsequently granted to him was not issued until 4 July 1984, according to the corporation's records the application was made on 10 May 1984, that is two days after the date of expiry of his previous licence.</P>
    <P>The corporation's records also show that despite the fact that the 1984 licence expired on 3 July 1985, a valid application for a further licence was not received by them until 16 July 1985 &mdash; the licence being granted on the same day.  There is no record on the corporation's file to suggest that the person concerned was asked prior to 16 July 1985 to produce proof of an application for a driving test &mdash; such proof was already on their records.  Neither is there any record in my Department of a request from the person concerned seeking such proof.</P>
    <P>It is only since 16 July 1985 that the person concerned has held a licence without a break between the expiry of one licence and the granting of another.  He presently holds a three year full driving licence (granted on 16 June 1987 after he passed his driving test).  He will have fulfilled the three year rule by 15 July 1988 and will be entitled to surrender his licence for a licence free from that endorsement with effect from 16 July 1988.</P>

Among the issues covered in this resolution was the question of guaranteeing access for unemployed school leavers to full-time programmes of basic training and work experience.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour assigned responsibility to the Youth Employment Agency for co-ordination of the implementation of the guarantee commitment and jointly with the Minister for Education set up the Social Guarantee Advisory Board to advise the Youth Employment Agency in relation to how the Social Guarantee should be provided; monitoring and reviewing the Social Guarantee commitment; the extent and nature of the provision required for specific groups, both in manpower and education-based programmes; the level of allowances for participants in youth training programmes.</P>
      <P>The board consists of twenty members (including the chairperson) as follows: seven nominated by the Minister for Labour, representative of Department of Labour, (2) (including the Chairperson); National Manpower Service, (1); Youth Employment Agency, (1) AnCO, (2); CERT, (1).</P>
      <P>Seven nominated by the Minister for Education, representative of Department of Education, (2); Irish Vocational Education Association, (2); Association of Comprehensive and Community Schools, (1); Joint Managerial Board for Secondary Schools, (1); Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, (1);</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six nominated jointly by both the Ministers, representative of Employer <Col N="2087" /> bodies, (2); Irish Congress of Trade Unions, (2); National Youth Council of Ireland, (2).</P>
    <P>The board itself do not issue reports. During the period since their first meeting on 5 March 1986 they have considered various broad issues relating to the guarantee and gave advice during the drafting of the Youth Employment Agency's annual reports to me on the implementation of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>The Board also advised the Youth Employment Agency on the appropriate level of allowances to be paid to young persons on programmes in the manpower and education areas.</P>
    <P>The future of the Board will be looked at in the context of the establishment of FÁS and whatever strategy may emerge from the discussions taking place between the Minister for Education and myself, to which I referred last week, to improve the vocational preparation and training available to early school leavers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if the Youth Employment Agency has made the following recommendations (a) that a travel allowance be introduced for work experience participants (b) a higher premium of £60 apply, under the employment incentive scheme, to persons under 25 who are on the live register for over one year and (c) that the level of the Teamwork scheme be maintained at just over 2,000 places; if he intends to implement these recommendations particularly in light of reducing training allowances as recommended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations referred to by the Deputy were made by the Youth Employment Agency in the context of their Medium Term Outlook and Plan for Youth Employment Policies 1986-1991 published in November 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Re (a), as recruitment to the Work <Col N="2088" /> Experience Programme has been suspended, implementation of this recommendation does not arise.</P>
    <P>Re (b), the employment incentive scheme allowance of £60 a week was specially targeted towards long term unemployed persons over 25 years of age who represent 80% of that category.  I have no proposals to extend this level of allowance to persons under 25.  The funding of such an increase could only be achieved through restricting overall numbers entering the scheme resulting in a decrease of opportunities generally available to unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>Re (c), it is proposed to accommodate some 2,278 persons on Teamwork during 1988.</P>

      <P>The ESF rules determine the level of assistance available from the Fund for programmes eligible for such assistance. In general vocational training programmes are assisted at the rate of 55% of eligible expenditure which includes both allowances and other relevant costs. On the other hand employment related programmes are Fund aided on a capitation basis based on 55% of the premium paid to participants out of Exchequer funds but subject to a maximum set out by the EC Commission from year to year. The present maximum is £29.425 per week.  All assistance from the Fund is subject to linear reduction in the event <Col N="2089" /> of the combined claims of all member states exceeding the total amount available for distribution from the Fund under any given guideline.</P>
      <P>The following are details of the assistance available to the various manpower programmes:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, because of paragraph A of Article 3 of the EC General Directive which will come into effect in the next few years, he will introduce legislation <Col N="2093" /> for the statutory registration of physiotherapists to remove any doubt as to their right to practice anywhere within the Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that statutory registration for physiotherapists will not be necessary in order to comply with our EC obligations. Accordingly, I do not propose to introduce legislation for the statutory registration of physiotherapists.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists is concerned that their members may not satisfy the requirements for a &ldquo;regulated profession&rdquo; within the meaning of the proposed EC Directive unless they are subject to statutory control in this country. However, a definition for &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; in this sense is still under active consideration, together with the entire text of the proposed directive, at Council working level in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The EC authorities are aware that there is a variety of forms of regulation or recognition of professional activities by member states and they are currently working with the member states towards drawing up a broad definition of a &ldquo;regulated professional activity&rdquo; to comprehend all forms of such regulation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.  Mass vaccination is not recommended by my Department for the attempted control of the spread of influenza but to give individual protection to groups most at-risk.  Groups at-risk are <Col N="2094" /> indicated each year in a Departmental circular and are identified locally by the Director of Community Care/Medical Officers of Health.  Therefore, no advertising campaign is required.</P>
      <P>I am getting from each health board information in respect of the cost of influenza vaccination, the number of persons which this will cover and the average cost per person, and will transmit it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

I should add that a review of enrolment trends at the school was recently completed, and it has established that one classroom fewer than the number originally planned for in this scheme will be required.  It will accordingly be necessary to revise the scope of the project for which tenders may in due course be invited.</P>

My predecessors had authorised the provision of a new second level school at Ashbourne, County Meath and architectural planning for the proposed school was initiated in early 1986.  No specific allocation was made in the 1987 estimates for this project, as provision for capital expenditure on the second level education sector is made on a global basis.</P>

      <P>No such guidelines have, as yet, been issued to post-primary schools. The study of the submissions which have been received and consideration of the outcome of the consultations held following publication of the report of the Committee on School Discipline have yet to be completed.  It is intended that all the issues raised by the Deputy will be covered by the guidelines when issued.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the position is that the question of disciplinary action is primarily a matter for the managerial authority of the school concerned, the manager in the case of secondary schools, board of management in the case of community and comprehensive schools and the vocational education committee in the case of vocational schools.  Any difficulty which a parent may have arising from the disciplinary action taken in a particular case, in this regard should in the first instance be taken up with the managerial authority of the school concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to community schools the Deed of Trust provides that:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of these articles and to the direction of the Board, the Principal shall control the internal organisation, management and discipline of the School, shall exercise supervision over the teaching and non-teaching staff and shall have power for any cause which he or she judges adequate to dismiss subject to the approval of the Board or to suspend pupils from attendance but on the dismissal or suspension of any pupil the parent shall be informed that he or she has the right to appeal to the Board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the proportion of State educational expenditures represented by teachers' salaries and pensions at the present time; if this proportion has changed to any significant extent since 1960; and if so, the reasons for this.</P>

      <P>Information is not available in the precise form sought by the Deputy as separate figures are not maintained in <Col N="2105" /> respect of overall teaching staff as distinct from other staff at the present time or for pay and superannuation costs generally or for teachers in particular for 1960-61.</P>
      <P>Overall pay and superannuation costs will account for 82 per cent of the net Exchequer provision in the Education Votes for 1988.</P>
      <P>Pay and superannuation costs of national school teachers will account for 33 per cent of the net Exchequer provision for education in 1988.  The corresponding figure for 1960-61 was 61 per cent.</P>
      <P>The secondary teachers' incremental salary grant will amount to 19 per cent of the net Exchequer provision in 1988 as compared with 10 per cent in 1960-61.</P>
      <P>Pay and superannuation costs of secondary, community and comprehensive school teachers will account for 23 per cent of the net total provision in 1988. The voted provision for 1960-61 was 10 per cent of the total.</P>
      <P>The main factors responsible for the changes since 1960 are the expansion in post-primary and third level education services in the intervening years and the fact that the superannuation costs of secondary teachers were not a charge on the Exchequer in 1960-61 but were met from the secondary teachers' pension fund.</P>
      <P>Separate data on vocational teachers as distinct from vocational education committee staff in general is not available.</P>
