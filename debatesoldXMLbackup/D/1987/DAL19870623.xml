    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will be seeking to make progress on the devolution objectives provided for in Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at his forthcoming Heads of Government meeting with Mrs. Thatcher; his views on devolution as a means of getting the Unionists involved in the current Anglo-Irish process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to outline the subjects to be discussed at such meetings.  The Deputy will be aware that Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Intergovernmental Conference shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on devolution in Northern Ireland, in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can accept that the Taoiseach cannot state what he will be raising at his forthcoming meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, I would like to know <Col N="2940" /> his Government's views on the issue of devolution which is provided for in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Does he agree with the objective of devolution as a means of making progress now in the North in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to go into those areas at present.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a fairly fluid situation in the North at present following the recent general election and I would prefer if the Deputy did not press me on issues of that kind at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach an open mind on the issue of devolution as a means of getting Unionists involved in the political process in the North in the wake of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that I would not wish to comment on any possible or likely developments at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which provides for the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals on the modalities for devolution. Have the Government framed or are they putting forward any modalities for devolution in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the Church-State meetings, if any, which have taken place since he assumed office; and, if so, the matters discussed at such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is none.  It is normal practice for the Taoiseach to meet the leaders of the different Churches from time to time on an informal and private basis.  I intend to continue this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he has not had <Col N="2941" /> meetings on an informal and private basis with the leaders of any of the Churches since he assumed office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a very brief courtesy call from a member of the Hierarchy of the Church of Ireland but it was of no particular significance.  It was just a casual meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Taoiseach prior consultations with or agreement from the leaders of the various Churches prior to proposing contemporaneous Church services on 12 July to mark commemoration of the war dead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote to all the heads of the Churches giving them my suggestions as to what form the commemoration ceremonies might take this year.  As the Deputy knows, a meeting is now proposed at party deputy leader level to discuss that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage any change in the practice of Church-State relations during the term of his Government as distinct from the practice during the term of the last Coalition Government when we were led to believe that Church-State relations had reached their lowest ebb in the wake of the abortion and divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy should tempt me into criticising my predecessor in this way.</P>

    <P>Footnote 1</P>
    <P>The fifth freedom rights outlined above can only be implemented when the Irish authorities and the two foreign States agree to an Irish carrier operating on a commercial basis between them. Therefore, the Irish, UK and Belgian authorities would each have to give approval before an Irish carrier could operate between Manchester and Brussels for instance.  Aer Lingus do not at present operate any routes on a fifth freedom basis.</P>
    <P>Footnote 2</P>
    <P>Fifth freedom rights on Dublin-Lourdes-Rome were withdrawn by the French authorities in 1981 but were restored in 1986.</P>
    <P>Footnote 3</P>
    <P>Fifth freedom rights on the routes (i) Dublin-Zurich-Rome; and (ii) Dublin-Geneva-Milan, were withdrawn by the Italian authorities in 1980 and 1985 respectively.</P>

      <P>Delegations from Ireland and the United States met in Dublin from 27-29 May 1987 to discuss the establishment of a permanent scheme of US <Col N="2948" /> immigration pre-inspection at Shannon. The delegations agreed that the trial period of pre-inspection at Shannon between 1 July and 31 October 1986 had been very successful.  They also agreed that a permanent scheme of pre-inspection should be established at the airport and that it was desirable that the scheme should commence, if possible, during the 1987 summer period.  It is hoped that a date for recommencement of pre-inspection will be settled in the near future.</P>
      <P>The recommencement of pre-inspection on a permanent basis is provided for in the Irish-US pre-inspection agreement, which forms part of the Air Navigation and Transport (Pre-inspection) Act, 1986.  No changes in the agreement can be made without amending legislation and no such changes were discussed in the recent negotiations.  I am not aware that there is any question of the pre-inspection arrangements conflicting with the requirements of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have no role in considering acquisition of cultural assets such as the Pig House Collection although Bord Fáilte have assisted in promoting the collection in their tourist literature.  State acquisition would be a matter for the National Museum, which operates under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The ideal solution is the retention of the collection in Cavan.  This is a matter for Cavan County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this collection has attracted international interest and that students from the Continent and elsewhere have visited it and are returning to study it and to take particulars of it?  Does the Minister appreciate that tourism in Cavan would be greatly helped by the retention of this collection?  While most of the tourists who visit Cavan are interested in fishing, there are many who content themselves with sightseeing and enjoying other pursuits.</P>
      <P>In view of that, will the Minister agree that it would be good business for his Department to take steps to preserve this valuable collection for the region?  Is the Minister aware that the collection was offered to Cavan County Council some years ago but because of lack of accommodation that body have not shown any interest in it?  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices as Minister for Tourism and Transport to see to it that the collection is not lost to the region.  I am sure he will agree that it would be folly of the worst type to allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy and the House that I am fully aware of the exhibit which the Deputy has lauded, and rightly so.  I am also aware that foreign students, particularly German students, have been doing some study on the contents and are engaged in cataloguing them.  Through membership of the Breffni Historical Society I am acquainted with Mrs. Faris who is responsible, with her mother and grandmother, for putting this collection together and I <Col N="2952" /> am as committed as the Deputy to the retention of it in County Cavan.  The Deputy referred to the type of tourism which we depend on in that region and I agree that as a back-up to the fishing element historic collections, such as Mrs. Faris' Pig House Collection, are very important as are the other historical and archaeological sites in the county.  I am pleased to tell the House that we are committed to the preservation of that collection in the region.  I am aware that some time ago the county council were offered the collection and that it was to go to Cootehill.  However, there was a hitch in the arrangement for the accommodation there but I hope the county council will be able to make available in the town of Cavan a suitable location for it.  The alternative is dispersal and that would be a serious blow to the collection, would reduce its impact and would mean that anybody who tried to put it together again would have to chase all over the country and abroad looking for the artefacts that are on display there.</P>

I note the Minister's good intentions but I should like to stress that there is an urgency about this matter. Delays are dangerous and Mrs. Faris' one anxiety is to see the collection preserved. She cannot see that being done other than through a State agency.  I appeal to the Minister to treat this matter as urgent.</P>

      <P>The question arises from a firm report from a constituent. From the Minister's inquiries of Aer Lingus, can he confirm that there were two commerical aircraft in the locality about the time and date indicated?</P>

      <P>We have had detailed inquiries made with regard to this serious question.  There is no evidence whatsoever in the air traffic area of such incident, no pilot has reported any incident, and no air traffic control officer is aware of any incident such as this.</P>
      <P>My Department are at a loss to know the reason for this question.  The Deputy indicated that a citizen reported to him that such an incident had taken place.  It was suggested to me in one of the letters I got when I asked for information that sometimes, from angles, citizens may get a false impression of how near aircraft are to each other.  We have no evidence of this incident.  As I said, angles can give a false impression as many spectators and goal umpires can give evidence of.</P>

My concern is that in the course of this manoeuvre an incoming landing flight passed very close, if not near to, the circling aircraft.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous question on the subject of the Aer Lingus fleet replacement programme on 31 March 1987 and the examination of the Aer Lingus proposals by the interdepartmental review group.</P>
      <P>Recent developments and trends within the aviation industry have made it necessary for Aer Lingus to undertake some further work and a further submission from Aer Lingus is now in course of preparation.  This will be examined by the review group, who are now expected to report later in the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can list some &mdash; not all &mdash; of the factors involved.  Those responsible are, the improved situation in regard to interest rates which is very important in regard to funding of the Aer Lingus fleet; depreciation of the US dollar &mdash; as the House knows, at one stage the dollar was on a par with the punt and now it is roughly $1.50 to the punt &mdash; and the strong profit position of Aer Lingus on 31 March 1987 for the trading in the 12 months previously.  Those three important factors had to be taken into consideration and we are waiting for resubmissions from Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I humbly submit that those factors should, if anything, speed up a decision by the inter-departmental review group as to the raising of capital.  Will the Minister say when precisely a decision will be taken or will this matter be put off for ever and ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's comment that these factors <Col N="2961" /> should speed up matters.  If I had to provide money when the punt and the dollar were at par it would be a more substantial sum than when the punt and the dollar are related one punt to $1.50.  The Deputy's general thesis or major premise does not hold up.  It is very difficult to give a precise date because there is a meeting of the Council of Ministers tomorrow and decisions may be taken which would change the scene as there are so many variables.  To venture into the realm of assessment, I expect the report by July or August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The fee payable to Zeus <Col N="2967" /> Management Limited in respect of the consultancy services provided to the B &amp; I Line plc. amounts to £250,000 plus VAT (at 25 per cent) in respect of the three-year period from 6 May 1985 to 5 May 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister's answer and in the present circumstances surrounding the B &amp; I operation, does the Minister consider that the Government have saved themselves considerably more money by the level of this type of investment in Zeus Consultants to run the company, as it would appear at this stage that their objective has not been achieved?  What are the options facing the company? Does the Minister intend that this agreement will see its way through to 5 May 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall cost that I gave is less what the chief executive and chairman of the company would have been paid anyway in the normal course of events which is, I suppose, to be deduced from that.  It is a substantial expenditure, an amount fixed by my predecessor to try to deal with the very difficult circumstances that arose in the B &amp; I.  It is a difficult thing to assess whether this has been successful or not.  Again, as we mentioned with regard to the funding of Aer Lingus, there are many variables and it would be beyond the wit of man to determine whether there has been a financial improvement as a result of this, or whether there has not.  In the absence of the Zeus operation, we have no way of knowing whether it would be better or worse.  That is what the Deputy is trying to get at.  I am afraid that I would not be able to answer that query straight out.  It is a very substantial investment in the management of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would seem to have certain reservations with regard to how the operation has gone up to the present.  In the light of the further investment of £8 million into the company, would the Minister not consider, <Col N="2968" /> in the best interests of all concerned, seriously looking at the option of trying to privatise the company, in that it would be the best possible deal for the taxpayers and the Irish people who have pumped an enormous amount of money into this company?  Quite clearly it has not worked up to date.  Other options must be looked at.  Is it now the Minister's intention that, come the end of the tourist season, these hard facts will be put to the company and to the people involved and a decision taken possibly to privatise it?</P>

I reiterate what I have said already, namely, that both management and unions expressed themselves committed to a policy of reorganising B &amp; I in such a way that they would come up with a proposition to make the company viable and by viable in my simple language I mean a profit-making company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the reason for the refusal by the British authorities to allow Ryanair to operate services (a) direct from Cork to Luton (b) Dublin to Manchester; if he intends to pursue the matter further at this month's Council of Transport Ministers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities have indicated that they have deferred a decision on Ryanair's application to operate scheduled air services from Cork to Luton and from Dublin to Manchester. I have protested directly to the British authorities in the strongest possible terms about their action and I raised the issue at the Council of EC Transport Ministers on 9 June.  I intend to continue to pursue the matter through EC and bilateral channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2969" /> In relation to the Cork-Luton application, this route is not included in the current Ireland-UK Air Services Agreement. While the British authorities have previously indicated their willingness to accept freely the opening up of new routes, they now state that they are prepared to do so only in the context of an overall package with particular emphasis on the number of carriers that should be allowed on any route.  The question of the number of carriers to be designated on UK-Ireland routes has also delayed approval of the Dublin-Manchester application by Ryanair.  I have made it clear both at EC and bilateral negotiations that any expanded opportunities that are granted to external carriers to serve the Irish market must be balanced by meaningful fifth freedom rights for Irish carriers, who are handicapped by our peripheral location and a small home market.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that at this week's Council meeting, which begins tomorrow morning at 9.30, Ministers will reach agreement on an air transport package which will create a more competitive and flexible air transport system in Europe, which will provide for a significant opening up of market access opportunities, including fifth freedom rights, and enable the setting up of new routes including those being sought by Ryanair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the British Minister has refused those applications, although &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; is the word used in the reply.  Is there more to this than meets the eye?  Has the Minister indicated to the British authorities that he is granting licences to Irish operators or to independent operators with which the British did not agree?  Are there any other areas of conflict about which we do not know?  Is the Minister mystified by this refusal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no irritation, although a well deployed piece of irritation can be helpful at times in international negotiations.  The British are anxious for multi designation on a city pair basis and they are holding this <Col N="2970" /> back in the hope that multi designation on a city pair basis may become available. I wrote to the former Minister for Transport, Mr. John Moore, asking him to see to it that the liberal philosophy which was being expounded is adhered to and that Ryanair should be allowed their service from Shannon and Cork to Luton.  Mr. Moore was campaigning in the general election at the time I wrote.  I then took the opportunity to write to Mr. Paul Channon immediately he was appointed, indicating that I had already written to his predecessor and that I expected that, in accordance with the liberal philosophy which was then outlined for the UK authorities, these two services from Shannon to Luton and from Cork to Luton would be approved by the British Government. I am continuing to pursue that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This refusal, or deferment, has all the marks of a reprisal by the British Authorities.  The flight from Cork is ending up in Luton but Ryanair are being put to considerable extra expense every time they fly to Luton and besides that passengers have to endure a much longer flight path.  Surely there is something sinister in this which has not been brought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is unreasonable that the permission was not granted. I am continuing to maintain that position. I know the hardship caused to the airline concerned.  It is not much longer, it is 20 minutes extra, but it means a touchdown in Dublin which is a farcical exercise in the context of discussions that are going on in Europe at this time about liberalisation. It is not the first time we found that sometimes a profession of liberalism and acting on it are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the British are looking for an increased number of operators or for permission to have an increased number of operators on the Dublin-London route and that the Minister has not agreed to that, or Aer Lingus have not agreed to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2971" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would correct the Deputy on that.  Aer Lingus are one company operating and Ryanair are the second Irish company.  Both have to be taken into consideration when dealing with a matter like this.  The UK authorities are anxious for multiple designation on a city pair basis.  That answers the Deputy's question.  We cannot see how multiple designation can be accepted on the one hand along with a refusal to extend fifth freedom rights to Irish carriers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major subjects for discussion is that of fifth freedom rights.  I would not like to under-estimate the difficulties with regard to this because a number of the major operators have already said they are not anxious to have fifth freedom rights between hub airports. There is a possibility &mdash; and the Irish carriers are more interested in this &mdash; of developing fifth freedom rights in hub to regional airports.  Our carriers could benefit substantially from such a development.  We will be pressing that area.  There are difficulties.  Major powers among the Twelve do not want to liberalise.  Some countries do, and we <Col N="2972" /> are relying on those for support.  Our principal objective is to extend fifth freedom rights for the benefit of all our carriers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 7, 2, 3, 8 and 9.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on item No. 7 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 4.15 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Vincent Brady.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put in an amendment to the Order of Business at lunch time today within ten minutes or so of my receiving the order.  The amendment <Col N="3052" /> proposes to delete the second paragraph of the Order of Business which the Taoiseach has read out because it relates to completing the proceedings on item No. 7 not later than 4.15 p.m. today.  Item No. 7 is a very elongated complex motion to guillotine about 12 items of Business during the next couple of days, to allow no debate at all in respect of some of them and to allow short periods of debate in respect of the others.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to accept that and for that reason, while I am not objecting to things in general being ordered as the Taoiseach sees fit, I am certainly objecting to this complex and lengthy guillotine motion and I ask that that paragraph be decided separately from the remainder. It is worth noting that that motion contains in subparagraph (7) a proposal I have never seen before in 20 years in this House, which is to distinguish between the Leader of the main party in Opposition and of the various other parties. That might not mean a terrible lot if we did not read it in the context of what has been going on over the past couple of weeks in particular.  It seems designed to underline what has been happening.</P>
      <P>I think that 45 minutes in my case, and I am sure in the case of the majority of Members, is quite adequate.  I am not complaining about the length of time but it is quite wrong that a distinction should be made and that the leader of another party should be given a longer period in which to speak.  It is unnecessary and, read in the context of the events of last week, it seems to be almost provocative.</P>

Deputies Mary Harney and Desmond O'Malley have tabled an <Col N="3053" /> amendment to delete the proposal.  Pursuant to Standing Order 48 I have disallowed the amendment as being equivalent to a direct negative.  The Deputies can achieve the very same objective by opposing the proposal made by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform you and the House that I am objecting to the Order of Business for today and particularly in relation to Motion No. 7 (7).  I have here a schedule of business for this week which was circulated last Friday.  I assume it resulted from a meeting of the Whips which the Whip from the Labour Party was not allowed to attend.  There is no mention of this particular motion which is now on the Order Paper.  I do not think that is a fair way of doing business. The Labour Party Whip attempted to consult with the Whip of the Government Party last week to find that the door of his office was locked and there was a private meeting going on between himself and the Whip of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel that is the way to conduct and arrange the business of this House. I am objecting to it and I appeal to the Taoiseach in relation to allocating time for debates and making a differentiation between the leader of the main party in Opposition and other leaders.  I do not <Col N="3054" /> think that is in the interests of this House. I appeal to the Taoiseach.  A meeting should be held between all the leaders of this House to arrange the business of this House because this will go on and on, on this basis, certainly for the rest of this session and the next session if we do not sort it out.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, with your permission may I ask the Taoiseach if he would accept that there are a number of unsatisfactory elements in the Order of Business before us.  An example of the kind of problem which all of us in this House have with the Order of Business is that there is scheduled in the context of this comprehensive three day order a proposal to take on Thursday morning an Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce without debate.  That Estimate has, from my own knowledge, a substantial number of important items within it.  It is not yet circulated and surely it is unreasonable of the Taoiseach to expect this House to approve of an Order of Business binding itself to having no debate on an item with far reaching implications which has not yet been circulated.  Is that tenable or sustainable in any democratic institution?</P>

The sense of what I am saying is very clear.  There is a proposal to take without debate, on Thursday morning, a Supplementary <Col N="3055" /> Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce which that Department told me, prior to lunch, has a number of facets to it and not a scintilla of it has been circulated at this moment.

Therefore, A Cheann Comhairle &mdash; I may be a little out of order, in which case I apologise to you Sir &mdash; I am saying that the allocation of time for the various items of business during the course of this week which has been proposed by the Government appears to me to be reasonable and I will not oppose it. I do not think the House should spend much of the time of the House in debating whether we will debate issues.  It is far more important for us, and it is the reason we are elected, to be here to deal with the business before the House rather than talking about the business.</P>

That Bill attracted 72 amendments in the Seanad and there are upwards of 50 amendments pending on it by Deputies in this House, who are concerned, and who wish to get involved in the workings of this House.  For too long we have been accused abroad of being people who simply run for our constituences and of not doing the business of this House.  We are anxious and willing to get involved in the discussions, the debate and the deliberations on important legislation.  It is not acceptable to me, or indeed to anyone within the Workers' Party, or to anyone interested in serious work in this House to be afforded an hour and a half to discuss major implications of all Stages of a Bill such as the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.  In view of the seriousness of the proposals contained in this and in many other Bills, but I want to single out this Bill as one primary concern to me, I suggest to the Taoiseach that he find some other time or some other means to afford at least a reasonable opportunity to all parties and Deputies who are interested in discussing this matter.  I appeal to him because it is important that we are afforded some opportunity to contribute to this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="3058" /> So far as is concerned the Taoiseach's suggestion that as Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1969-70 I moved a guillotine motion, I may or may not have, I do not know.  I certainly know that I never moved one of two and a half pages.  Last week the Taoiseach suggested that I moved one in respect of the Finance Bill when I was Whip.  The only Finance Bill when I was Whip was in 1970.  I recall that period well because we had a quick succession of three Ministers for Finance. We had many strange incidents but one of them did not include a guillotine.</P>

      <P>I have allowed Deputy O'Malley great latitude.  He has spoken twice at length on the matter.  It seems clear to the Chair that in respect of the allocation of time to the motion there is strong objection.  Therefore I am putting the question: &ldquo;That the proceedings on No. 7 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 4.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set out by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to a statement made in the House last week by a Minister of State in regard to the amount of State grants made available to the Goodman international group.  That Minister of State stated that £25 million was the maximum that would be made available notwithstanding the fact that the following day the Government in the Finance Bill, in particular in section 25, introduced a facility whereby the grants can be written off as a tax liability up to a maximum of 50 per cent.  I would like some clarification from the Taoiseach.

      <P>Deputies will be aware that I have expressed in this House and elsewhere my concern to complete the takeover of the assets of Dublin Gas as quickly as possible and to get the Dublin city utility under full control and management of BGE so that safety, efficiency and progressive development would be the hall marks of the future.</P>
      <P>Dublin Gas is a problem which I inherited from the previous Government. Matters were dragging on with no sign of finality, either on the organisational, financial or safety fronts.  As soon as we came into office we decided that this situation needed to be regularised and stabilised at the earliest possible opportunity.  The receiver of Dublin Gas has made substantial advances since he was appointed.  Nevertheless receivership is an inherently unstable state for any organisation and I have been keen to bring this state to an end as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The BGE bid for the assets of Dublin Gas was successful and I am now pressing ahead with all possible haste to put the legislative framework in place so that there will be no delay in forging ahead and adding substantially to what has already been achieved.  This Bill is designed so that the Minister for Energy can oversee the operations of gas distribution with particular emphasis on safety.  It also provides for the appropriate capital borrowing powers so that the contract for sale of the assets can be signed very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3071" /> I am also pressing ahead with all possible haste on the organisational front.  I am insistent that the takeover will be done properly so that we can go forward and build on what has been achieved through the best possible management and organisational arrangements, and through the extension of the competence of the board of BGE to deal with their new remit.</P>
    <P>This Bill covers three main points, though not necessarily in the following order.  It increases BGE's borrowing powers, to enable them to effect the take-over. It proposes power for the Minister for Energy to confer on BGE, the new owners and operators, the powers and functions which Dublin Gas Company have as a gas distribution utility.  Thirdly, it enables the board of BGE, which will be responsible for both the existing BGE and the Dublin Gas utility as an integrated entity, to be increased in numbers, so that the wider spectrum of operations can be reflected at board level.</P>
    <P>The discovery of natural gas in 1971 represented a major development in Irish energy.  The Kinsale Head gas field was our first commercial discovery of hydrocarbons. The volume of gas in the field is about equivalent to 250 million barrels of oil.  Since gas came ashore in 1978, we have reduced our dependence on oil from 75 per cent to 53 per cent of total primary energy.  Deputies are aware that the initial allocations of Kinsale gas were to NET for ammonia manufacture and to ESB for electricity generation.  These allocations were essential to underpin the economics for the field to be developed and brought into production.  The ESB have now become a major coal consumer, following the coming on stream of the Moneypoint scheme, and this has allowed a significant diversion of supplies to other consumers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the major volumes flowing to NET and ESB &mdash; which, as I have said, made the exploitation of Kinsale possible &mdash; it was recognised that the direct distribution of natural gas to domestic and commercial consumers would <Col N="3072" /> be a premium use of natural gas.  Natural gas is a particularly clean and convenient fuel.  It can be burnt efficiently in modern appliances and it has hardly any undersirable by-products.  This makes it expecially attractive where fine control of heat and high levels of purity are required.</P>
    <P>The premium domestic, commercial and industrial consumers normally use gasoil or LPG when natural gas is unavailable whereas heavy industry and the ESB are able to make do with cheaper heavy fuel oil.  In the premium markets natural gas can displace gas oil and LPG which are both more expensive to import than most other competing energy forms.</P>
    <P>In order to gain access to these premium markets the gas transmission system was expanded, and natural gas was made available, first in Cork, then in Dublin, and later in Limerick and Clonmel. Plans are afoot to supply Waterford City, Kilkenny, north County Dublin, Drogheda and Dundalk.  Large volumes of gas are also being supplied to major industries, including the dairy industry, in the vicinity of the transmission pipelines.</P>
    <P>Dublin is by far the largest premium market for natural gas.  Dublin Gas have approximately 130,000 consumers and in 1986 83 million therms of gas were sold compared with 34 million therms in 1983. The target is to get this to at least 124 million therms within the next few years. A number of marketing studies which have been undertaken in the past few years have indicated that this level of sales should be possible though, of course, it will not be easy.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate events of the past six months or so have not helped.  I am quite satisfied, however, that under the care of BGE all of the necessary steps will be taken to ensure the integrity of the gas network and the safety of the public.  A great deal of the pipe network in Dublin was laid at a time when attention to safety was not as important as it is today and when it was impossible to forsee the volume or weight of traffic which now uses the streets of the city.  BGE have already recently appointed a member of their staff to oversee operations in Dublin <Col N="3073" /> gas and a major task of determining a policy for repair or replacement of mains which are most at risk has been started. Remedial work will not have to await the outcome of that study, however.  Significant repairs and renewals have been under way all year and the Cremer and Warner reports on the Raglan and Dolphin House explosions have emphasised the areas most in need of attention.</P>
    <P>With this heavy emphasis on repairs I am sure that customer confidence will be restored and we can now look forward to a resumption of growth in gas sales in the Dublin area.  It will be a primary function of BGE and their management to ensure that this is achieved.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company project was financed broadly 50:50 by a consortium of Irish Banks and others, and by BGE. The bank loans were to be repaid by 1991 and BGE's thereafter.  From 1985 onwards the company encountered serious marketing and costs difficulties which they were not able to rectify.  They seemed unable to get their costs and management structures under control. Mounting debts in the company and failure to pay outstanding sums of many millions of pounds due to BGE for gas forced BGE to put in a receiver in April 1986.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in the costs and operations of Dublin Gas have been achieved during the receivership, but further improvements on the marketing and operations fronts remain necessary if their future is to be assured.  Apart from the fact that the receiver cannot remain in place indefinitely, these improvements are unlikely to be fully achieved while uncertainty about the future remains. That uncertainty effects the customers and the staff of the company.</P>
    <P>In March 1987, following Government decisions designed to safeguard the Dublin Gas Company's customers and employees, BGE submitted a bid for the assets of Dublin Gas, and this has been successful.  With good management we can now ensure that the utility will continue and prosper and that natural gas will be supplied, safely and efficiently, in the city of Dublin to increasing numbers <Col N="3074" /> of satisfied customers.  Much work remains to be done to bring gas distribution in Dublin up to modern technical and commercial standards.  I am confident, however, that BGE will tackle these problems in a thorough manner and that the Government's decision to ensure continued distribution of natural gas in Dublin will be rewarded.</P>
    <P>Here I would wish to make a few points very clear.  I remain convinced that the decision to bring natural gas to Dublin city was the correct one, despite the various traumas we had to endure.  The chosen vehicle, Dublin Gas Company, did not achieve success for a variety of reasons and, in consequence, there was probably no option but to put in a receiver.  The alternatives of liquidation or an uncertain future under a bank receivership were hardly palatable.  The consumers of Dublin Gas would also be put to major expense for other cooking and heating systems, the employees of Dublin Gas would have been hit severly and a large number of small contractors and subcontractors would have been ruined.  On top of all that, a valuable outlet for the sale of our gas would have been lost and GBE's large investment in the infrastructure of Dublin Gas would have gone for nought.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is quite straightforward.  In view of the time constraints, the Bill has been restricted to the absolute minimum necessary to enable the takeover by BGE of the Dublin Gas assets, and to give BGE the powers to carry out the duties and functions involved in the operation of a gas utility.</P>
    <P>There are in essence two aspects to the gas business.  The first part, that which is at present being carried out by GBE, is the transmission of gas at high pressure in reasonably large diameter pipes such as the pipeline which runs from Cork to Dublin.  Then there is the business of gas distribution which is the business of the gas utilities and involves the distribution of the gas generally in low pressure small diameter pipes and its sale to domestic, commercial and industrial customers within a specified area.  To date BGE <Col N="3075" /> have been involved in the distribution business in subsidiary companies such as Cork Gas and now also in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The functions, powers, duties and obligations which are necessary for the purpose of gas distribution are somewhat different from those needed for the business of gas transmission.  While as I mentioned earlier the 1976 Gas Act conferred the right on BGE to distribute gas it did not specify what these rights actually are. The Government have decided that it is appropriate at this time to clarify these rights, duties and obligations and this we propose to do under section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The urgency to enact the Bill arises because it is essential that BGE should complete the assumption of control as soon as possible.  While the receiver has achieved very considerable successes, I am anxious that such a large and important entity should be under normal control and management of an operating company &mdash; in this case BGE.  That will create the necessary confidence and stability among the public at large and the customers and employees of Dublin Gas and that is the only way to enable the business to achieve maximum efficiency and the highest safety standards.</P>
    <P>It is very important for us to clarify the situation here and to specifically confer such powers on BGE.  It is also vital that I do all in my power to secure the safety of the public and property as far as is practicable.  In so doing I would wish to be able to ensure that appropriate standards are adhered to and that the necessary powers exist for BGE, in cases of emergency in particular, to enter and inspect any premises and there to take such measures as BGE consider appropriate for the purposes of ensuring the safety of the public and of property.</P>
    <P>On the question of ensuring proper and safe standards I have seen to it that the implementation of the numerous recommendations of the Cremer and Warner Report are being implemented by Dublin Gas.  Officials of my Department are closely monitoring this and I am assured that good progress is being made.  I am very keen that we should do all in our <Col N="3076" /> power to ensure that the occurrence of accidents such as we have had earlier this year is reduced as much as is humanly possible.  Where new updated procedures are required they should be implemented.  Where new standards of workmanship, reporting, installation of services and the standard of pipe work are needed then these should be implemented.  I recognise that the putting in place of a mains replacement programme will be an expensive undertaking and will need to be phased over a reasonable period of time but there is no way we can or should attempt to avoid this. We must aim to have the best possible standards of performance and safety in the running of this gas utility.  Very good progress has been made by the receiver in this area and I am convinced that similar progress will be maintained and brought to an appropriate conclusion by BGE.  I will be insisting on the highest standards of performance.</P>
    <P>The Gas Act, 1976, which established BGE, set out the board's powers and responsibilities.  The sections dealing with borrowing were amended in 1980 and 1982.  In 1976, of course, BGE were only involved in buying gas from Marathon and delivering it on to NET and the ESB. It was not envisaged that BGE would be directly involved in the retail distribution of gas in towns and, as I said, the 1976 Act did not provide, in sufficiently clear terms, the specific powers necessary for such operations.  This is now being rectified.</P>
    <P>The way this is being tackled it to give BGE powers which have been available to Dublin Gas for many years and which have withstood the test of time.  At the same time I was conscious that the Dublin Gas powers derive from legislation which dates back to the middle of the last century. Rather than make those Acts apply to BGE I am proposing to give effect to the necessary powers by new orders which can be expressed in modern terms and which can be tailored to meet current requirements and concerns.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the order defining the area in which BGE may undertake these functions.  Initially such <Col N="3077" /> an order will relate to the existing Dublin Gas area and later it is likely that similar orders will be necessary for other parts of the country, such as the towns of north County Dublin which will be served when the north eastern pipeline project is undertaken.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the Gas Act, 1976, conferred on the Minister powers in relation to permissions for BGE to construct pipelines. That power will continue to rest with the Minister.  However, in the designated areas for gas distribution it will be within the Minister for Energy's power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to grant a waiver on the need for such permissions in the case of each and every individual pipeline.  It would be quite impracticable to have officials of my Department deciding on each and every small pipeline in a distribution area.  However, the power conferred on me by the 1976 Act will continue in existence in the normal course of BGE's activities, except that from now on such consent for the construction of a pipeline will also require the consent of the Minister for Finance, a provision not in the 1976 Act.  This approach has been decided on by the Government because it is appropriate that the Minister for Finance should have a say in any area where the expenditure of large sums of public money are involved.</P>
    <P>As mentioned above, the Government have considered that it is important that not only the assets of Dublin Gas be transferred to BGE but that BGE can carry out the functions necessary to use these assets.  It is also necessary that the matter of the workforce of Dublin Gas be dealt with, in particular the question of their existing pension fund.  Section 18 of the Gas Act, 1976, deals with the pension fund arrangements for Bord Gáis Éireann and it is appropriate that the existing Dublin Gas pension scheme be brought under this section of the Act. When all the necessary formalities with regard to the pension fund have been completed the Bill provides that the appropriate section of the Bill can be brought into operation by a ministerial order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3078" /> The old private Acts for Dublin Gas in the last century provided for such matters as financing of the company. Dublin Gas are partly financed by debenture stock issued under these Acts.  Some of this debenture stock is irredeemable.  It has a first charge on all the assets of the company.  I am advised that it is not possible to transfer this debenture stock to BGE.  Therefore, the Government have decided that it should be redeemed. While such redemption could have been effected by an order under section 11 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1982, the Government decided that it was more appropriate to deal in the present Bill with all matters relating to this issue.  To that end we have made provision for the receiver of Dublin Gas to redeem this stock and we have also specified the method by which he can redeem it.</P>
    <P>BGE's borrowing will rise by £66 million directly on account of the takeover because of the debts associated with the assets of Dublin Gas.  This amount is inescapable because of the commitment made by the previous Government in a letter dated 22 April 1986 to the banks confirming the position that they had a prior charge on the assets of Dublin Gas and that the Government intended that all amounts due to the banks would be paid in full.</P>
    <P>I have adverted earlier to the reasons for that course of action.  I now expect that these loans will be rescheduled on more favourable terms than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise at this point that the financial reality of this transaction we are debating today, the take-over by Bord Gáis of Dublin Gas is that a nil value is being placed on the assets of Dublin Gas and BGE will only be assuming the guaranteed debts.  This is the best position that can be achieved. The net effect of this is that the only cash outlay by BGE in the transaction will be some £4 million on stamp duty payable to the State.</P>
    <P>To provide for the further future development of the north east pipeline project and essential capital expenditures <Col N="3079" /> in Dublin over the next few years, I propose to increase the borrowing limit by £90 million rather than £66 million to £170 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies should note that, regardless of precedents set by earlier legislation I do not propose to increase the limit on guarantees by the Minister for Finance from its present level of £80 million.  In the present economic climate the Government are most anxious to ensure that borrowings by semi-State bodies can stand on their own feet.</P>
    <P>As has been already agreed by the House it is the intention to include in this debate the Clonmel Gas Order 1987.  The purpose of this order is to establish the new Clonmel Gas Company as a gas undertaking with authority to maintain, continue and expand the existing Clonmel town gas network and to distribute and sell natural gas within the limits of supply as defined in the order &mdash; the Clonmel town area and environs.  Currently, Clonmel Corporation are the gas undertaker in the town under the Clonmel Corporation Act of 1895 and the order provides the vehicle by which the assets, functions and legal authority of the corporation's gas devision are transferred to the new company.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Acts, 1920 to 1982 provide for the making of regulations, orders etc., to oversee the gas industry. The 1920 Act in particular provides for special orders to be made to enable new gas utilities to be constituted.  These orders must be laid in draft before both Houses and their approval given before the orders are made.  This order is similar to that passed in draft form by both Houses in December last and subsequently signed by my predecessor to enable the Limerick Gas Company to commence operations when natural gas became available.  That company are now up and running.</P>
    <P>This procedure has been adopted because the vehicle for carrying out the distribution of natural gas in Clonmel is to be a limited company, similar to that in Limerick, representing a joint venture between BGE and the corporation.  This <Col N="3080" /> company will, accordingly, be a gas undertaker within the meaning of the gas untility legislation and the most appropriate and expedient way of conferring the functions, status, and jurisdiction of the corporation's gas division on the new company is by making this order.</P>
    <P>The new company, Clonmel Gas Company Limited, has already been incorporated and its Memorandum and Articles of Association will be confirmed by me under the Gas Regulation Act of 1982 as soon as this order is made.  The Company are to be owned jointly by Bord Gáis, with 90 per cent of the equity, and by the corporation with the remaining 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the structure of the project for Clonmel was finally reached in December last between BGE and Clonmel Corporation and no time has been lost since in pushing ahead with the project. Construction of the 4.5 kilometer link from the main Cork-Dublin pipeline at Ballyveelish to Clonmel commenced on 12 May last and is now well advanced. It is expected that this work will be completed in a few weeks.  The cost of the construction project for BGE will be approximately £860,000 and the conversion of the Clonmel gas system to use natural gas is scheduled to begin immediately gas is available at the town gate. The conversion project will cost about £840,000 and will be funded also by BGE by way of loan facility to the new company.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,800 domestic customers in Clonmel with annual consumption of 170,000 therms at present and the availability of natural gas will ensure the survival and potential for growth of the distribution industry there. As a clean, efficient and versatile fuel, and competitively priced, natural gas will provide a new impetus for expansion of gas sales in the town.  The projected market for natural gas is 2 million therms by 1997.  It is this sale of natural gas to the domestic markets which enables us to maximise the contribution to the economy of natural gas.</P>
    <P>As usual, considerable amounts of Irish goods and services are being used <Col N="3081" /> on this project and will represent up to 80 per cent of the expenditure on it. Employment during the construction phase has been provided for 20 people and the availability of natural gas in Clonmel means, of course, the assurance of continued employment in the distribution industry with about 50 additional jobs during the conversion programme.  The making of this order clears the way for the new company to begin operations, and I recommend this motion to the House.</P>
    <P>I would now like to return briefly to the Dublin Gas takeover.  I believe it is possible to run an efficient and profitable gas undertaking business in Dublin, operating to the highest standards of safety and efficiency.  I believe that with the proper care and attention, with hard work and concerted effort that BGE can run a successful and profitable gas undertaking in Dublin.  I am also confident that this new venture will have the full, loyal support of the workforce of BGE and Dublin Gas and I have no doubt that it will merit the support of the citizens and business community in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have recognised that the gas distribution network in Dublin is a very important infrastructure that can give premium use for our natural gas.  It is obviously important that the potential of this custom would not be lost by the windup of Dublin Gas.  Therefore this Bill is important legislation that deserves our support.</P>
      <P>However, in agreeing the take-over of the assets of Dublin Gas by Bord Gáis, we must be alive to the danger that many people have aired in the past, that essentially the problems of Dublin Gas could remain unresolved under the much larger and profitable Bord Gáis Éireann and the very effective cash flow into Bord Gáis from their special position of having a very low Marathon price would provide resources that could conceal the real problems that need to be tackled in Dublin Gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I would raise a serious <Col N="3082" /> question with the Minister regarding his proposal for the total integration of Dublin Gas within BGE.  Everyone recognises that the problems of Dublin Gas are far from resolved.  I do believe that this approach to the problem is fraught with danger.  It is important, instead of total integration, that Dublin Gas be set up in such a way that they are operating as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann.  There are, in my view, essentially three options as to the way in which we could approach this problem.  One is the idea of a separate State company altogether, distinct from BGE; the other is, as I say, a subsidiary, the option I favour, and the third is the idea that the Minister is putting forward of a fully integrated operation within BGE.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments to support the view that we should have a subsidiary relationship rather than full integration. First, there is the very simplified argument that the skills required in the task of transmission, which is BGE's expertise, are very different from the skills in distribution and although BGE have had some minor experience in recent years with the Cork Corporation, I would still raise the question as to whether BGE have the established capability to run Dublin Gas and to resolve the problems that remain.  What assessment has the Minister made in regard to that matter?</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the problems in Dublin Gas are not entirely new, that Bord Gáis have themselves been involved on various monitoring committees.  If we are going the road of total integration with all that means in concealing from the public view exactly what is happening financially and otherwise, it is important that we have entirely clear assessments laid before us by the Minister as to the proven capabilities of Bord Gáis.  For instance, what new resources have been brought in to give BGE the capability to tackle this problem?  I would also like to know something of the analysis the Minister has carried out on what went wrong and why the advice given in 1983 has been so terribly wrong in its realisation. There are problems in Dublin Gas and we need to be confident that the <Col N="3083" /> advice we are now getting, that they can be resolved within BGE, is correct.  That is an important aspect of this with which the Minister has not dealt adequately in his speech.  That is the bottom line for the taxpayers.  If we are having what is well known to be a severely loss-making company taken into the maw of BGE, we need to know more about their capability to pull it around.</P>
    <P>In preparing for this debate I was hampered by the fact that Bord Gáis accounts for 1986 were not available to us.  I noticed that in the course of its review the Oireachtas committee commented on this same area and said that at a minimum accounts should be available to the Dáil within six months of the end of the year. I know that technically we have a few days to run but BGE should have made a special effort, when the House was going to debate this, to have those accounts available to us to provide a foundation for our discussion.</P>
    <P>I favour the approach of having a subsidiary rather than total integration because there is a certain benefit in a contractual relationship between the distribution company and the transmission company.  It provides a certain amount of friction, a competitiveness, that is of gain to the consumer in the long run. I am very concerned that the distinct management problems of Dublin Gas which as we know relate to the marketing approach and to the various personnel problems in the company, will be buried in the wider personnel functions and marketing functions of the larger Bord Gáis and that instead of being resolved, because they are now part of a larger personnel, marketing or managing approach by BGE, they might reflect badly on both operations rather than curing the remaining problems.</P>
    <P>The very obvious problem is on the cash side.  Bord Gáis have been set up as an extraordinary profitable company. They profitted in 1985, the last year for which we have accounts available, by £94 million on a turnover of only £2 million which is a massive return on turnover, but that is not a genuine profit.  Bord Gáis <Col N="3084" /> are in effect operating as the collector of royalty on behalf of the people.  This cash rich environment in BGE is one that could easily lend itself to burying the much smaller problems, relatively speaking, of Dublin Gas in BGE.  Dublin Gas has a turnover of only £38 million and it could be lost within an integrated company. At the least there must be a separate transparent account provided for the Dáil to see how Dublin Gas is performing. I understand that this is not what would be involved by the Minister's proposals.  In the 1985 accounts there are no separate returns made for the Cork subsidiary and we are unable to examine what is happening there.  The same will become the case if Dublin Gas is wholly integrated.  The taxpayers will not be able to assess what is happening.  If the taxpayers are being asked to subsidise a loss in Dublin Gas for the foreseeable future, the very minimum is that they should be able to see precisely what is happening. As the Minister recalled in the final comments of his speech, it is possible to run an efficient and profitable gas undertaking in Dublin.  The taxpayers will want to see that that is what is happening.  I hope the Minister will take on board an amendment in that area that would at least allow the taxpayers to see a separate financial return by Bord Gáis in respect of its Dublin operations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the safety aspect, it is not right as is proposed in this that the job of policing safety should be integrated into the company Bord Gáis Éireann.  If we have learned anything from the tragedy of Raglan House it was that under the pressure of day-to-day management of a company, a gas distribution company, safety standards can be and are sacrificed. It is important now that we are setting up a new approach to the running of Dublin Gas that we should take that lesson on board.  For a start it is important that we have new legislation.  The Minister adverted to this but he has not specified anything so we do not know what he has in mind.  In new legislation we need to tighten up the old gas Acts which are in force.  More than that, we need some sort of watchdog or supervisor who would be <Col N="3085" /> independent of the gas company, to look after safety aspects.  With the best will in the world it is unrealistic to expect a gas company to tell us that safety matters have an all-clear when things go wrong. There should be procedures to be overseen by somebody outside the company. I hope the Minister will reconsider on Committee Stage the approach to safety. There should be a supervisor who should organise a periodic audit on safety in the company and he should be independent of the operations.</P>
    <P>Dublin Gas at the moment are undertaking a safety action programme and the Minister said that his Department are closely in touch on this.  It should be agreed to operate a similar safety action programme in this company.  What we need is a supervisor who has the explicit brief of monitoring and keeping this action programme up to date.  It will be equally important that such a supervisor would spot check the work practices being carried out by the company.  We only have to refer back to the Raglan House experience to see how various practices set out, hopelessly fell through when it came to their execution.  There was a failure to properly report the incidence of leak.  There was a failure to carry out appropriate checks.  There is no point in going back over the ground.  There were numerous failures in the way in which agreed practices were executed. Let us be honest, Dublin Gas will be under commercial pressure for a number of years.  We should be alerted by what happened at Raglan House: If practices are to be kept to the highest possible standards there must be someone other than the company with their commercial brief checking that that is being done.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible lack in our present approach to safety that there is no supervisory authority recording the number of leaks.  If we had a public record of the leak experience it would alert us to problems that are emerging, it would give some system of advance warning and, more important, it would give some indication of success in coming to grips with safety problems.  It is well known &mdash; and this was reported by an Oireachtas Committee <Col N="3086" /> who debated Bord Gáis &mdash; that there has been tremendously high leakage problems in the distribution companies. In Cork they reported that 40 per cent of the gas was unaccounted for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it is happening now.  This is a real problem. The experience in that regard was better in Dublin but it still is a serious problem. It is important that we have some public record where we can see openly that progress is being made in these areas so that we and the public know that the problem of leakages is being tackled and overcome. I know that very considerable progress has been made in Cork but we need a public record which will be looked after by somebody other than the company. The question is why did it reach that stage in Cork.  If there was a record one can be sure that that would not have happened.</P>
      <P>The question of supervision and of who should be responsible for it is an open one.  My attitude is that in the first instance the Department should take responsibility.  It need not be expensive and the Department could contract out the required work to various agencies in the public sector without setting up any new gas supervising authority.  There are agencies in the public sector who have expertise in this area and who could easily undertake this function.  If the first duty to supervise is placed on the Department it would be up to them to allocate that job to various State agencies as they saw fit.</P>
      <P>The Minister has allocated the functions of safety to the board but he should also ask that the board report annually on safety.  In this way the board's annual report would deal explicitly with that function and we would see comments from the board on their execution of this new safety responsibility that has been given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the wider issues raised by the Bill with regard to the rational use of natural gas.  There should be proper public appraisal of all proposals to extend the national gas grid.  There is <Col N="3087" /> the danger of an extension of the natural gas grid becoming a politically good thing to do.  Everyone regards it as a benefit to extend the gas grid willy-nilly whereas in reality it is only going to benefit the people close to the line.  If it is going to impose some sort of cost it is the taxpayer at large who suffers.  Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to a published appraisal of any extensions that are proposed in the gas grid.  This would give a more rational and clear policy of what precisely is being done when gas grids are being extended.  It is important that all the assumptions and projections that underlie a proposed extension of the gas grid should be available to public scrutiny and that we have a chance as taxpayers to see that the investment plans of a company like BGE are up to the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>An issue that is going to become more and more important in the coming years and this is raised specifically by the Bill and the proposal for BGE to move into the gas distribution activities &mdash; is that BGE are moving further and further away from their original mandate which was the simple job of transmission of gas to two state operators, NET and the ESB.  Because of the low Marathon price and the low royalty Marathon was paying, BGE became effectively the collector of royalty on behalf of the Irish people on this natural resource.  The amount of profit earned in 1985 was £94 million on a £200 million turnover.  It is effectively a royalty collection exercise being done by BGE.</P>
    <P>I would seriously question whether that is the proper commercial climate for a company like BGE to be operating in as they now embark on new commercial ventures and move away from their initial mandate of gas transmission into the distribution activity.  It is important that all of the decisions taken by Bord Gáis Éireann on investment and supply be divorced from that huge cash flow which is effectively a royalty.  It would be a shame if Bord Gáis found themselves in a position where they were papering over decisions to subsidise in one way or <Col N="3088" /> another because they had this royalty being collected.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide low priced gas to certain industrial users is one that could become seriously unstuck.  By the end of this century, and in reality in about ten years time, the Kinsale gas field will be exhausted and we will have to turn to much higher priced sources of gas.  In that context any decision to supply that involves discounting gas to such an extent that the company who are taking that gas are not paying enough to pay for the replacement cost of gas when we have to move away from Kinsale, effectively means we are walking ourselves into a position whereby in ten years time we are going to have to give those companies subsidies directly from the State &mdash; which I do not think many intend when they say that discounted gas should be provided &mdash; or else we are going to have to pull the plug on them thus leaving the companies who have built up on the expectation of discounted gas no longer having access to it.  We must guard now against such an eventuality.  The lessons of the past prove that if we use a scarce natural resource in a way that it goes to people who cannot afford to pay the commercial value of it &mdash; which for us are the proper costs we would have to pay for imports &mdash; we are misusing a scarce natural resource and we are asking the taxpayer to take less than he is due from that resource.  That is a wrong approach.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister looked at the financial framework within which BGE are operating.  The sensible approach is that the Exchequer should impose a royalty which would grow over time in the next ten years eventually reaching a stage where the effective price BGE were paying for Kinsale gas would be equivalent to the replacement import price they would then have to pay.  This would do a great deal for getting greater transparency into the operation of BGE.  The royalty element which that is collecting on behalf of the taxpayer would be clear. The subsidy, if any, it was giving to loss making operations in the distribution area would be clear and we would have a company like the companies in Belgium <Col N="3089" /> and other countries that are importing natural gas, companies which are running effectively and profitably on a much higher priced gas than the present Marathon price.  We have to be gearing up for the day which will dawn in ten years time when we should not be drawn into making decisions about who would be supplied and at what price they would be supplied as that would undermine the proper framework for developing gas in this country into the next century.  In this context it is very important &mdash; and I am glad to hear the Minister mention it on a number of occasions &mdash; that we sit down and seriously consider the proposal of gas inter-connector.  The Minister should do a serious cost benefit analysis of that project at this stage.  That analysis so far as possible, and as soon as possible, should be available for public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I feel there will not be an upsurge in exploration activity for a new gas source in Ireland, which of course would be the optimum outcome if there is not a prospective market for a new discovery until the year 1999 or 2000.  If we want to have a spur to exploration of gas it is not on the route of large concessions or terms. It is essentially the route of clarifying the gas price that a new explorer would get if he found gas and providing some mechanisms whereby if something is discovered early that there will be the opportunity for export.  I would like to see the proposed inter-connector, which the Minister has mentioned on a number of occasions, properly teased out with some research into the pros and cons at an early stage so that we would be in a position to make a decision on it.  That I believe would be the most effective spur to improving exploration for gas.  There are a number of other smaller items which will come up and I do not want to delay the House as there may be other speakers who wish to contribute but we will have the opportunity to discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is providing a waiver of the requirements to get special permission for projects for small piping activity by Dublin Gas.  That is only as <Col N="3090" /> it should be.  He should go further and extend that waiver to the operations of BGE where their proposed activities are below a certain figure.  There is a problem in having to go to the Minister and his Department for sanction for smaller items of investment by BGE which probably are ordinary commercial operations of the company.  Perhaps he would look at whether there would be some sense in having a similar waiver for BGE's proposed activities where they fall below a certain figure; that he would reserve unto himself, as it should be, the right to examine the larger expenditure items which would be involved.  He should not ask BGE to come for sanction every time any more than he expects Dublin Gas to come every time they decide to replace some piping.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that matter &mdash; I know it relates to the wider issue of BGE but I think it is important.  I note that the Minister is also extending the board membership.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to give us some assurances on the high quality of the people he will be adding to the board.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a necessary measure to bring to an end the saga which unfortunately has been going on in Dublin Gas for a considerable number of years and it seems to be the only way of dealing with that unfortunate situation. The distribution and sale of gas in Dublin can hopefully be safely continued by the enactment of this Bill.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;safely&rdquo; because it is a very important aspect of this whole matter and there is great public concern about it and it is being referred to continually.  If this Bill is enacted it is hoped it will have the effect of restoring the confidence of gas consumers in the ability of the newly structured company to function properly and also to restore public confidence generally in the gas distribution system in Dublin to the extent that the market for gas will expand through additional demand from domestic, commercial and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the purpose of this Bill is to effectively enable Bord Gáis Éireann to take over the assets of Dublin Gas and the control of the operations of the company which, as we all know, has been held in low esteem in recent years. The company went into receivership in April 1986.  The mismanagement of the company in latter years, I would suggest, has become quite legendary.  The number of holes we see in the streets of Dublin are a daily topic.  There is great concern as to why such a large number of openings on public roads have got to be made.  This is something I would hope to come back to later when I speak at greater length about the safety aspects of the existing gas networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety aspect of the distribution has been in the public mind as a result of recent accidents at Raglan House, Dolphin House and also the events which occurred at Nicholas Street.  It is against this background that Bord Gáis Éireann will now be looked to to turn that situation around and get on with the safe <Col N="3092" /> and effective management of this public gas utility.  To enable this happen the Bill provides under section 6 for an amendment to section 23 of the Principal Act which allows an increase in the limit of capital borrowings of Bord Gáis Éireann from an existing level of £80 million to £170 million.  This additional £90 million is necessary in order to enable Bord Gáis Éireann to take over the assets of Dublin Gas Company and have it properly funded to enable them to expand and carry out the necessary improvement to the gas pipe network in the coming years. This represents an increase in the borrowing capacity of something in the order of 112 per cent.</P>
    <P>What are the assets of the gas company? How does it justify this kind of a price tag and an increase of such an amount in its borrowing capacity?  More important, it should be asked what are the liabilities and the potential ongoing liabilities of the Dublin Gas Company? These liabilities have to be looked at and we need a great deal more information on them.  I presume the assets that An Bord Gáis Éireann are buying are effectively the contract they have with the Dublin Gas Company, which will be now a contract with itself, to purchase natural gas and to distribute it on behalf of the Dublin Gas Company.  As I mentioned earlier, it will also inherit the pipe network which appears to be in need of constant repair.  Bord Gáis Éireann will also be taking over the consumers who were formerly customers of the Dublin Gas Company.  These are the assets together with whatever liabilities existed. I understand they were in the region of £60 million and were guaranteed by the State through letters of comfort which were given to the various banks.  We now understand that a sum in the order of £60 million has to be made available through an increase in borrowing capacity for a company which in November 1983 was valued at just over £1 million on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  Presumably the company had some borrowings at that time, but those borrowings would not be anything as substantial as the borrowings the company have today.  These figures <Col N="3093" /> speak for themselves and are an indictment of the management of the Gas Company, particularly from 1983 onwards.</P>
    <P>The main objective of this Bill is not so much to justify the figure which is being put on the assets of the company but to ensure that the long suffering consumers will be given an efficient, safe and cost effective service.  I have some reservations as to whether this will be the case and I would like to deal with that by putting down some amendments on Committee Stage.  The point made by Deputy Bruton in relation to the structure of the proposed takeover is important. Bord Gáis Éireann should look at the operation of the Dublin Gas Company in the form of a subsidiary as distinct from taking it over entirely and subsuming it into Bord Gáis Éireann entirely.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the safe distribution of gas through the Dublin network is of primary importance and Bord Gáis Éireann will now be charged with the responsibility for ensuring that all of the recommendations in the Cremer and Warner report in so far as they relate to Dublin Gas are fully implemented.  The present management of Dublin Gas have made a start in fulfilling their obligations in this area.  Work practices and procedures in line with the recommendations of Cremer and Warner have been implemented.  I hope this aspect of the company management will be pursued with even greater vigour on completion of the takeover by Bord Gáis Éireann, the primary objective of which is to put the whole thing on a proper footing and restore confidence generally, and particularly in Dublin, in the gas industry.</P>
    <P>The Government task force set up after the publication of the Cremer and Warner report have been carrying on their work for some months.  I recall that the Minister for the Environment told the Dáil some weeks ago he expected the task force to issue their report in July. The main function of that task force was to identify all potentially vulnerable multi-storey buildings throughout the country which were liable to suffer from <Col N="3094" /> progressive collapse and consequently would be at great risk if subjected to an explosion from a gas source, an internal explosion.  On the same occasion the Minister told the Dáil that he did not intend enacting the new building regulations until the task force had reported on their investigations into the vulnerability of existing multi-storey buildings. Why do we have to wait so long for the implementation of these new building regulations?  They have been on the stocks for nearly 11 years.  They were first drafted in 1976.  There is absolutely no reason why we have to await the report of the task force on this matter.  They should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the condition of the pipe network in Dublin.  There are many problems associated with the underground pipe network.  This has been the subject of much public comment and concern and vast amounts of money are being spent each day on leak investigations and repairs.  Could I ask the Minister are there any financial projections available as to the overall ongoing cost of these operations and the extent of these repair and pipe replacement programmes? Will the State have to continuously fork out money for these programmes, or is there an end in sight to this problem?  What additional financial commitments will Bord Gáis Éireann be storing up by now undertaking responsibility for repairs to the Dublin pipe network? I would like the Minister to quantify this if he would.  I note that new techniques have been developed for repairing defective old pipes such as the insertion of plastic sleeves and I am sure these repair techniques are effective both from the point of view of preventing leaks and the cost involved.  I trust that new developments like this will have a major impact in bringing down repair costs.</P>
    <P>Have the current leak problems any bearing on the changeover from manufactured gas to natural gas?  As I mentioned before in this House, natural gas is a dry, lighter gas than the old manufactured town gas, which is moist and heavier.  There is a substantial body of <Col N="3095" /> opinion that suggests that it is much more leak prone than the older form of gas. This matter needs to be cleared up.  The level of leaks reported for repair has increased greatly since our conversion to natural gas.  The Cremer and Warner report concluded that there was no evidence that the conversion to natural gas, or leaks from joints, contributed to the accidents it investigated, but that those accidents were in fact caused by fractures and, in any event, the same conclusions cannot be applied to all other leaks in the pipe network throughout Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to my question on 27 May said he expected to have a report in June from the Dutch consultancy company which had been carrying out an investigation into the long term pipe replacement and repair programme required for the pipe network in Dublin and, I believe, in other locations as well. Has the Minister received this report and, if so, what are its findings?  The urgent publication of this report, particularly if it categorically states that conversion to natural gas has not given rise to additional leaks in the existing pipe network, would be very welcome.  It would be very welcome indeed if such confirmation were received and would do a great deal to restore confidence in the gas system.  I urge the Minister to clear up the understandable doubts many people have at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with continuity of supply, which Deputy Bruton referred to in his contribution.  At the present rate of depletion, natural gas from the Kinsale Head gas field will be completely exhausted by the late nineties.  As we know massive amounts of money have been spent in converting appliances and improving the underground pipe network facilities for the distribution of natural gas.  This investment will be rendered useless effectively if long term supplies are not available and assured.  We really need further Irish gas discoveries and the only way in which that can be brought about, as Deputy Bruton said, is if as an incentive to the exploration industry we put an interconnector into the UK which <Col N="3096" /> would tie us into the European grid.  This would undoubtedly be an incentive to the exploration industry to go out and investigate the prospects of finding gas in the Celtic Sea.  If we had an inter-connector the exploration industry should be given an assurance that if we found a gas field which was far surplus to our needs, they would have permission to export that gas.  The fact that we would be plugged into the European grid would ensure our long term supply of gas because the supplies available in the European grid will be there for the next 60 years.  I support the points Deputy Bruton made in that respect.  I hope to deal with certain aspects of this Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>The safety aspect of gas worries me as it does other speakers.  Recently about 3,000 holes were dug in the Dublin Corporation area.  Apart from finding leaks they must have found something else if they dug 3,000 of them.  Maybe the reason is being kept a great secret from us.  There was an unfortunate, tragic death in Clonmel due to a gas explosion in the early seventies.  The old pipe <Col N="3097" /> system was of no use.  I am happy that the new system coming into the town will be safer and much better for the industrial atmosphere apart from the domestic atmosphere there.  The ailing old Gas company were not able to continue satisfactorily. The connection of Ballyveelish into Clonmel town is almost complete.</P>
    <P>In that regard let me say that BGE have done a wonderful job all over this country in the restoration of the lands and roadways after the installation of the gas pipes.  We often hear criticism of companies, but BGE must be complimented on that.  That is good for public relations. Good work was done on the gas pipeline from Dublin to Cork and the spurs to Limerick and Waterford.  When the route of the spur from Ballyveelish into Clonmel is restored we will be happy that it will be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Clonmel is the most industrially based town in County Tipperary and the people there are extremely happy to get the new gas.  Perhaps contrary to what other Members have said, I hope consideration will be given to keeping the price constant and that there will be no price escalation in that area.  The adaptation industry has to make for taking on gas must be taken into consideration in these hard times when money is not freely available.</P>
    <P>Perhaps BGE will look at the system of either funding or guaranteeing loans to some of the school authorities who may consider converting to gas.  In view of the need for savings in this area that would be very welcome.  BGE have made profits in this area already, and they might consider over a period of some years giving some support to the vocational school in Clonmel and to the other girls' and boys' secondary schools there and providing them with a cheaper system of heating.  I hope that the advent of gas into the town will ensure the continuation of industry there and increased employment and that the 20 people who are employed by the old gas company can be kept in continued employment. Sometimes we forget the work that was done by people during many years with an old, inefficient system.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an expansion of the <Col N="3098" /> Gas company.  I look forward to cleaner air.  I am delighted that the heavy industries which were using heavy duty oils such as Merck Sharp and Dohme (Ireland) Ltd. are turning to the use of gas.</P>
    <P>This new fuel will be of tremendous value to the Suir Valley in ensuring pure air there.  This is important not just for the commercial aspect but the environmental aspect also.  I would like the Minister to come to this area to meet some of the industrialists who may wish to talk to him about it.  I thank him and his predecessors for the interest they have shown in Clonmel in this regard.  I hope Deputy Bruton's comment on side spurs does not imply that the big industrial towns are to be considered as minorities in view of Dublin's size.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Clonmel Gas Order is to continue development in Limerick of the joint venture scheme with the corporation in Clonmel. This Bill under discussion is to allow the takeover of Dublin Gas by Bord Gáis Éireann and to give them the necessary power to run the Dublin Gas networks. It increases the borrowing level for BGE from £80 million to £170 million.  That is significant.  It provides for an increase from six to eight in the number of members on the board.  The Bill allows BGE to take over the administration of the existing Dublin Gas Company pension fund.</P>
      <P>The essence of the Bill is that one of the most efficient State companies ever established, BGE, who between 1881 and 1985 made accumulated profits of £304 million, is being asked to take over one of the most incompetent and inefficient privately owned companies, Dublin Gas, one of the worst ever inflicted on the Irish people.  We have seen hundreds of incompetent and inefficient companies closing down over the years.  Dublin Gas, despite massive State subsidies, still managed to make accumulated losses of almost £20 million between 1981 and 1984 and that was before the real crisis set in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine the comments in this <Col N="3099" /> House if Dublin Gas were a State company, the howls that would have emanated from the Progressive Democrats and from Fine Gael about how this would have illustrated the inherent inefficiency of the State sector.  They would claim it should be privatised to ensure that it was run efficiently.  Privatisation is the great cry of the right wing at the moment.  It is supposed to mean efficiency but that is not so.  I am sure this Bill and what it contains must be sticking in the throats of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, to have to propose that a private company should be nationalised. Because of its total inefficiency and mismanagement, as Deputy O'Malley clearly pointed out it has to be taken over by the State.  The creeping socialism those Deputies talk about, as it there was any creeping socialism, when the State has to take over private companies is still continuing today.  The State has to take over when the private entrepreneurs who are supposed to exist totally fail to provide a service to the people.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the decision to take over Dublin Gas clearly shows that the concept of State enterprise as far as conservative parties are concerned is simply one of fire brigade action.  In the thirties the State and the taxpayers had to step in to rescue the people from the incompetent privately-owned transport companies. The State established BGE at an enormous cost to the taxpayers.  Those taxpayers are now being asked again to rescue the people from the incompetence and mismanagement of those who, through their greed and avarice, brought the gas distribution network in Dublin to its present disastrous level.</P>
    <P>Even before the crisis in Dublin Gas came to a head in the past few years, the incompetence and inefficiency of the company was legendary among consumers. I recall that it often took months to deal with the simplest repairs and defects.  People talk about An Post and Bord Telecom but there were constant complaints from consumers in regard to billing procedures in Dublin Gas.  No <Col N="3100" /> work whatever was done on the replacement of pipes.  There was no planned renewal programme or maintenance programme and the gas network, much of which has been in existence since the early years of this century, was allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that disasters have been occurring almost monthly in the past 12 months, in particular the disaster at Raglan House and Dolphin House.  Nobody seems to be quite sure how much Dublin Gas have already cost the Exchequer and the taxpayers or how much this takeover will cost.  I doubt if we will be told the full details of the cost.</P>

      <P>There is a considerable amount of information in the speech but it does not give all the information. The former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, indicated in September 1986 that the total cost of Dublin Gas to the Exchequer at that stage was about £124 million.  Various figures have been given as to what this take-over will cost and the figure of £66 million was mentioned.  The fact that borrowing by Bord Gáis Éireann is being increased from £80 million to £170 million suggests that the figure will be substantially higher than that.</P>

      <P>Everything is answered in the speech.  I read the Minister's speech, apart from listening to bits and pieces of it, and all the points are not answered in it.  I imagine that most of the money is going to the banks.  We believe the shareholders, the directors and the banks should not get anything from the taxpayers.  Dublin Gas, as a commercial company, is absolutely worthless.  If they were a normal commercial company that could be left to their own devices and not one for which the State had responsibility, the shareholders and the banks would have got nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>The shareholders are not getting anything.  I would like the <Col N="3101" /> Deputy to be accurate.  It has been clarified that the assets are nil and the shareholders are getting nothing.  The Deputy should not misrepresent the position.</P>

      <P>I will not misrepresent it because it is not a serious point.  The value of the shareholdings at the end of 1983 was only £1.6 million but the banks were asking for £66 million.  It is a relatively minor point.</P>

      <P>In the case of a normal commercial company left to their own devices, no-one would have got anything. Many of the former directors who must bear direct responsibility for the whole chapter of disasters have been rewarded for their efforts with extraordinarily generous pension schemes. One of the directors, Mr. McAleese, received a pension of £35,000 a year out of a pension fund of £600,000.  The banks are fully protected for their investment of £66 million.  The real losers are the consumers and the taxpayers.  The record of the asset strippers and the cowboys who sat on the board of Dublin Gas shows they have been so irresponsible, incompetent and reckless that they should not get one penny in compensation.  Indeed, the case was made that they should be held personally responsible for the debts of Dublin Gas and should be pursued for the money.  In 1983, just before losses increased from £2.8 million to £8 million, the 14 directors increased their own remuneration by 75 per cent, from £106,000 to £186,000.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister.  Actually I am talking to both sides of the House.  However, the Ministers responsible for Energy, since the blame to date lies on this side of the House.  The catalogue of commercial mismanagement of the company has certainly been matched by the ineptness of the supervision at political level of Dublin Gas by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments, and Ministers responsible for energy, since the late seventies must accept their fair share of the blame for the disastrous development which has led to this Bill.  If the Government had moved to take over the company earlier much of the present difficulties and financial commitments might have been avoided.  The Workers' Party have continuously pressed for the nationalisation of Dublin Gas.  Successive Governments refused to accept that idea and continued to pour good money after bad into the bottomless pit of Dublin Gas.  The objection to nationalisation of Dublin Gas &mdash; if the Minister would prefer that I should avoid using that word I will substitute the words &ldquo;the takeover of Dublin Gas&rdquo;&mdash; seem to have been an ideological one.  To avoid that a series of disastrous decisions were made by the outgoing Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted.  At the outset I should have said that I am giving full backing to the Bill.  One of the ironies about this is that the company who will possibly end up costing the taxpayer in the region of £200 million &mdash; taking into account what has gone and what remains to be paid &mdash; could have been acquired on the open market, certainly a majority shareholding of it, for as little as £1 million in 1983.  Instead the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition decided in 1983 to underwrite more than £100 million for a private company which had a record of gross mismanagement without insisting on any real control over the management of that company.  The State has now to pick up the tab for all the debts <Col N="3103" /> incurred by Dublin Gas and not just those associated with the conversion programme.</P>
      <P>The assurances given by various Coalition Ministers in 1983 and 1984 proved to be as worthless as a share in Dublin Gas.  In April 1984 when I urged public ownership of the company the former Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, told me that the interests of the taxpayer would be well protected by the appointment of four State directors and by the interest which the State has taken up in Dublin Gas.  There are not many taxpayers who would consider that that promise has been honoured since then. It is important to ensure now that Bord Gáis Éireann are not dragged down by the burden of taking over the Dublin Gas mess.  There may now be an argument for developing Bord Gáis Éireann into a national gas authority with sole responsibility for the sale and distribution of all piped gas to domestic and commercial users and for ensuring that natural gas is used in the most effective way possible for the creation of industrial jobs.  Dublin Gas is only part of the problem.  The involvement of private enterprise in the sale and distribution of piped gas has over many years been characterised by bungling and incompetence.  An Bord Gáis have already had to move in to take over a number of private gas companies. They have taken over, for instance, Cork Gas and, as mentioned at the outset, had to set up a joint venture with Limerick Corporation and in Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of the Dublin Gas Company in the conversion programme to natural gas has been abysmal.  The State company, An Bord Gáis, have on the other hand worked very well, made a major contribution to State funds and handled the construction of the Dublin-Cork pipeline which was completed on budget and ahead of schedule with considerable efficiency.  Natural gas is far too valuable a national resource to be left to the cowboys of private profit who made such a mess of Dublin Gas.  Given the Government's decision to nationalise Dublin Gas there is no reason a national <Col N="3104" /> gas authority should not be established to have sole responsibility for selling and distributing natural gas.  Such a natural gas authority should have the same responsibility for gas as the ESB have for electricity.  An Bord Gáis have performed well but their terms of reference are rather limited.  An Bord Gáis could be developed to constitute the national gas authority or a separate authority could be established to work with them.</P>
    <P>A major priority for the new authority should be the use of natural gas to create jobs.  Our natural gas supplies have not been used to their full potential for industrial development and it would be unfortunate if this valuable natural resource was used simply to boil kettles rather than create jobs.  In particular the gas that had been earmarked for export to Northern Ireland, which is not being taken up, should be used for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>We cannot discuss Dublin Gas without referring to the disgraceful state of Dublin's streets, the proliferation of holes in the street.  I understand that at the last count there were more than 3,000 holes.  That number is increasing.  Apart from the inconvenience to the public that those holes are causing they also cost a huge amount of money to the Exchequer through higher fuel consumption, damage to CIE buses, traffic hold-ups and a general loss of production because employees have difficulty getting to work.  They have also caused accidents as a result of people cycling or driving through them.  There is much evidence to suggest that the rush to lay off people last year resulted in a serious deterioration in safety standards in the company.  Some of the staff with the greatest expertise to deal with the problems that are occurring daily were laid off.  Highly experienced tradesmen, gas operatives, joiners and so on were laid off and people who knew nothing about the job were asked to do their work at half the rate of pay.  Considering the end result of that move I believe it was bad economics on the part of the company to lay off their best staff. Shortage of staff has led to a delay in filing in holes and the completing of jobs <Col N="3105" /> in a competent way.  The position has been made worse by the use of British repair crews being hired to do the work, people who do not know Dublin City or the gas network.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister power to make such conditions as he thinks desirable in relation to the construction, maintenance, repair and replacement of pipelines.  That is an important provision provided it does not end up with the Minister having power to interfere on a day to day basis in the operation of the company.  It is important that the Minister should have power to make such conditions but I suggest that it should be amended to specifically include the power to set deadlines for the completion of work, the filling in of holes and so on in Dublin City.  I will be considering tabling an amendment along those lines for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the last six months I asked a number of questions in the House in regard to Dublin Gas and Bord Gáis Éireann but I did not get a satisfactory reply.  I am anxious to get information about the amount Bord Gáis pay Marathon for the gas.  I am told that is a secret.  I was informed about the amount the ESB pay Bord Gáis Éireann for natural gas, 24p per therm but I have not been told how much NET pay for the gas, that is a commercial secret.  I hope the Minister will give us some idea of how much BGE pay Marathon, how much Dublin Gas paid BGE for gas and how much NET pay for gas.  We were never given that information.  That is very important in understanding how much Dublin Gas was costing the taxpayer and the Exchequer because any loss to Bord Gáis Éireann is a loss to the Exchequer.  State companies, unlike private companies, hand over all their profits to the Exchequer and Bord Gáis Éireann have been a great contributor to Exchequer funding, thereby saving the taxpayer money and contributing to the better running of the State.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to support this Bill.  I am only sorry it has come so late and cost the taxpayer and the Exchequer so much to try to shore up this totally incompetent <Col N="3106" /> company over the past number of years. We poured money into this company unnecessarily.  The steps being taken now by the Minister should have been taken three or four years ago by the outgoing Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome this legislation.  Listening to the last speaker one got the feeling that previously the Gas Company provided little or no service to the citizens of Dublin.  I would be saddened if the House adopted that attitude because this company provided a great service in the past. Like many other companies in this city they have been overtaken by time and new developments as well as the massive change which has taken place in the demands of ailing industry.  Therefore, it is not a question of condemnation of an industry which served developing Dublin at a time when the price of gas was far lower than the price of alternative fuels. It would be wrong not to lay some of the blame for this debacle on the fact that the pace of change which was necessary did not happen fast enough.  To pick out the Gas Company for special mention in this way could be misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to safety in this city. Many of the 130,000 gas consumers live in fear of a dangerous explosion.  I had the opportunity to visit two areas where there were explosions &mdash; Raglan House and Nicholas Street.  I heard the explosions in both instances because I live and work quite close by.  When I visited these devastated sites I was reminded of bombed areas.  It is important to realise the emergency forces &mdash; Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board and the Gas Company &mdash; came together very quickly and worked efficiently and effectively with the mop up arrangements.  I say this with a degree of reluctance, but it is not unreasonable to assume that more explosions will take place in Dublin city.  That must be recognised by everyone.  In a few moments I <Col N="3107" /> will mention the steps which could be taken to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>When there is an explosion the real hardship is that people are displaced from their homes.  The Minister will appreciate this because there have been, and still are, many meetings taking place about the Raglan House explosion.  We had a deputation with the Minister last week and we also met the city manager because we wanted to do something to alleviate the difficulties under which these people are living.  Soon after the explosion it was said that the problem had been cleared up very quickly, that the people were given alternative accommodation and that they could now go back to their apartments which were safe for occupation. The reality is that at present there is a complete impasse because the developer will not fill in the caverns under the apartment blocks or ventilate them in accordance with the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.  No matter what action the residents attempt to take the developer will not abide by the recommendations of this report.  It will probably be the recommendation in the task force report &mdash; which I believe will be issued on 20 July &mdash; which will force the developer to do something about this.</P>
    <P>It may not be realised that all our old flat developments have caverns below street level and when gas piping becomes eroded or needs sealing at the joints, gas can leak into the street and then under the apartments.  This can be a veritable time bomb if the pressure builds up because it can lead to an explosion.  I know there has been a mad scramble on behalf of the Gas Company to try to seal as many of these pipes as possible, but it is a race against time.  I do not believe it is possible to repair the vast numbers of pipes which can potentially do damage. One could cynically say that at the moment modern Dublin is more like medieval Dublin with all the potholes. Coming into the millennium year it will be an absolute disgrace if there is not a crash programme to improve the footpaths and fill in the potholes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3108" /> It should be mandatory that all these caverns be ventilated.  Anyone in his right mind would realise that if there is a void under an apartment block, gas can leak into it and so be a potential danger.  It is essential that such a void be ventilated. This is not an expensive exercise.  It may be more expensive to fill the void because in the case of Raglan House that figure was about £56,000, but it is less expensive to ventilate.  There should be an alarm system.  Sophisticated gas alarms like smoke alarms are now available.  It is possible to set up an alarm system for leaking gas instead of depending on phone calls and reports to the company asking them to send out people to sniff out these problems and then have to dig up roads.  As a first move, homes should be equipped with these alarm systems. Some kind of educational programme should be undertaken through the Minister's office to alert people to the steps they can take.</P>
    <P>As I said at the commencement of my contribution, people are afraid to go into their homes.  In Nicholas Street, just after the explosion, the residents said they would not go back until the voids were ventilated and until they could be given an absolute guarantee that they would not be put in the awful situation of an explosion taking place again.  The Minister cannot give such guarantees and there is no point in being emotive about it.  However, there should be an alarm system all over the city.  I would not expect the State to provide it, after all people buy house alarms to protect them against burglary and so on and this would be an extension to protect themselves against this awful risk.</P>
    <P>In regard to flats, a system should be written into legislation which will bind developers to complying fully with the by-laws and not to take short cuts by having apartments with unventilated voids.  Regrettably, in the case of Raglan House, the application to build was not fully in accordance with Dublin Corporation by-laws, which is a disgrace. Many of these residents are hard pressed financially as they are old age pensioners. Some people are under the impression <Col N="3109" /> that they are wealthy enough to be able to seek alternative accommodation but they are literally living from day to day and are not able to go back to the Ballsbridge complex because of the potential from the voids not being filled.</P>
    <P>The map of the area shows that the pipes leading along the railway are also in a dangerous state, they could again leak and gas could seep back into the caverns.  People should not be expected to return to that development until the developer &mdash; in this case Holland Lansdowne Developments &mdash; carries out this needed work.  A recent engineer's report stated that there were exaggerated fears about the safety of some apartments and that it would cause many problems if they had to be pulled down.  It might be possible to get over this impasse by having the voids filled without admission of liability.  In many cases this would free the developer of the possibility of actions being taken against him whereas at present if he filled the voids it could be wrongly interpreted as an admission of liability.  In this case, the residents concerned are quite prepared to go along that line as they just want to get back to their homes.  Six months have passed and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>In Nicholas Street some of the residents are back in their homes but much of the property is still boarded up.  The main emphasis of any expansion of natural gas &mdash; this great product and resource which is for sale &mdash; must be on safety. However, there is a widespread feeling that the product is not safe, that the previous type of gas on sale throughout the city had the effect of self sealing many of the pipes and the connections which acted as an extra liner.  It is felt that the clean gas has the opposite effect and tends to be a corrosive element, breaking down the sealing effect of the previous gas. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that because, if such information is not accurate, it will be necessary to dispel such fears.  There is a feeling that the network and some of the older piping are breaking down because they were not built to cope with the new gas system.</P>
    <P>The use of natural gas is a marvellous <Col N="3110" /> way of cutting down on the very high sulphide dioxide levels and is a better balance for an alternative fuel to high bitumenous coal with a high smoke and sulphur dioxide content.  On environmental and health grounds it is a very desirable product to sell but it must be safe.  There should be a progression into this type of fuel with an inbuilt safety factor, especially in regard to the type of pipes used.  There is a huge and daunting task ahead of us in providing gas as an alternative system of fuel.  I should like to see natural gas used all over the country but it must be developed with the very best technology and shortcuts cannot be taken.  The piping and alert systems must be second to none.  I stress that we must not allow any developer to take short cuts and, in cases where by-laws have been breached, we must force developers to right the wrongs.  After all, the consumer should come first.</P>
    <P>The industry will expand at an accelerating rate into the close of this century if we provide a safe product and put maximum research into the transitional changeover.  I welcome the legislation.</P>

    <P>Buried beneath that sentence is indeed a long saga and a great story.  I would not want to depart from the spirit of nonrecrimination which has characterised the contributions so far.  However, if the Minister chose to make such a remark it was incumbent upon him to give the House at least some details of the financial history and the different forms, incarnations if you like, of Dublin Gas.  I find it very interesting and welcome to note the conversion to the advantage of public ownership which is taking place in the larger parties.  It is reminiscent of the generous speeches made in those days when people accepted the need for public utilities, the responsibilities of public utilities, the accountability they provided to the public in terms of safety, which is mentioned so often, in terms of regular provision, in terms of delivering a product to the consumer.  This was not the thinking, I recall, in the days when it was likely that profits could be made from the delivery of what was a natural asset owned by the people to a private company on to what was acknowledged in the Minister's speech as a lucrative market in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>That history, which has not been told by the Minister, would have emphasised that phase in the history of the exploitation and delivering of natural gas which had all the hubris of speculative activities associated with it, indeed more at that time in the newspapers.  One newspaper has been discovering oil and gas practically every week consistently now for seven years.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, at that time the movement in the shares of Dublin Gas, the special general meetings that were held and so forth took a great deal of precedence over any questions of safety, of consumer satisfaction, of appropriate development, of changes in required building standards and so forth.  It is very <Col N="3112" /> important that we should not forget that. I welcome any time when the State's ability to organise the development and delivery of a service like this is recognised, as it is in the legislation which is now making this transition.</P>
    <P>I intend to use only a few minutes and to be very specific about the further development of this company.  I note that the Minister quotes the details of a letter from the previous Government to the banks.  I find this phrase &ldquo;to the banks&rdquo; unsatisfactory.  The different bank investors should be identified.  If one is going to take a letter &mdash; and I do not know the status of this letter and should be glad to be guided about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the status of it is what interests me.  I have in mind the kind of commitment which this letter indicated in terms of the commitment which other investors and creditors at that time enjoyed.  This matter was never satisfactorily resolved, as far as I am concerned. There are several possible constructions that could be put on the activities of all of us who had invested in the company and how they sought to resolve what was for them a particular dilemma.  I note, in fairness to the Minister, that he stated:</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise at this point that the financial reality of this transaction is that nil value is being placed on the assets of Dublin Gas and BGE will only be assuming the guaranteed debts. This is the best position that can be achieved. </P>
      <P>Quite frankly, the operation of the company in this period was very unsatisfactory from a public accountability point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make my own position perfectly clear on that.  One of the advantages, not much heralded, I might say, by the people who write about such things, about public ownership and public operation and so forth is that there is far <Col N="3113" /> greater public accountability of the best kind in relation to financial movements. Let us be perfectly clear here.  We are now in a situation in which the Government in relation to other matters, the development of the meat industry and so forth, are responding to proposals made many years ago by the Allied Irish Investment Bank and others in relation to future relationships and so forth and I hope that the accountability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, there was a great deal of public cloud around the whole question of who was investing in Dublin Gas, who was providing money, what was the status of different creditors and so forth. I read the Minister's speech and listened to it with even more care and find myself having to ask a question because, perhaps, it is buried somewhere by allusion in it &mdash; the question of the transfer of the rights of workers under the existing company to the new company.  This has not been a simple transition.  There have been different models available for the take-over of different companies.  I should have preferred if I could have heard this afternoon a more specific commitment in terms of not only their existing rights as they stand while they are workers but in relation to pensions and so forth.  I cannot find it in the Bill in terms of specific guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a specific section on pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not specific. There is a section.  I am aware of identified sections but I am also aware of the subtlety of language.  I am also aware that workers are usually the victims of subtlety and that investors, the kind of people who have been involved before, are the beneficiaries of subtlety.  That is the history of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of other little questions that are equally unsubtle.  I agree with the previous speaker who mentioned <Col N="3114" /> the question of the adaptation for the development of the lucrative markets that have been identified.  I wish BGE and their workers and management well. I wish everybody well in the development of this asset.  What I find very interesting is in relation to the question of liability, which is not addressed in the Minister's speech and is not addressed very adequately in the Bill.  Perhaps it cannot be addressed.  Everybody knows that there is a 90 per cent majority in this House against any constitutional change which would have changed the immunity which developers enjoy in relation to many of the consequences of their actions in terms of the structure of buildings, in relation to the adaptation of buildings and to the future provisions of buildings in compliance with certain standards. The Minister would have my support if amending legislation were to come before this House &mdash; or his colleague, the Minister for Optimism if he wants to bring in legislation changing the liability and obligations of builders and developers in this regard.  This point was adverted to by the previous speaker, Deputy Brady.  One should support the extension of the borrowing limit.</P>
    <P>When we are seeking legislation like this we should do three things.  We should acknowledge the superiority of there being a public company with accountability. Secondly, we should come clean about the unsavoury involvement and financial history in some respects.  Finally, we should in so far as we can, allay fears in relation to usage.  Above all else we should be concrete in regard to guarantees given to the workforce in such transitional arrangements.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because anything that increases public confidence in our gas system after the problems we have had in Dublin over the last few months is to be welcomed.  This Bill gives Bord Gáis Éireann the powers the Dublin Gas Company had.  It is in effect dealing with what has already happened, the takeover by Bord Gáis Éireann of the assets of Dublin Gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister <Col N="3115" /> extension of the gas pipeline and the grid northwards to County Louth.  This Bill expands the ambit of Bord Gáis Éireann. Will the Minister bring in legislation in relation to this aspect?  The Bill defines the areas over which Bord Gáis Éireann can have power.  Will the Minister bring in an order in relation to the extension of the pipeline northwards to Dundalk and Drogheda?  I understand that the planning of this scheme is well under way and that it is hoped to finish it in 1988.  This project will give a number of jobs in the area.  The Minister suggested that somewhere in the region of 225 jobs will be created in the construction of the project. The pipeline will be diverted north of Dublin to take in the horticultural areas and this is to be welcomed.  Dundalk is a large town with many problems. The gas company there have subscribers of the order of 1,700 both commercial and domestic.  The extension of the pipeline to that area will help; it will increase the infrastructure and hopefully it will increase industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill increases the powers of BGE in relation to safety.  Will these provisions extend to areas where the pipeline has been extended?  The Minister mentioned that there would be an extension or an outlet across the Irish Sea to Britain and to Europe so that if our natural gas resources dry up we will also be able to tap into the European market and into the British market.  The fact that the pipeline is to be extended northwards might enable us to supply some of our gas to the Six Counties if there is a change of attitude there.  I welcome this Bill and I hope to contribute on Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and for the general welcome for the Bill. Many of the points raised today can be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage tomorrow.  In the limited time I have available I will restrict myself to aspects of the financial history of this operation. I was accused of a lack of subtlety by <Col N="3116" /> Deputy Higgins in relation to the financial affairs of this company.  The Deputy referred to the fact that I did not quote in the letter of 22 April exactly who it was addressed to.  I will quote the exact letter signed by the then Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, Dick Spring, TD.</P>
      <P>22 April, 1986.</P>
      <P>Allied Irish Investment Bank, plc,., Investment Bank of Ireland, Ltd., Ulster Investment Bank, Ltd., Irish National Insurance Co. (As Trustees).</P>
      <P>Re: Dublin Gas Company (&ldquo;DGC&rdquo;) &mdash; In Receivership</P>
      <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
      <P>I refer to the discussions between representatives of your banks acting in their capacity as Load Managers of the Syndicate Banks and my Department.</P>
      <P>I confirm that it is the Government's intention that: (1) DGC will continue to trade under the Receiver; (2) the company or its successor will be placed on a viable footing and furthermore it is my intention to recommend the nationalisation of the company as soon as is practical without prejudice to the participation of workers or consumers in the future ownership.</P>
      <P>I also confirm that it is the Government's intention that the affairs of DGC will be conducted in such fashion as to allow all amounts due to BGE, to the Loan Stock Trustees, and to the banks under the terms of the Syndicate Loan Agreement dated September 13, 1984 to be paid in full.  Furthermore any arrangements for the transfer of the undertaking to another entity will be such as to recognise these intentions.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the BGE letter to you and approve of its contents.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely, Dick Spring, T.D., Tánaiste and Minister for Energy. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another series of correspondence by Bord Gáis to the same group of people and there were further <Col N="3117" /> letters in August last year from the then Taoiseach to Deputy Frank Cluskey. Those letters were dated 18 August and 25 August.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to subtlety. My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, who is now Minister for Industry and Commerce asked a question in this House on 26 November.  Deputy Reynolds asked if that letter was a guarantee and this was the subtlety of the response given by the Tánaiste at the time.  I would ask Deputy Higgins to judge the subtlety of the Tánaiste at the time having regard to his comment when asked if this was a guarantee, and if he had misled the House in relation to it.  Deputy Spring said:</P>
    <P>I totally reject the implication of the Deputy's statement that I have attempted to or have in fact misled this House.  I have made my position very clear.  This letter is in the Library of the House at the Deputy's request.  It is not a letter of guarantee or a letter of comfort in the normal manner of Government business.  I, likewise, have legal advice available to me and it is that this letter is not a letter of guarantee or a letter of comfort. </P>
    <P>The accuracy of that statement is reflected in the fact that tonight those institutions who were the recipients of that guarantee by the Tánaiste of the day will be as a result of this changeover, in receipt of £62 million.  This will not be paid immediately but I hope that in the future we will be able to negotiate better terms than the appalling terms that were negotiated and that the Irish taxpayer will benefit from the improvements.  I came into office on 10 March.  We are now in mid-June.  We have taken three months to bring this to finality.  It took the previous administration nearly four years of talking about it and 12 months with the Receiver in.  Yet nothing was done.  This Government are proud that as a result of this Bill we are going to provide the people of Dublin and the country generally with an efficient gas network.  As far as subtlety is concerned, surely nothing could be more subtle than <Col N="3118" /> the wording of that letter by the then Tánaiste to the banks.  It was a guarantee in everything but name.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think since we joined the European Community have we been faced so late in the year with the failure of the Agriculture Ministers to reach agreement in the annual price review.  As a result of that failure losses to Irish farmers have <Col N="3119" /> been estimated at £2 million per week.  Of course, that loss has continued in recent weeks and will continue until such time as the Ministers finalise their agreement. Even more worrying is that the main concerns in so far as Irish agriculture is concerned appear to be receiving scant attention in the protracted discussions to date.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this debate, and my reason for putting down this motion, was to strengthen and reinforce the backbone of the Minister in dealing with his Community colleagues and to permit the Dáil to express its view as to the objectives which, of necessity, must be achieved in the interests of Irish agriculture.  The objectives set forth in my motion do not in any way conflict with the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy: in fact, quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>Despite the problems of the Community budget, the central reasoning behind the Common Agricultural Policy still holds.  Since its adoption in 1960 the policy has been based on three main principles: first, the single market with a common price system; secondly, Community preference and, thirdly, common financial responsibility.  Looking at the terms of the motion, there is no doubt that a refusal to dismantle MCAs, or border taxes as they are known, or to permit full green currency devaluation, leads to a distortion of trade which conflicts with the principles of a single market.</P>
    <P>I know there is much talk in Brussels and Luxembourg about the problems of the Community budget.  I am well aware of these problems, having been budget Minister of this country for five years up to the change of Government.  This talk has tended to focus on the large proportion of the Community budget which is applicable to the Common Agricultural Policy.  This is more a reflection of the reluctance of member states to agree other common policies which would involve joint financial responsibility rather than an indication of the excessive costs applying to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3120" /> If one examines the situation world-wide, there is State expenditure on price and income support for agriculture in many countries.  We see it in the United States, Japan and in most countries with a large agricultural base and indeed in many with a small agricultural base.  In making comparisons, it is clear that in international terms the expenditure under the Common Agricultural Policy is not excessive: recently it was estimated at five ECUs per month for each EC citizen.  Surely that is not an excessive sum when one considers the contribution which the Common Agricultural Policy makes to the security of food supply for its 320 million citizens.  Accordingly, I make no apology for defending the Common Agricultural Policy as a whole or for demanding certain key objectives thereunder for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The share of agriculture in Irish gross domestic product is over three times the community average.  The percentage employed in Irish agriculture is almost twice the Community average.  There is no great need at home to emphasise the importance of agriculture to our economy but, of course, it is essential that that message be repeated loud and clear time and time again in the Councils of the European Community.  There can be a tendency there to forget or even down-play the importance of agriculture in so far as it affects a country like ours with such a substantial agricultural base.</P>
    <P>In considering the motion clearly from the point of view of prices, an agreement is now both urgent and critical.  There is the continuing £2 million a week loss being suffered by our farmers.  We have milk intake reaching its highest level.  The cereal marketing is due to start on July &mdash; that is Wednesday of next week.  There is no need for me to emphasise the difficulties of that sector.  Anybody with any knowledge of our interest in agriculture is well aware of the traumatic times being sustained by those who are producing in that sector and that is why I highlight 1 July which is the beginning of the cereal marketing year.  Obviously the failure of the Agriculture Ministers to reach an agreement is going to impact severely on <Col N="3121" /> those involved in that sector and in many other sectors.  I have a particular sympathy for those in that sector because of the major difficulties being experienced by them.</P>
    <P>One other factor which has to be taken into account is that apart from the continuing losses of our farmers there is the possibility of the Commission taking decisions unilaterally because of the failure of the Ministers to agree.  If this abdication of responsibility by the Agriculture Ministers continues, the outcome may be that the Commission may take action without reference to the Ministers at all. That could be a very dangerous precedent. The danger would lie not in the fact that the Commission has ever shown itself to be inimical to Irish interests but rather in the temptation for it to concentrate on those areas where the Council apparently was close to decision.  That could mean it would ignore the agri-monetary area and leave us high and dry, in particular in relation to the Green Pound devaluation.  That would be an absolute disaster for this country and the Minister must try to ensure it does not happen. From the point of view of community institutions the function of the Ministers is to argue, dispute and discuss and ultimately reach decisions.  I know from my own experience at Community level the difficulties which can arise.  I am aware that meetings can go on through the night.  At one stage I recall being involved in a meeting which at that time set a record of 32 hours for the longest EC meeting of Ministers.  Having said that, the institutional position of the Community is that ultimately it is for the Ministers to make their agreements.  From the Community point of view and the Irish point of view there is a coincidence of interest and the Minister will have to go back to the negotiating table and keep at it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the devaluation of the Green Pound and the possibility of the Commission, in the event of the abdication of their responsibility by the farm Ministers, taking the decision themselves and ignoring that particular area.  There is no doubt that the question of a full <Col N="3122" /> Green Pound devaluation is of major importance to this country if only to offset the lack of progress on the prices issued and the problems which may result from a reduction in intervention periods. On the issue of the Green Pound devaluation the Minister must take a clear and unequivocal stand.  He must be able to convince his colleagues of the justice of the Irish case.  I understand there are certain offers on the table involving about 2.7 per cent for animal products and 6 per cent for crop products.  Let us be fair about it: they are not good enough and I want the Minister to go back to Brussels reinforced with a view from the Irish Parliament that this is not acceptable. There should be no reason whatever why full devaluation is not agreed even at this late stage.  The difficulties being experienced by Irish farmers are such that nothing less can be accepted.  If the Minister sticks to his guns he can achieve that full devaluation.  Hopefully, he will finish this debate with the voice of the whole of this Parliament totally behind him on that issue.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the MCAs or as they are more commonly known the border taxes.  The shortcomings of this system are now becoming obvious. Where there is a shortage of funds in the Community budget the cost of that system is such that it can no longer be sustained.  That is an issue that has to be raised and has to be pressed home particularly where the problem of funding is raised as an excuse for lack of action and lack of progress in other areas.  This, in fact, is not my main objection to the MCAs, even though it is a serious one. Where there are continuing differences between green rates and official parities, competition is distorted and the whole development of agriculture in the Community is hampered.  It is no longer acceptable to have member states who, on the one hand, continue to press for the completion of the internal market and, indeed, very often oppose increases in Community resources, while on the other hand they resist efforts to remove border taxes.  That whole stance is contradictory. <Col N="3123" /> That contradictory stance must be exposed and pushed home.</P>
    <P>I am not against the liberalisation of the internal market but, if it is to apply to industrial goods, there is no reason why we should not have a full free open market for agricultural products and I believe border taxes hamper that development.  As I see it, the countries to which I have referred very often want to have their cake and eat it.  The principal countries want the full and free movement of industrial goods and capital but they want to maintain a system which enables them to have high prices for their farmers, with imported farm inputs in many cases and those import inputs not being subject to MCAs but rather being paid for at the official rate of exchange.</P>
    <P>Before delving into this area on my appointment as spokesman on Agriculture I often wondered why farmers in the richer countries of Europe are doing so much better than those here.  Clearly, the system which I have outlined is a major reason.  They are protected by border taxes and yet they have the benefit of cheap inputs which in many cases are not subject to those taxes.  The whole system obviously discriminates against Irish farmers and, indeed, not just against Irish farmers, but against many others in the Community.  It conflicts with the principle of a common price level applicable to all farmers in the Community.  I know that the Commission would like to see and end to the MCAs.  I want to see the Minister supporting the Commission in their efforts to dismantle the MCAs entirely.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister makes a stand in relation to the market support system.  Despite temporary difficulties, intervention has proved itself over the years as a bulwark of support for the market and as a guarantee of supply.  We now have limitations on excess as well as pressure on price levels at which it operates.  In addition, we have restrictions on intervention periods and we have long time periods for payment and we have artifical quality criteria for access. This is coupled with less than enthusiastic <Col N="3124" /> support for the export refund system where increases in refunds have not automatically followed a fall of world prices and falls in the value of external currencies. Here again, the protection of the market support system as an essential pillar of the common agricultural policy is very much in our interest and must have the Minister's wholehearted commitment and support.</P>
    <P>I have included in my motion a reference to the encouragement of the expansion of the beef cow herd.  I should like to see this as a priority objective.  I want to see the Minister securing measures to encourage the expansion of the beef cow herd in this country.  Nowadays it is fashionable and, indeed, proper to refer to quality as being an essential aim for producers and processors of agricultural goods in Ireland.  It is also fashionable, and indeed very proper, to speak of the need for an improvement in our marketing effort.  I am totally in favour of efforts to improve our marketing but despite the emphasis we put on quality and marketing we have to face the fact that to maintain farm incomes we must maintain and increase the volume of our agricultural output.  This has to be done in an era of quotas on milk and sugar.  The reality is that a cutback of 10 per cent in milk means a cutback of at least 10 per cent in our dairy cows, that is 150,000 animals.  Furthermore higher milk yields over the next few years will accentuate this trend, perhaps up to 200,000 cows.  In output terms it takes at least one and and half beef cows to replace one dairy cow.  If we are to lose 200,000 dairy cows we would need at least 300,000 beef cows to replace them if we are to maintain output and more important, income.  That is the measure of the magnitude of the problem that confronts us.  It is clear that current policy outside the disadvantaged areas will not achieve this objective.  At present I understand there are about 450,000 suckler cows, of which only one quarter are outside the disadvantaged areas where there is a reasonable level of grant support.  If increasing beef cow numbers is a priority policy, that policy has to be reflected <Col N="3125" /> in our efforts to secure support for that priority objective from the European Community.  That is why I have included this in the motion.  I ask whether the Minister has raised this issue and in what form he has done so and what proposals he has made to meet the situation?  This is of course presupposing that he agrees with me that increasing beef cow numbers is in fact a national priority.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the question of disadvantaged areas.  I would like to see the review leading to an extension of disadvantaged areas expedited but that is a separate issue to the matter I have tabled in the motion.  I do not neglect it. The only reason I have not included it is that it is a matter for us to complete the review at home before we present it to Brussels.  The application for reclassification was presented and lodged by the Fine Gael Government early in February last.  I am concerned that the Minister appears to be dragging his feet on this issue.  Certainly his public pronouncements do not give any confidence to those who are anxiously awaiting reclassification.</P>
    <P>However, there is a precedent, a few years ago the Germans were able to secure a similar type of reclassification in the context of the price review.  I understand they were able to get a similar application through in the price negotiations within a matter of weeks.  This application was lodged by the Fine Gael Government on 4 February last and we have had no result on that application.  In general terms the reply from the European Community should be virtually automatic, yet we have no decision. There is an onus on the Minister to fully clarify the situation.  When I raised the matter in the Dáil before there was a certain amount of political cross-fire about it.  At this stage I ask the Minister to forget the political crossfire.  It is in the interest of this country that the reclassification application be completed and I believe now is the time to get it through.</P>
    <P>We are seeking that all existing less severely handicapped areas and mountain sheep grazing lands be reclassified and given severely handicapped status. <Col N="3126" /> The relevant directive lays down and gives considerable discretion to member states in such a situation.  Generally it is for the member state to make a decision in this regard, subject to the approval of the Commission.  The last Government made such a decision and lodged their application.  I would expect that there would be virtually automatic approval from Brussels.  It is now nearly five months since the application was lodged and yet we have had no decision.  I feel that the case for reclassification is very strong; in fact I do not believe there is any answer to our application.  It is clear that certain areas have been treated unfairly and the application was lodged by the Fine Gael Government in an effort to ensure that that element of unfairness would be removed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the most severely handicapped areas and the other areas there is no system of differentiation in some respects.  We are talking about the same level of co-responsibility levy, the same level of sheep headage payments and of grants in relation to the farm improvement programme and grants for the western drainage scheme and so on.  There is no question of distinguishing between the two, and accordingly what is left is an anomaly in relation to cattle headage.  I believe very strongly that that anomaly has to be removed and the quicker the better.  It is very clear that many small farmers in less severely handicapped areas are just as deserving of headage payments as similar farmers in more severely handicapped areas but they are excluded under the present arrangements. I believe the system would lead to a far greater administrative efficiency in the operation of the headage schemes generally.  I am not sure whether I have to convince the Minister of the need for reclassification.  The matter was discussed fully by the last Government, a decision was made, the application was lodged, and it is now purely a matter of completing the approval for the application in Brussels.</P>
    <P>In facing a resumption of the price talks we have the first real test of the Minister and of the Government as far as agriculture <Col N="3127" /> is concerned.  I noted that the Minister for Foreign Affairs approved of the decision of the General Affairs Council, the Council of Foreign Ministers, to exclude from the summit meeting of the Heads of State the questions which are before the farm council.  I have some reservations about that decision in the light of the difficulties of the farm Ministers so far in reaching a decision. But if that has the approval of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I presume it is a reflection of his confidence in the ability of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, and the other farm Ministers to reach agreement quickly and more importantly to attain the kind of objectives which I have set down in the motion. As I say, this is the first real test of the Minister and of this Government in so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of changes which I have characterised as being really cosmetic changes.  It is a matter for the Government whether they want to make these changes: changing the name of the Department, setting up food offices without money, setting up boards like An Bord Glas and appointing directors.  That is a matter for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>These areas may give the impression of activity but so far they have not put a bob into farmers' pockets and it is very doubtful they will do so in the future.  I do not intend to go into that issue in more detail at this stage.  It is a matter for another day and we can pass judgment when we see any beneficial results coming from changing the note-paper and the other matters to which I have referred including the appointment of those directors to whom my colleague Deputy Durkan referred.  As far as I can see, so far those changes were purely cosmetic but we are talking about something of major importance.  What happens in the price talks will have a direct and immediate impact on farmers' incomes, unlike those other changes to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3128" /> Here then is the real test.  I have suggested in my motion a list of objectives with which I felt the Minister could and would have no difficulty in agreeing. Surely the kind of things I am talking about are those the Minister can take fully on board?  Surely he accepts it should be a national objective to maintain and improve farm incomes?  That brings on board the question of increases for farm products and, more important and perhaps the only route available to the Minister, full Green Pound devaluation. I expect he will have no difficulty with the question of the protection of the market support system or the dismantling of the MCAs.  He must accept that these border taxes are not in the interests of Irish farmers or of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I feel, too, that the Minister will have no difficulty in supporting my approach in relation to the expansion of the beef cow herd.  If he puts as high a priority on that, he must accept that that priority must be reflected in the kind of approach and attitude which he adopts in the Community talks.  I have gone into the question of reclassification where the Minister has some explaining to do.  It is fairly obvious he is dragging his feet here but the time for foot dragging has come to an end.  The time for action has arrived. Surely in the context of the price talks now is the time for action.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to state his support for the objectives I have outlined and to go back to resumption of the farm price talks in the full knowledge and confidence that in accepting those objectives he will have the full backing of the Dáil.  That is the essential point on which I started and on which I will shortly finish.  I believe it will strengthen the Minister's hand and reinforce his backbone in those talks to have a vote of the Dáil on the terms of the motion I have tabled.  In discussions with his Community colleagues it must be an advantage to him to be able to put on the table the fact that this was fully discussed in the Irish Parliament and that the kind of stand which I hope he has taken and will be taking in the price talks has the support of the Irish Parliament. The list of objectives is such that no <Col N="3129" /> reasonable person could quibble with them.  I urge the Minister to take them fully on board, to go back to Brussels and to fight for their attainment.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Agriculture Ministers to date is creating an enormous problem for the Community in general and for Irish farmers in particular.  Whatever decisions were made in relation to the summit, at the meeting of the Heads of State, if that is the strategy decided on by the Government it is fine if it works. I have reservations about it, but the Agriculture Ministers must sit down quickly and our representative on that Council must fight to the end to attain the objectives I have outlined in my motion.  If the Minister goes into those resumed talks and fights to achieve these objectives, then he has my full support and, more important, if he accepts this motion here tonight he will have the full support of the entire House in his efforts to attain those objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to have the negotiations on EEC agricultural prices for 1987-88 completed as quickly as possible and in a way that best promotes the development of Irish agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since the EC proposals on prices for agricultural products and on related measures for 1987-88 were presented in February, they have now been discussed by the Council of Ministers on five occasions, approximately 15 days, most recently in Luxembourg from 15 to 18 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it has to be remembered that the Council of Ministers adopted wide-ranging restrictive measures in the milk and beef sectors in December last.  In addition, the current proposals have to be seen against the Community's chronic budgetary problem and the fact that there will be a very substantial deficit &mdash; 4 billion ECU &mdash; in FEOGA expenditure <Col N="3130" /> this year.  In this connection I would point out that the whole position in regard to agricultural expenditure has been changing dramatically.  The era of sharply increasing agricultural expenditure has ended and an entirely new and restrictive approach is being followed.  This stems partly from the structural surpluses of certain products and partly from the severe pressure on the Community's overall financial resources.  While the restrictions on agricultural spending are not welcome from our point of view, the same does not hold good for some other member states.  The tight budgetary situation is not unwelcome to them as it assists their efforts to reduce agricultural expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations, we have acknowledged that action is required to prevent unreasonable growth in net agricultural expenditure.  It is worth noting that in 1986 more than one-third of FEOGA guarantee expenditure in Ireland was accounted for by intervention storage and disposal costs.  Another one-third of guarantee expenditure was accounted for by refunds on exports to third countries. While this expenditure indirectly benefits producers, it would be in everybody's interest, not least that of producers, if an increasing proportion of farm income were obtained directly from the market. My primary concern is to protect the interest of the producers.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is prepared to contemplate adjustments to the CAP to meet current financial and market realities, I have made it clear that any adjustments must be gradual and must not undermine the viability of the average family farm in the Community.  In addition, I have consistently argued that support price levels in some parts of the Community should not be artificially kept below the common price levels by the maintenance of negative MCAs for prolonged periods. I have also indicated that the Community should not continue to stumble from one budget crisis to another or go on endangering its ability to meet its commitments and obligations.  I have, accordingly, emphasised the necessity of providing adequate Community budgetary <Col N="3131" /> resources and of ensuring that these resources are directed towards the development of a more cohesive and stronger Community through limiting the impact on small to medium-sized producers of any changes in market policy and through devoting more resources in the future to structural action to help such producers.</P>
    <P>During last week's meeting the Commission presented compromise proposals which amended their original proposals in a number of important respects.  The negotiations on the compromise were carried on mainly under three broad headings.  First is the stabilisation measure for oils and fats to which Deputy O'Keeffe did not refer and which is a major element of these negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see it as a national priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a major element and I will endeavour to explain why it is also a national priority.  Second is market and price policy including in particular cereals support and, thirdly, agri-monetary matters.  I shall deal with each of these aspects but before doing so I would like to point out that as agreement was not reached last week the negotiations are still open.  This imposes certain constraints on me as I do not wish to say anything here which could prejudice efforts to secure further improvements. Neither do I want to confine the House in any way from expressing its views which, as Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, I will use so far as possible in support of my negotiating position and in the national interest.  The House will understand that there are certain constraints on me in the process of negotiating at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important features of the price package is the proposed stabilisation arrangements for vegetable and marine oils and fats.  It is, as the Commission has said, a central essential element of the package and we cannot consider the package without taking account of that.  It is important to understand that this is not merely a tax.  In all <Col N="3132" /> likelihood it will operate as a tax for the first few years but if prices of these oils rise beyond certain levels in the future the arrangement would become a subsidy to moderate the increase.</P>
    <P>The importance of this proposal is two-fold, there is the financial aspect and there is the equity aspect.  The Community's current financial difficulties are well known.  It is very much in Ireland's interest &mdash; this is where I have to take issue with Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; that the Community should find a fast and an effective response and should have adequate resources to meet the case we and other member states make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>An appreciable element in those difficulties is the escalating cost of supporting the vegetable oil sector within the enlarged European Community, a sector that includes the various oil seeds and olive oil.  The proposed stabilisation measure would make a significant contribution to relieving the Community's budgetary problems at present.  It would yield two billion ECUs in a full year and would facilitate greater control of the oils and fats sector which, if no action is taken, could cost 6.5 billion ECUs in a few years.  Effective action on the financial side is essential if the cost of supporting the oils and fats market is not to become intolerable.  As Deputy O'Keeffe and other speakers understandably stated, we will get more if the Community budget is not entirely over-loaded and strained beyond any reasonable capacity.  That is why I say it is an essential element and why the Commission makes the same case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without making too much out of it, I find it surprising that this central element in the package was not referred to by the Deputy who is <Col N="3133" /> asking for full support for our national position in this instance.</P>
      <P>From the equity point of view, we are all aware of the restrictions the Community has imposed on milk.  There are milk quotas and a super-levy and, in addition, a co-responsibility levy.  Given that milk is severely restricted, it is only fair that competing vegetable and marine oils and fats should be given comparable treatment.  Indeed, this has been the Irish approach at Community level for many years and under various Governments. The Commission is satisfied that its proposal conforms to international obligations, particularly as it applies to both imported and domestically produced oils and fats.</P>
      <P>From the beginning I asked for an easing of the rate of tax on marine oils and I am glad to say that the Commission has now agreed to this.  It is also proposing certain safeguards for third country suppliers who fear that their interests may be affected.  The latter would constitute an extremely important concession by the Community.  If after the first year the stabilisation mechanism was leading to a reduction in imports and causing injury to third country traditional suppliers, the Community would enter into negotiations to establish, where necessary, compensation for the losses suffered.  It would also take steps to prevent the injury from being repeated.</P>
      <P>All in all, I see the Commission's approach as logical and reasonable and I have been consistent, and in the forefront of the Council, in my support for the proposal.  Failure to adopt it would have far-reaching and unwelcome consequences for the CAP.  Despite this, four countries opposed the proposal in the early hours of Thursday morning, thereby effectively rejecting the whole package of which it was an integral part, as stated repeatedly by the Commission who presented the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to the measures under market and price policy, the Council of Ministers took decisions last December which will have far-reaching consequences for the milk and beef sectors <Col N="3134" /> which account for about 75 per cent of our agricultural output.  The proposals now on the table for these products provide for retention of existing institutional price levels but the partial dismantling of our MCAs would improve producers' returns to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>The original proposals for cereals would have meant that intervention would not be available until the spring and that the monthly increments, which are designed to compensate for storage costs from harvest to time of sale, would not apply until then either.  This, together with a 2.6 per cent drop in the intervention price, would have meant a very substantial drop in support prices everywhere in the Community but especially in member states such as Ireland with relatively high interest rates.  Perhaps even more importantly, it would have left the market without any effective intervention support throughout the most critical time of the year &mdash; the months immediately after the harvest.  For Irish producers, most of whom have little or no on-farm storage, this would have been far worse than for producers in most other member states.  A proposal on moisture content, to be implemented now but actually agreed as part of last year's price agreement, would have further discriminated against Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that following significant pressure from a few countries, principally Ireland and Germany, the nature of the cereals proposal has been very substantially changed in the Commission compromise.  Intervention would now be available from October and the a monthly increments from November; intervention would be triggered when the average community market price is below the intervention level; even if intervention were generally suspended, special intervention would take place when prices on an isolated market such as Ireland drop sharply; the formal intervention price would remain unchanged but actual buying in would take place at 93 per cent of the intervention price, and the maximum moisture content for grain to be eligible for intervention may be <Col N="3135" /> fixed at 15 per cent rather than the 14 per cent originally proposed.</P>
    <P>When the Green Pound change for cereals is taken into account, there would be a net drop in price of about 5 per cent, a somewhat better outcome than last year's.  While I would like to see an even better outcome on the actual price level, the new arrangements I have just outlined would represent a considerable improvement on the original proposals introduced by the Commission.  We would not be unfairly penalised by the timing of intervention or by the maximum moisture content.  Isolated markets such as ours could receive special treatment.  On the basis of estimates derived from the experience of recent years, intervention should be generally available during the critical months.  If it were not, the reason would be that prices are above the intervention level, which would, of course, be an even better outcome.</P>
    <P>The agri-monetary issues, especially the devaluation of our Green Pound and the consequential dismantling of our negative MCAs, are of the utmost importance to us.  I wish the Deputy could spend just five minutes with me at Council meetings so that he would see that I have consistently been the strongest promoter of dismantling MCAs in all their forms to the point that the Commission vice-President, whom I have known for a number of years, reminded me that I was the only person who was consistently demanding their total dismantling. He said it was not acceptable that I should say that his proposals, or failure to accept my demands, were unacceptable. I should like to assure the House, and Deputy O'Keeffe, that it is not just a matter of words but of record that I have been the most consistent and strongest promoter of dismantling all MCAs, particularly the negative MCAs which affect our interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I welcome the Deputy's support for what I have been demanding.  These MCAs &mdash; minus 4.3 per cent for animal products and minus 9 per cent for crop products &mdash; are made up of what the Commission describe as a natural element dating back to the devaluation last August of the Irish pound and what the Commission called an artificial element of 3 per cent created by the January realignment mainly of the Deutschemark.  The Commission's original proposal envisaged the abolition of the natural element only in their terms &mdash; I do not accept the terms &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;&mdash; that is, 1.3 per cent for animal products and 6 per cent for crop products.  While I have repeatedly pressed for the abolition of the artificial element, as the Commission call it, the Commission have been opposing this because they say, the artificial element arises from the German revaluation of January last and not from anything related to the weaker currencies. However, they have now agreed to a further 1.5 per cent dismantlement in the case of beef.  The Commission have also proposed a switchover of 0.5 per cent from positive to negative MCAs and have agreed to an immediate dismantlement of this also.</P>
      <P>The result in overall terms then is a 1.6 per cent price increase in the dairy sector, 3.2 per cent in the beef sector and 6.2 per cent for sugar beet and cereals.  In the latter case the increase would offset much of the large price cut which would otherwise have arisen.  While the proposals as they stand are worth about £50 million to the agricultural sector in Ireland in a full year, I was not satisfied with the extent of the devaluation as negative Irish MCAs would still exist &mdash; albeit at low levels, and, accordingly, I opposed that part of the package.  There would appear to be a qualified majority for it but the UK indicated that their support was conditional on there being no improvement for Ireland and France.  They indicated that if such an improvement were forthcoming they would insist on more.  The House will gather from that the complex nature of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3137" /> The proposals for the dismantlement of future MCAs are also welcome since the process proposed represents the first definite commitment to an automatic elimination of MCAs.  I have strongly supported and welcomed that development and it is worth recording that for the first time we now have an automatic procedure for dismantlement of MCAs, though it is not at the pace and in the amounts that we demand.  However, it is a move in the right direction.  The proposals in this sector are giving rise to major difficulties from Germany, as they would involve automatic reductions in prices to German farmers.  This is one of the principal factors preventing an agreement.</P>
    <P>There are a number of additional items in the agri-monetary areas to which I should like to refer.  Deputy O'Keeffe did not refer to them though they are matters of the most fundamental importance to Ireland.  I have been concerned for some time at the absence of MCAs on cooked beef products.  The Government are particularly anxious to encourage investment in the food processing industry as a means of creating employment and increasing exports.  The meat industry in particular has significant potential for downstream processing.  However, up to now MCA subsidies have been available on exports to the UK of uncooked meat but were not available for cooked beef preparations.  This anomalous situation discouraged investment in cooked beef facilities and I am pleased that, following my strong pressure, the Commission has now proposed the introduction of MCAs for cooked beef.  The proposal represents a significant step forward in the development of the meat sector.</P>
    <P>I have also been concerned at the absence of MCAs on jams/marmalades and certain other sugar-based products. Because of this exports of these products to the UK have been uncompetitive in recent times and, indeed, the industries concerned were losing their share at the home market to cheaper imports from the UK.  In response to my repeated requests the Commission have now proposed <Col N="3138" /> the introduction of MCAs on these products and this should safeguard the future of the industries concerned which have an annual output of £50 million and employ about 1,000.  There are problems also for the soft drinks industry where MCAs do not apply and I will continue to press for a similar solution to the problem. I will then be able to say that all those areas, processed products, cooked beef, what we call non-Annex II goods and soft drinks, have been included for the first time to the maximum advantage of a major element of the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem that for many processed products &mdash; the so-called non-Annex II goods such as biscuits and chocolates &mdash; the MCA system applies in a haphazard and uncertain way.  MCAs may be eliminated or reintroduced for these products following twice yearly reviews even when relatively high MCAs, and hence large price differences, apply to the basic products from which they are made.  The Commission's compromise in response to my request would abolish this anomalous system and replace it by arrangements under which MCAs would apply whenever the amount involved is above a small minimum threshold figure. This is a much more clear cut and definite system and will be of considerable benefit to the industries concerned, especially while the UK continues to have high MCA levels.</P>
    <P>The compromise also provides for a number of other points which I have been seeking &mdash; the buying up of milk quotas for resale and the temporary leasing of milk quotas on a flexible basis which I know the House supports.  The first of these was, in fact, agreed last year but it had not been possible to get real action on it until we pressed it in these year's negotiations.  I do not wish to make any triumphant points about that beyond saying that it represents the common interest.  However, it is important to point out that we have succeeded in having it introduced.  In addition, the arrangements now envisaged for sweet cream butter, both salted and unsalted, are more satisfactory than what was originally <Col N="3139" /> proposed.  I have also secured the agreement of the Commission to examine our request for the extension of the producer group regulation to Ireland and for the inclusion of harvesting and ancillary equipment for horticulture and potatoes in the categories eligible for FEOGA investment aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's motion mentions the expansion of the beef cow herd and the reclassification of some of the disadvantaged areas.  In the light of the EEC constraints on milk, production, I am sure everyone will recognise the need for a dynamic programme for the expansion of the beef cow herd.  I believe such a programme is of vital importance in order to maintain farm income.  It would certainly contribute towards increasing our beef output, which is an essential element in the recovery of the economy, with the consequential impact on employment and export earnings.</P>
    <P>The prices proposals contain no special measures on beef.  The reason for this is that major changes in the beef arrangements were agreed by the Council of Ministers in December last.  These involved, unfortunately, a weakening of the intervention system for beef and were designed to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of supporting the beef market.  Against this background it is not realistic to expect that the price package would include measures to encourage beef production and people should not delude themselves into thinking that it would.  We must therefore rely on our own efforts and I propose to make considerable efforts.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have already taken steps to see what can be done to maintain and expand the national cow herd.  On my instructions months ago officials of my Department had discussions with representatives of one bank and then with representatives of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee about the introduction of a scheme of low interest loans for the farmers involved.  I will now meet the committee in the immediate future &mdash; I mean the immediate future &mdash; and it is my intention to meet also with the other <Col N="3140" /> parties concerned as soon as possible with a view to formulating an acceptable financial package to meet what is the common interest of Members and the farming sector.</P>
    <P>I did not think I would be dealing with the reclassification of disadvantaged areas in the context of price negotiations but I feel I need once again to clarify the situation.  A submission was lodged with the European Commission by the last Government on 4 February 1987 to reclassify to more severely handicapped status all the existing less severely handicapped areas as well as areas where mountain sheep headage grants are paid.</P>
    <P>There are, however, major problems which have to be faced.  In the first instance, no provision was made in the budget prepared by the previous Administration to meet the very substantial costs that would arise.  It is a fact of financial life that any additional costs that are incurred have to be financed in full by our own Exchequer in the first instance.  The recoupment which subsequently comes from FEOGA is only paid in the year following expenditure from the national budget.  Thus, the reclassification proposal would cost £30 million in the first two years of operation of which only £7.5 million would be recouped from the Community.  This has to be seen against the background of our budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>A second problem is that the Commission has recently and formally made it clear to us it is not prepared to agree to the type of across-the-board reclassification proposed by the previous Government.  So much for what Deputy O'Keeffe said.  Maybe he did not know this when he said it was purely a formality. It is far from it.  They say that such an arrangement would not meet the terms of the relevant EEC directive which requires that headage payments, or compensatory allowances as they are described, must reflect the severity of permanent natural handicaps in the regions concerned.  This rules out the payment of the same rates of headage grants throughout all our disadvantaged areas, and <Col N="3141" /> so the proposal put forward by the previous Government is not acceptable in its present form.  We are re-examining the matter but in any event it is not something for inclusion in the current price negotiations. I hope we can be honest enough with each other to acknowledge that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning back now to the price proposals proper, I believe these have been substantially improved during the discussions.  I regret the negotiations are not complete as the likely outcome involves some gains for Irish agriculture and the Irish economy, although not of the order Deputy O'Keeffe said.  One would assume from his remarks that everything that was asked for from day one was granted.  We should not engage in that kind of illusion. The reasons they are not yet complete are partly the fact that the original proposals were tabled much later than usual and partly because of the major political problems caused by two of the proposals &mdash; the oils and fats stabilisation measures and the agri-monetary measures.  As matters stand, it is clear there would not be a qualified majority for the stabilisation measure which is opposed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark.</P>
      <P>While different countries have objections to various elements in the package, it looks as if there would be a qualified majority for all the other items in it. However, Germany has made it clear that the proposed future agri-monetary system and the price reductions for cereals and rape seed are completely unacceptable. The big political problems involved have still to be resolved and may be considered by the European Council next week.  In any event, the prices package will have to be considered again by the Agriculture Ministers; I hope this will be done immediately after the European Council.  Certainly, I will be doing all in my power to get a speedy settlement and to see whether further improvements may be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, as well to be realistic. <Col N="3142" /> The room for manoeuvre is very limited because of both the budgetary and the market situations.  Some of what is implied in the motion is not realistic and certainly takes no account of what has been decided in recent years.  We have been asked to protect the market support mechanism.  Naturally that is our aim but do not forget that the greatest weakening ever of market mechanisms took place in the past few years &mdash; the introduction of the milk quota system in 1984, the decision to reduce quotas last year and to weaken the intervention systems for milk and beef.  No further changes are being made in these sectors this year. Indeed, the introduction of flexibility in milk quota transfer arrangements will be a clear improvement.  We have been asked to secure reasonable price increases.  Again that is our aim, and for our main two products we look like securing that aim.  It is true that a net price reduction is inevitable in cereals, but that continues a process begun last year and, in fact, represents a smaller price reduction.</P>
    <P>The package is shaping up to be a reasonable one which would give real benefits in terms of the levels of price support being fixed and the maintenance of most of the existing systems unchanged; the introduction of new arrangements for cereals significantly better than those originally proposed; and improvements in other areas not least of which are in the area of MCAs on processed products.  There are, of course, areas where we would like to see more progress and I will continue to press for more improvements wherever there is a realistic prospect of obtaining them.  That is why I am asking the House to pass the amended motion supporting the negotiating efforts to date and calling for a quick settlement.  That settlement looks like being worth £50 million or so to Irish agriculture in a full year, and perhaps £40 million in balance of payments terms. In times of low inflation these are not insignificant figures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this motion will allow me to go to Europe and tell the Commission that this is the view of all <Col N="3143" /> the Irish people.  I would not like anybody to get the impression that before this motion was introduced by the Opposition I was less than enthusiastic in promoting these views in Europe.  I can only leave it to the record of the proceedings of the Commission to demonstrate who was the most enthusiastic and constant supporter in putting forward the views of his country. I do not believe anyone has been more enthusiastic than I have been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion.  Deputy O'Keeffe said if there was not a quick resolution at the meetings in Brussels the Commission had said it would manage the market, taking account of the market and budgetary situations.  This means that if a decision is not taken before 1 July the Commission will manage the market in such a manner as to achieve the result already proposed.  If this were to happen it would mean that the influence of the Agriculture Ministers would be greatly eroded and their input would be greatly diminished.</P>
      <P>This motion calls for &ldquo;the completion of the current round of EEC farm price negotiations and the attainment of the following objectives: (1) Reasonable increases for farm productse...&rdquo;.  The important word here is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  We must recognise that there is a surplus in many of the farm gate products produced in Ireland.  We must also recognise the need for market management.  Another course to take would be unfettered production and to allow market forces to obtain.  We have seen the results of this in other countries &mdash; beef at 40p a pound in South America, milk at 25p a gallon in New Zealand and grain at £70 a tonne in the United States.</P>
      <P>We believe the diversification within the price support structure which we will get from Brussels in future is the only answer to an increased top price to the farmer at the farm gate to compensate him for his real production costs and to give him a viable standard of living.  I was interested to hear the Minister say&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3144" /> It is worth noting that in 1986 more than one-third of FEOGA guarantee expenditure in Ireland was accounted for by intervention storage and disposal costs.  Another one-third of guarantee expenditure was accounted for by refunds on exports to third countries. </P>
    <P>This means that two-thirds of the EC grant-in-aid to farm gate production does not find its way back to the farmer in the way it was intended.  The reality is that we are producing in surplus commodities which the Common Market does not want any longer in the form in which they are being produced.  We must now solve our own problems and we cannot adopt the attitude that the Minister will bring home the bacon every year.  We cannot expect that all will be well if we do not have an input ourselves.  There must be a change in emphasis and attitude and, indeed, in the dairy industry there has been a move to further rationalise very large co-operatives so that they will be able to diversify into products which will not gobble up the EC subvention in storage and which will give a market return in products which the consumer requires.</P>
    <P>I welcome a move in the last week to do the same in relation to the beef sector. There may be shortcomings in regard to our knowledge about the deal but the thrust of the idea is good, whereby a company are looking at the long term future recognising that a lot of research and development must come from within private companies if we are to be successful in selling our products.</P>
    <P>Various speakers have highlighted the problem in regard to raw materials, cutbacks in milk quotas and the milk cessation scheme and said that the shortages will reduce the cattle herd by about 150,000 animals per annum.  That is a daunting prospect as well as the fact that we have the highest calf mortality in Europe.  If we put our minds to it we could easily make up the shortfall in cattle numbers next year and the following year if we put more emphasis on the rearing of calves.  The Minister and the Department should give serious consideration to this <Col N="3145" /> problem.  We are now rearing 70 per cent of our calves and this could be increased to 90 per cent if we provided the educational resources required to enable farmers to rear calves properly.  Perhaps calves are marketed when they are too young.  Whatever the reason, we are shooting ourselves in the foot on the very first rung of the ladder.</P>
    <P>We must stand by the market support system because it is the very essence and spirit of the EC and the Treaty of Rome. It was intended to be one market for 320 million people.  Most Members supported the Single European Act which was intended to support the concept of one market and, if we support that, how can we then turn around and fragment agriculture by introducing direct income aids which would suit countries with strong economies and low surpluses in dairy and agricultural produce generally?  It would militate greatly against Ireland which has about six to one in surplus agricultural products and, generally speaking, a very open economy which could not afford direct income aid.  I appeal to the Minister to resist strongly any such move in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is continuously eroded, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, by a reduction in the subvention to cold storage costs, a restructuring of intervention for beef and milk, increased standards for wheat, many of them artificial, and longer payment times for dairy products.  There is a clear warning to us from Europe that we continue at our peril to produce intervention products. The warning is clear in the treatment given to us this year by FEOGA in that we secured a very large EC grant towards updating and equipping processing plants.  There is an implicit message for Irish agriculture that we must move out of intervention products with the help of the EC.  Of course, that is more easily said than done and it will take a tremendous effort on the part of those in food processing to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <P>In looking for the full Green Pound valuation, Ireland has had increasingly to depend on a partial devaluation every <Col N="3146" /> year to get a real increase in farm incomes because of the high interest rates and because our costs were very high <i>visà-vis</i> our counterparts in Europe.  Our national currency has been under continuous pressure against European currencies. While the continued devaluation of our own currency has certainly helped processing and export companies to sell their products abroad, it has not helped the farmer because the Green Pound devaluations have never been in line with national devaluation and there is always a time lag of about six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>Whatever settlement is arrived at next week, there should be a certain element of restrospection with regard to our position. We were over-optimistic this year in stating that a 6 per cent to 8 per cent increase in farm incomes can be expected.  Perhaps it is possible over last year's figures but, when you take the 2 per cent cessation scheme and the 4 per cent voluntary scheme into account, it is obvious there will be a reduction of at least 6 per cent to 7 per cent this year in our national milk quota.  That represents a lot to farmers whose incomes have been restricted in many ways.  If we have to accept the low level of increase now offered the full devaluation of the Green pound is most important.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the policy in relation to oils and fats which is being introduced to fund CAP.  While it will achieve its stated aim of raising revenue, there is a danger in the longer term to the GATT trade agreements.  We will be treading on the toes of trading partners like the United States who are very large customers for Irish proteins and other semi-processed foods.  We cannot continue to have different mechanisms every year to cope with the same problem.  We must grasp the nettle and solve the problem ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on the introduction of MCAs on cooked meats.  In my own constituency, a company manufacturing corned beef and cooked meats have had a very difficult time lately trying to export their products. In my own town there has been a similar situation in that a soft drinks <Col N="3147" /> company have been under tremendous pressure due to cheap importation of soft drinks from Britain where there is a great difference in the sugar price content and no MCAs on the imports.  We talk about restrictive practices and below cost selling but with regard to supermarkets Irish manufacturers are having to compete with imports at about half their manufacturing costs, especially in the soft drinks area, due to the difference in the cost of sugar, which is the major raw material.</P>
    <P>A total dismantling of the MCAs would bring the full benefit from a devaluation and would maximise the return to farmers.  At the moment, because of our national currency weakness and the national currency strength especially of countries like Germany, the MCAs which are supposed to act as an export tax are acting as an export subsidy. That is because over a number of years there has been a gradual decline in the strength of our money in the European Monetary System.  This is causing a great distortion of trade and will not help the stated aim of the Government of creating jobs in the manufacturing industry.  I strongly urge the Minister to see if he can arrange for the dismantling of the MCAs in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also spoke about measures to encourage the expansion of the beef cow herd.  One of the main measures is the allowing of a reclassification. Item No. 6 in Deputy O'Keeffe's motion is in relation to existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas. That would help greatly but it is not the real key.  There are so few beef cows located outside the disadvantaged areas, proportionately speaking, that the reclassification, although desirable, will have a minimal effect.  The real answer, which must be recognised, is that the beef cow herd enterprise is not one of profitability and does not attract farmers to it.  It would be best to look at it in isolation because it is of vital importance to the agricultural industry.  It should be looked at especially where there are people going out of milk.  The Minister <Col N="3148" /> has said he is looking for a decision in the EC whereby the milk quota could be leased to younger farmers or put into flexi-milk.</P>
    <P>The beef cow herd should have a guaranteed minimum profit level commensurate with other farm activities. There should be some provision of Euro-currency or low interest money to make up the difference and to attract people into that type of industry.  When a person goes out of milk, the sheep industry is a far more attractive activity.  There is a premium every year.  We are asking people to get into beef but there is a very low profit level and a very low guaranteed income level in it.  There must be some type of interest subsidy or inducement to get people to go into this most vital industry.</P>
    <P>The reclassification of the existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas has been on the agenda on a number of occasions this year.  It is my contention that we should have found the money in the Estimates this year to allow us to proceed with this.  The Minister has said there are difficulties in Europe and that it is not only a matter of the money. I contend that if we had the money there would be no problems in Europe; that is the real situation.  The EC recognise Ireland's position and I cannot see how it would say it cannot allow this reclassification even though it understands how much Ireland depends on it, or even though it would help our beef cow herd, with which the EC is in full agreement.</P>
    <P>It appears to me the rules are being changed every year and at every negotiation. It is the big boys who change the rules.  There are situations which were thought unbelievable, unattainable and downright ridiculous but which are now accepted as the order of the day, as part of the EC day-to-day policy.  We should have been able to find that £14 million. It is the one bone of contention I have regarding the Estimates outside the Euro-currency.  That £14 million, of which £7 million would have been repatriated the next year, would have given us an injection of £7 million.  Very few companies can bring £7 million into the <Col N="3149" /> country by way of earnings every year. This was an opportunity we passed up.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe for bringing this timely motion before the House.  These matters need to be discussed.  We must put far more emphasis on agriculture if we are going to get the jobs out of it that we need and expect.  Agriculture is our natural resource; we are talking about it but we need to do a lot more about it.  I welcome the Minister's reply. there are many positive aspects to it.  There is the matter of marine fats and oils, although I have a certain amount of reservation about these due to the severe budgetary constraints in the EC.  If we go down the road of bringing in this measure this year, will we be looking for something extra next year?</P>
    <P>I welcome the assertion by the Minister when he stated:</P>
    <P>The compromise also provides for a number of other points which I have been seeking &mdash; the buying up of milk quotas for re-sale and the temporary leasing of milk quotas on a flexible basis.  The first of these was in fact agreed last year but it had not been possible to get real action on it until we pressed it at this year's negotiations. </P>
    <P>I do not know who brought that in or who pressed it but the matter is very urgent.  There are many young farmers, especially in dairying, who are now left in a position where they cannot expand their herd or increase their income.  Their quota is too low and any move from any side that would relieve that is to be welcomed. We should look to our counterparts in Britain who refused to enter the milk cessation scheme.  They handled their situation far better than we did in an area where milk is not of the same importance.  We sometimes tend to be too much the good Europeans without watching out enough for ourselves.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold:</P>
      <P>&mdash;On the one hand, it creates a licensing system for the special trading houses envisaged in the 1987 Finance Act &mdash; a system which will ensure that the valuable tax concessions applying to those trading houses are used solely for the purpose of creating new exports for this country.</P>
      <P>&mdash;On the other hand, the Bill raises the ceiling on Córas Tráchtála's aggregate level of grant-in-aid.  The existing ceiling of £160 million has now been exhausted, and the new ceiling of £260 million will be adequate for the next few years at least.  </P>
      <P>Before commenting in detail on the specific matters addressed in the Bill, I would like to say something about the general framework these measures fit into.</P>
      <P>Deputies will need no reminding of the crucial importance of exports to the programme for national recovery. However, the point does need to be made yet again because as a nation we are still not aware of just how much we depend on exports.</P>
      <P>Over half our GNP is created by exports &mdash; a level that is higher than in major exporting nations like the UK, the United States and even Japan.  Ireland is now above all a trading nation, and our survival and our growth depend almost entirely on our ability to improve continually our performance in selling our goods and services abroad.  Exporting is the very core of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, the news from the export front is good.  For the month of <Col N="3151" /> May, our exports topped the £1 billion mark for the first time ever.  We are on course to reach £10 billion for the year as a whole &mdash; which would be another record.  Even more significantly, our trade balance continues to improve &mdash; we are increasing our exports faster than we are increasing our imports.  The favourable balance for the first five months of 1987 is over £400 million, well over double the surplus for the same period last year.  Taking the past 12 months, the favourable trade balance is running at a level of over 10 per cent of our export sales &mdash; and that ratio is continuing to rise quite sharply.</P>
    <P>This is healthy and should give us confidence as we look towards the future. But when we look behind these encouraging figures we find plenty to be concerned about and plenty of work for us to do.</P>
    <P>What the figures do not reveal is the relative weakness of Irish-owned companies in the export field.  The overwhelming mass of our exports come from foreign-owned companies; overwhelmingly, the growth in our exports has come from those companies too.  It must be our priority to see that Irish-owned companies also play a full part in bringing about export growth.</P>
    <P>We need the foreign-owned companies, of course, and we need them to grow a lot more in the future.  But if we want to see our economic objectives realised, if we want to create the employment and the prosperity for our people that we aspire to, we must ensure that Irish companies are not left behind in the exports race.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many Irish-owned companies which are very successful exporters but the point is there are not enough.  Our twin aims must be to get those who are exporting already to export more and to get those who are not exporting to take the plunge.</P>
    <P>Some Irish companies are totally dependent on the home market.  Many, indeed, were created solely for the purpose of serving that market.  The days when that approach offered a secure <Col N="3152" /> future are gone.  Increasingly now, the home market is wide open to foreign competition, competition from companies that can offer lower prices through vast economies of scale.  We cannot protect Irish companies from that competition but we can and must help them to compete in the wider markets that are now open to us.</P>
    <P>Because so many Irish companies are very small, they have particular problems when it comes to exporting.  Irish companies must get into exporting earlier than equivalent companies in other countries. They must embark earlier on this task that demands special skills, and demands long-term commitment of money and other resources.  In some of the most important markets, language skills are also vital.</P>
    <P>That is the reality we have to address, and we must focus our investment in exports on that reality.  The whole thrust of what we do for exports must be geared to helping indigenous Irish companies to be successful in exporting.</P>
    <P>Where do the special trading houses fit into this?  They will fill what I see as a structural gap in our export effort.  They will offer to Irish companies export marketing skills that they are not in a position to provide themselves, or not yet in a position to provide.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that some companies have exportable products but do not have any resources to commit to exporting.  We have to face the fact that some manufacturing companies are able to cover only a few key export markets, and have to turn their back on smaller opportunities in other countries in order to concentrate on their priorities.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have to recognise that there is now in Ireland a considerable reservoir of export marketing experience.  There are people with special knowledge of certain markets, or who possess certain language skills that are in rare supply.  Many of these talents are under used at present, not least because up to now we have been penalising rather than encouraging them.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for instance, someone with special knowledge of a particular world <Col N="3153" /> market like chemicals, or a particular national market like Portugal, decided to set up a company specialising in exporting Irish goods into that market.  The existence of the company would be welcome to those manufacturers who were not able to do the exporting themselves, but, though the company would be selling Irish manufactured goods and creating valuable new exports, the enterprise would be taxed unfavourably, compared with a manufacturer of those goods.</P>
    <P>Small wonder, then, that very few such companies exist at present.  We now want to provide a positive incentive for people to go into this kind of business.  We want to make it worth people's while to act as exporters for Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The incentives are now in place; they were contained in section 29 of the Finance Act.  Special trading houses will get the concessionary corporation tax rate of only 10 per cent, which up to now has been restricted almost entirely to manufacturing companies.  Investment in special trading houses will also be eligible for income tax relief under the business expansion scheme, so making it much easier for these enterprises to find start-up capital in the form of risk-taking equity.  In addition, special trading houses will be eligible for assistance from Córas Tráchtála on exactly the same basis as if they were manufacturing the goods they are exporting.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House this evening has the purpose of setting up a licensing system so that these very substantial incentives are used only for the purpose the Government intended when we introduced them.</P>
    <P>Let us not be in any doubt about this. We are not creating a device for creative accountants to play with.  We are creating a framework to create additional exports for this country.  We are fully determined to restrict the enjoyment of these incentives to bona fide trading houses that will fill the structural gap that exists in our exporting system.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the licensing system will be simple, fair and fast.  Its objective will not be to put an obstacle <Col N="3154" /> in the way of enterprise, but merely a fence to keep the cowboys out.</P>
    <P>The system proposed is outlined in section 2.  The procedure will be that companies seeking the status of a special trading house will have to make application for a licence to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  To support that application, the company will have to provide information about their proposed capitalisation, their general qualifications and expertise, and their business and marketing plans.</P>
    <P>The applications will be assessed by the Office of Trade and Marketing, after consultation with Córas Tráchtála.  CTT will be required to make a recommendation to the Minister on each application. It is obvious, that the on-the-ground expertise of CTT should be fully availed of in this evaluation process.  They are the closest to the export marketplace and is right that the Minister in making a decision should have access to CTT's informed view on the proposal.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides that the Minister can seek further information about an applicant's suitability.  One purpose of this is to avoid the need to impose an excessively detailed disclosure requirement on all applicants, whether relevant to their individual needs or not.  A further aspect of section 2 that I would like to refer to is the provision for an appeals procedure.  I am sure Deputies will agree that it is right that such a safeguard should exist.</P>
    <P>My office will shortly be issuing an information brochure outlining the licensing procedure, but I should like to take this opportunity to stress that I have no intention of creating a monster of red tape.  We want to encourage the setting up of special trading houses, and we want to see them in action soon.  From the response we have had to the idea since it was first mooted, I am in no doubt at all that there is both a real need for this initiative and a readiness to get involved on the part of people with the necessary expertise.</P>
    <P>The special trading houses will not, of course, be a panacea.  They are a specific response to a particular problem, which <Col N="3155" /> is only one aspect of the overall export challenge that faces us.  With that in mind, I now invite Deputies to turn to the second element of this Bill.  At section 3 it provides for an increase of £100 million in the aggregate level of grant-in-aid for Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing this aggregate figure arises every few years as an existing ceiling is reached through annual allocations to CTT in the Book of Estimates. The last increase was made in 1983, when the current level of £160 million was set.  The increase now proposed is expected to be enough to cover CTT's activities for about four further years. The measure we are no discussing will not, of course, affect the annual estimates exercise, which will continue to provide the House with the opportunity to consider the allocations to CTT in a particular year.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, moneys provided annually to CTT are expended on a wide range of support to exporters. These cover advice and basic information; specialist services in the field of market research; incentive grants to individual exporters entering new markets; and the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  In addition, CTT are involved in educational and training measures aimed at improving marketing skills in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>All of these services combine to provide a comprehensive support service to our exporters, and the provision at section 3 is necessary to enable CTT to continue to provide these supports. Indeed, the matter is of some urgency because the existing ceiling has now been reached.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing I have been reviewing the policy and activities of CTT, with the particular aim of focusing our investment on the encouragement and development of exporting by Irish-owned companies.  There is a need, in particular, to encourage Irish companies to approach exporting in a strategic way, carefully planning for the long term their involvement in the markets <Col N="3156" /> that offer opportunities for them. CTT can, and must, play the major role in getting this message across, and in my current review of CTT's activities I am considering how best the shift to strategically-planned marketing can be accelerated.</P>
    <P>It had been my hope that this Bill would reflect the outcome of my review of CTT's current strategy.  However, the two main provisions in the Bill before the House cannot wait until the other side of the summer, and so it was necessary to bring them before the House on their own.  I would like to assure Deputies that the overall restructuring of our export effort is one of the four main tasks that I see before the office for trade and marketing, and which I outlined to the House in my speech on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce last month.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill will make a very worth-while contribution to the future expansion of Irish exports and I therefore recommend it to the House for approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity formally in the House to congratulate Deputy Séamus Brennan on his appointment with responsibility for the office of trade and marketing.  He is not often in the House; his Minister is usually here at Question Time.  I understand he is the first Minister of State with responsibility in this area and I wish him well.  I will judge his performance not by the number of times he gets his photograph in the papers but by the output from his office and the offices under his aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple and straightforward Bill of four sections.  It does not involve a great deal of complexity. However, it is not entirely satisfactory that this Bill was circulated to Deputies so recently and taken so quickly.  It was only on the Order of Business today that the Order for Second Stage was taken and Second Stage is taken on the same day.  That is quite unusual in the business of this House.  I am not suggesting that it is disorderly in any way but perhaps in future we would be given the courtesy of <Col N="3157" /> more time to consider Bills given that this is a confined debate and there are only three hours for Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>

Fine Gael will not be opposing this Bill on Second Stage and we will not be putting down any amendments.  That is an act of goodwill on our behalf in relation to a number of aspects of the Bill.  That does not mean that we do not have certain reservations and misgivings about it.  I would like to put on the record a number of points specifically relating to trading houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was waiting to see in the Finance Bill a definition of a &ldquo;trading house&rdquo;.  I noticed that from the Second Stage to the Committee Stage it moved from being a &ldquo;trading house&rdquo; to being a &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo;.  Apart from section 27 there were no provisions in the Bill with regard to definitions.  In this Bill for the first time there is a suggested definition of a &ldquo;trading house&rdquo;.  It relies on what is defined as export goods as per section 39 <Col N="3158" /> of the Finance Act, 1980.  Is it possible under this Bill that trading houses could be established and get tax breaks and other concessions on the basis of reexporting imported goods?  Is there any element of bogus merchandising corporations being set up and is the terminology used explicit enough?  Will it affect the output of indigenous companies only or will Irish goods with a given percentage of Irish raw materials in them be affected also?  What will be the definition of indigenous and what will be the definition of the goods that are to be exported?  I do not wish this legislation to be excessively restrictive but given the tax breaks that go with this and the fact that the Minister and the Department plan that these should be the flagships of our marketing methods on the export side, there should be no loophole whatsoever.</P>
    <P>My major reservations about the trading houses are two-fold.  First, there is little evidence to suggest that the establishment of these special trading houses will generate new export sales.  They are far more likely to displace existing export marketing operations.  Therefore, it is very questionable whether the generous tax concessions and extra bureaucracy attached to these bodies will be justified. Unfortunately, in the Minister's speech, there is nothing but lip service and well meaning rhetoric; there is no factual or technical evidence to suggest that this will create new sales.  We all know, and I will refer to this later, that 80 per cent of small Irish manufacturing firms do not export at all, including Northern Ireland as an export market.  We know the problems are there.  We know that they have to export earlier in the lifetime of the company.  That is all there in the data base of information we have.  What we do not have is the information to say that their existing methods of selling <i>vis-àvis</i> an agent, <i>vis-à-vis</i> a distributor, will not be replaced by these trading corporations. We do not have the evidence to say that the existing CTT schemes, whereby there are subsidised personnel and marketing graduates placed in the export market itself, will be found wanting <Col N="3159" /> by the trading corporations.  I suggest there is no evidence &mdash; and I will come to the evidence to the contrary later &mdash; that we need more resources on marketing, we need more people on the ground selling Irish goods.  We know small companies cannot afford an export presence but that does not mean that other people will be able to do this by way of a corporation.  Perhaps the Minister would say exactly what evidence he has to suggest that the success of these trading corporations will not be based on displacing existing trading operations.</P>
    <P>Another point of great concern relates to past experience in this area.  The Minister of State will be aware that some years ago the National Trading Corporation, as it was called, was established whereby some very large companies were involved in a once-off venture.  They set up a very expensive office in Singapore and an expensive head office in Dublin and within a matter of months they went bust.  Given the track record of the people involved it was a monumental failure.  I do not wish them any ill.  I would love to have seen them succeed but the fact is that they did not succeed.  It was based on the same concept as these trading houses in this respect.  If, for example, Deputy Keating is selling handbags, Deputy Higgins is selling soap and Deputy Michael Noland is selling detergents and we are operating as a trading corporation, instead of selling as an agency basis in France or Germany and getting a 5 per cent margin for everything I sell of their products, what I as a trading corporation am asked to do is to buy all their products, take all the risks; they are now my products and I go and sell them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be the case and many small companies will be in that position.  Where they have no presence in a particular export market they might be delighted for me to buy them but the price might be arguable.  The point I am making is that there are very few people <Col N="3160" /> who are prepared to take on the full risk of the full cost of the product, the full overheads of exporting it and the full risk of getting paid for it and doing so profitably.  All the evidence suggests that it would be far more successful to do it on a commission basis.</P>
      <P>While I have given an example of a failure of a trading corporation, I would like to give an example of a success of a commission basis of export sales and that is the Irish Export Agency.  This is a nonprofit making organisation which was established by CTT and during the past ten years has generated £63 million worth of export sales of Irish goods.  It has been achieved without incurring any loss to the Exchequer and it has been done on an agency basis, mostly sales in Libya and Iraq.  That track record is the best way to go in terms of boosting Irish exports. What I am saying basically is that I am not against these trading houses.  I believe they will have some success but their success will be limited to Third World countries, that they will be successful mostly in the area of displacing existing export promotions and methods and will not create new businesses.  The only acid test, and the only yardstick whereby these can be considered, is the amount of new export sales they can generate. Otherwise we have created an expensive bureaucracy, we have created an expensive tax concession for something that would have happened in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill increases the provisions for Córas Tráchtála by £100 million. On the Second Stage debate we arew given a fair degree of latitude to look at areas of CTT's performance, or lack of it, and to make some general comments about export marketing.  Perhaps with a new Government, we do not know how shortlived, and with a new officeholder we will give him the benefit of some ideas we have in this area.  First there is an inextricable link between good marketing and high quality.  Unless you have a high quality product that stands up to the OECD table of competitiveness, no matter what resources are expended on marketing, it will not be successful.  Ireland's problem has been <Col N="3161" /> that in the OECD table of 22 countries we have always languished around 17th on that table, whether it is the quality of the goods, delivery on time, after care service or whatever.</P>
    <P>Another thing we must do is create an Irish quality symbol.  Let it be a very simple quality symbol, for example, a harp or something else uniquely Irish. Anything that satisfies either the Irish Quality Control Association or a particular section of the Department of Industry and Commerce that it has attained a certain level of quality should have an official stamp.  This particular logo or marking brand would help to sell Irish exports because it would be unique to Ireland and no matter who sold the goods it would show that as an Irish Government we were putting such an emphasis on quality that we recognised products that met that standard.  Companies that got the symbol and traded with that logo would then get preferential treatment for grants all along the line.  The best way to export anything, whether it is a tourism holiday or a manufactured product, is to have satisfied customers from New York to Singapore saying that they are satisfied with that product.  I ask the Minister to pursue the question of an Irish quality symbol.</P>
    <P>Second, in the Minister's export marketing drive, at a time of scarce resources, one always has to establish priorities.  It is very important in terms of overall export marketing that the West German market be established as a number one priority.  I say that for a number of reasons.  Germany has the greatest purchasing power among EEC member states.  It is the second largest importer in the world after the United States, and Ireland has already established a favourable trading record there. For instance, in 1985 the trade balance with Germany was £225 million.  There is a real potential for jobs and extra output and extra sales.  If Ireland sold as much <i>per capita</i> to the West Germans as we did to the Dutch we would create £1 billion worth of trade that could be sustained and repeated every year.  Different job figures could be put on that: I will not put <Col N="3162" /> a figure but we are talking about a very sizeable number of jobs.  I believe the type of products we have, particularly among our flagship companies, lend themselves to the German market.  It must also be remembered that Germany is an industrial nation and in terms of subsupply to the industrial market, Germany is the third largest supplier of goods.  Imports from Germany in 1985 amounted to £730 million.  Germany is a major investor in Ireland and we already have good links with them.  Germany is a source of substantial tourism revenue to this country, being our third most important source of tourism revenue.  In 1983 it amounted to £24 million.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible to penetrate the German market, given the changes in the internal market and given their high spending patterns due to their high disposable incomes <i>per capita.</i>  They have the money.  We have to learn that in Ireland we have cost factors; we have a 10 per cent cost disadvantage in this country because we are an island surrounded by water and on the periphery of Europe. We must go for the premium pricing markets. There is no point in the Minister, or his predecessors, or CTT saying that exports will reach £10 billion mark this year.  Much of that is transfer pricing by the big multinationals who have been induced here by the IDA through a facet of industrial policy, but it is not a marketing strength.  I know the Minister acknowledged in his speech that our export performance is very uneven.  We have the good and the bad, the good being those who are in the transfer pricing. However, West Germany is an area where companies such as Waterford Glass, Guinness and the large Irish indigenous companies can benefit.  I believe a particular strategy must be drawn up for West Germany.</P>
    <P>The second point the Minister must recognise &mdash; he referred to it in his speech &mdash; is that small indigenous firms are our area of weakness.  As I said earlier, 80 per cent of them do not export and would not even think of it.  They are purely concentrating on the local market and <Col N="3163" /> that is their weakness.  In addition, they have management weaknesses in that the person who owns a business runs it, is marketing and personnel manager and financial controller.  That is the identity of a small firm but it is also its weakness. We must get some concise strategy for these small firms.  There is no point in exhorting them to export if it is not going to happen because no amount of lip service will resolve that problem.  I have a very simple suggestion for the Minister. The simplest market for small firms to penetrate is a market where people speak the same language, drive on the same side of the road and have similar lifestyles and bureaucracy, that is, the British market and particularly the Northern Ireland market.  A special CTT initiative is required to zone in on the UK and Northern Ireland market specifically.</P>
    <P>Small firms have a problem with attitude; they do not think of the export market.  I would like to co-ordinate the efforts of chambers of commerce and different organisations.  We should bring them on a trip to London, Manchester and Belfast to introduce them to contacts there.  I know CTT are doing some of this in a very small way, which in my view is totally unsatisfactory.  I suggest, for example, that a group of small business people from, say, the Chamber of Commerce in Athlone who would never have exported but who would have products with potential be introduced to contacts in London and perhaps 5, 10 or even 20 per cent of them could subsequently have follow-up business.  Our first priority must be to target the West German market as they are a high spending market and as our second priority to encourage the 80 per cent of small firms who do not export at all to zone in on the UK and Northern Ireland market.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a Dáil question on resources to the Minister last week.  I think it was quite striking that over the past nine years £177 million was allocated by the IDA to established manufacturing firms that subsequently went out of business. There were 34,000 job approvals that were granted by the IDA that were <Col N="3164" /> subsequently taken back.  In the United States and in other countries they recognise that failure is a reasonable part of industrial strategy.  However, I believe we have too many eggs in the IDA basket.  The IDA continue to perpetrate the myth they can solve the jobs problem when they cannot.  Every local community is looking to them to fill an advance factory; they cannot but, at the same time, we are spending a great deal of resources there.  As Telesis, the industrial White Paper and the three year review of the Industrial Strategy argued, there is a strong need to divert money away from the IDA, to dismantle parts of the IDA and switch the resources into marketing, research and technology, because those are the two areas on which future growth will be based.  If my suggestions have a cost factor, I feel the onus is on me to say where the money would come from.  I would look at the IDAs resources.  I ask the Minister to check for his own sake if there are more people employed in the IDA today than ten years ago and handling a lot less business. I would like an answer to those questions.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister introduced charges for the services of CTT.  I make a special plea that these would not be arbitrary charges.  Charges are not necessarily a bad thing but we must have a degree of selectivity.  We have limited resources.  We have only so much manpower and fiscal resources to put into export marketing and we cannot back everybody's product so we must be selective and charging people who are prepared to pay for the service is one way of doing this.  But I believe the small firms have a major problem of attitude towards export marketing and if the charges are applied in an arbitrary fashion or across the board the very purpose of what CTT aim to do, to pick up the people who have potential products to export and who are not doing it for one reason or another, will be defeated.  I feel very strongly that there should be a particular exemption of charges for small firms.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a need to put together the Irish Goods Council and CTT.  The Irish Goods Council's buyers' campaign <Col N="3165" /> ran into difficulties when the EEC ruled it out of order.  I believe that CTT's brief should be changed to include import and export trade.  If it is possible to draw up a reasonable target and objectives for export markets to create extra jobs and output, it is surely more reasonable, given some degree of Irish consumer patriotism and Irish support for Irish products, that we should be able to displace certain imports with existing Irish industrial capacity.  The figures are quite staggering.  For instance, in the industrial market £700 million of imported goods could be replaced by the existing produce of Irish firms.  I am not talking about a company coming in here to manufacture the product and then substitute it; I say that existing companies in operation could do it.  In the industrial market we are talking about industrial engineering and other such products.  On the consumer market, the figure is £300 million for products such as food, clothing which could be directly substituted by companies making the exact same product here.  I believe a strong promotional drive is badly needed that could co-exist and be consistent with the policies and structures of the EEC but that would specifically reverse those figures and create the jobs.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a central point, which I specifically ask the Minister to consider. The Office of Trade and Marketing has now been established, which is a new departure.  With institutions such as the Marketing Institute of Ireland and the Marketing Society of Ireland we have a great deal of marketing expertise, and perhaps they have been part of a lobby together with the IMI and others who said we must put marketing first, that marketing is very important.  It has become part of our industrial policy jargon.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about marketing?  Are we to put Deputy Brennan into some job, keep him happy, make it look good that we have a sales manager, or are we to take a real decision about marketing and put it as the central focus to our economic drive?  Marketing is so important to us that we should decide our whole economic <Col N="3166" /> development strategy, our overall fiscal strategy, on what this country can sell, what this country has that other people want.  We have our ESRI and NESC who are advising us as our national planning board on what we should do, whether we should put money into the construction industry, or the clothing industry, or into one subsector or another.  Therefore, I am arguing for the consideration of the establishment of a national marketing council, not as another quango, not as having any executive function in marketing practice or methods, but with a central economic role of advising the Government even at the expense of abolishing the ESRI or NESC, so that we could decide as a nation that our economic strategy would be based on what we have to sell that people are prepared to buy.</P>
    <P>I have seen the IDA spend a fortune on industrial engineering plant and equipment and setting up big factories and Ireland with no experience in industrial engineering trying to sell into the German market.  That does not make much sense.  For centuries Britain has had a tradition in that area.  They have greater economies of scale and greater expertise than we have, and we expect to take them on.  Would it not be better for us to have a national marketing council to tell us that the matters we should pick for sectoral development are the food industry, the tourism industry and a few others, that all our resources should go into those and that we should market them comprehensively? The library of the CTT, which has an abundance of information, should be used to give an essential input to Government economic policy and thinking, and less of this consultation, less of this airy-fairy academic economic thought from the NESC and the ESRI. Get practical people in there who can say what Ireland can produce that people want to buy, and act on that advice. There is a strong case for such a central marketing council.  Fine Gael will be preparing policies in all of these areas that I have referred to.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, I do not believe that the time to produce one's ideas is on the eve of an election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3167" /> The time to discuss these things is now because they are important and urgent. I hope the Minister will consider these points.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister in relation to the operation of CTT why there was such a low uptake of the market entry and development scheme.  I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses who produced a report on this area in 1983.  One scheme, for which there was a great deal of representation and support, was supposed to be the best thing since the sliced pan for marketing in that it was going to facilitate companies with new products to have a market plan, to get the resources into the market and take it from there.  Looking at the figures I am disappointed at the low uptake of that scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will give some reason for that.</P>
    <P>A major change is just around the corner for the way this country trades, that is, the internal market by 1992.  I see all the relevant changes that will take place <i>vis-à-vis</i> the internal market, the areas where it has become easier to export and the pressures there will be on the home market, as marketing issues.  It is critical that someone takes full responsibility for the implementation of the entire market.  I know only too well that the Department of Foreign Affairs see their responsibility as negotiating on such matters as making sure that Ireland gets its point of view across on the way France is delaying with the importation of video tapes.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department of Agriculture and Food should look after the strictly food and agri end of things. Everybody has his own area but nobody thinks ahead and says that these are going to be the problems down the road.  In the same way when we joined the EC, traditional industries hit the wall with a very painful smack and other businesses will do the very same thing in 1922.  We must be prepared.  It need not be that way.  I hope something will be done in that area.</P>
    <P>In another area the Minister got into a <Col N="3168" /> tangle.  Perhaps he meant well and was not given the right support.  I am talking about the export marketing of fish and beef.  It was suggested one day that this might all be done under the aegis of the CTT and another day I had a Dáil question down about it and I was told quite definitely that the functions of the Minister of State did not include the exporting of fish and beef because that is a matter for CBF and BIM.  I understand the internal politicking of each Department wishing to hold on to each empire, but if BIM do not have the list of international offices abroad that CTT have in the EC, North American, Asian countries, the Far East, Australia and so on, it makes sense that CTT should have some role in the countries where BIM and CBF are not represented in the export of those products.</P>
    <P>I hope this can be sorted out.  The Minister will be aware that this was alluded to in the Fine Gael election programme where we said that you might get a better return for your buck if there was a more cohesive and somewhat rationalised market effort where everything that was Irish went through a particular office and you got the maximum output from each employee of CTT.  If BIM and CBF have not got offices in America, the Asian countries, the Far East and Australia, why should they retain a monopoly in trying to sell Irish fish?  The Minister might clarify that matter from his Department's point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the Minister's speech.  I was gravely disappointed because I think it was intimated in the media some time ago that when this Bill came to this House we would have some insight into what he was going to do and the findings of his review of current marketing policy.  I have tried to give him some ideas of where that might be, but I have a funny feeling that when the Dáil go into recess there might be a better chance of more column inches and it might appear then, but let us hope not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Not of policy but more of an individual perhaps.  This House should be the primary place for hearing of those policy developments.</P>
      <P>Under the industrial White Paper a facility was set up for this industrial management committee which is very cumbersome. It is all the State agencies under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce who were trying to wrestle back control of policy formation from the IDA, God help them!</P>
      <P>I wish to make two points in this regard.  I do not believe it is in CTT's interest to get sucked into too many company development programmes.  Too many people are trying to hold down jobs in the IDA and in other State agencies for schemes that are of questionable value. There is no doubt we have a weakness in terms of company management in many cases and that creates a need for a strong management agency, whether it is the IMI, the IPC or AnCO.  We have no streamlined management agency.  It does not make sense to ask untrained and improperly skilled people from the IDA or from CTT to set up some nebulous company development programme which is supposed to turn a company around, because that does not happen.  It keeps people in semi-State jobs.  I have met clients of CTT who are not satisfied, who think CTT are getting too sucked into that area and are not doing the job they were set up to do.  I hope that will be rectified rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of real success stories in terms of international trade and marketing.  There is the Mitty operation in Japan and the Labruska wine company in the United States, of which the Minister of State will be aware.  That company invented a product which was tailormade to a particular need in the United States, wine producing, and it was very successful.  There is a strong case to pick an Irish company, on a once-off basis, and to do everything to see what can be done to increase its share in particular target markets.  There should be integration along those lines.  We should pick flagship companies and the State agencies could rally in behind them, <Col N="3170" /> whether it is Baileys Irish Cream, Waterford Glass, Ballygowan or whatever and they should be targeted for a particular policy and programme for export marketing.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some points of the Bill again tomorrow.  I am slightly puzzled that the appeal should be to the Circuit Court.  The Minister said he wants the licensing procedure to be fair and fast. There will be some very senior counsel who will advise people who take a case to the Circuit Court that it should be appealed to a higher court, but this is unnecessary.  We have reached the stage where planning applications are dealt with by An Bord Pleanála.  I would have thought the most sensible thing would be for CTT to decide who should get licences and that the appeals would go to the Minister.  That would be a far simpler and more expeditious way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) states that the applicant has to have the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale of export goods.  It could be a nightmare in the Circuit Court to define whether or not somebody could do that job successfully, something that would be a projection over a three-year period or more, leaving aside that marketing at the best of times is a high risk venture.  There may be no basis for refusing to grant a licence under the terms of section 2 (5).  I know the intention is not to be unduly restrictive but I question the terms of that section.  I am intrigued the Minister has not said in his speech what form these trading houses will take.  Will they all deal with food processing or industrial engineering or will some of them deal with the consumer market and some with the industrial market?  I do not think the Circuit Court is a suitable body to deal with this matter because you will end up with expensive litigation.  The wording in section 2 (5) is so subjective and so nebulous that it could be a nightmare to refuse anybody a licence.</P>
    <P>Under the definition of exported goods there is also the question of whether the new concept of the international traded <Col N="3171" /> services sector, such as computer software, would be included as export goods. This is a growing area and I wonder whether we should extend it further.  This is a time when, especially with the advent of the withholding tax, we have very skilled people on whom we spent a great deal of money putting them through college &mdash; architects, mechanical engineers and different types of consultants in the building industry.  Why should we not let them form a trading house and let them sell their skills across the Continent where perhaps there may be some construction activity or public sector contract growth. We have already seen with the Masstock enterprise in the Third World what can be done in this area.  The area of exports will be very important in the future especially in terms of the construction industry.  If you want the construction industry to export, the best thing to do is to get the professions to export also.  I am not talking about people emigrating, I am talking about people selling an Irish service abroad.  I would like to know whether, as the Act is currently defined, those international traded services and professional services could be included.</P>
    <P>There will be teething problems with those export trading houses and some people will be unhappy with them.  There should be some facility in this Bill that would allow, by way of order, for certain changes to be made.  I am not an experienced parliamentary draftsman but I do not see in this legislation the terminology included in most legislation that allows by order the Minister to amend the regulations for licensing.  Instead of the wording in section 2 (5) it would be better to have, by order, with the publication laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the full criteria in exact terms whereby people would qualify for licensing, and that if it was subsequently found that changes were needed they would be properly and totally defined.</P>
    <P>I have tried to scrutinise this Bill.  First, it deals with giving more money to CTT, which is very simple provided the money is available and, second, it proposes to <Col N="3172" /> set up export trading houses.  We do not take a begrudgers' attitude to any innovation and development.  We wish it well but I warn that it will only displace existing export operations.  Given the previous examples of the National Trading Corporation and the Irish Export Agency it would be better to proceed on a commission basis rather than on a trading house basis.  I would like the Minister to take up the questions I have raised of a quality symbol for Irish exported products, that they would zone in on the German market, that small firms would go for the UK and the Northern Ireland market, that IDA resources would be switched to marketing in R and D, that small firms would be exempt from charges by CTT, that the Irish Goods Council would be taken under the auspices of CTT and that the export marketing of fish and beef products would also be taken under the auspices of CTT.  I hope I have been constructive.  I assure the Minister that I will be constructive at all times but if I feel his efforts are not up to the required standards I will also be the first to criticise him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>One never knows.  The <Col N="3173" /> measure proposed is a reasonable one.  It seeks in a particular way by incorporating incentives into the network of attractive inducements available to people in the entrepreneurial areas to recognise marketing. I have always felt that was something we have been extremely tardy in underlying as an important element in our economic approach.  The Bill is about marketing, about making that area more important, more attractive financially and encouraging more people into it.  I should like to make a number of points about that area, in particular the way the State pursues it.  It is staggering to consider that the cost of running the State agencies involved in marketing is about £150 million annually, a figure which is one-quarter of the total cost of support for industry.  That points to the urgent need to focus immediately on the rationalisation of some of those agencies.</P>
      <P>Many agencies were set up to deal with specific problems and needs of a decade or two or three decades ago.  Unfortunately, one of the difficulties with regard to the growth and development of semi-State bodies is that it is extremely difficult to extinguish them &mdash; in the nicest sense of the word &mdash; once they have done or are seen to do the task they were given.  If we want to make the Bill a success and take account of the concerns which the Minister voiced on a number of occasions, we have to create an efficient machine.  The existing machinery, that is the phalanx of semi-State bodies involved in this area, is not efficient or streamlined and needs urgent rationalisation.  There are no more than a handful of semi-State bodies that can deal in an efficient, effective and co-ordinated way with the major task of marketing our goods abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major need is to focus clearly on what that marketing target should be.  One of the difficulties with the Minister's approach in the Bill, and one of the difficulties with our own approach in terms of the grant aid we have given to industry generally, is that it has been largely responsive.  Strangely, that is one of the areas where the State could give a lead.  I am not sure whether we have decided we are going to be good at certain <Col N="3174" /> key areas of economic development or whether we are going to try to be useful in everything.  In my view our approach has been to respond virtually to every application for aid or assistance from whatever corner or source it came without any reference to a clear vision of what our marketing and economic purpose should be.  It is unreasonable and economically illogical for a small country to try to compete in certain areas of specialisation with countries whose economies of scale, expertise, resource base and so on are far superior to ours.</P>
    <P>We should target clearly on the area in which we have a reasonable chance of being excellent and then market in that area.  That means we will have to reduce our response, our grant aid and our encouragement of certain areas of economic and industrial activity.  I am not saying we should shock them overnight because that would be unreasonable and unjust to people in that area of work but it is illogical for us to pretend we can compete by grant-aiding virtually the whole spectrum of economic activity.  If I was asked to give a reason why we are to some extent in the economic doldrums, I would say that was one major reason, together with the size of our State sector generally.</P>
    <P>There is a problem of a lack of courage in deciding what we are going to be when we grow up economically and singling out those areas in which we can be the first in Europe and, indeed, the first in the world.  Other small countries have done that but I will not bore the House with examples.  Some countries with fewer natural resources, less skill and a less educated populace have standards of living and an economic life that is far superior to ours.  They have achieved them by saying, &ldquo;let us target on a niche in the marketplace in which we have a particular aptitude and let us be good at that&rdquo;.  If we are to create systems for encouraging trade and marketing, such as the Minister wants, we cannot do that unless we are direct in our approach and at some stage review our whole approach to investment and grant aid along the lines mentioned.  That refocusing of our <Col N="3175" /> industrial drive and rationalisation of our semi-State bodies are essential criteria if we are to be a success.</P>
    <P>It is important that Córas Tráchtála, or any State bodies, or the State body I am referring to, should have a clear remit. That is not the case in relation to any State or semi-State organisation at the moment.  I am staggered that there is no clear definition of what is a State-sponsored body.  I am not talking merely about the commercial State-sponsored bodies in the corporate sense as we understand them which seems to imply that if they are not in that august list they are bound to be non-commercial which is untrue.  There are many State-sponsored bodies who spend public moneys without any accountability.  I am talking about any body or organisation that receives State funds.  Many of them receive State funds at second or third hand, on occasions from local authorities, health boards or VECs and as far as I can see, none of them is accountable to anybody. Indeed, in many cases they make no response on how they spend money. However, I am talking primarily about the bodies involved in the area of industrial promotion and marketing.  I am convinced there is not a clear remit or function or understanding of their role for many of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, in the course of a speech on Thursday, 28 May in the House, talked about the need to ask fundamental questions and he addressed some of those in this way, where do we want to focus the attention of CTT?  It may be that I am speaking to the converted but the need for an extremely clear remit cannot be overstated.  The absence of that clear sense of purpose is, unfortunately and tragically for the State and every worker in it, one of the sad hallmarks of the State effort here.  So many people of high capacity have no clear sense of direction or purpose and are relatively aimless in the way in which they respond to the effort which their organisation should be or is pursuing.  We owe it to all workers in State bodies, <Col N="3176" /> and to the taxpayers, to get that clear statement.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider that point when he is considering some form of review of CTT. He hinted in May that it might be in the form of legislation.  Although I am not clear why there is a need for legislation to clarify the role and purpose of CTT, he may have more fundamental functions in mind.  I would ask him to bear in mind the possibility of extending equity rights to workers because it appears to me that that is the direction in which we should go.</P>
    <P>Those three areas are vital if we are to achieve the purposes for which this Bill is intended.  First, there is a need to rationalise State agencies.  This will not be easy because there will be lobbies and protests but the time has come to try to deal with this area in an organised and systematic way.  Second, we should focus on precisely what we are supposed to be doing economically, and, third, we should clarify the function and role of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta because that is not as clear as we, or indeed CTT, would like to to be.</P>
    <P>On 28 May the Minister was talking about the areas of concern to his office and spoke about the reduction of the cost penalty on Irish exports.  He said that from an export viewpoint our energy cost too much, our telephones cost too much and our insurance costs were too high. One of the ideas my colleagues and I are looking at is the possibility of reviewing our approach to grant aid to industrial development and the possibility of putting a substantial increased sum of money into infrastructure, and obviously a reduced sum into direct grant aid to various companies.  In this way the various costs to industry can be reduced, the economy may be helped, the possibility of a Hyster case occurring again, and the inevitable degree of rip-off which occurs in the odd case, may be reduced.  This is a thought which I would commend to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that by way of subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, directly related.  For <Col N="3177" /> example, I would see it functioning as a direct subsidy to local authorities specifically geared to, say, the roads programme or to any particular need of industry, but it would have to be related directly to the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not a direct subsidy to the company.  That would probably be administratively cumbersome and might not result in what I would call a filter through to the economy.  If we improved our infrastructure in the broadest sense of that word, our economic climate would become more attractive, input costs would be reduced and the need for once-off grant aid of a massive nature to individual companies might not be as demanding in terms of the companies needs to cope with those costs.</P>
      <P>The concept of trading houses is reasonable and we support it.  This was heralded in the Finance Bill and seems to be a modern, skilful and versatile way of dealing with a specific problem.  It is time we recognised the anomalies which existed in terms of our traditional approach to grant aiding only manufacturing industry when there are many service industries, the marketing profession and areas of export and co-ordination of those facilities which are legitimate areas of economic activity, give genuine added value and create employment.  Deputy Yeats suggested that all this might do is to displace some existing areas of economic activity, but I am not convinced that that will be the case if what the Minister said is correct. He said there was clear evidence that there were companies who wanted to get involved in this field but which were at a relative disadvantage to those in manufacturing and if one had a choice one went into the area which was more attractive.  I wonder if that is the case, and what was the research base for that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marketing skills is an area where we have some strengths, but I believe we are not in the forefront in this respect.  We have a home based economy and many of our companies are introverted.  There <Col N="3178" /> are immense opportunities abroad which Irish companies rarely think of or seek out.  I wonder if more emphasis should be put on every facet of marketing, not just on our economic activity but on our educational endeavour at third level colleges. We do not hear a great deal about this in third level curricula and I wonder if we should start stressing it a little more.</P>
    <P>From my experience with third level education &mdash; on vocational education committees and in college &mdash; I felt it was an academic environment and was not related to the real world.  If one spoke about marketing one was looked on as somebody who should be somewhere else because it was not a legitimate area of academic study; it was too close to the sweat and toil of the marketplace.  I wonder if we should get a little tougher in that respect and demand more compliance from the educational system with our expectations of what the world needs from our graduates, particularly as we are spending large sums of money in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problems with the concept of trading houses.  I was relieved to hear the Minister say he does not intend to have an elaborate complex and debilitating process and review of applications. I agree with Deputy Yates that if at all possible we should avoid referral to the courts for anything, but also for this particular purpose.  Some form of fair trade ombudsman or an agency might be able to make a sensible assessment.  If the Minister turns down an application I assume he will do so for good reason, or at least for a reason which is, to his way of thinking, reasonable in the circumstances.  I am not sure that an open-ended appeal to the courts is the way to resolve difficulties.  I hope not too many applications will be turned down, and that those who receive licences will be successful.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister means it when he says that he does not want to add to bureaucracy in the realm of State activity.  If he operates an efficient simple system it will be a flagship because one of the complaints we get regularly from people who are trying to get a company <Col N="3179" /> off the ground is that they get the umbrella when the sun is shining: they get the money when they prove they do not need it, they get help when they no longer need it, and the degree of paperwork and the cost involved in preparing a business plan for some of these agencies is so off-putting as to be discouraging.  I hope that will not occur in this case, and the Minister has given us degree of assurance which I welcome.</P>
    <P>It is probably a source of irritation to Coras Tráchtála Teoranta to have this section interpreted as a grant for CTT. As I understand it, this section facilitates the Department in making payable to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta over an unspecified period, grants as the Government of the day see appropriate.  I do not know why the section appears in this fashion.  I assume it is because other promotional agencies get their money in the same way.  In my view, it is a nonsensical way of doing business and I cannot see any difference in principle between the operations of other arms of the State and this one.  It may even have an effect on CTT which is undesirable in the sense that coming towards the expiry of the limit, which was £160 million, it may impede or inhibit CTT's activities.  They may feel that this will require new legislation. Accordingly, there will be no guarantee and we may have to soft pedal for a year or two.  I do not know.  Nobody has said that to me but I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on the need for a section like this.</P>
    <P>Would it not be more realistic and sensible to dispense with this need for totting up the aggregate amount of the sums which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may pay to Córas Tráchtála? One of the problems, for example, is that it makes no allowance for the real time value on money.  It does not make any sense.  Obviously, the value of a pound a decade ago is not the same as it is now. It is peculiar way of doing business.  Apart from that, it may afford an extra opportunity for CTT to come under the scrutiny <Col N="3180" /> of this House with the result that they might be discouraged or even misinterpreted. I am all for scrutiny but in this case it is not the ideal way of doing business.  It might be more efficient to look again at financing CTT directly.  We have an opportunity annually on the Estimates to look at CTT's performance and this device is somewhat outdated in its approach and does not coincide with my way of thinking in relation to &ldquo;up and at' em&rdquo; type of semi-State bodies if the Minister has to come in, presumably in four or five years time, to allocate more money.  It is unnecessary and perhaps the Minister will comment briefly on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need to give priority to Irish owned companies in playing a full part in bringing about export growth.  There is a clear need for that although there should be no distinction between our warmth of response to Irish companies and others.  There is sometimes the feeling &mdash; I am not sure if it could be scientifically verified &mdash; that if you speak with an Irish accent as opposed to German, Dutch or Japanese you get different treatment.  I do not see any evidence for this but it is perceived among industrialists and business people that that can happen.  We should take every opportunity to give Irish owned companies reasonable encouragement as other countries, including those in the EC, make no bones about encouraging in a specific way &mdash; a discriminatory way on occasions &mdash; their own companies.  We have particular economic problems here and we owe it to our own companies to give them every possible opportunity and not to be daunted by the huge scale and flashy credentials of some of the larger international companies who play the international market and, as we know to our cost, unfortunately on some occasions fly the coop when it suits them.</P>
    <P>The problems Irish companies have in relation to exporting should be combated, not merely by the special trading houses, but by the encouragement of some form of co-operative approach in these areas.  I am a strong believer in the co-operative idea which, unfortunately, is too often interpreted as a last resort <Col N="3181" /> for a failed company.  I am talking about a sensible, rational, organised, comprehensive approach by groups of companies with broadly analagous aims in regard to penetrating the marketplace.  It should be possible for them &mdash; or for CTT in conjunction with them &mdash; to create marketing tools which can do a task for a number of companies.  I am talking about promotional and advertising material, market research and all the other things which at present many companies are trying to do on their own.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to a lady in a cottage industry who was literally getting on an aeroplane flying to New York to sell very fine &mdash; in so far as I could judge &mdash; Irish cheese.  She would have been gobbled up before she got to the high street in New York but she was doing it on her own. There is strength in numbers in a case like that and the need for a co-ordinated approach to marketing is vital.  I encourage the Minister to develop a range of inducements to facilitate that, apart from the special trading houses which are peculiarly economic and which obviously give particular benefits in the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and the business expansion scheme incentives which are good in themselves.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note that, in considering applications, the Minister will insist on ensuring that there are no cowboys. This is an opportunity for people who do not want to get into the heavy capital intensive area or heavy capital investment to make submissions.  No doubt, some will see it as an opportunity to make a fast buck.  I hope that will be guarded against and the precautions which the Minister outlined seem reasonably adequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the last increase in an allocation to CTT was made in 1983 when the current level of £160 million was set.  He said that the increase now proposed is expected to be enough to cover CTT's activities for about four further years.  I do not understand this way of doing business and perhaps the Minister, when looking at the legislation, will consider whether CTT might be funded in a more rational and up to date way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3182" /> This is a reasonable attempt to bring in efficient, clearly understandable, intelligible legislation.  I commend the Minister for introducing it so speedily as we have been wont in the last week or two to be a bit critical about the time allowed to deal with these issues.  This is a fair measure and I hope it will be successful. We look forward to having a detailed discussion on Committee Stage and we will not be obstructive in any way.  I commend the Bill to the House and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I congratulate Deputy Séamus Brennan on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for marketing and I wish him success.</P>
      <P>There are many welcome features in the Bill but I should like to begin by setting the proposals in context.  Let me stress a few assumptions and their importance in relation to discussions on marketing and export level growth. There is an overall assumption in the suggestion that some of the main obstacles to export led growth are marketing deficiencies and an internationally competitive free market.  The first qualification that must be made is that the evidence is against that.  If you are serious about the economics of marketing, you have to look at facts rather than fantasies. The fact is that the structure of the internationally traded sector in commodities is dominated now more than ever by conditions of oligopoly and monopoly.  They are very far away from conditions of perfect competition.  Therefore, you have to take that assumption on board and it is not the case that you can simply produce high quality goods more effectively and sell them to the people waiting for commodities to be placed on stalls in a free marketplace alongside each other.  What has stayed in place has been both the economic theory and the myth of the policy-makers relying on a rather stagnant economic theory.  The economics of perfect competition have long outlived the realities of the marketplace of the world.  This is just simple fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3183" /> The second assumption follows logically, which is that increased market competitiveness will result in increased exports which will, in turn, not only increase, somehow or other, the productive base of the economy but it will impact on unemployment.  It is significant that this word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;&mdash; the dirtiest word in the Irish economic vocabulary; very few use it now and those who do almost do so at their peril &mdash; is not used at all this evening.  Let me examine that chain of assumptions for just a second.  The fact is that in considering the improvement of Irish exports through marketing we would have to ask initially what are true exports and what are bogus exports.</P>
    <P>I shall turn to that explicitly in a moment because it is very necessary to draw a distinction between, for example, companies which are producing goods, seeking to market them and exporting them on to those markets effectively and other companies which are simply using Ireland as a location and by a series of well known price trading arrangements purchasing commodities at one price in a tax favourable environment, selling them on in certain conditions and grossly inflating the actual volume of exports.  I know we are a people known for our flair for myth and fantasy, but very often there is no greater example of myth and fantasy than the total volume of our exports. They have to be corrected to try to get an idea of what is, in fact, something realistic happening within the Irish economy that might conceivably turn into employment generation.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for a second against export led growth.  I am being very careful about this and simply expressing a qualification that I believe to be a reasonable one in terms of traditional &mdash; and I emphasise that word&mdash;centrist economic theory at present.  It is the further assumption that even if such exports were real they automatically trickle down with benefit to the entire community, resulting in employment.  This again ignores one of the great realities of modern economic trading, that is, that exports are far more <Col N="3184" /> capital intensive now than they ever were.  The Minister has wisely stayed off the unemployment theme for that very reason because, like a person with a decent training in economics, he understands that what can be achieved within this realm is something which will be minuscule in relation to its contribution to unemployment or job creation in Ireland.  He equally would realise that not only far from acting on unemployment it certainly cannot impact on poverty.</P>
    <P>One of our great dilemmas of the present time within the social policy &mdash; and those of us who have the honour and privilege to serve in this House must bear that in mind &mdash; is that income can no longer be simply handled by an approach towards the economics at work and neither can it be reduced simply to the notion that by increasing marketing you increase exports, reduce unemployment and reduce poverty.  That is unadulterated rubbish in conventional terms. Unfortunately, people who make a living from peddling such fantasies do not have to live with the reality of unemployment and far less with the reality of poverty and thus the theory outlives its victims.</P>
    <P>I want to turn in some detail to some of these assumptions.  I welcome this Bill but I am in no doubt whatsoever as to what it can achieve.  I simply wish the Minister's initiatives well.  I shall turn to them in a moment.  I want to correct this notion.  I shall suspend my judgment for a moment about some of these assumptions and concentrate on the text of the Bill before us.  One should ask on Second Stage why this legislation is necessary. First, the legislation is once again a motivational exercise.  It is not taking an initiative in terms of establishing State agencies, or State trading companies, or anything like that.  It is inspirational.  That is the modern term used.  I have described this in much less heady language very often as trying to stir the carcase of a dead cow into action.  That is rather like what getting the Irish private sector to produce at all, to trade at all, to train their workers at all is like.  We take from general taxation &mdash; massive levels of taxation by European standards &mdash; and <Col N="3185" /> expend it across a variety of agencies to stir this dead cow into life and hope that she will give milk.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, looking at the historic performance of the Irish private sector, to its credit it has never gone so far as to say that it wanted to create a single job in the Irish economy. It always wanted to trade at a profit.  It did that on the domestic market for a while in the old days of protection, and gave us that phrase which the literary people like of &ldquo;old money&rdquo;.  Then when we were opened up to the winds of free trade, the winds blew and a great number of industries went to the wall.  People were not able to trade in the new circumstances and we got involved in a whole series of incentives to the Irish sector.  We also became involved in inviting foreign investment here.  I am not arguing against that either, but I do object to the notion frequently put forward that such companies locate here out of some kind of international benevolence, as we would be led to believe.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that we have hopped from one economic strategy to another.  We had a period in the early days of this State of moving quickly into protectionism.  After protectionism, after opening up the Irish economy so-called, we began to look for foreign led investment in relation to manufacturing.  At that stage our official theories were hostile to the services sector and hostile to natural resource based development.  I remember listening to the most atrocious attacks on people like myself who suggested that.  Then, rather late in the day, our Industrial Development Authority became converted to the idea of a natural resources development and also to internationally trading services.  They are now more or less saying that internationally trading services can be the leader in providing jobs and I hope they are successful for the sake of the highly trained, highly educated young people who may take up these jobs.</P>
    <P>What is missing from it all is any attempt to link the population projections which Dr. Brendan Walsh and others were providing in the sixties into <Col N="3186" /> any kind of strategy of income, of work, of industrialisation, of trading, of marketing, or of wealth creation, and so forth.  That must be said because, let us be perfectly clear, I am responding to the mention in the Minister's speech of the context in which these efforts are being made.</P>
    <P>In 1983, a Bill very similar to the present one passed through this House. The purpose of that Bill at that time was to provide £160 million for Córas Tráchtála.  The purpose of this Bill, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, is to increase that figure to £260 million, but also to create the concept of licensed special trading houses which have been described by the Minister.  In this regard it is rather to attract special trading houses to come into existence.  Here we have a small problem.  Different economists commenting on Ireland's Industrial strategy have commented on a number of things.  They have commented upon the fact, as has been mentioned already, of the need to establish in the internationally trading centre significant niches in which is established excellence with which we could identify.</P>
    <P>We have part of the embryonic technology already.  We could purchase technology and direct our policy at that particular niche in the world market. They also said that in many of these identified sources of hope in relation to trading, the level of investment was higher than could be provided by the Irish private sector and it certainly was beyond the terms of credit provisions and was far beyond what the Irish banking sector would invest in.  Our banking sector, modelled as it is on a conservative British banking sector, is totally at odds with the banking sector in Europe.  The dogs in the street know that.</P>
    <P>In the European money market one can borrow on the basis of inspirational technology, on the basis of patents, on the basis of any kind of export opportunites one may have.  Trying to borrow here for a new venture in productive manufacturing, in servicing, in trading, in marketing, or whatever, not only would one be asked to supply impossible <Col N="3187" /> guarantees but the time horizon is too short, the collateral requirements are too severe and one would be asked to take the risk of bankrupting oneself and to put the roof over one's head at risk.  All of this occurs in a banking environment that is enjoying high interest rates with little risk taking.</P>
    <P>Over the past seven months I have been accumulating a list of the receipts of the Irish banking sector from local authorities, health boards, semi-State agencies and so on.  They have been making a fortune on no risk activity charging a rate that is admittedly their best rate to their highest borrowing customers with little risk attached.  The atmosphere of risk taking or of risk taking facilitation does not exist in Irish credit institutions, and it never has.  They will hop along for a ride when the State has taken most of the risks.  They will fund small borrowers willing to take risks if some major investor comes along, but they are not innovative.  The point one of the ERSI's most distinguished workers, Mr. O'Malley, has made in one paper after another published by the institute is that we would probably need to concentrate on a number of very large companies and we would need to give them State funds and establish State agencies if we are ever to get off the ground in relation to achieving some impact and to capturing some employment.  Reference was made to other European examples. This is exactly what took place in countries about which we are hearing so much. It is what took place in Denmark, Finland and so on.  In Denmark it was a mixture of State and private purchasing strategy in relation to technology and the evidence is that it has worked in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of increasing the funding to CTT.  We have no choice in relation to trying to market abroad.  While I said this was a Bill which was inspirational, trying to motivate this sluggish entity, people should not be expected to believe that from me.  The surveys of the Irish Management Institute, hardly a radical left wing rhetoric using organisation, showed that less than 3 per cent of companies <Col N="3188" /> had a marketing function at all and in the under 5 per cent league was personnel functions.  Companies neither thought it important to relate to their employees nor to sell but there were lots of other kinds of courses on offer about how to feel like an executive in a decaying Irish company, or how to have pretensions in a company selling very little internationally.</P>
    <P>I spent my life reading brochures for such courses and I spent time reading the largely conservative Irish press which day by day becomes more of a marketing organ in itself for the egos of the people who have large shareholdings in them. There is just an obscenity in all of this. There is no hard thinking.  There is just sloppy thought given to the idea that an international seminar, for example, given the conditions of the Irish economy with 250,000 people unemployed, would bring Mr. McGregor and other people like him from Britain to give us lectures on how to break strikes and wreck the British industry.  It is an extraordinary thing.  Let us not be drawn down that road.</P>
    <P>We should be under no illusions. Interest rates can drop here and I think they will.  Equally, our exports may increase.  According to an OECD report our present inflation rate is probably at its lowest in 20 years.  We are having high exports, but we are not sure whether or not they are real.  Interest rates are dropping but where is this investment taking place?  Where investment is taking place it is taking place in speculative rather than productive ventures.  The evidence there is not mine either.  They are the views of Dr. Whitaker expressed again and again when he witnessed to the appearance in the seventies on the Irish Stock Exchange of the number of operators who were effectively asset strippers, who bought shell companies, looked at the balance sheets, sold the assets, displaced the employees, threw them on the waste heap and, at the same time, handed the bill for creating jobs to the Government and to the IDA.  They became millionaires and stayed there to impress people with simple peasant outlooks with their ostentatious lifestyles and their lavish behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3189" /> I have listed countries where such behaviour is not only anti-social but illegal.  They were asset strippers who did not create jobs.  I could give lists of them here, but the Chair would probably encourage me not to do so.  I have many other places in which to do that, and I would not hesitate for a second.  The fact is that that is the kind of person who was investing in Ireland in the seventies and who was abusing the Stock Exchange for that purpose.  They went like a dose of salts through some of the older companies, keeping the name of the company, the shell of the company operating and so forth, without creating any wealth that would create a single job.  At present, if they are listened to, they are lecturing us endlessly on the spirit of enterprise, the spirit of the dog kennel. These people are voracious, greedy, anti-social, anti-national people who decided they could make a vast fortune out of buying companies, throwing the workers on the scrap heap, not creating genuine new jobs and then deciding, by the sale of assets and other things that fluctuate, to invest in different things.</P>
    <P>There are no ethics in this at all.  No other country in Europe has the same relationship between investment in shares that are quoted on the Stock Exchange and newspapers.  The relationship that exists in Ireland is one that is not allowed in a number of countries.  It would be illegal because of the jaundiced intersection that is possible.  I keep returning to this because I hope, if this Dáil lasts, to be in a position to bring legislation before the House through Labour Party private Bills which will put an end to this jaundiced intersection about which I speak.</P>
    <P>In 1985 Irish exports reached a level of £9,743 million producing a surplus of £314.8 million over imports.  I welcome those figures in relation to trade.  Anyone should welcome them.  I do not want to dispel the mood of optimism that is being created.  I realise that there is something to this.  There are times in human history when feelings take over from reason and they propel people along a certain road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3190" /> The Government are trying to create a psychological atmosphere of optimism that we will get things going.  I like those phrases, and people should be encourged if they believe in them, but it is useful to do a little thinking as well.</P>
    <P>The question about the surplus of exports over imports is good.  The Minister will say there is a problem about these figures, but I am not asking him to solve that.  However, there is a question about the way in which they are calculated. Perhaps of more value is the fact that there has been a sustained performance of surplus of exports over imports and there is no doubt that we should give credit to CTT for what they have contributed to achieving this surplus.</P>
    <P>When I have met some of the leading members of Córas Tráchtála I have been very impressed with what they said about the importance of marketing.  They have attempted to do something the private sector was not willing to do.  There have been improvements also in the trade of food and in the trade of technological equipment of a certain kind.  However, I enter a caution here in relation to chemicals, information products and technology. The figures should be adjusted. The question is whether we are more an international warehouse than a trading economy and when the rates for the warehouse change will other warehouses bid us out of existence?</P>
    <P>The final reports of Digital Ireland &mdash; which is located in my city and which is very welcome there &mdash; refer to the fact that we have been worth nearly £1 billion to them in terms of their being able to put their products through the country to the different market locations.  The argument people always come back to me with is, &ldquo;Should you not be grateful they are doing it here rather than anywhere else?&rdquo;  Of course, like the poor peasant who went up to the landlord and said: &ldquo;Would your honour like to give us a little more for our potatoes this year, sir?&rdquo;  I have to take my peasant's cap off as well as a citizen of this country and say: &ldquo;Yes, sir, thank you very much sir, <Col N="3191" /> and please do not go to Costa Rica or Portugal or wherever&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Because I cannot bring myself to lie about these things, it is my regret that I have to strike such a bleak note.  Having listed the successes about exports and Córas Tráchtála's role in the story, the successes and the public relations hype that is being built around these trading surpluses is distracting from the deep core problem of the Irish economy.  The deep core problem of the Irish economy is unemployment and the poverty that is flowing from it.  What is happening in relation to unemployment is that more and more we are moving, for example, in the inner city area of Dublin, to a third generation of unemployed people.  In other parts of the country there is a second generation of unemployed people.  With unemployment there comes a chain of non-participation.  Because people have no basic incomes &mdash; the Social Welfare Act, 1981, is a panoply of different provisions of assistance of different kinds &mdash; they are falling down through the floor of participation in society and they are not participating more and more.  We are creating a new culture around unemployment; we are creating an under-class.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make, and I cannot make it sufficiently strongly, is that it is wrong to say that performance in the export-import ratio is a sufficient answer to those who are asking about economic performance in relation to unemployment. It is not justified by the fact that the majority of academic opinion in economics and social science, to their eternal disgrace, have neglected the unemployment problem.  It has turned economics into something like a cross between predicting the racing page of a paper and soccer results.  There is no point in quoting export-import figures as other than just what they are.  They are trading surpluses and they might or might not mean something.  In order to get their full meaning one has to tease out what is involved in the actual export, how much of it was price fixing between different locations and so forth.  It has to be <Col N="3192" /> adjusted back so that one can get the true value of it.  It does not help any more than just that.  It is one indicator and it should not be used and abused as it is at present.</P>
    <P>The figure for unemployment at present stands at over 250,000.  This belies the well-used maxim of all the party leaders I hear speaking about unemployment.  They are decent people but I think they believe this dangerous nonsense about economics.  They say that exports create jobs, sacrifice creates jobs and low wages create jobs.  This is what I hear every day.  The fact is that gradually we are getting the interest rates that are more favourable &mdash; although it is a slower operation than any of us would wish &mdash; we are getting all the incentives to industry, we are getting the lowest inflation rate in 20 years, we are getting a curtailment on incomes, we are curtailing public expenditure but we are not getting the jobs.</P>
    <P>Let us keep our heads about all of this. Export we must and export we must into niches in the world economy in which we can develop an excellence.  We must do this effectively and establish agencies such as the Minister described.  However the Minister is not establishing these agencies: he is making himself available to license them.  The problem about that is that not only is the Minister available to license these agencies but, as the Minister said honestly, they have to have certain criteria laid down.  It is correct to lay down criteria but I cannot see how you can on the one hand say that people have to have an established expertise, marketing skills, knowledge and so forth and at the same time start from scratch trying to bring in new people and new intelligence. That will be very difficult and I am not here to make it more difficult; I am simply saying that I identify a paradox within it.</P>
    <P>The most interesting figure to look at in all of this is that as we went through the years exports increased.  In 1981 exports were £4,777.6 million and imports were £6,578.4 million.  At that stage the imbalance was on the side of imports over <Col N="3193" /> exports.  That has been turned around and it is a good thing.  The average industrial wage in 1981 was £112.25, output per worker was 108.4 and unemployment was 141,000.  In 1982 exports were £5,691.4 million and imports were about £6,816.2 million, the average industrial wage was £126, the output per worker had grown to 110.5 and the unemployment figure was 179,000.  I could go on but I do not want to be tedious.  The figures were beginning to turn around and the output per worker was growing. In 1981 it was 108.4, in 1982 it was 110.5, in 1983 it was 126.4, in 1984 it was 146.8, in 1985 it was 15.6. and in 1986 it was 164.2.  The output per worker was growing all the time and the incentives to produce, to trade and export were growing but, at the same time, the figures were growing inexorably.  In 1981 there were 141,000 unemployed; in 1982, 179,000; in 1983, 208,000; in 1984, 225,400; in 1985, 239,900 and in 1986, when we had those good trading figures we had 250,200 unemployed.  I do not want to hear again the suggestion that by simply turning the trade figures around we are impacting on unemployment.  It is not happening.  It is a contribution but what has to be done is that the export figures have to be adjusted, and you have to look at the employment content of them and the way in which wages are calculated.  Then you will find that a different strategy is needed.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister of State he has not said that what he is proposing will solve the unemployment problem, but he is at the trading tip of a set of economic policies that are failing in relation to unemployment and will continue to fail because they are not really looking at the productive sector of the Irish economy. We would all like if there were a productive economy but there is not an investment strategy, there is not an incomes policy of some kind that would be able to ensure some kind of basic income, there is no intent to change the social policy that would create a basic income, nor is there any real concern about the chain of deprivation that exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3194" /> Let us be careful about how Mrs. Thatcher can say that the export order books of Britain are full, fuller than they have been for many years at a time when not only have all the workers gone from the north of England manufacturing sector but there are chains on the doors of the factories and the managers have gone and left that part of Britain.  They are trading very well in Britain but they are trading existing produced commodities which do not have the same knock-on effect on production as we would hope here.  The figures I have quoted show that exports have doubled in five years, with a surplus of exports over imports for the past two years.  Despite a disgraceful reduction in the paid workforce we have fewer people working productivity of workers has continued to grow from a base of 100 in 1980 to 164.2 in 1986.  Wages, although they show a steady increase, have in fact fallen behind the real cost of living and as the productivity rates indicate workers are getting less money for an ever increasing output.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to quote these statistics.  They are stark and unpleasant reminders that exports do not necessarily mean jobs.  They show that despite a rise in productivity, a growth in exports and a reduction in jobs, the Government and the business sector still come back for more.  They want more.  They still want to pay less.  They still want to get away with having fewer workers.  They still want more incentives paid for by the taxpayer. Now they want another source of inspiration.  The position is even worse than that.  We are now, at the stage of being lectured every day as to what we must do if we are to be competitive.  The fact is that the most uncompetitive thing in European trading history has been that the very private sector who are lecturing everybody at present.  What is private about them?  They do not train their workers, they get depreciation on their equipment, they get writes off in relation to what is one of the lowest tax regimes in terms of production in Europe.  They are assisted in every way.  Their workers are educated by the State.  Their export agencies are trying to sell for them.  When <Col N="3195" /> some of the companies get into trouble, that news is never published.  The first question addressed by the media usually is if there has been a strike in the company. The question that is never asked by the Irish media &mdash; it is afraid to ask it &mdash; is if there has been bad management.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the history of Fóir Teoranta produced before this House because it would show one long agonising litany of the incompetence, laziness, bad training, bad orientation towards business and so forth which closed down the work prospects of thousands of workers. We must ask, too, whether rises in productivity have meant greater rewards for workers.  They have not meant a rise in living standards that go beyond income. As there is a higher productivity per worker, as there was in 1980, of about 64 per cent, the ordinary worker leaving the workplace is witnessing a cutback in State activity in a whole range of areas, in education, in services provided by local authorities, health and so on.  This is an incredible situation and I am availing of this opportunity to raise the matter because it is very important.</P>
    <P>Our export policy was funded from the Exchequer in 1983 to the extent of £160 million.  The present Bill could conceivably raise this figure within four years to £260 million.  I hope the trade figures will continue to go right but I must ask to what extent it will impact on the kind of problems to which I have referred.  I am not, unfortunately, as enthusiastically optimistic as the Minister of State and his colleagues.  I want to refer to the difficulty the Minister has in setting up a State initiative to try to lure the Irish private sector to get itself together to start trading and marketing.  At paragraph 6.6 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy it is stated:</P>
    <P>Financial institutions generally are not geared to the provision of finance where no asset backing is available as collateral.  Nor are they geared to the accommodation of a repayment pattern entirely related to the results on <Col N="3196" /> an investment such as that associated with the new export project.  To overcome these financial constraints it is proposed that the risk attaching to such investment be shared by the state; the financial institutions and the exporters. CTT will accordingly introduce a market entry and development finance scheme on a pilot basis. </P>
    <P>People do not have to believe my views about the economy.  That is what the White Paper had to say about the financial institutions.  It rather reminds one of the greedy undertaker waiting for the people to die all around him.  The Irish financial institutions fit well into that image.  I have not seen &mdash; and I read their annual reports &mdash; where they have enthusiastically taken a new patent, a new technology or a group of scientists and said to them &ldquo;the bank has money to set you up&rdquo;.  Deputy Yates wanted to go to the German market.  One would not get very far except to the poor house with the philosophies the banks have in relation to collateral.  It is antiquated, it is wrong in terms of time horizon, it is too short and it is completely wrong in relation to the strength of the collateral they are asking.  They are a perfect reflection of a decaying economy rather than an economy of growth.  I am not sure how this can be changed around.  I may have some ideas about it.  It is unlikely that I will have in the short term an opportunity of bringing about change in this area but there are things which could be done in relation to credit policy. I am sure the Minister of State experiences the same kind of frustration as I experience in relation to the conservative banking policy under which Irish exporters suffer.</P>
    <P>What the spirit of the White Paper suggests is that it is rather like children deciding who will put their toe out, and saying, &ldquo;let us all put our toes out together&rdquo;.  The attitude in the White Paper was that the State should put its toes out.  It could put its big toe out as it always does and gradually the last people to put their toe out would be the financial institutions.  Before we knew where we <Col N="3197" /> were we might have a whole foot outside in the cold.  That is the interpretation in the White Paper.  What we do not have is any suggestion that should our little toes be covered with gold, we should have a share in the rewards when we had drawn it back.  There is no suggestion about sharing profits but rather that the unemployment burden be borne disproportionately by those whose colleagues have produced higher productivity, and who have watched their colleagues disappear from the workplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvement in the export position but this improvement is in the interests of the financial sector. The community in general have not been the beneficiaries.  Despite the criteria laid down by Córas Tráchtála and the spelling out of clear priorities for industry in Ireland business has taken what suits its needs and left what it does not require at this time.  I am a little weary of listening to spokespersons for the Confederation of Irish Industry talking about the great octopus of the State when they themselves are beneficiaries of a whole raft of State agencies.  What they are saying is that it would be nice to freeze the State so that it would enhance productivity and we could continue to take from the sections we have been taking from for some time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the theory adduced in the Minister's speech &mdash; he is correct in some parts at least about the identification of markets &mdash; the export market has grown. If you take it separate from the figure as to the growth in exports a good question to ask might be, and perhaps the Minister might address this, which markets are we performing in?  Are they markets we have lost, which markets are we penetrating for the first time?  This is a much more interesting question for a number of reasons.  We still have an over emphasis on the British and North American trade. Equally, and I heard a great deal about this, we have the benefits of trading within the large block which constitutes the European Community which is left somewhat unexploited.  There are a number of reasons for this.  It is not as simple as Deputy Yates suggested.  He <Col N="3198" /> was going to storm the German market with his products: may it work for him but the fact is that it is not simple as that. He is right in adducing an element of a more general problem that there are many aspects of the European market which we have left unexploited.</P>
    <P>There are two other sources of markets we have neglected totally.  One is the Latin American market which, for reasons of our own, we have expressed very little interest in.  Despite the growth in population in the world and the increase in the need for food, the easiest contract for the supply of many of our products is in fact in that part of the world where there is a favourable orientation towards us but we have been unwilling to explore or to penetrate that market.  This is reflected equally in references made to this by our attitude in diplotmatic terms towards that continent.  We have one representative in the entire continent of Latin America, our diplomatic representative in Buenos Aires.  You then travel across the whole continent to Washington to get the next person who is accredited to the whole Latin American or Central American continent.  We are not interested.  On the other hand we have the obscenity of having invited the South Koreans to open an embassy in Dublin.  Let me not stray off on that because I would be quickly reminded to stick to the terms of the Bill.  We have neglected the Latin American market.</P>
    <P>We have also neglected a whole series of markets, including the African markets where we had marvellous opportunities for taking diplomatic initiatives. Several African countries have indicated to me while I was visiting that they were anxious to trade with Ireland as opposed to other countries because of our history and so forth.  But our history has been rewritten.  We are no longer the decolonised country anxious to sell abroad to countries such as Latin America and the struggling African countries and so forth. We are the neo-colonised country that has an obsession about the British and American markets.  That is why we neglect markets which we think might upset our United States trading partners <Col N="3199" /> or would upset a trans-national or multinational company.  Equally we open diplomatic relations with these countries. We will pay a terrible price for that kind of exclusivity as probably the greatest crash in economic terms of this century is not unlikely &mdash; I will be cautious &mdash; to happen in the United States economy.  It is staring everybody in the face that this is likely to happen in the next ten years and our dependance on that kind of trading relationship makes us all the more vulnerable.</P>
    <P>One of the points I made &mdash; I could only find the 1985 report from Córas Tráchtála which was the latest available to me when preparing my remarks on the Bill &mdash; is that half of the exports from Irish owned companies in both the manufacturing and primary sectors went to the United Kingdom, as compared with a quarter of the exports from foreign owned companies.  On the other hand, the European market, other than the UK, accounted for one-eighth of exports from indigenous firms and close to half of the exports from foreign owned companies which were established in Ireland since our membership of the European Communities with the explicit purpose of supplying continental Europe.</P>
    <P>My point is that the Irish indigenous firms, faced with a vast European market, only export one-eighth to that market while at the same time the companies who have come and located here are selling half of what they are selling into that market.  We have to examine that and stop evading the question of the pricing policy of these companies and its implication for the true export figures. The annual report of Córas Tráchtála also makes the point that the diversification of Ireland's export market has not, therefore, been evenly spread between Irish and foreign owned companies.  The importance of the United Kingdom market for our indigenous industries should not be underestimated but, while exports to the UK are increasing, we are simultaneously losing market share in a number of sectors of particular importance to indigenous industries.  Córas Tráchtála <Col N="3200" /> make the point that at least we should be able to hold our own in the market close to our capital base.</P>
    <P>I find Deputy Yates's suggestion &mdash; who I never realised was a romantic &mdash; that we should tell small exporters to concentrate on Britain and tell people over a particular size to go for markets other than Britain a truly extraordinary one.  There should be some assistance to try to keep what we have in the UK market and see whether we can change our product content of sections of that market.  What we gather from the statistics and my interpretation of them is that the pattern of Irish export growth gives one the picture of a self-propelled market, responding to the daily needs of consumers and not projecting itself or providing leadership, and certainly not exhibiting any policy acceptance of what has been suggested by some of the best economic opinion, that is, that previous choices had been exercised in relation to niches in the international market and decisions on levels of excellence established.  This is not a criticism of Córas Tráchtála.  It is a criticism of the policy makers who are responsible for the productive side of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>In that case I am very grateful to Deputy Brady.  I am anxious to facilitate him as I understand he wants to contribute to this debate.  I shall be brief and draw my remarks to a close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill I do so with a cautionary injunction to the Minister that we are, in fact, operating a policy at present in which exports occupy a part, but the construction of that export policy goes far beyond the bounds of what it would warrant.  We have pumped millions of pounds into the industrial sector and provided generous incentives to encourage industrial development, let me take a chance on a figure that I recall <Col N="3201" /> from somewhere.  Would it be £1.3 billion for about five years?  We provide corporate rate taxes of 10 per cent, grants, interest subsidies, loan guarantees, advisory services, employment grants, retraining grants and so on.  I welcome one point in the Minister's speech.  He said there will be criteria for evaluation of what are realistic proposals, but I notice there is no reference to employment creation potential.  When chapter 6 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy looked at export development, it decided it would also avoid any reference to the employment creation potential of the particular activity.  The fact is that a surge in exports can go on and can increase and the trade figures can stay right, even if some of them are a bit bogus in the method of their calculation.  The fact is &mdash; and this is not a reflection on anybody; it is the nature of things &mdash; that a surge in exports will not be accompanied by a depression in the unemployment figures.  It may not lead to creation of wealth and jobs and true growth.  For that reason we should be cautious in what we propose to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not assisted in his new ministry by the confusion of functions that exists, for example, in the marketing of fish and marine related products which is now staying with BIM.  The Minister will have some difficulties with the start-up of his new trading agencies.  I hope he is successful in this but the concept of the trading houses is very much an abstraction at present.  I want to ask a question about it.  How does the Minister propose &mdash; and we can deal with this on Committee Stage &mdash; to deal with the phenomenon of fronting?  Let us say that you already occupy a portion of an international market and you decide you want to control the supply to that market how do you deal with the situation where you get an Irish national &mdash; and there has been no shortage of them in the many different activities &mdash; to front for you?  I think the Minister is as anxious as I am to stop the abuse of the new incentives that will take place.</P>
    <P>I disagree with those who have criticised the Circuit Court procedure because I think it is a good idea to have <Col N="3202" /> an appeal outside the system that would be able to answer the question of favouritism of one kind or another.  Perhaps the idea of bodies that make decisions on their own decisions within their own realm of accountability is quite limited in terms of accountability.  Therefore, I welcome the principle of the Bill and the initiative the Minister is taking.  I wish him well in his ministry.  I hope he will be successful in establishing this and in building in all the cautions.  As somebody who has been exposed to what was once the respectable discipline of economics, I urge him to continue his efforts acclaiming that exports can solve the unemployment problem and to bring what influence he can to bear on the members of the Cabinet even at the peril of reducing some of their optimism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Time has overtaken me. I had intended to make a more lengthy contribution than I am permitted to do now.  At the start I offer my belated congratulations to the Minister of State in charge of trade and marketing, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and wish him continuing success in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I give this Bill my absolute, unqualified welcome.  It is the lifeblood of this economy that we engage in the most energetic exports, and the concept of special trading houses situated abroad will provide a breath of fresh air throughout the exporting part of our economy.  Given the recent success &mdash; the Minister referred to £1 billion of exports within a calendar month and a projected £10 billion &mdash; and the fact that over half our GNP is created by exports, nobody can overstate the importance of this area for growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me concentrate on a few areas of our export initiative I would like to see the Minister take particular note of.  One is our food industry.  In the context of the Chernobyl experience and the fact that Europe is reeling from the effects of that catastrophe, the market is wide open for vegetables, processed foods and all exports of that kind into Europe.  There is a very pressing need to be energetic as we are a market garden of Europe, and <Col N="3203" /> to exploit that market to the greatest extent possible.  Consider the huge success of An Bord Bainne.  We are proud to see &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;, to mention one product, on sale throughout Spain, the Canary Islands and so forth.  That is an example of the type of success that can flow.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister had to criticise some of our manufacturers for lack of consistency in meeting deadlines.  This is important, too.</P>
    <P>The second area is high technology specialised industries where again we can exercise great influence.  In the optical industry, Bausch and Lomb, in Waterford, to mention one, employ 500 people and a great example of the successful model of an export industry.  Many European countries fly in people to look at the operation of that plant.  There are many others.  Let me refer briefly to the impending success of a new concept of Irish technology, that is space technology. We read of the great success of one of our prominent professors in astrophysics, Professor Susan McKenna-Lawlor, who is fronting a tremendous advance in space technology for this country.  This is a growth area that demands specialised training for the export yield from that type of industry. The profits are quite substantial.  Again this area should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to tap the resources of many of our highly trained graduates who have had to emigrate in recent years through no fault of their own.  It is a fact of life that we have a huge young population.  It is a temporary problem which will abate as years go by but for the moment we have this harsh reality of emigration taking place particularly in the area of high technology and of professional people going abroad.  If the Minister taps into these people who are abroad in many different countries, corrolates their endeavours and brings them together I am sure he will find that there will be a bond among them in doing their bit for their country.  Perhaps they will have had experience of work effort in the country <Col N="3204" /> in earlier years and can be brought together to assist in our export drive. Given incentives of this kind a 10 per cent setoff involving private enterprise is what it is all about.  Many countries have shown that private enterprise, given the correct incentives, the right temperature and the right climate in which to trade, is the way to create lasting jobs in manufacturing industry.  Things are looking bright at the moment.  We have stablised inflation and our interest rates are coming down.  At last a greater work ethic is developing where people value their work much more than they used to.  These atttitudes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to use these few minutes to thank Deputy Yates, Deputy Keating, Deputy Higgins and Deputy Brady for their contributions and particularly for their courtesy and their good wishes.  I thank them all for the very constructive proposals they have put forward and which I will respond to in detail on Committee Stage of the Bill tomorrow night. I will be asking your indulgence, Sir, at that time to expand on the large number of areas which have been raised by the speakers, ranging from the detail of the trading house proposal to a reasessment of CTT's activities and to a much more fundamental reassessment of our whole economic stragegy, a matter raised by Deputy Higgins.  We have a lengthy time for Committee Stage and I hope to take at that time the points Deputies have put forward.</P>
      <P>I value and welcome the list of recommendations put forward by Deputy Yates.  In concluding this Bill I will proceed in a spirit of co-operation so that the ideas which have been put forward by the speakers can be taken account of, if possible before we conclude.  However, given the tight schedule we are operating on that may not be strictly possible on this occasion, but the spirit of what they are saying I assure them will be taken into account.  I will avoid dealing with the details of the trading houses and details of the queries raised in regard to the abuses which can arise, why there is need for the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;, the Circuit Court appeal and all those items.  In the time available to me I will not attempt to get into all of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3206" /> I welcome the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  I believe the new office of trade and marketing is providing a focus for and a leadership to Irish exports which they require.  I hope to bring before this House in the future a package of measures which will give us that focus to a greater extent. I am also looking at the affairs of CTT to see how best we can focus their activities in the future.  As I said publicly many times, I want to take the soft edge off the subject of marketing and I want to take away the notion in this country that CTT are a soft touch.  I want to encourage Irish industry to be market led as opposed to being just production led for its own sake. I believe firmly, from my examination to date, that there are huge opportunities abroad for Irish exports of goods and services.  I hope my office in the months and, I hope, the years ahead can show leadership in that regard.  I ask the House to agree to the Second Stage.  I will reply in detail to all the points made when we come to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate gives the House an opportunity to discuss trends in and prospects for the two important sectors of our economy for which I have responsibility.  I welcome this opportunity to articulate clearly the Government's views and plans for these sectors.  I look forward to the constructive debate which I know will ensue, given the wealth of experience and knowledge in these areas available within this House. I can assure Deputies that I will, as I have always done, take full cognisance of their views in formulating future policy in areas for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>On assumption of office, the Government announced a series of administrative changes to reflect the economic and social priorities which they had been elected to implement.  One of these was the formation of a new Department of Tourism and Transport which combines the tourism functions of the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry with the transport functions of the former Department of Communications. The revised Estimates before the House relate to these functions.</P>
      <P>The tourism and transport sectors are exceptionally important both in terms of their existing contribution to our economy and also their potential for wealth and employment creation &mdash; a potential which has not been adequately tapped in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, there is an undue obsession with the demand aspects of macro economics in this country.  While it is important to ensure that the level of aggregate demand is maintained at a sustainable <Col N="3208" /> level, we must also ensure that its composition is conducive to increasing economic growth.  This is the primary task the Government have set themselves.  We are going for economic growth.  We have the policies to achieve it.  We will succeed by creating an economic and business climate conducive to confidence and enterprise within a framework of consistent, fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.</P>
    <P>Imaginative micro economic policies are also a pre-requisite for sustained economic growth.  We will concentrate on developing those sectors whose output can be sold in international markets.  In keeping with this philosophy tourism has been chosen as a major target area for the generation of wealth and jobs.  Tourism will, by the end of this century, be the largest single industry in the world.  It will not be IBM or General Motors, but tourism.  With a good quality and competitive product marketed professionally and sold aggressively we can substantially increase our share of this rapidly growing market, with all the ensuing benefits for wealth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>On coming to office, we found a tourism sector sapped of confidence and lacking the leadership and commitment it was entitled to expect from Government.  Our first priority was to restore confidence and give a clear sense of direction to the sector.  We wasted no time in setting about these tasks.  The swift merger of tourism with the crucial area of transport was a clear signal of the Government's commitment to harmonise these sectors to the betterment of both.</P>
    <P>On 3 May, less than two months after we assumed office, I announced a comprehensive programme of initiatives to boost tourism in 1987.  The main elements of this programme were set out in our document, Ireland in '87.  I have that document and I could go through the details but as time is limited I will not delay the House at this stage.  I may be able to deal with this matter when replying. This was phase 1 of the Government strategy for their tourism programme in 1987.  Phase 2 is to follow this up with <Col N="3209" /> contributions from the industry supporting the Government initiatives.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that my Department had a series of very constructive meetings with all the main operators in the industry.  The outcome of these was the series of measures which I announced to the House on 14 May. On that date I expressed my gratitude to the operators for their contributions. Again I want to emphasise that the constituent organisations and the groupings involved in the tourism industry were more than co-operative in this effort to launch a new initiative in the tourism industry.  I should like to reiterate my thanks to them today.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks that I would take full cognisance of the views of Deputies in formulating policy. As an earnest of my commitment in this regard I ask the House to note that the petrol voucher scheme which I announced on 3 May has been extended to all of Britain.  It has been originally intended for administrative reasons to confine it to the London area which is our largest market.  However, in response to suggestions and representations by Deputies I was pleased to be able to broaden eligibility for the scheme.  I know this will please Deputies in those constituencies, like my own, which draw tourists from many parts of Britain outside the London area.</P>
    <P>While our 1987 programme is designed to significantly increase tourist traffic in 1987 it will undoubtedly have a positive knock on effect well beyond that.  It is intended that it should have that knock-on effect.  My Department are currently working on a comprehensive medium term plan for the development of the industry to ensure that the drive for growth in tourism started in 1987 will be maintained into the nineties.</P>
    <P>We have just received a first draft of the consultancy study of State expenditure on tourism, commissioned by the previous Government.  We expect to receive the final version shortly.  The consultant's findings will be a major input into our plan.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to give the <Col N="3210" /> House details of the Exchequer's allocation to tourism this year.  Including the token Supplementary Estimate the allocation for Tourism in 1987 is £25.065 million excluding the provision for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Of this total, £24.154 million is being allocated to Bord Fáilte.  The token Supplementary Estimate of £1,000 includes the transfer, from within the transport element of the Tourism and Transport Vote, of the sum of £1.251 million to Bord Fáilte and £1 million of this will be used by the Board to undertake, in conjunction with the carriers, a promotional campaign to capitalise on the Government's recently announced programme of measures.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte will spend approximately 25 per cent of the additional £1 million on promoting the new air fares and other incentives in the North American market.  A breakdown of the £1 million expenditure by market is as follows: North American, £250,000; Britain, £320,000; Continental Europe, £355,000; Home, £75,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the attention of the House to the £355,000 for continental Europe, an area we must target and attract more tourists from in the future. I ask the House to note the £75,000 for the domestic market.  That is important because it is the equivalent of exporting.</P>
    <P>The balance of £251,000 will be used to cover the cost of promoting a petrol voucher scheme for British visitors taking motoring holidays in Ireland and redemption of the vouchers.  This transfer has been made possible by an increase in non-Exchequer receipts generated under the transport element of the Vote; £200,000 of the expenditure will be used to redeem the petrol vouchers.  Under the scheme 20,000 vouchers valued at £10 each are being made available for British motoring tourists to Ireland who booked a holiday to Ireland after the scheme was announced.  To be eligible for the £10 voucher a visitor in advance of travelling, must produce evidence, <i>exempli gratia</i> ferry ticket, to show that he booked a holiday to Ireland.  Media response in Britain has been excellent, strongly reinforcing <Col N="3211" /> the image of Ireland as an ideal location for motoring holidays.  Latest indicators show that already, only three weeks after the launch, the rate of increase in British car arrivals for this month has more than doubled the rate of increase for the first five months of the year.  The balance of expenditure, <i>id est</i> £51,000, will go on advertising &mdash; postage costs associated with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The board's overall subvention to the regional tourism organisations in 1987 will total £2.016 million in 1987 compared with £2.336 million in 1986.  The reduction in the board's subvention to the RTOs is unavoidable given the cut in the board's own budget.  We expect the private sector to contribute a substantial amount to even the score in that area.</P>
    <P>In so far as Bord Fáilte's tourism capital development programme is concerned £2.176 million is being provided compared to £3.340 million in 1986.  The reduced capital allocation is due entirely to the termination of the hotel and guesthouse reconstruction and development grant scheme.  When this scheme was being introduced in 1986 it was announced that it would operate for one year only.  The Estimate also includes provision of £1,120,000 for tourism and traffic development by SFADCo which plays an important role in tourism development and promotion particularly in the mid-east and west of our country. I have already given the House my assessment of prospects for the 1987 season so there is no need to cover that ground again.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the other sector for which I have direct responsibility, namely, transport.  I have a dual responsibility here.  First, I am responsible for regulating the transport sector in a way which will contribute to an improvement in national competitiveness and sustainable employment creation and, secondly, I represent on behalf of the Irish people the shareholder interests in the major companies operating in this sector. Governments in the past have been accused of confusing these two roles.  Let there be no confusion about where this <Col N="3212" /> Government stand.  Our primary responsibility and commitment is to develop an efficient and competitive transport sector to support the Government's goals of creating sustainable employment and economic growth. Having established this framework our second responsibility is to ensure that our State bodies perform well within it.</P>
    <P>In keeping with this overall philosophy we introduced a series of innovative measures in access air transport on 3 May last which will not only benefit the tourism industry but also many other sectors in our economy.  Details of those measures have already been made available to the public and the House.  On the European front I welcome the prospect of greater competition in aviation as a healthy development.  International aviation must break away from the traditional mould of regulation and create a more competitive air transport system.  I shall continue the work undertaken in recent years to expand the development opportunities for Irish carriers.  Ireland has been to the forefront in seeking a more competitive air transport system within the EC.  At the Transport Council in March, I emphasised that it was a policy priority of the new Government to generate additional tourist traffic to Ireland and that one of the ways in which this could be achieved is through the adoption of measures to liberalise air transport in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Council made substantial progress in agreeing more flexible fares arrangements also, but I stressed that liberalisation in the market access area was of critical importance to Ireland.  The potential for growth in all sectors of the Irish economy is directly related to the proximity of Ireland to the heartland of the Community.  This can be achieved through the expansion of the network of air links between Ireland and Europe and through the opening up of opportunities for profitable expansion of air services.  I stressed to my council colleagues that any package of air transport measures designed to promote additional competition in intra-Community air services would have to make some provision for <Col N="3213" /> fifth freedom rights.  In the coming months, I will seek liberalisation measures which will promote competition on routes between Europe and Ireland but also provide commercial opportunities for the development of more routes.  I should like to tell the House that at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow I shall be at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Strasbourg and, as far as I can anticipate, we will be dealing with the liberalisation of air transport for the whole day.  In particular we will be dealing with the gaining of fifth freedom rights for our carriers which is essential to our programme for development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have now embarked on their 51st year of trading.  The international environment within which they operate has changed dramatically over the past few years.  Following years of losses in the first half of this decade the company returned to profit in 1986 and are expected to do so again in 1987. However, a disappointing feature of the group's performance has been the fact that their core business &mdash; air transportation &mdash; has only made a marginal contribution to overall group profits in the last few years.  Furthermore, the level of profitability has not been sufficient for it to renew its basic plant &mdash; aircraft.  It must do so.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that the company is currently engaged in a fundamental review of all its costs with a view to increasing profits to a level where it can afford to replace its equipment to a standard compatible with a company of Aer Lingus' stature and renown for a quality product. We had some discussion of this today at Question Time.  I can assure the board and the employees of Aer Lingus that its profits will continue to be available to it for reinvestment.  Indeed, knowing the ethos of the company, I am sure they would prefer to fund their fleet replacement programme in this way.  The concept of subsidy, in whatever guise, has been alien to the Aer Lingus way of thinking over the years.  I am proud to say that the current management have carried on this tradition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3214" /> Aer Rianta are another body of which we can be proud.  Their performance over the past few years justifies this pride.  I am also grateful to them for providing the bulk of the extra revenue I needed to finance the 1987 tourism programme as already outlined.  While air tourist traffic has increased at a much faster rate than anticipated at the beginning of the year, Aer Rianta must be congratulated on translating this extra volume into extra revenue.  I am hopeful that if present trends continue, they will even surpass the revised income target for 1987 which we set them in April last.</P>
    <P>The Dublin runway project is the largest single infrastructural investment ever undertaken at the State airports.  As well as the runway itself, the project will include the provision of a parallel taxiway system, advanced navigational and visual aids, a new air traffic control tower-technical building and consequential road works.  The project will provide several hundred jobs and will be one of the largest construction projects in north County Dublin over the next four years. Preliminary expenditure of about £800,000 was incurred on the project in 1986 and this was financed by an Exchequer grant.  Total expenditure on the project in 1987 is expected to amount to £10.7 million of which £2.6 million will be financed by the Exchequer from subhead D3 in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>A number of other major investment projects are also planned for the State airports in 1987.  These include the re-organisation of the departures floor of the terminal building at Dublin Airport, an extension of the apron and pier building at Shannon Airport and certain works on the extension to the main runway at Cork Airport.  It is expected that State expenditure of about £1.5 million will be incurred in these areas in 1987.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the allocations for regional and local airport projects which are covered by subhead D8, I am not making any provision for new projects in this area in 1987.  The 1987 provision is mainly required to discharge commitments <Col N="3215" /> which have already been made to certain projects.  I am satisfied that the funds which have been made available by the Exchequer for the development of regional and local airports have been generous, especially in the prevailing budgetary position.  Furthermore, the network of regional airports is now reasonably adequate for the country's requirements.</P>
    <P>I would also like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate Connaught Regional Airport on the commencement of operations at the airport.  The spirit of enterprise, determination and courage which has characterised the development of the airport has been an inspiration to all of us.  I am particularly delighted with the airport's recent successful introduction of scheduled air services to Britain and I believe that these services have a major role to play in the economic and financial development of the airport and of the west of Ireland in general.  I can also assure the promoters of the project of the Government's continued goodwill and interest in the development of the airport.</P>
    <P>An allocation of almost £2.5 million is provided for the Air Navigational Services Office in 1987.  The main projects to be carried out during 1987 are the installation of new main VHF communications systems at Dublin and Shannon airports and the provision of a new radar simulator for the Air Traffic Services Training School at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The affairs of the B &amp; I have been extensively discussed in this House in recent weeks.  I will, therefore, confine my remarks to the latest developments. Deputies will be aware that the Government decided recently to make available to the B &amp; I additional equity from the Exchequer of up to £8 million in the period to end October 1987.  Of this amount, £6 million will represent an advance payment of the equity allocation for the company proposed by the previous Government for 1988.</P>
    <P>As I told the House today at Question Time I had a meeting with the board of the B &amp; I on Friday, 22 May to inform <Col N="3216" /> them of the Government's decision.  I conveyed to the board the Government's extreme concern and dissatisfaction that, notwithstanding equity injections totalling £25 million since February 1986, the company were now forecasting losses for 1987 which would be more than double the 1986 loss of £6.8 million.  I told them that this situation was totally unacceptable to the Government.  I am aware that the B &amp; I have lost traffic by virtue of competition from low air fares but in my view too much has been made of that factor.  After all, the air companies cannot compete with the car ferries. Competition is a fact of life and a commercial company such as B &amp; I have to react positively and aggressively to changes in their commercial environment.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh a fhios agam go raibh teorainn ama ann.  I recognise also that a major contributory factor to the company's serious financial situation has been the disastrous strikes which occurred in the B &amp; I earlier this year. It is incomprehensible to me that such strikes should have occurred at all given the B &amp; I's financial position.  I have told both the board and representatives of the B &amp; I unions, whom I also met recently, and I got a very good response from them, that if the company are to survive it will be necessary for the board, management and staff to face up to the need for drastic and radical change which will eliminate the company's losses.  I have directed the B &amp; I board to submit to me as soon as possible a plan of action for implementation in the autumn.  Between now and then, the Government will be considering the position with a view to a long term policy decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude my review of the international dimension of the transport sector with a brief reference to our international road haulage industry.  Last month, agreement was reached at a meeting of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport on the allocation of <Col N="3217" /> additional annual multilateral authorisations permitting haulage throughout participating States &mdash; that is a larger remit than the EC states.  For the remainder of 1987, Ireland will have 39 such authorisations.  The organisation of our domestic transport sector, which I propose to deal with under appropriate headings, is also a major determinant of our competitive position.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Act, 1986, will complete the process of liberalisation of the national road haulage industry over a two year period.  Since last September, road freight carriers licences are being granted on an unrestricted basis to existing licensees and to operators in the exempted areas who held current road freight certificates at 30 September 1986. With effect from 30 September 1988, similar licences will be granted to all applicants who satisfy the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence. Because the liberalisation is being phased in over two years, it will be another 18 months or so before it will be possible to assess the impact.</P>
    <P>The Transport (Re-organisation of CIE) Act, 1986, led to the establishment of the three new subsidiaries &mdash; Iarnrod Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath &mdash; which started trading on 2 February last.  Note I am using only the Irish version of their names.  I was impressed with the smoothness of the changeover in which the co-operation of the staff of CIE was obviously an influential factor.</P>
    <P>Experience with CIE in the years 1984-86 has been good.  The deficit was £4,000 in 1984, a year when accumulated deficits brought forward were close to £59 million, including a deficit of £20.6 million from 1983.  In 1985 the board made a profit of almost £7 million and the unaudited figures for 1986 indicate a profit for last year also.  These profits have gone towards offsetting the accumulated deficit of earlier years.</P>
    <P>The results for 1985 and 1986 would have been better if the financial commitments in respect of subvention payments made to CIE by our predecessors in office had been implemented in full. <Col N="3218" /> Because the last Government did not honour their commitments, CIE had to borrow to meet their financial commitments. The consequential interest charges are reflected in the board's results.</P>
    <P>The shortfall related first to interest payments on the capital costs of DART, to which the last Government committed themselves in 1984.  That Government decided, however, on a number of occasions to defer payments to CIE instead of making the payments as they fell due.  When I came into office I found that payments totalling over £30 million, relating to 1985, 1986 and 1987, had been deferred to 1988.  If account is taken of interest on borrowings which CIE have had to undertake to cover the delays in payment the shortfall exceeds £34 million.</P>
    <P>The second shortfall relates to the subvention for CIE's general operations. The previous Government decided in late 1985 to defer until January 1987 subvention of £9.2 million which was due for payment in 1986.  A similar decision was taken in relation to the 1987 subvention, except that the amount deferred to next year amounted to £11.2 million.</P>
    <P>In all, the shortfall in payments to CIE arising from the non-fulfilment of the previous Government's commitments exceeds £40 million.  Indeed it totals approximately £45 million if interest on consequential borrowings undertaken by CIE is taken into the reckoning.  The shortfall is a major problem and the Government are clearly not in a position to make good the shortfall or any part of it.  There is an obligation on me to review the position and I will be doing that in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority have now been in existence for approximately six months.  While the Authority have been charged with the assessment of transport infrastructure proposals and public transport services in the Dublin area, one of their more immediate concerns is traffic management involving a number of technical management projects.</P>
    <P>Subhead C4 of the Vote provides <Col N="3219" /> £365,000 this year towards the costs of such developments while, under subhead C3, a provision of £300,000 has been allocated to meet the Authority's current expenditure.  The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the primary legislation governing the regulation of road passenger transport services.  Over the past ten years or so there has been a considerable increase in the number of private operators providing unlicensed bus services.  The legality of some of these operations is doubtful.</P>
    <P>As a result of these and other developments over the 50 years or so since the legislation was enacted, the provisions and the operation of the 1932 Act are being reviewed in my Department.  That review is at an advanced stage and, before year end, I hope to bring before the House amending legislation which will take account of the needs of the travelling public, CIE and private operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Estimate although I regret we do not have much time.  When we speak of tourism and the projections for 1987, we seem to draw comparisons with 1986 which is erroneous and misleading when we take account of the fact that 1986 was, in real terms, probably the worst year for tourism in modern times. We should make comparisons with 1985 or even the years immediately preceding that; indeed comparisons with any year over the past 20 would be more realistic than 1986 which was disastrous mainly because of the reluctance of the Americans to come to Europe as a result of acts of terrorism in Europe and the Middle East.  Those acts, whether carried <Col N="3220" /> out in the Middle East or Europe, emanated from the Middle East.</P>
      <P>I was listening to RTE radio this morning and I heard a typical, snide remark about the United States which does not help our image in that country or the cause of tourism.  The remark was to the effect that last year's tourism in this country was affected by the uninvited incursion by American forces into Libya.  I should like to point out to RTE that our tourist industry would still be in the doldrums in 1987 if those acts of terrorism had not been nipped in the bud in 1986 by President Reagan and the United States administration.  It is not an occasion for snide remarks or for blaming the remedial action taken in our interests and to use it as an excuse to have a go at President Reagan or the United States. By stopping terrorism in the Middle East and Europe, we have reaped the benefit of a huge upsurge in tourism from the United States.  Anybody willing to bring back law and order and a civilised relationship in Europe and the Middle East is to be complimented, not denigrated. Our airwaves should be used for something a little more constructive than bashing President Reagan and the United States and insulting its people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing, as far as tourism is concerned, has been the deregulation of air fares or, as we say, the improved facility of access to this country.  In other words, people can get here at a much cheaper rate than was previously the case.  I should not like anybody to get away with the notion that those cheap air fares resulted from the policies of the Government.  It is due to the policies brought in by the previous Government and Minister for Transport as tourism is interwoven with transport. We should compliment Deputy Jim Mitchell, the former Minister, for the work he did to unravel the web of conspiracy that ensured there was a high level of air fares operating into and out of this country which deterred people from visiting it.  The breaking down of that network goes back several years during Deputy Mitchell's period as Minister for Transport. We are now reaping the benefits <Col N="3221" /> because we did not get an opportunity to do so in 1986.  Deputy Kavanagh was Minister for Tourism during that period and he also played a part in breaking down those prohibitive rates of air fares.</P>
    <P>Nowadays some fares are so low they appear ludicrous.  It is no wonder that B &amp; I and other car ferries are in difficulties because if those fares are maintained the number of people using the sea routes will seriously diminish and the airlines will have a field day.  We will wait and see; this has often happened before in other lines of business.  Sometimes supermarkets lower their prices on certain lines and when they have mopped up the opposition they raise them again. We will watch with interest to seen what happens air fares.  I know the initial burst is very welcome but it is difficult to see how it can be maintained.  Maybe fares will stabilise at a level close to the exceptionally cheap rates at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to consultancy studies.  This was also mentioned in <i>The Irish Press</i> yesterday which estimated the cost at £266,000.  It is said that the Minister and the Government had sent back the study to the consultants because they were extremely unhappy with the analysis which had been done, that the work was incomplete.  I would have thought when the Minister was making reference to the study that he would have referred to the inadequacy of the work done, or else that he might have denied the newspaper article.  It is rather important that we get the matter cleared up; it is confusing.  I do not see why the Minister should be referring to it in a laudatory manner if the press report is true.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the petrol voucher scheme for British visitors, which is very welcome.  I hope it does genuinely increase the number of British tourists visiting this country.  We always have a difficulty here in defining a British tourist.  Nobody ever seems to differentiate between an Irish man or woman working in Britain returning here on holidays and the genuine British tourist, the British national coming here as a tourist.  The figures there, if we could get them, would be extremely interesting. <Col N="3222" /> Would the Minister ask his Department to try to break down the figures for us? One would suspect that the vast majority of what are termed British tourists are Irish people returning home on holidays. I should be delighted to see that figure provided.  They are welcome whether they are Irish people returning on holidays or British tourists because they are the best spenders of all tourists.  I thought I heard the Minister saying during Question Time that the American tourists are the best.  That is not our experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years the British tourist has been the best spender.  We all know the truth of that.  As regards competition on air transport, the Minister refers to Aer Lingus and the profits being made by that company.  Would somebody put me right?  Am I stark raving mad, because I think Aer Lingus are losing a packet?  There is a vast difference between operational losses and profits &mdash; and that is what we have been hearing about in the last year or so &mdash; and overall profits and losses.  Any business must take into account the cost of replacing its equipment.  Whether it be a one-man business or a huge national transport organisation, it must include, in any account provided, provision for replacement of its fleet or its equipment.  I do not see any reference to this in figures provided by Aer Lingus.  All we hear about are operational profits or operational losses.  Any Joe Soap could make a profit if he were given the equipment free of charge.  Let us get an honest assessment of the situation.  It has been put to me, and we all know it, that the Aer Lingus fleet must be replaced.  Who is going to pay for it?  Is it going to be Aer Lingus, or the hard-pressed taxpayer?  I suspect the latter.  If the hard pressed taxpayer is going to have to pay for it, we should know what the bill comes to.  It has been put to me that the bill may range somewhere between £300 million and £1,000 million; the higher figure may be somewhat imaginary or inflated.  I would <Col N="3223" /> like to know what the figure is.  I would like to know who is going to foot the bill. Even at £300 million it is a colossal figure.</P>
      <P>The Minister, during Question Time here today, was asked repeatedly by a number of Deputies whether there were any plans to privatise sections or all of Aer Lingus, or if there were any additional sources of funding for that company.  He gave us a run around and said that the whole matter was under study by an interdepartmental review body.  That is fine, but it does not tell us anything.  It is a bit of waffle.  The public would like to know where the money will come from, because it is a huge amount of money.  If that much is involved, then alternative methods would have to be looked at.  There is no doubt about that. I was handing out bouquets earlier about the regulation, but I should say that the Commissioner in Brussels, Mr. Sutherland, has done wonderful work for deregulation and liberalisation of air fares.  He does not get sufficient credit. Of course, he is Commissioner for Competition within the European Commission.</P>
      <P>There is one small point on airports. The regional airports are referred to in the Minister's statement.  One thing has been a very welcome development in the past ten years &mdash; we have got quite a number of regional airports and they are serving those isolated communities tremendously well.  The Minister makes much play of the Connaught Regional Airport of Knock, but there are others as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed there are, good ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one in Galway and one in Waterford, of which we are very proud.  We should like a little additional money for a terminal building initially, that is the first priority, and eventually an extension of the runway so that we can bring in and out jets rather than turbo-prop aeroplanes as is at present the case.  All the regional airports should be <Col N="3224" /> given equal consideration.  Some have got considerably more money than others.</P>
      <P>These airports are doing a tremendous job in conjunction with a number of independent airlines.  Those independent airlines deserve a great deal of credit.  I wish them every success in the future. Ryanair, in particular, are blazing a tremendous trail of glory in the way in which they are operating.  I hope they can continue to do so and extend their operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to grants for guest houses.  Some of the grants have been done away with and others retained. It has been pointed out that there is a limitation on grants depending on the size of an hotel.  It would seem to discriminate against small family hotels.  I believe the maximum number of bedrooms in Dublin City would be 30 and the maximum number in other parts of the country would be 20.  If you are to encourage tourism in a realistic manner, surely the family hotel is the one that you must take greatest care of and encourage.  Those hotels provide a very personalised service. They have an attraction for foreigners which is unequalled.  It is extremely important that we maintain grants for that size of operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred at some length to the B &amp; I Shipping Company.  We are all extremely distressed at the difficulties of that company.  It certainly looks as if there could be a very bleak future.  The Government have provided temporary funding and, as the Minister pointed out at Question Time, that will sustain them up to the end of October.  We do not know what the future holds for the company beyond that.  If the plan of action to which the Minister referred involving management and workers takes effect and the company can become self-sufficient, and is fine but our experience here would indicate that it will not be quite as simple as that.  If people get over a hump they are inclined to go back to the Government and look for subventions. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out the company has been savaged in the current year by a series of strikes.  People should think <Col N="3225" /> twice before they take part in damaging strikes which may eventually strangle the very company which is providing employment for them.  There is a very serious problem concerning that company and I hope commonsense prevails and that wastage and any other element which is providing an undue burden will be eliminated so as to allow the company to continue to function.  It would be unwise and it would be bad policy if we were left with one operator, one car ferry on the Irish scene.  We do not want a monopoly. We want an element of competition.  It will be in everybody's interests if that shipping company is retained.  We want the employment content and the service and we do not want to see a monopoly provided from outside this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to CIE and the figures he gave are puzzling.  The Minister referred to a figure of £4,000 of a loss.  I assume that subvention for CIE is something in the region of £90 million to £100 million annually.  The Minister's figures are most confusing.  They do not give a picture of what is happening.  Under the previous Government the overall deficit for CIE has come down considerably. The previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, can take a great deal of credit for that as can the management of CIE, particularly their chief executive Mr. Conlon who has done tremendous work in the last number of years.  It is not easy to run a national rail service without incurring considerable losses but it is a strategic service which must be kept.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to tomorrow's meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg.  It is important that what seems to be a frivolous objection by the British to Irish independent airlines flying to Britain from Ireland should be lifted. Will the Minister see to it, whether it is done at the Council of Ministers meeting or in bilateral discussions, that Ryanair are allowed to fly directly from Cork to Luton and directly from Dublin to Manchester and that these snags are ironed out?  It is awfully petty that an aeroplane flying from Cork to Luton has to touch down in Dublin and take off again without <Col N="3226" /> landing or taking on passengers.  It is absolutely ludicrous.  Perhaps there is more to it than meets the eye.  Maybe there is some uisce faoi thalamh, but some funny business is going on.  Is the Minister putting all his cards on the table? Is it totally the fault of the British or are we partly to blame?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important area of tourism and transport.  I welcome a lot of what the Minister said in the areas he covered. The Minister touched on a large number of important areas and he identified the fact that tourism has been chosen as a major target area for the generation of wealth and jobs.  If the work is done in the months and years ahead tourism will have a great effect on our future.  I am glad that at long last a Department of Tourism has been established in its own right.  It has been coupled with the important area of transport.</P>
      <P>Transport, particularly air transport has become an integral part of the future development of tourism.  We are an island nation and access is crucial to us in the long term if we are to develop tourism seriously.  We have the potential to develop tourism.  The Minister has touched the top of a possible iceberg in a number of areas he mentioned.  I am anxious to encourage the Minister to go down some of the roads about which he has expressed an interest.  We should not take the pedal off at this stage.  We on this side of the House will encourage the Minister to be positive, constructive and radical where necessary in his approach to the development of tourism and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package the Minister announced some while ago with regard to the impending tourism season is welcome in <Col N="3227" /> the short term.  Judging by what the Minister had to say in his speech last week, when he identified his surprise at the lack of motivation in Bord Fáilte plans, that some radical action had to be taken, I encourage the Minister to take some action.  I hope the action taken and the moneys put into it will have borne fruit when we review the results of that package this year.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister had to take that action highlights the approach of Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte have served the country well but they should be reviewed in the light of development over the years.  The time has come for us to look seriously at how Bord Fáilte operate today.  Are they doing the best possible job?  Are they geared to achieve the best results for us?  I hope these questions will be examined minutely in the forthcoming Price Waterhouse report which we are eagerly awaiting.  Will the Minister clarify the statements in some of the papers that he has rejected aspects of this report? As I understand it, the Minister had a preliminary look at the report which will be due in the next few weeks.  I hope the whole structure of Bord Fáilte is examined.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a sense of urgency in relation to cuts in many areas, but it should not be forgotten that the object of cutting many areas is not just to reduce expenditure but to get a leaner and more efficient structure.  There are many areas where the budget is either incorrect, or could be increased or at least reviewed in an overall context.  When I look at tourism I consider that the return for the money spent is excellent.  That return could be substantially increased in the coming years.  The Minister touched on one area when he identified in his speech the importance of the private sector working hand in hand with the public sector.  It should not just be the responsibility of the Government to produce on behalf of the commercial and private interests the necessary funding to promote tourism.  I hope it will be looked at in the coming months and that some <Col N="3228" /> mechanism can be devised to allow for a serious contribution from the private and commercial sectors.  On the figures that are available to date we could spend much more money on tourism but the areas in which it should be spent and how it should be spent should be clearly looked at.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech identified the breakdown of the extra moneys voted by Bord Fáilte and he identified also certain markets.  The easy part of this is to identify the markets.  Nobody in the country or in this House is in any doubt that we are not gaining the tourist trade from Europe that we should be.  It is not enough to identify that market: we have to identify the requirements of the tourists from those countries and those requirements vary tremendously from country to country in Europe.  We have to identify the requirements and needs of for example, the German tourists, the Danish tourists, the French tourists, the Spanish tourists and what they perceive and enjoy on their holiday.  Leisure time is becoming extremely important in the context of holidays.  I do not believe it is right any longer to talk in terms of holidays in what they have been to date.  That concept has quite seriously expanded and it is in these areas that the opportunities for expansion of the Irish tourist season offer us our greatest scope for development.</P>
    <P>I referred the other night to the development of the product market. There is no reason why we could not have a ten-month tourist season.  This, of course, depends on the type of developments one gets from the various markets. There are fishing seasons which occur at various times of the year which are not necessarily at the same time as the peak sunny months.  There are shooting seasons open at different times of the year.  Golf can be played for about ten months of the year because it does not have to be played in blazing sunshine.  A temperate climate is most enjoyable for a golfing holiday.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn that one of the fastest growing activities enjoyed by tourists are visits to gardens throughout <Col N="3229" /> Europe and the world.  We have much potential in this area.  I do not have figures in this regard but I believe the market is very substantial.  Perhaps the Minister could look at this.  We have natural resource assets.  We are an island nation with the sea all around us.  We have opportunities for sailing, surfing and swimming.  The requirements of these markets must be identified and related back to the requirements of the tourists from Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister identified the over cost in this country of many of the requirements on which tourists spend their money.  We have got to get it right if we are to sustain the repeat tourist business.  This is very important.  Apart from the family-type tourists who come on a regular basis, many of our tourists come on a once-off basis.  We have to develop the repeat business on an annual and seasonal basis and to do that we have to get the cost of the package right.  That is the bottom line.  I have no doubt we can provide the requirements but cap-in-hand with that must be the cost effectiveness.  Unfortunately our costs are too high and this has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to transport and, in particular, air transport.  Obviously there have been very encouraging developments in the area of air transport and deregulation.  However, for one side of the House or the other to claim that it is their own ingenuity that has brought this forward would be erroneous.  If anybody outside the House was asked who was responsible for at least motivating the rapid forward movement in the area of deregulation, the name of Deputy Desmond O'Malley would be very much to the fore.  An enormous amount of further development has yet to occur and the Minister is taking the right approach in this area.  There is huge scope for further development.  The Minister's meeting tomorrow is very important and vital and I have no doubt he will put the case for Ireland in a very cogent manner because of the importance to us of air transport as an island nation.  The cost of air transport and the deregulation of air transport is <Col N="3230" /> vital to increase and enhance our tourist potential.</P>
    <P>Air costs at present from many parts of Europe are vitally important.  Australia has a huge indigenous Irish population which we tend to forget.  The breakdown of the Irish connection in Australia is far higher than is the case in the USA.  If we can bring tourists from as far away as the USA there is enormous potential for us to bring tourists from Australia. However, we have been losing out consistently because there is no direct flight from Australia into Ireland at present. There is a very substantial number of Australian tourists going to Europe but because of the cost of access fares from Europe to Ireland up to now we have not been gaining those tourists.  I would be delighted if an Irish airline could operate that type of route.  It is extremely important.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion earlier today on fifth freedom rights and I am glad the Minister mentioned it again tonight.  The Minister gave me a very detailed reply to my question today but I was disappointed to learn that we do not have in operation at present any fifth freedom rights for any of our airlines.  It is crucial and essential for the development of our airlines on the world stage that fifth freedom rights become an integral part of any deal that is completed within the European context. Obviously I appreciate there will have to be some give and take both ways but that is part of the world we live in and the commercial way in which we operate.  In this regard I urge the Minister to press, as I know he will, to ensure that we receive the opportunity to have fifth freedom rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned the funding for airports.  The development of regional airports during the past number of years has been extremely important.  It has brought an injection of capital into the areas in which they are located and it has positive social implications for the spread of people living in those areas.  Tourists are able to get into areas where they might not normally go. The smaller operators, the smaller hotels <Col N="3231" /> and the smaller guesthouses are an integral part of the continuing development of local economies in these areas.  In this regard the Minister would be advised to look again at the importance of regional airports.  If he looks at it in an overall context he will find they are an integral part of the development policy which I, and the Progressive Democrats, would envisage.  I hope to see the development of airports such as Waterford, which was referred to by Deputy Deasy and which has done a tremendous job with very little Government funding.  They are to be highly commended on that achievement. Ryanair was the operator which primarily made it a viable airport.  The runway needs to be extended so that we can move into the operation of small jets which will be another major step forward.  We need to provide a terminal there, too.  All of this will be an integral part of these areas.</P>
    <P>The position of the B &amp; I has been referred to.  It gives me no joy to see the problems which surround that company today.  I encourage the Minister when he is looking at the position to realise and to accept that what we want to see is a viable operation run by the B &amp; I as an Irish company.  It is vitally important that that company should continue to operate as an Irish company.  A problem we have identified up to now is that it has been unsuccessful in the public sector.  There are many good examples of what can be done to make this a viable company.  It is important that the workers, the management, the unions and everybody involved accept that at the end of the day we must have a viable company and that whatever steps are taken are in the interests of the company so that at the end of the day there will be a proud and viable company in operation.  I sincerely ask the Minister to consider the possibility of the privatisation of this company. It is the route that offers the best possibilities in this regard.  Finally in the area of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second week I have had to take a restriction.  On this occasion I have five minutes, last week I was given no time at all.  As the previous Minister with responsibility for tourism I thought I would have had more time because five minutes will not be adequate for me to respond to two recent statements on tourism made by the Minister. I would have liked to deal with certain aspects of transport but it is only fair to myself and to other people involved in the Government to which I belonged that we should make comment on some of the statements in the Minister's brief when he introduced the Tourist Traffic Bill last week and again today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all agree with one statement that is about all I can agree with in the Minister's brief and that is that tourism will possibly be the biggest industry in the world by the end of this century and that we should be gearing ourselves towards that possibility.  In both statements the Minister singles out the previous Government, and obviously the previous Minister, in not giving the leadership in this area during our time in office.  I should like to say to the Minister that on a public relations exercise he would get full marks but on the facts as they present themselves in the tourism area they require some looking into to see that what he is producing is a very neat trick on the <Col N="3233" /> public.  I can say for certain, now that we have the figures, that this year there will be a real cut to Bord Fáilte of 11½ per cent on their budget of last year.  We got the figures only today.  This will be the lowest budget for Bord Fáilte for the past ten years.  That is an indication of what the real input of this Government is into promoting tourism for this country throughout the world.  In 1968 the budget for Bord Fáilte was £26.8 million, last year the figure was increased to £27.4 million but this year, as provided for in the Supplementary Estimate, the amount is £24 million which is much lower than the figure for two years ago.</P>
    <P>Under the promotional aspect of Bord Fáilte the money available to promote this country in all the various regions with which Bord Fáilte deal, whether it be North America, Britain, the Continent, the Far East, Australia or New Zealand, is cut back considerably.  Therefore, Bord Fáilte will not have the money to promote this country in those areas.  There has been a trimming down in various areas throughout the world in Bord Fáilte's operations following the installation of the free phone systems where rather than having offices in every large city across the States tourists can ring up and get information.  This system has been introduced also to Britain and has had a much more beneficial effect than off the street type of office people just walk into.  That type of facility is not used by large companies or modern businesses in places like America or Britain to promote their products.  The budget has been cut back drastically.  Even though we are bringing in a Supplementary Estimate it does not measure up to the reduction in that budget.</P>
    <P>In trying to bring forward a policy for tourism the previous Government, under Deputy John Bruton published a White Paper on Tourism.  That was the first time that was done for tourism.  It is wrong of the Minister to say that tourism was lacking direction under the last Administration and that it is only now getting its due recognition.  This was not so.  We know what Deputy Jim Mitchell did <Col N="3234" /> during his period in the Department of Communications so far as the reduction in access fares into Ireland was concerned. During my short time in the Department of Tourism I made every effort to promote tourism in what was a very difficult year.  It was not difficult through any fault of mine, I am not a Libyan, I am not from the Middle East and I am not a terrorist.  Americans will not travel out of their country if there is any hint or possibility that their holiday plans can be in any way upset by terrorist activities in Europe.  That problem overlapped into this country.  Because of aggressive selling of tourism in America the drop in tourism from the States was far less last year in Ireland than in many of the big tourist countries like Italy, Greece and even Great Britain.</P>

That is generally agreed, but he will note that, in my contribution on both the Tourist Traffic Bill and tonight, any time I made a comparison I made it like to like.  Any comparisons I made was before Chernobyl and before the Libyan intervention last year.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh that the Americans would not come, in fact their President told them to stay at home and unlike the fractious Irish, the Americans tend to do what their political leaders tell them.  In fact I have been comparing like to like.  I know that Deputy Mitchell succeeded in reducing fares from the middle of 1986 onwards, <Col N="3236" /> when the first lower fares came into operation, not several years ago as Deputy Deasy said.  But I appreciate what has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the reduced air fares would play havoc with the car ferries.  The car ferries carry cars; as of now the planes into Ireland do not carry cars and there is a whole area that the car ferries can concentrate on without fear of competition.  I expect great things this year from that area and the petrol voucher scheme was designed to increase the numbers coming by the car ferries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that, but the effect has been exaggerated and there is a market there for the ferries to target.  I will not indulge in across-the-House chat when I have so much to say and so little time to say it.  With regard to Deputy Deasy's comments on Aer Lingus' profits, the profits given are not operational profits.  The profit given to 31 March 1987 is £16,730,000, which is a substantial profit.  However, that is the consolidated profit.  In my speech I said that I regretted so little of that degree of profit was made in the actual air travel business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy when he says that the Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland &mdash; as befits a past pupil of mine &mdash; is very helpful in this area of trying to develop fifth freedom rights and improve competition in the area of air transport and I hope to meet him today <Col N="3237" /> and to work alongside him towards the development of fifth freedom rights for this country, so that the airlines that are operating in Ireland will benefit.  Deputy Deasy spoke about new hotel regulations rather than the conditions applying to grants for hotels when he mentioned the number of bedrooms which will be required in the future.  There is a certain amount of confusion when studying the CIE accounts since my predecessor introduced a move that I agreed with, above the line subsidy when we are talking about profits and losses. I reiterate that I decry what happened with regard to pushing back moneys that were due to CIE so that there is a colossal building up of debts to CIE which accrue on 1 January 1988 and which are causing me serious headaches at present.  I suggest that Deputies examine that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us who will bear the cost of replacing the Aer Lingus fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House today, the cost of the Aer Lingus fleet is the subject of interdepartmental discussion at present.  I also referred to it in the course of my speech, if the Deputy examines the section which refers to Aer Lingus.  I wish to deal with the points raised by Deputy Martin Cullen.  No doubt Deputy Deasy would like me to deal with the contribution from his fellow constituent, Deputy Cullen, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Cullen agreed with some of the positive and even radical steps which I have taken in the tourism line and I agree with him that cuts should be for a leaner and a more efficient operation. Indeed I would not go along with cuts in any area of our national life if I were not convinced that that was the objective of those cuts.  We must do it only if productivity and a more viable business development are the result.  He also welcomed my invitation to private interests, in the tourist industry to supplement and subsidise what is being done by the public sector.  He also indicated, <Col N="3238" /> and I hope in 1988 I may be able to help in this regard, that money invested in tourism should increase because it brings in the results, it brings in the profits and of course strengthens our economy.  I agree with the Deputy when he suggested that we should find out what the German and French needs are in the way of tourism, holidays and gear our product to their needs.  We are doing this.  I am interested in his suggestion that we exploit the very fine historic gardens we have.  It is one of the many areas we have under consideration with regard to strengthening the tourist industry in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about prices being too high.  I must say that the people who are fully involved in tourism as a business have responded very well to requests from me and my Department with regard to the reduction of various tariffs.  I think this House and the country in general should be grateful to them. They deserve to be congratulated by this House and the country in general for what they have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasised that in my speech. The Deputy will have noted that part of the increased expenditure which I have managed to get for advertising &mdash; £70,000, if I remember the figure correctly &mdash; is being devoted to development of domestic tourism.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also saw great potential in the regional airports for general development as well as tourist development, and I agree with him on that.  He asked me about fifth freedom rights.  I assure him that our whole policy objective is concentrated strongly in that area as far as development in the EC is concerned. B &amp; I, an Irish company that is commercially viable and under the Irish flag, is my objective in that regard.</P>

He said there was a real cut of 11.5 per cent and that this was the lowest for the past ten years.  He must bear some responsibility when, as we were told, the figures were being put together last autumn or when he abdicated his responsibility and walked away from the Government who were putting this budget together for the Tourism Estimates for this year.  I know he made every effort last year to buttress up the faltering industry.  It was not all that successful but it was not for want of trying.  He put in long, hard journeys and travelled long distances including a visit to my constituency straight off the plane from the US at one time.</P>

We hope that commitment is now in place and that we will have the full commitment of the House, spokesmen and general membership of the House on both sides, to develop this industry which will be world wide, and will be the greatest industry in the world at the end of the century.  We want to be in there with proportionately as big a share as we can possibly get out of it.  The greatest industry will not be General Motors or Mitsubishi; it will be tourism and we want to impact on that scene.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny was given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the closure of the <i>Mayo News</i> with consequent job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me express my appreciation to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this question to be raised on the Adjournment of the House.  I regret that it has to take place at 12.35 a.m. on 24 June but this matter was outside my control.</P>
      <P>The reason for my wish to raise this matter on the Adjournment arises from the contents of a letter which was received by the Taoiseach and by the nationally elected representatives from my constituency, namely, Deputy Flynn, Minister for the Environment, Deputy D. Gallagher, Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, and Senator Martin J. O'Toole.  While it might not be appropriate for a Government Minister or a Minister of State to speak on a matter on the Adjournment, I am sure that I speak on behalf of all the nationally elected representatives when I raise this local but extremely important matter on behalf of the people in the area served by the paper, namely, the <i>Mayo News.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Mayo News</i> has been the dominant local paper in this district for a great many years.  Its circulation is now in the region of 11,500.  The paper was founded in about 1892 and, instead of looking forward to its centenary celebrations and its centennial year, alas, its demise now seems to be at hand after almost 100 years of tradition and local involvement to an enormous extent.  The reason for the anxiety of the staff and people, in general arises from the High Court decision given in favour of the Revenue Commissioners on 2 June for the sum of £280,791.  This matter appeared in the public press on 14 June and was only in that manner communicated to some members of the staff concerned.  I understand that this <Col N="3241" /> capital sum arises from an accumulation of debts during a number of years due to the involvement of an Irish printing company who own the paper in the publication of the newspaper, the <i>Mayo News</i> itself.  Therefore, the accumulated interest of a compound nature would be increasing on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>As our public representatives know, this paper serves the Westport area in particular with a population in excess of 20,000.  It serves the local towns of Westport, Louisburg, Newport, and the outlying areas of Mulranny, Ballycroy, Drummin and Leenane as well as Clare Island, Inishturk, Inishbiggle and Achill Island which is the largest island off our coast.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate that a local newspaper of its type has an enormous impact particularly in the rural districts which it serves in carrying local news, for good or for bad, and advertising general wares and items manufactured in the district for the benefit of the people there.</P>
    <P>For generations this region has suffered enormously from emigration.  On consultation with the people concerned with the paper it emerges that a substantial percentage of single subscriptions to the paper are from emigrants whether in Britain, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston, New York or elsewhere.  Therefore, it is an important link of communication with people from that district who have gone abroad for one reason or another and it has served them well for generations.</P>
    <P>The paper and printing works were bought in 1947 by Foilsiúcháin Náisiúnta Teoranta, or FNT printing company, and were acquired initially with the intention of producing Irish books for publication. Vested in the company and in the printing works is the unique skill of qualified printers who are competent to deal with printing in the Irish language, which is not common to local newspapers throughout the country today.  This skill has been acquired in many years and a large number of very fine publications have emerged from FNT including John Hume's <i>Derry</i> and a great number of leaflets and pamphlets in Irish, some by <Col N="3242" /> Cardinal Ó Fiaich and other such people. In the past 40 years FNT have produced high quality Irish print and Irish books. This is something that should not be lost in view of the Government's recognition of the standing of the Irish language and in view of everybody's concern that as much as possible of high quality printed material should be available in that language.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in their respective positions as Airí na Gaeltachta in the last number of years allocated Government funds for the production of the then newspaper, <i>Inniu,</i> which was printed by FNT in the <i>Mayo News</i> printing works in Westport.  These Government grants were available over the years as a subsidy to the company to produce that paper which served a great number of Irish students in second level colleges throughout the country.  Both Ministers are very familiar with the operation of the printing works and the old style overhead hot metalworks.  They both dealt with this matter in their capacities as Ministers for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons <i>Inniu</i> is no longer in print.  FNT still produce books and the <i>Mayo News,</i> as the local newspaper, is printed in the works.  The paper is viable and all payments relative to it, including payments to the current staff, have been made up to date.  The real reason I raise this matter on behalf of everybody from the area is that we desire the Government and the Minister for Finance, or whoever the appropriate Minister is, to see to it that the Revenue Commissioners shows leniency in terms of the payment of the sum due.  There would be no point in placing a sheriff's order or in sending people from the sheriff's office to seize goods in the printing works because those goods are only of scrap value.  They are the old style metalworks and they would not be of any value in comparison with the sophisticated equipment available in other printing works at present.</P>
    <P>I understand a meeting took place yesterday <Col N="3243" /> between the owner, his accountants and the Revenue Commissioners to see if the Commissioners would allow a phased payment.  If that is allowed the owner will be prepared to talk to the staff about the restructuring of operations and further rationalisation, with the introduction of some advanced computer training in the printing works.  I am raising this matter on behalf of the people in Mayo News Limited, the people of Westport and on behalf of our public representatives.  The printers are highly skilled and have an advanced and unique knowledge of printing in Irish, something which is available only in very few places today.</P>
    <P>The paper has had a historic and an illustrious past in political, social, sporting and local terms in this region.  Every elected representative in this House from west Mayo has always had a direct personal involvement with this paper and they have given it unbiased and fair treatment over the years.  The paper has had a very intense involvement with sport over the past 40 years and also in terms of the social and local integration of the general area.  There are areas in this part of the country that are not reached adequately by radio signals because of the conformation of our mountains and so on and the paper plays a very important part in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know if one approaches the Revenue Commissioners on a matter such as this the usual reply is, &ldquo;Deputy, you are a legislator.  You legislate in the House of the Oireachtas so that we can introduce and implement what you legislate for&rdquo;. If intransigence and bureaucracy are combined to produce the demise of 100 years of literary tradition it will be a very sad day because this paper has become part of the fabric of the rural life of that area.  I will quote the essential part of the letter which has been received by the Taoiseach, by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher and by Senator Martin J. O'Toole who was appointed as chairman of Mayo County Council last night.</P>

      <P>Without the Minister's assistance, even though he was not as vocal as he normally is.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>The Collector General of Taxes was recently awarded a judgment of £280,791 against Foilseacháin Náisiúnta Teoranta, the owners of this industry.</P>
      <P>We understand that a sizeable portion of the amount is accumulated interest on arrears due since FNT were publishing the Irish language weekly newspaper, &ldquo;Inniu&rdquo;.  We also understand that the liabilities of the company to the Revenue Commissioners in recent years have been met in full and that our Directors are negotiating with the Collector General to allow a phased payment of the arrears.</P>
      <P>The issuing of a Sheriff's Warrant on foot of the judgment of £280,791 would result in an immediate closure of the firm's operations with the loss of 18 full-time jobs.  The seizures of stock, machinery, etc. would realise only a small portion of the arrears due.</P>
      <P>The company's present viable operations include publication of &ldquo;The Mayo News&rdquo; (weekly), publication and printing of books, mainly Irish language publications and general job printing.  With new technology being phased in, and further rationalisation and restructuring of operations, we are confident that the future of the industry can be secured.</P>
      <P>The important communication role played by a provincial newspaper, such as &ldquo;The Mayo News&rdquo;, both for the local community and emigrants, can not be over-emphasised.  The loss of such a publication and the jobs of 18 workers (10 of whom are married with young families) would be a disaster. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank the House for letting me raise this matter on behalf of the people from my area.  You have a personal involvement in this district, having many relatives there, fine upstanding people, <Col N="3245" /> in the area.  No doubt as a child, on your visits to that part of the country, you too read the <i>Mayo News</i> and you understand its importance to the local district.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure that leniency will be shown by the Revenue Commissioners in this matter, that they will allow a phased payment of the amount due and so that, with the owners and the staff, we can save a paper that is due to celebrate its centenary in five years' time, instead of looking forward with anxiety to its potential demise and destruction.</P>

      <P>I regret I was not aware of the imminent closure of <i>Mayo News Limited</i> until it was brought to my attention earlier this afternoon.  However, in the short time available to me I have endeavoured to find out as much as possible about the matter.  My inquiries to date indicate that the company which was established in 1949 and which currently employs about 18 people obtained no grant assistance from the IDA.  The newspaper is mainly circulated in the Westport and Castlebar areas &mdash; I am not going to suggest which town should be first or second.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware the company's current difficulties stem from the highly competitive position that obtains in the newspaper industry at present.  The net effect of this competition is that certain newspapers are experiencing difficulty in maintaining circulation and advertising revenues and, accordingly, staff reductions are not uncommon.  Deputies will appreciate that these commercial forces are beyond our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point worth mentioning in relation to the newspaper industry is that there is a significant over-capacity in it. The main reason for this development is the growth that took place in the seventies combined with the emergence of more sophisticated technology in the eighties.  As a result the industry now <Col N="3246" /> has the capacity to significantly increase output without any further expenditure on buildings or machinery or on staff. That scenario also obtains in almost all subsectors of the printing and publishing industry.  For those reasons it is now Government policy not to provide financial assistance towards investment in the printing and publishing sector unless proposals contain major export dimensions. I am sure Deputy Kenny will understand that.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this policy will increase the competitiveness of the sector in the medium term.  There is also the other point that there is a debt due to the Revenue Commissioners of a figure just short of £300,000.  Deputies will be aware of the financial constraints on the Government, and their predecessors, and we cannot have people paying PAYE on a weekly basis while others accrue debts on a long term basis.  We cannot have one rule for one sector and a different rule for others.  I contacted my colleague, the Minister for Labour, to ascertain whether he had obtained any data in regard to the difficulties the <i>Mayo News</i> are experiencing at present.  The Minister has indicated that he has not been notified of any recent developments of the company and I find that most unusual.  It is remarkable that no contact has been made by unions or employees with the Department of Labour regarding a company that is about to fold up.  Is there something sinister about this?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny has had sufficient time to make his case.  I am merely stating what he omitted to say.  It is not possible for me to keep track of developments in the thousands of companies in the State.  For the most part the resources of my Department, and the State agencies which operate under it, are geared towards attracting future, further and large industrial investment from abroad and expanding successful existing companies.  I regret what has happened but if the company produced the full <Col N="3247" /> amount of money due to the Revenue Commissioners they would not have any problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission tabled proposals on 16 June 1987 for the setting of new standard rules for radioactivity levels in foodstuffs.  These rules are designed to replace the temporary arrangements which were put in place after the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 and which were extended on two occasions since then.  The Commission proposals were formally outlined by the Commissioner responsible at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, 22 June.  They will now be considered urgently at official level with a view to reaching consensus on new common arrangements before the temporary regime expires on 31 October next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's approach to the problem of defining radioactivity limits for foodstuffs is guided by two considerations.  The most important is the protection of the consumer, who must have complete confidence that foodstuffs, whether domestically produced or imported, are safe to eat.  This can only be done by setting and continuously monitoring the most rigorous standards on the basis of the best available scientific advice.  The second consideration of importance is that it is vital to find as wide an international consensus on this issue as possible, starting with an agreed European Community approach, to avoid possible distortions in trading conditions and the <Col N="2975" /> creation of hidden barriers to trade. Ireland believes that a strict and effective Community régime would be a significant step forward in the establishment of globally applicable radioactivity standards. The Departments of Energy, Agriculture and Food and Foreign Affairs in conjunction with other interested State bodies are examining the Commission proposal in the light of the considerations set out above.</P>

      <P>I am most concerned that every effort should be made to ensure that any inconvenience to members of the public or any possible administrative inefficiency arising out of unnecessary duplication of means testing should be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to recent Parliamentary Questions (Official Report for 30 April 1987 &mdash; column 797 and for 20 May 1987 &mdash; column 2451) where it is indicated that officials of their two Departments and the health boards are already considering, jointly, the extent to which co-ordination of means testing between the Health Boards and the Department of Social Welfare can be undertaken.  I am exploring with those two Ministers and the Minister for the Environment the possibility of extending the scope of those discussions to include consideration of means-tested services provided by local authorities.  Such an extension would bring almost all means-tested social services within the ambit of these discussions.</P>
      <P>The discussions which are now in train cover a very wide variety of schemes all with differing objectives and with differing criteria for the assessment of means under present arrangements.  If it proves possible to rationalise arrangements in those areas, consideration can then be given to their extension on a wider basis.</P>

      <P>The shop at Limerick Prison, which carries a range of items e.g. cigarettes, minerals, confectionery, coffee and toiletries is managed by a prison officer.  Items other than tobacco products are sold at the price for which they have been purchased. There is a marginal mark-up on the price of tobacco products but the retail price in the prison shop is less than that normally obtaining elsewhere.  Profits are channelled into a small fund operated by the governor for the benefit of offenders.</P>
      <P>I can see no reason, particularly having regard to security considerations, why the current arrangements should be altered.  In any event, any screening of goods that might be introduced to detect, for example, an attempt to smuggle drugs into the prison would be likely to be such that it would render the goods in question unfit for use.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out a number of times in recent years by a number of my predecessors as Minister for Justice, in response to parliamentary questions on this matter, the introduction of any system of registration of security firms raises issues of considerable difficulty. For example, a system designed to provide for the exclusion of persons from this type of business on the basis of, say, a past criminal record, could raise very serious issues relating to the rights of the people concerned.  Similarly, if a registration system were to attempt to provide for minimum standards of commercial practice by those engaged in the business, serious questions would arise as to the criteria to be applied in the determination of those standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The expected increase in farm incomes this year arises from a reversion of the price-cost squeeze which has strangled profitability in Irish agriculture in the recent past and a drop in volume of farm inputs particularly feedingstuffs. The latest monthly agricultural price indexes for March 1987 published by the Central Statistics Office show agricultural output prices up by 1.3 per cent and agricultural input prices down by 6.4 per cent over the corresponding month in 1986.  Sales of animal feedingstuffs increased by over 17 per cent in 1986 because of the poor weather and it is expected that they will decline significantly this year.  These factors underline the projections by the Central Bank that, assuming a return to normal weather conditions this year, the outlook is for a recovery in farm incomes of the order of some 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Department's veterinary research laboratory has for a number of years past attempted to develop a dye which would assist the identification of dipped sheep.  Following a series of tests and field trials in 1985 and 1986 it was decided not to continue with this experiment.  The shortcomings of the dye were: (1) It could not be incorporated in the dip at manufacturing stage; (2) It was not visible to casual inspection after one week; (3) The additional annual costs to sheep farming could amount to £400,000; (4) The price for wool from dye treated fleeces could be discounted by as much as 4p to 6p per lb.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question is residing with her son who is not, from the information furnished, a permanently incapacitated person as required by this scheme.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, a free telephone rental allowance cannot be approved in this case.  The applicant was notified to this effect on 24 February, 1987.  If the person referred to is dissatisfied with this decision it is open to her to submit further medical evidence in support of her claim. On receipt of such further medical evidence in the Department her application will be examined again and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

The additives are approved for use in this country only after they have been approved by the EEC Scientific Committee for Food and by our own Food Advisory Committee. The regulations controlling additives, made on the recommendation of the Food Advisory Committee, specify the additives which may be used in food and in some cases, restrict the use of specified additives to certain foods up to specific limits.  The regulations are enforced by the health boards through weekly food sampling programmes.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement regarding the Leukaemia report of the many occurrences of illnesses related to the Sellafield nuclear plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the report to which the Deputy refers is the report of the study which was carried out into the mortality and incidence of childhood leukaemia in this country arising out of concern about possible health consequences from the levels of radiation in the Irish Sea region.</P>
      <P>Mortality arising from acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) was studied for the years 1971-82 and incidence for 1974-83. During the total study period no excess of mortality or incidence was apparent either on the east or south coast of the country and distribution of high rates was quite random over the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More detailed examination of mortality rates showed a small excess in coastal strips approximately three miles wide <Col N="3028" /> on the east and south coasts for the period 1971-76 but not for the period 1977-82. When incidence rates were examined the east coast strip showed an excess of new cases of ALL for the study period 1974-76 but not for the study period 1977-83; the south coast strip showed no such increase.</P>
    <P>These increases were in low single figures and no particular conclusions can be drawn from them.  After 1977 the study found no geographic variations in mortality and incidence rates.  It could be concluded from the findings of the study, post 1977, that no possible external causative factors were involved and that Sellafield therefore has had no observable impact in relation to acute lymphoid leukaemia in children since 1977. However on the basis of this study while Sellafield could not be linked directly to the increases in childhood leukaemia prior to 1977, it could not be exonerated either prior to that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>There has been no significant reduction in the numbers of public health nurses employed by the health boards. However, difficulties are being experienced in some areas due to the non-replacement of nurses on annual, sick or maternity leave.  In such cases the health boards are endeavouring to redeploy nurses or to redraw areas served in order to minimise inconvenience to eligibile persons.</P>
      <P>While I was not in office during the winter period I understand that hospitals in all health board areas were able to cope and that no major problems arose. However, as I made clear to the House during the recent Estimates debates, the improvement of accommodation and services for the chronic sick and terminally ill will receive particular attention to part of the review of the acute hospital sector.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the most needy and vulnerable in our society will be taken care of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The World Health Organisation have monitored the methods in which the HIV virus is transmitted and have indicated that there is no evidence that the infection is transmitted by casual contact, such as would occur at wakes and funeral removals.  If the relations of a person who dies from AIDS require advice regarding a wake or funeral arrangements, they should contact the local director of community care and medical officer of health.</P>
      <P>As regards the possible occupational hazards associated with AIDS, officials of my Department have met with representatives of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the Irish Association of Funeral Directors to discuss the handling of victims of infectious diseases and, in particular, AIDS.  My Department subsequently wrote to these organisations outlining the simple precatutions necessary to eliminate the minimal occupational risk to staff from HIV infection, while at the same time taking due regard of the feelings of the family of the deceased.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the above represents what is appropriate in situations such as this and see no need for regulations to provide for the registration of undertakers, mortuaries and funeral homes.</P>

Vocational education committees may utilise their allocations by employing teachers on a whole time or part-time basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications for the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology of the Government's Budget Statement in relation to staffing in the public service have been the subject of discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and other interested parties.  Following these discussions my Department issued Circular Letter No. 45/87 to the vocational education committees concerned which requires that between now and the end of 1988 the gross pay bill in the sector is to be reduced by 4 per cent in volume terms.  This is to result in a saving of 1 per cent of the gross pay bill in the calendar year 1987 and a further 3 per cent in 1988.  The pay outturn for 1987 will be the basis for 1988 Estimates.  Allowance will be made for unavoidable increases in <Col N="3047" /> costs and the figure so calculated will be reduced by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the introduction of specific measures in order to comply with the terms of the circular letter rests with the college authorities and the vocational education committees concerned.  I have no reason to believe, however, that essential activities in the colleges in question will be curtailed by the application of the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of the architectural courses in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, I am not aware that any formal advice of the kind indicated by the Deputy has been issued by the City of Dublin VEC.</P>

My Department's professional advisers have accordingly been asked to list the project for preparation of tender documentation.  It will not, however, be possible to advance this project significantly in the immediate future because of the large number of other projects which are at an advanced stage of planning, or for which tenders have been received, and which are awaiting capital allocations.  My Department's Primary Buildings Branch will keep in touch with the school authorities regarding the further processing of the project.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the plans, if any, she has to bring the fees payable at the faculty of veterinary medicine, University College, Dublin when expressed as a percentage of current cost, into line with the figures which prevail for students at colleges and facilities which are funded under the aegis of the higher education authority; if she will make a statement on the substantial difference between the staff-student ratio which prevails in the faculty of veterinary medicine and the average figure for colleges, courses and facilities funded under the aegis of the higher education authority; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Funding for the faculties of veterinary medicine, agriculture and dairy science has, since the beginning of the present financial year, been included in the State grant-in-aid to the higher education authority to assist in the funding of institutions operating under its aegis.  The determination of student fee levels is not specifically related to individual course costs.  In the 1986 financial year the overall income from student fees in the teaching institutions in the HEA sector, including such income in the faculties mentioned above, represented about 25 per cent of the State grant plus fee income.  The fee income in high cost faculties wiht relatively low student numbers <Col N="3049" /> could, however, be substantially below this general percentage figure.  I am not satisfied that comparisons between staff-student ratios in general and those which operate in faculties with relatively low student numbers and a high proportion of practical or laboratory work have any validity.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of whole time teaching and support staff, including part time equivalents, employed by the college of veterinary medicine, University College Dublin; the number of whole time students of veterinary medicine in <Col N="3050" /> that college and the output of qualified vets from the college for the most recent year for which figures are available; and the current fees paid by such students on a per annum basis and those fees expressed as a fraction of the current operating costs of the facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education, given the need to advertise courses and given the termination of temporary teachers' contracts in September and the great public anxiety that exists, if she will assure the Dáil that a sufficient allocation will be made now to the vocational sector of education so that it can continue providing services that are badly needed by those involved in the provision of travellers education, education for prisoners, adult literacy programmes, adult education courses and special education programmes usually advertised before the autumn; if she will announce before the Dáil goes into recess, the allocations for the vocational sector for the years 1986-87 and 1987-88 so that the anxieties of the many temporary teachers who face redundancy before the Dáil resumes can be relieved; if she will indicate to the institutions, heavily dependent on such teachers for courses, that they can retain the teachers in their employment given that some entire departments are faced with virtual closure before September unless these matters are resolved now; and if she will give details of the proposals if any there are for such redeployment that she intends discussing with the teachers' union involved.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently considering and will shortly be issuing the 1987-88 allocations of teachers to vocational education committees under the heading &ldquo;Co-operation with other institutions&rdquo; to provide for the educational needs of travellers, prisoners etc. I am satisfied that my Department will be in a position to make allocations which will be sufficient to meet the needs of the VECs in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards adult literacy, the Deputy <Col N="3051" /> will be aware from answers I have given in this House recently in reply to a number of similar questions from other Deputies, that I have allocated £400,000 to vocational education committees this year for the provision of adult literacy and community education free of charge or at nominal cost.  This is £50,000 in excess of what was allocated for the same service last year and £250,000 greater than the provision made in 1985.  The Deputy will appreciate that where provision for a service has increased, and substantially increased as against 1985, the question regarding redundancies and closures hardly merits serious consideration. Other adult education courses, apart from second chance courses for adults who have left school with no formal qualification, are expected to be self-financing.  As regards second chance adult education courses, I am at present in consultation with the IVEA in regard to the provision to be made in this area for 1987-88.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have already been advised of their 1986-87 teacher allocations in respect of these services.  The question of the employment and assignment of teachers to schools from within these allocations is a matter for each vocational education committee.</P>
