      <P>I have two questions to put, Sir, in respect of promised business. May I ask the Minister for Finance, in the first place, if there are proposals to introduce a new Central Bank Bill soon, and if this Central Bank Bill will introduce a single regulatory authority for all financial institutions as they are now operating in very similar areas: by that I mean insurance companies and building societies as well as banks?  Will the Minister further say if it will contain powers to reduce interest rates, in view of the apparent resistance of the Central Bank <Col N="882" /> to a reduction in interest rates that is due at this time?</P>
      <P>Secondly, may I ask the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to introduce a revised Book of Estimates, in view of the statements by the Minister for Education in regard to the provisions for primary school salaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1987</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 31st March, 1987.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann approved the Order, in draft, on 18 June 1987.  This motion arises because I consider it necessary to introduce a legal measure to assist consumers in assessing the true cost of credit.</P>
      <P>The order, which will relate to credit provided to consumers only, will, (i) require advertisements that make reference to the availability and cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge.  The APR may be shown by way of a representative example if no other means is practicable; (ii) require that, where the advertisement relates to the provision of a good or service, the cash price, the price payable under the credit agreement and the number and amount of instalments must also be indicated; (iii) require any notice-leaflet and so on, relating to loans or credit sales which is displayed at a place where a cash loan can be obtained or a credit purchase made to show the true cost of credit using APR; and (iv) set out legally binding definitions relating, in the main, to consumer credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The APR can be defined as the total cost of the credit advanced as an annual percentage of the outstanding amount of the credit granted.  In addition to interest, the total cost of credit will also include such items as administration costs, documentation fees, compulsory insurance and so on.  In calculating APR, the interest paid on a loan is expressed as a percentage in relation to the declining principal outstanding over the term of the loan.  This compares with the &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; system, at present used by some financial <Col N="888" /> institutions, where the interest is based on the capital sum borrowed for the full term of the loan and does not allow for the fact that the principal is constantly reducing over the period of the loan: in other words, the real cost is considerably greater than that apparently indicated by the rate of interest quoted.</P>
    <P>Generally, a rate of interest expressed under the flat rate system will only be about half the APR.</P>
    <P>For example, take a loan of £250 with charges amounting to £50 &mdash; total of £300 &mdash; repayable in 12 monthly instalments of £25 and compare this with a similar loan repayable in a lump sum of £300 at the end of 12 months.  Both of these loans have a flat rate interest charge of 20 per cent.  Under the first loan, however, the borrower has the use of an average of £125 only available during the 12 month period.  He is therefore getting less for his charges than the borrower under the second loan who has the use of the full £250 for the entire 12 month period.  The effective annual rate of the &ldquo;12 monthly instalments&rdquo; loan would in fact be 41.2 per cent, while the effective annual rate of the &ldquo;lump sum&rdquo; loan would be 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Consequently there is at present a serious possibility of consumers being confused, or even misled by hidden charges, as to the true cost of the money they are borrowing.  I am introducing this order to enable consumers to compare the cost of credit from different sources and consequently to eliminate the possibility of consumers being confused as to the true cost of credit.</P>
    <P>The order will also require that, if an advertisement refers to the provision of goods or services on credit, the cash price and the credit price must be also shown, for example, &ldquo;£50 deposit and 12 monthly payments of £20 &mdash; APR 20 per cent, Cash Price £267.70, Credit Price £290.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The order will not apply to free credit or, at present, to licensed banks because banks are exempted from the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, under which the order is being made. However, at present, banks generally use <Col N="889" /> the APR system and with the co-operation of the Central Bank will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Moreover, enactment of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, which is at Committee Stage in the House, will remove the exemption of licensed banks from the scope of the Consumer Information Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This order has been on the Order Paper of the Dáil since last March.  It was prepared by the previous Government to deal with clear instances of abuse of people in impoverished circumstances. Those who have to rely on consumer credit are almost always people whose financial situation is very difficult, mostly people on social welfare, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit and the like.  They are the ones whose weekly income is so small that they cannot accumulate enough money to pay for goods when they want to get them and, as a result, have to accept consumer credit which, in the past, has tended to be at rates of interest hugely in excess of the rates of interest at which the same people could have borrowed money, for example, from a credit union or some other suitable source.</P>
      <P>The order is therefore most welcome in that it would bring to the attention of people who are being induced to enter into consumer credit arrangements, the true rate of interest, not just on the initial sum but on the declining principal owing over the total period of the loan.  It is to be hoped that people, in looking at the rate of interest they are actually being charged will, if they do not have enough money, consider obtaining it from another more competitive source such as a credit union where people usually provide assistance to one another for dealing with circumstances of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of cases in my own constituency where people are, for instance, buying their children's clothes by mail order on consumer credit, have got themselves into severe financial difficulty and found themselves without the basic necessities for daily living in terms of <Col N="890" /> food and heat because of commitments entered into to obtain items like clothing on consumer credit.  If those people had been wise enough and advised sufficiently well they could have obtained the money for the purpose if they had been a member of a credit union.  I know I speak for all Members of this House in strongly endorsing the work of the credit union movement and expressing the hope that it will provide an alternative for people in difficult circumstances who need to buy large items like clothing or consumer durables so that they will seek the money from such a source rather than getting consumer credit unless the consumer credit is available on reasonable terms.</P>
    <P>This order has been on the Order Paper of this House since last March.  I suppose it is a reflection of the priorities of this House that it has lain there for all of this time without being debated or allowed to come into effect.  Matters that affect people who are more privileged in our society, with greater access to the media and greater ability to arrange protests of one kind or another, would probably have been taken the week they were presented in the House.  Unfortunately this order is of benefit to people who are relatively voiceless in our society.  It is therefore interesting to note that this debate is being conducted in the presence of only four Members of the House, and in the total absence of the parties claiming to represent the least privileged in our society.  This is a significant fact that should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>Something we can discuss in greater detail when we come to deal with the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill is that this delay in introducing this important measure results from the provision in the Consumer Information Act passed in 1978 which says that an order under that Act can only come into effect if it is confirmed by a debate and motion here in the House.  That Act was passed by a Fianna Fáil Government but I have to admit that I was myself, as Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary, responsible for the insertion of the requirement that such orders would need to be confirmed by a motion in the House. <Col N="891" /> Frankly, in making that suggestion, I never envisaged that delays of this kind would occur.  I therefore think it might be appropriate to revise this provision to allow for orders of that kind to be put through either on the basis of the normal 21 day rule or perhaps, in view of the less hurried agenda of the Seanad, a Seanad debate would suffice rather than having the order debated and passed in both Houses.  In either event there is a need to look at the delays taking place.</P>
    <P>Another possibility would be that a committee of the House would be allowed to pass such orders without the necessity of debating it in here.  In the previous Dáil a committee on legislation existed which would have been quite suitable for that purpose.  That has not been reconstituted in this Dáil but there is a possibility that the terms of reference of the joint committee on EC affairs which is already looking at statutory instruments of another kind might be extended to enable it to deal with obtaining approval of orders of this kind.</P>
    <P>There are one or two observations I would like to make about the provisions of the order.  It is an order under the Consumer Information Act.  Therefore it relates to advertisements.  As I understand it, these are advertisements publicly displayed.  The Minister should consider also whether it would be appropriate to introduce an order under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act stating that, unless such information has been provided as indicated here, the contract itself would be void.  There is a possibility, given the limited resources of the Department &mdash; and I do not make any suggestion that these resources can at the moment be increased substantially &mdash; in regard to enforcing orders of this kind that it may, in fact, be ignored.  As I understand it, the order simply provides criminal sanctions.  It would seem more appropriate that if a person offering consumer credit fails to draw to the attention of the person receiving it the true rate of interest, the contract should be void and the person who had given the credit <Col N="892" /> would not be able to enforce the collection of the loan.  If that were the case, it would ensure that the giving of consumer credit on fraudulent terms simply would not occur.  That would be a far more effective sanction than the provisions in regard to advertising contained in this order.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter carefully.</P>
    <P>Many people will obtain consumer credit or go looking for it not so much on the basis of advertisements but on the basis of personal contact.  They may never see any of the advertisements required to be displayed under this order and may enter into an agreement on the basis of a simple conversation with the person concerned.  I may be wrong and perhaps the Minister could confirm if I am wrong, but, as I understand it, this order does not apply to oral discussions between the offerer and the receiver of the credit.  Am I right in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is a case to extend the provisions to oral representation and simultaneously to say that unless the person offering the credit has positively drawn to the attention of the person receiving it the true rate of interest by, for instance, giving them a piece of paper containing the information, the contract will be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, which I drafted as Minister of State although it was put through in 1980 by a subsequent Government that indicates the speed at which these things happen and which not only gives the Minister the power to require that certain contracts be in writing but also the power to require that that writing be in a certain size of type.  A person entering into a consumer credit contract, possibly on exorbitant terms as to the rate of interest, should have a right to a written statement containing terms as set out in this order and those terms should be set forth in legible type, not in the conventional small print which is illegible without a magnifying glass.  It is <Col N="893" /> certainly so designed to ensure that people will not read it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should use the powers he has &mdash; which, let me say, no Minister has used so far &mdash; to extend the provisions to the civil law.  I must concede that while Minister for Industry and Commerce I did not introduce measures of that kind and regret I did not do so.  I shall anticipate the Minister's making that point by making it for him, so that we need not get involved in who did what or did not do what and when, as the case may be. This is one of the disabilities of being a former Minister that in trying to be an Opposition spokesman invariably someone will ask why, you did not do it yourself? Having said that, there is a reasonable case for this measure.  The powers do exist and I claim credit for having put the powers there in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
    <P>It would be useful for the Minister, and a valuable supplement to this thoroughly welcome order, to ensure &mdash; and I sum up for the attention of the large Press Gallery listening to this debate &mdash; first, that a contract for consumer credit where the information as to the true rate of interest has not been given orally or in writing to the person entering into the contract shall be void; secondly, that those contracts be required to be in writing; thirdly, that the Minister use his powers to ensure that the writing be of a certain size so that people can read it.  I argue that those measures would provide a very valuable benefit to the consumers in addition to what is here, remembering that the consumers who are to benefit under this order are people who are among the most disadvantaged in our society.  I hope the Minister will be able, when replying, to give an assurance that further action along the lines I have suggested will be taken by him.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome this order and hope that it will have a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure and hope it will succeed.  In essence, it is about putting in place some form of protective system to ensure that the most vulnerable people in our society are not <Col N="894" /> misled and exploited.  Many of us have many examples, indeed, of that kind of abuse.  Unfortunately, one of the aspects of our economic problems is precisely that, that there is an enormous number of people now who are extremely hard pressed who find themselves having to live from hand to mouth or on borrowed money.  There is, therefore, fertile ground for those who want to abuse that opportunity for their own greedy needs. It is right, even if it late in the day, for us to respond as well as possible to that unfortunate threat.</P>
      <P>The order is the minimal step we should take and I wonder whether we should go further in a number of respects. The purpose of this, essentially, is to lay before people the full facts relating to the true cost of borrowed money.  If that is the case, then we must ensure that the order will be effective because it is, without any question of doubt, absolutely accurate to say that there are thousands of people at present who are in hock to financial institutions of one kind or another or to moneylenders of one kind or another and who do not fully appreciate the extent of the financial noose around their necks.  They find themselves unable to extricate themselves from that predicament.  Trying as they are, desperately in some cases, to raise the money to pay the ongoing instalments, they find themselves running very hard to stay precisely where they are.  At the end of the day they still continue to owe a great amount.</P>
      <P>I have met many people who after years of paying instalments which came to a multiple of the capital sum borrowed still found that they allegedly owed money in excess of the initial capital sum borrowed.  Worse than that, they could not get any form of assistance, advice or access to information or to counsel which would give them some opportunity of dealing with some of the conglomerates involved here who, when it comes to the crunch, sometimes deal with people extremely heartlessly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish there would be at some stage a discussion in this House on that whole <Col N="895" /> area of money and its use, personal borrowings and the interest rates arising therefrom.  It is not just those on the fringes of the financial markets and institutions about whom we are talking.  We are talking about some of the respected names in that business, including the credit card companies, the banks and the moneylending agencies and others, many of whom have true interest rates which are extremely excessive and very hard to justify but justification is not called for because most people are not aware of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the discussion this morning so I shall not go into this matter in the form of copious examples, but there are many one could give.  Certainly, I can say sincerely and truthfully that my constituency is one of those that has suffered and is suffering the ravages of this kind of financial exploitation.  I welcome the order and hope it will be effective.  If some of us had our way, we might go a little further in trying to ensure that the scales are a little more balanced when it comes to dealing with some of the more rapacious elements in the business of lending money without any concern for the social consequences, the consequences on family life or other consequences.  Basically, they keep those people on tap for years and milk them until they are virtually dry.  At the end of the day they come down hard on them, if necessary.  Unquestionably there is a need for this House and the Government to take sides in this unequal contest and I know which side we should take, obviously the side of the person who is open to that form of abuse and exploitation.</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions that I would like to make is this.  The order seems to be framed in regard to written, stated and printed advertisements.  That is the phraseology used in the order itself and that is the proposal that is made.  What about those advertisements or statements which are directed by means of radio or television or advertisements which are not advertisements as we know them traditionally but which essentially are making ploys and which might be open to argument as to whether they were <Col N="896" /> advertisements?  I seek clarification on that point because the spirit of this order is that wherever there is a communication about rates of interest the true cost should be brought home to the person who is about to embark on the borrowing of the money.  Bear in mind, that in every case the person about to engage in the contract is a person who needs the money for some reason or other.  They, obviously, do not have the money because if they had they would not be borrowing it.  In other words, they are vulnerable and open to being seduced and sweet talked into going beyond what is right and suitable for them, although in some cases at present it is unquestionably out of necessity to keep a roof over a person's head or to keep food on the table so I can sympathise with them.</P>
    <P>The order refers to the statement in the advertisement being given a certain kind of prominence.  Paragraph 6 (2) refers to an advertisement displayed at a premises which refers directly or indirectly to the availability of credit. That is the general thrust.  In view of the fact that we are likely to have a fair number of radio stations and other television stations perhaps in due course, I would like to know how we are going to deal with the challenge presented by a comprehensive range of, if I may call them, audio-visual advertisements and marketing ploys.  In that context I am talking about information booklets which would not be advertisements <i>per se</i> but which undoubtedly in some cases would be more effective as selling aids.  For example, some of the more seductive advertising by the banks is in the area of student loans but this would not come under the heading of advertising.  The spirit of this order is, as I have said, to get across the true rate of interest in all cases.  Therefore, if necessary I would like the order to be amended or extended to apply to all of these communication exchanges in whatever form or guise they take.</P>
    <P>The order does not make adequate reference not just to the need for stating the true rate of interest but to ensuring that it is stated in such a way that it is either <Col N="897" /> intelligible or visible.  Reference is made in the order to the prominence which is appropriate.  Nevertheless, I can visualise that one could have a display board in the corner of an office which gives a certain kind of prominence to the figures involved but where the overwhelming burden of the advertising thrust of the financial institution involved is such as to present that information in the small print.  I would like to see the Minister making a serious assault on the fine print mentality, the over-riding purpose of which is to hide from the consumer the true effects and the full consequences of contracts and obligations entered into. Some of this fine print, without doubt, mitigates against the rights of a citizen and damages their capacity to act in law against those who might very well be engaged in this business.</P>
    <P>I am troubled by the possibility, for example, that the minimal terms of the order could be met by a display notice put in some obscure corner of an office, perhaps behind a grill, where a person will not be able to see it and that other advertising forms would present the bald figures of the attractive net rate of interest without making any reference to the true cost of the credit involved.  I am not sure whether the order is adequate in that respect although I sympathise with those who drafted it.  The tables outlined at the back of the order involve all kinds of formulae.  They are like a third level examination in mathematics.  The point which needs to be borne in mind is that there is no point in making this order unless it is going to be effective and it gets across the information to the public. Let us see if we can abolish so far as possible the fine print which seeks to hide the full facts from people.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether there should be some form of temporary stay in the signing of contracts such as this.  I am aware of cases where people were suddenly startled, even traumatised in some cases, by excessive demands made by corporate bodies.  Indeed, this very week I heard of a case involving an elderly couple who repeatedly received extortion <Col N="898" /> demands from the Revenue Commissioners which, as I was able to ascertain in an answer to a question I put in this House, were unjustified.  There was not even an apology offered in that case. The point I am trying to make is that there are people who react in those circumstances by immediately going to some money-lending institution and perhaps in a semi-emotional way getting involved in obligations which are not capable of being met.</P>
    <P>In this order there should be some provision for a breathing space between the initial contractual undertaking and the completion of that contract, even if it is only for a few days, to ensure that people would have a chance to think through the consequences armed as they should then be with all the facts in regard to the true rate of interest.  Here again, I am troubled by the vulnerability of people who may suddenly find themselves as a party to a contract which in retrospect they would not have entered into had they had a chance to think in a non-emotional atmosphere outside of the environment in which people often borrow money.</P>
    <P>I submit that under section 51 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 that possibility does exist.  I would like the Minister to comment on that aspect.  The Minister said in his remarks that the order will not apply to free credit or the licensed banks at present because they are exempt from the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 under which this order is being made.  Admittedly, the banks generally use the APR system and I am told that with the co-operation of the Central Bank they may continue to do so. However, in principle, I wonder whether it is right that there should be any exemption from one area of moneylending as opposed to any other.  I am not sure whether it is justified merely by virtue of the practice which has been drawn up or by the convention which exists involving the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note that the Consumers Association of Ireland for whose work we all owe a debt made that similar <Col N="899" /> point.  They are unconvinced that the banks should be exempt under the order. In a submission they made to the Minister's Department two years ago they said that the exemption from the Consumer Information Act of banks and finance houses licensed by the Central Bank should be deleted so that the requirements of the new order will apply to these institutions.  The association did not agree that the Central Bank had been operating effectively in this area.  The association said, &ldquo;consider, for example, the undesirable wooing of students and others to the banking system and the practice of relegating information regarding the true rate of interest to small print notices in out of the way corners in most bank premises&rdquo;. I have much sympathy with the central point they are making, that the same standards should apply right across the board.</P>
    <P>In the near future the building societies will be involved in banking practices and this will undoubtedly heat up the competitive environment in which banks and building societies operate.  It will undoubtedly drive marketing managers to tear out more of their hair and get down to seeing how they can sell harder and bigger to anyone who wants to talk to them.  The protective device of this order could and perhaps should be available to all people who borrow money, not merely those to whom the order is proposed to apply.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider this exemption and see whether it is justified, particularly in view of the likely changes in the atmosphere and the competitive environment affecting the banks in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this order should have to come before this House, and I made this point last week on a similar order.  Again, it is an area of operational management which the Minister should be able to pursue without reference to having a debate here.  If one of the parties involved wants to put down a Private Members' Motion or make an issue of it, fair and well.  This order has the agreement of, I would say, everyone in the House.  Yet, because it has not managed <Col N="900" /> to squeeze into the Order Paper it has effectively been non-effective in some cases for over two years even though it was drafted initially in the term of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether we need urgently some form of system here to make sure that Ministers can get on with their day-to-day job, introduce orders as they see fit and make the changes in respect of which they have a mandate so that this House can be reserved for significant legislative discussions which is what it should be about.  If the Minister wants to make a change in this order in six months' time, I presume we will have to come back here.  That is preposterous.  I question the wisdom of using Dáil time in this way.  As things stand, the Minister has to come in here and because of the way business is ordered this order, which in many respects is more significant for many of my constituents than much of the business we spent time on this week &mdash; though I do not deny that was very important &mdash; has been simply lying there. In the meantime people for whom I am responsible as a public representative have become embroiled in situations which this order might have helped them to avoid.</P>
    <P>No number of orders we introduce here can protect people from the potential for exploitation which exists.  This point is appropriate not necessarily to this Minister but in the general context.  The fundamental way of arming people to ensure they do not become involved in the kind of entrapment we are talking about is through the educational process.  Will the Minister consider having a chat with his ministerial colleague in Education in the context that probably there could not be a more important issue in the educational curriculum than information on the proper use of money be it in relation to savings, borrowings, house mortgage, insurance or any other area which most students have to face a very few years after they leave school?  This measure is trying to deal with elements of abuse, but the fundamental way of dealing with it would be to ensure that people are armed by educational awareness to distance <Col N="901" /> themselves from people who are in the business of abusing them financially.  It is sad we do not do more in that respect. That is the kind of basic attack we should make to ensure that people by their own choice, using their own judgment, can make conscious, rational decisions and have the proper basic attitudes in respect of this area.</P>
    <P>The reality is quite the opposite.  I have often been startled by young people who get married after leaving school and have no idea regarding borrowing or the cost of money to buy furniture for a house or whatever.  They may be aware of the root of a Latin verb but they find that they cannot cope with the real things of life and the real pressures on them because we have all failed to inculcate that awareness in them.  However, I hope the order is successful.</P>

      <P>I welcome this order. As the Minister knows, I introduced it in the Seanad when I was over there over a year ago and I was disappointed it did not come into force before now.  I hope the Minister takes this as not just another order that must be got through but as the start of a real crusade to tidy up the whole area of credit and the access of consumers to a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>One very disappointing feature in the delay that has occurred is that even State bodies are ignoring the fact that this is on its way.  I do not know whether the Minister received his ESB bill this month.  I received mine, and they are offering credit and making no reference to APRs.  Someone should inform the ESB, like other State bodies, that the Minister is serious about this issue.  They should be leading the way and not waiting for legislation to come in to force them to give what is only reasonable treatment to consumers.  When I was on the other side of this House I was interested in this issue and I tried to initiate a number of changes.  One of the most important is to have a proper order dealing with consumer credit generally, outlining the sort <Col N="902" /> of things mentioned in the House such as the need for written agreements and provisions in relation to early termination of agreements, outlining clearly the ownership position, giving a clear statement of site or handling charges that might come in and emphasising the right of people to records at all times in connection with their loan agreement.</P>
      <P>This should come forward as an order of the Minister's own and not wait an interminable time before the EC gets around to getting something agreed through the intricate committees they have over there.  One important aspect would be to have a cooling-off period.  In the area of unsolicited loans it it crucial that consumers get an opportunity to have at least a week to reconsider.  Many of the worst abuses of lending are where people have unsolicited loans.  They have entered into them without adequate consideration. They have been approached when they were vulnerable coming up to Christmas or to a First Communion and they have had no opportunity either to get an agreement in writing or to have a cooling-off period built into the agreement to give them an opportunity to think again.  That important improvement in this area would potentially root out a great deal of the abuse.</P>
      <P>I want to consider how the order will deal with things like concealed collection and handling costs.  I gather they will be entirely rolled up into the APR as calculated, but I would like an assurance on that point.  I would also like the Minister to say how deposit requirements will be handled under this.  A custom in some institutions is that if you are to get a loan you must have on deposit and continue to hold on deposit a certain sum.  The effect of that, of course, is that it pushes up the APR quite dramatically.  In an extreme case if you borrow £1,000 and are required to have £500 on deposit continuously, the terms of the interest rate will be calculated on £1,000 but in effect you will receive only £500.  Potentially it has the power to double the rate of interest in that example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that credit unions are the institutions who at present most frequently <Col N="903" /> use this.  It is based on the very good principle that people should have a saving record.  At the same time it is important that the Minister, in specifying APRs, does not leave it open to other agencies who are not so scrupulous about their approach to lenders to use deposit requirements as a way of concealing that the true APR is much higher than the rate they quote.  As I understand it, this provision would not prevent such a practice. If the Minister has not already built into the order something to deal with that I think he should consider doing so or consider what alternative powers he might have to prevent lending agencies circumventing the need to quote APRs by using that sort of a ploy.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister and his Department taking a much more up-front approach to the issue of credit and access to adequate information by families who are in credit difficulties.  When I was Minister of State I initiated a move to have information leaflets available that would spell out for people the sources of different credit, how they would gain access to them, what requirements they would need to comply with and what the costs were.  It is important to bear in mind that it is not an inability to pay that is at stake for people who get into the hands of moneylenders.  As the Minister knows, sometimes they have to pay up to 200 per cent rates of interest.  They have a proven ability to meet payments but they have not a track record or access to the more reputable areas of lending.  The Minister can, through his Department, take a role in promoting access for ordinary families who do not have bank accounts and who are on a weekly wage, to get the sort of information and access to credit that they do not now have.  When I was Minister of State I met with the banks and the credit unions, and the banks, in particular, expressed a willingness to change their approach in relation to small sums which admittedly is not a very highly profitable business for them.  They were willing to look, on a pilot basis in difficult areas around the country, at an approach that would make lending more accessible <Col N="904" /> to people who do not have a record with banking agencies and who at present are those most vulnerable to exploitative lending.  I would like to see the Minister revive that initiative with the banks and see if he can put in place a series of pilot projects that would attempt to wean away from the illegitimate and drastically high-charging lending people who have genuine needs at Christmas and Communion time and so on.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the whole issue of moneylending that is wrapped up with this.  The Minister is in the course of preparing legislation and this is part of it.  He is creating criminal offences for lending agencies, offences which under the present Moneylending Act are not criminal offences.  In a very short period of time the legislation created by his Department will be the only effective legislation against moneylenders.  The Moneylending Act will be passed out by the more modern provisions that he is introducing for all lending agencies.  It will become a job for his Department to look at the issue of enforcement of the provisions which he is now planning not only in relation to the legitimate sector which he knows about but the area of moneylending which his Department have consistently avoided looking at.</P>
    <P>It is a shame to see the Moneylending Act, with its gross deficiencies, languishing in the Department of Justice where I believe there is not the sort of real interest in consumer credit issues that is in the Minister's own Department nor the sort of expertise in dealing with these issues. I sincerely ask the Minister to consider taking the Moneylending Act into his Department.  This is something the Minister for Justice has consistently advocated. The usual arguments provided against that is that the Minister's Department do not have experience in enforcement and the criminal offences that are tied up with moneylending.  The Minister is creating criminal offences in the credit area, and he has created criminal offences in many other areas also, but that does not mean that he will become part of the Garda or that he will be in charge of enforcement.  All I am asking <Col N="905" /> is that the Minister who has the skills and the advice available to him to put together decent legislation to control the problem of moneylending should take on that task.  That is not to take the job of enforcement away from the Garda but is to give them decent legislation so that they can do something about enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, the present moneylending legislation does not contain criminal offences for most of the things that we in this House regard as terrible abuses.  It is not a criminal offence for a moneylender to charge 300 or 400 per cent for credit.  All that means is that if the victim of that abuse took the moneylender to court the moneylender would not be able to enforce the loan. The Garda cannot take any action against that sort of practice on the basis of that legislation.  They need legislation that creates criminal offences, in the way the Minister now intends doing, in many areas of credit.  I ask the Minister not to close his mind to this question because it has an unseemly criminal undertone about it.  I believe that it is his responsibility to create the environment where the least well off families can get a fair crack of the whip in relation to credit.  He should not just confine his attention to those who are now able to deal with legitimate lending agencies.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this order is one of a series of actions taken by him to make this a real crusade against unfair access for many families in the area of credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for contributing to the debate on this order. Like Deputy John Bruton I too share the concern that it has taken so long to get it to the stage of being passed through this House.  This was started away back in 1974 by an advisory council but it is no reflection on anyone in the House or anyone connected with it that it has taken until now to come before the House.  In 1981 the consumers' association highlighted it and it was published by the previous Government in October 1986 but it did not make it through the Dáil at <Col N="906" /> that time.  I was disappointed on the many occasions that I tried to get it through this House.  I certainly share the views of the Deputies who said they did not know why it was put into the 1978 Act that these orders should have to come to this House for a full debate.  They could quite easily have been dealt with outside the House and the opportunity could have been left open for debate if somebody wanted to question them as is the case with other orders.  However, that would require amendment of the 1978 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton asked about bringing a further order forward in relation to contracts and said it would get a speedy passage through the House.  If I could rely on that I would be prepared to do it.  I would like to remind Deputies Richard Bruton and John Bruton that the EC Directive on Consumer Credit has been agreed and we are working towards the implementation of it.  I would certainly bring an order before the House if I thought I could rely on getting it speedily through the House.  I hardly accept this order could have got through any earlier than by putting it in as part of the implementation of EC Consumer Directive. It has taken a long time to get it before the House and it is not for want of trying on my part that it was not before the House sooner.  The same problems seem to have existed during the time of the previous Government when in October 1986 the order was there but was not passed.</P>
      <P>The question of moneylending was raised by Deputy Richard Bruton who suggested I should take control of that area.  I should like to tell him I do not have the opportunity to grab the Act governing that activity from the Department of Justice.  He should know that as well as I do.  I am aware that the Deputy had a question to the Minister for Justice on the matter but I did not see responsibility for the Act put on offer on that day. It is with the Department of Justice.</P>

I should like to remind Deputy Keating who raised a number of points about banks that the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987 which is at Committee Stage in the House will remove the exemption of licensed banks in relation to advertisements and bank charges.  I hope we will be able to see that Bill through before the Christmas recess.  I should like to tell Deputy Keating who referred to small print and so on that that point is dealt with in the order.  In my view it is quite clear in the order that there will have to be prominent print.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton mentioned that the deposit requirement was not included in calculating the APR and he asked for clarification in regard to that matter.  I have not seen the most recent ESB bill sent to our house but I will talk to my wife who usually pays our bill about the matter.  I will see to it that it is brought to their notice immediately that they have to come in line when the order is passed by the House, like everybody else. Deputy Keating also raised a question about advertising.  I should like to tell him that all types of advertising, in brochures, in newspapers, on radio and television are covered by the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that for something that impinges on the less well-off sections of our society we needed a long process to get this order together and through the House.  Discussion on it should have started in 1974, it went on until 1981 and went through various Governments since until it was put on the Order Paper last March.  I cannot say I am getting the <Col N="908" /> order through as early as I would have liked or as early as I tried but at least it is through at last and we will make full use of it.  This covers a very important area in relation to consumer protection and information.  I have not been inactive in that very interesting area but a lot more work remains to be done.  I will continue to do that work to the best of my ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider an amendment to the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill now before the House to speed up the order making powers under the Consumer Information Act?  In that context is the Minister saying that he is favourably disposed to the idea of making void contracts in which the APR is not revealed as well as making it a criminal offence to fail to advertise the APR?  Does the Minister agree with Deputy Richard Bruton that the APR should include deposit requirements and, if so, has he any intention of amending the present order to ensure that it does?</P>

If I were to consider amending it at this stage I wonder when I would get the Bill passed.  We should be realistic about this.  I would prefer to have the powers in the Bill as soon as possible and not to start drafting amendments at this stage because we would be pushing it back to God knows when.</P>

      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the Dáil on 29th October, 1987.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is é cuspóir an ordaithe seo atá i ndréacht &mdash; an t-Ordú um an Acht Rathaíocht Stáit, 1954 (Leasú ar an Sceideal) 1987 &mdash; ná cumhacht a thabhairt don Rialtas dul i mbannaí i gcóir iasachtaí Aer Rianta cpt. mar is gá.

Ghlac an Seanad leis an Rún cheana féin ar an 20 Deireadh Fómhair, 1986.</P>
      <P>This motion arises from the Government's approval of the construction of a new runway and associated works at Dublin Airport.  The motion, if approved, will facilitate the provision of a State guarantee for up to £25 million of borrowing by Aer Rianta.  It is unlikely that Aer Rianta's borrowings for this particular project will amount to £25 million but the draft order provides for a maximum of that amount to ensure that the amendment will be adequate to meet the cost of any unforeseeable developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a State guarantee facility in respect of borrowings by Aer <Col N="910" /> Rianta requires an amendment to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954.  It is in this context that the motion arises.  The order in draft has already been approved by the Seanad and Dáil approval is also required before the Government can make the order.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport's runway system dates from the mid-1940s.  The runways were designed to cope with the types of aircraft operating at that time as well as aircraft and technological developments then anticipated.  Since they were constructed the runways have been extended, overlaid and continuously maintained.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the age of the Dublin Airport runway system, the developments in size and weight of aircraft in recent years and the need to provide for the long-term traffic needs of the airport, a group of experts, representative of Aer Rianta, the then Department of Transport and Aer Lingus was established to carry out a detailed examination of the airport's future runway requirements. The group, which completed its work in 1981, concluded that further maintenance of the existing main runway would not be a viable option and recommended that a new east-west runway should be constructed on the southern side of the airport terminal area.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the group's report, and following a further technical analysis of the condition of the runways and an assessment of a number of alternative options, the Government gave approval in December, 1985 for the provision of a new 8,650 feet runway, together with associated facilities, at Dublin Airport, at an estimated cost of £31.26 million at 1985 prices.</P>
    <P>The new runway will intersect the Ballymun/Naul Road.  Local residents and other users of the Ballymun/Naul Road were very concerned about the proposal to close the road and to replace it by two new roads running parallel to and located on each side of the runway, linking the Ballymun/Naul Road with St. Margaret's Road.  An action group made strong representations to the Minister for Tourism and Transport objecting to the proposed road closure and sought instead <Col N="911" /> the provision of a tunnel to carry a road under the runway and parallel taxiway.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that all representations regarding the Ballymum/Naul Road proposal were carefully considered and while the Government were disposed to providing a tunnel, they had no option but to take cognisance of the advice of the Garda authorities on the security implications of a tunnel.</P>
    <P>Their advice was that for security reasons the tunnel should not be built.  In view of the concerns of the local residents, however, the Government decided in July 1987 to provide additional roads and to have further improvements undertaken to existing roads at an additional cost of £3.06 million.</P>
    <P>Arising from the construction of the new runway, it will also be necessary to close a section of Collinstown Lane.  A replacement road will be provided to connect the lane with the Old County Road at Commons Townland and this will meet the requirements of the local community.</P>
    <P>The investment on the overall project will be the largest single investment ever undertaken at a State airport.  As well as the runway itself, the project will include the provision of a parallel taxiway system, advanced navigational aids, a new air traffic control tower/technical building and the roadworks I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The project will provide about 200 jobs at peak during the construction of the runway and the associated work and indeed will be one of the largest in the northern part of County Dublin over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The new runway will have an east-west designation and as a result there will be a significant reduction in aircraft noise levels for densely populated areas of Dublin city and county, whose residents have from time to time complained about aircraft noise.  Noise levels, in particular, will be significantly reduced in areas such as Ballymun, Finglas, Swords and Castleknock, a factor which I am sure will be welcomed by residents of those areas.</P>
    <P>The actual development work on the project commenced in August 1986 with <Col N="912" /> the provision of water and sewerage services to the proposed new air traffic control tower and technical building.  A new high tension electricity supply for the project has been provided and relevant drainage works have been undertaken. Work on the actual construction of the runway commenced in mid-July 1987 and the runway should be completed in about 20 months.</P>
    <P>I am quite pleased with the progress so far and I am hopeful that the new runway will be operational by early summer 1989.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the three State airports are managed by Aer Rianta on an agency basis on behalf of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  Under these arrangements capital expenditure at the airports has traditionally been funded totally by the Exchequer, while the surpluses earned by Aer Rianta have been surrendered directly to the Exchequer. Recently the company have been given responsibility for the funding of certain commercial projects from their own resources.</P>
    <P>In view of the heavy demands on the Exchequer, the scale of expenditure involved in the Dublin runway project, the expected commercial rate of return on the project and the strong financial performance of Aer Rianta in recent years, the Government have decided that the bulk of the funds for the runway project should be provided by the company from their own resources.  It is envisaged that the company will provide 75 per cent of the funds required, with 25 per cent coming directly from their own resources and another 50 per cent from borrowings.  The remaining 25 per cent of the cost of the project will be provided by the Exchequer in the form of capital grants over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta have had discussions with a number of financial institutions including the European investment Bank, on their terms for borrowing.  A final decision on the source of borrowing will not be taken until immediately prior to the time of borrowing because of the anticipated fall in interest rates.</P>
    <P>In 1986, Exchequer funds amounting to almost £1 million were expended on <Col N="913" /> the runway project.  This year total expenditure on the project will be about £6.5 million, of which £2.6 million will be provided by the Exchequer.  As some borrowing will arise, it is essential that the appropriate facility for State guaranteed borrowings by Aer Rianta be in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Passenger throughput at the three State airports is confidently expected to exceed five million by the end of 1987 compared with 4.42 million in 1986. Dublin naturally, and this is widely accepted, is the busiest of the three airports and accounts for about 66 per cent of the total passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>In the ten months to the end of October 1987 passenger traffic at Dublin amounted to 3.1 million, an increase of 22 per cent over the corresponding period in 1986.  There is no doubt that the growth in passenger traffic is due to the stimulatory effects of the low air fares policy being pursued by the Government.  It is expected that passenger throughput at Dublin Airport for the full year will reach a record 3.5 million, which is over two-thirds of the total expected traffic for the three State airports.  To eliminate congestion arising from these increased passenger numbers, improvements were made in the passenger terminal at Dublin Airport earlier this year at a cost of almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>On the financial side Dublin's performance is equally impressive.  It recorded a surplus of over £10 million in 1986.  The provision of the new runway will not only enhance the future prospects of the airport and meet its traffic needs well into the next century, but it is confidently expected that it will generate a further increase in profits at the airport.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about our two other State airports, Shannon and Cork, which are managed by Aer Rianta.  Major improvements are underway in the terminal building at Shannon and the apron is being extended on a phased basis.  The cost of these improvements will be about £2 million and are necessary to enable the airport to cater for the increases in traffic which it is experiencing.  Passenger throughput to <Col N="914" /> the end of October this year at 1.1 million was up by about 8.5 per cent on the corresponding period in 1986.</P>
    <P>Another welcome development at Shannon has been the construction recently of a new aviation fuel depot which enables Aer Rianta to sell, at very competitive prices, fuel to airlines using the airport.  This project was, I am glad to say, financed directly by Aer Rianta from their own resources.</P>
    <P>At Cork Airport major improvements are being undertaken which will also involve substantial investment. The main runway is to be extended by 1,000 feet and improved navigational aids will be provided.  Improvements are also being undertaken to the terminal building.  The overall expenditure involved is in excess of £4 million.  The passenger throughput up to end of October this year at 383,369 has shown a 24 per cent increase over the same period last year.  I am quite satisfied that the improvements now being undertaken will further enhance Cork's excellent performance of recent times as the airport will be able to accommodate without penalty larger aircraft for longer routes.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House. Mar sin molaim go rithfear an Rún seo.</P>

      <P>We fully support this motion as it is basically the brain-child of the previous Government whose approval for the project was granted in December 1985 and the work on which commenced in August 1986.  It is obviously a very necessary development at Dublin Airport and while the State is providing handsome grants to Aer Rianta for the work in question I am glad that the company are providing 75 per cent of the money either through their own resources or through borrowings, which is an indication of the healthy state of Aer Rianta whose performance in recent years was very laudable.  A few points in the Minister's statement would not be readily understood by a layman.  For instance, the Minister said that the new runway will lead to a lessening of noise levels in the densely populated areas of <Col N="915" /> Dublin city and county.  Why should longer runways, bigger planes and more traffic reduce the notice levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It will reduce the noise levels in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the new runway will be built in an east-west designation seems totally logical in view of the traditional wind directions in this country.  I would have though that runways not built to an east-west designation would not be properly constructed.  What was the reasoning behind the designation of the previous runways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am almost &mdash; but not quite &mdash; amused by the assertion that the growth in passenger traffic is due to the stimulatory effects of the low air fares policy pursued by the Government.  That is less than honest because the Minister should have said that policy was instigated by the last Government.  Remember that the low air fares policy was introduced as far back as December 1985 with the granting of a licence to Ryanair to operate commercial services in and out of this country.  That, together with the deregulation of air fares, brough about primarily by the Commissioner, Mr. Sutherland, led to this tremendous reduction in air fares in and out of the country.  The fact that it is continuing is due to the stimulus it received at that time.  To hear senior or junior Ministers claiming credit for something that has been in operation for 12 months is a little sinister.  Let us face the fact that the initiative was taken in the lifetime of the previous Government under the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell. The improvement has been apparent ever since.  For instance, the Minister said that the number of passengers going through the three State airports in 1987 will exceed 5 million compared with 4.42 million in 1986.  For Dublin alone the number to the end of October 1987 is 3.1 million which is an increase of 22 per cent over the corresponding period in 1986. Let us be perfectly clear about the fact that that is not due to any policy introduced by the Government, nor can it be <Col N="916" /> attributed to any policy instigated by the national airline, Aer Lingus, who probably have the best public relations operation in the country.  If their fares are lower it is because of competition created by the introduction of licences for private operators.  Let us get that out in the open and say very clearly that we were ripped off for many years in relation to air fares. Aer Lingus had a monopoly and anybody in the State airline or associated with it who claims that they were the pioneers of lower air fares should be ashamed of themselves.  We all owe the lower air fares structure to the enlightened approach of the previous Minister for Transport and his colleagues who granted licences despite opposition from the national airline.  Those people who created and maintained higher air fares over the years should have the decency to apologise to the travelling public for overcharging prior to the advent of the independent airlines and the lower air fares structures.  Why were people charged more five, six and seven years ago to travel to and from London then they are charged today?  We are entitled to an explanation.</P>
    <P>It was one of the greatest rip-offs of the century that we had an overmanned and inefficient national airline but, of course, if one speaks out about a national body one is accused of being anti-national and not having the best interests of the country at heart.  Any airline which has an Irish base, employing Irish staff, doing the job properly and giving a better service than heretofore are entitled to credit and praise but let nobody claim that they brought about something which they opposed.  That is hyprocisy.</P>
    <P>It would be illuminating if we had a publication of the air fares structures that existed here in the ten years prior to the introduction of deregulation or licences for independent airlines.  Remember, that the initiation of this was during the last Government's term of office and it started in December 1985 and not on 10 March 1987 as some people here have tried to insinuate.  It has worked like a dream.  It increased traffic by 20 per cent this year and 20 per cent last year.  No <Col N="917" /> doubt that trend will continue.  It is working wonders for the tourist industry.  It is providing jobs not just in tourism but in the transport industry.  More people are travelling to Ireland.  That indicates that the policy has been a tremendous success. It is a pity that it was not done years previously.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement referred to the two other State airports, Shannon and Cork and pointed out that considerable improvement works had been undertaken in both those airports.  There are improvements to the terminal building at Shannon, the construction of a new aviation fuel depot and, in Cork, the main runway is being extended &mdash; another initiative brought about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have a comprehensive State policy for all airports.  Although we only have three state owned airports under the control of Aer Rianta, because of deregulation and the licensing of independent operators, we have had a huge increase in the volume of traffic going through airports which are now classified as regional airports, so we need a national policy for an airport system.  It is not easy to classify regional airports because they are independently owned.  A report I read recently showed that there are something like 76 airports or air strips in this country. Is it not time we had a grading system and a policy for the development of not just major airports but of those regional airports capable of taking very large aircraft? Knock Airport is classified as a regional airport as is Waterford Airport and many others.  These airports are capable of accommodating large aircraft.  If Waterford Airport had a larger runway it could accommodate larger aircraft.  I am asking the Minister to look at the overall situation with regard to airports presently providing a scheduled air service or a number of scheduled air services. Ryanair are operating daily <Col N="918" /> services from Knock to a number of destinations in Britain.  Waterford Airport is operating a daily schedule to Luton.  I am not aware of other airports doing likewise but we should have a debate in this House which would highlight airports capable of carrying on a scheduled service. Although I am not in a position to confirm it I have been told that an airport in a small town in County Donegal, Castlefin, is operating a scheduled service to certain locations in Britain, perhaps to Glasgow or Edinburgh.  It would be interesting to know how many airports are capable of developing services like that, services which would be a tremendous boon not just to the tourist industry but to industrialists who want to go to areas in the remoter parts of Ireland.  If we had scheduled services rather than chartered planes they could get to their destination at a reasonable cost in an hour or two from anywhere in mainland Britain.  It is time we have a grading system for airports especially when we have had this explosion in passenger numbers which is making this business viable.  It is viable nowadays to operate from airports which we would never have considered viable two or three years ago.  It is now clear that Knock Airport can become financially viable.  I have said publicly before that that is a great achievement.  A number of other airports can likewise be viable and provide a wonderful service to the public.</P>
    <P>We have no problem in moving this motion which basically was ours and I recommend it to the House as did the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to this measure which is to provide a State guarantee of £25 million to rebuild the main runway at Dublin Airport.  As the Minister said, the existing runway is now 40 years old.  I assume that over that time it has suffered a lot of structural damage and it is presumably cheaper to replace it now than to carry out some type of maintenance programme on it.  In arriving at the decision to reconstruct the runway there must have been detailed surveys into the condition of the existing runway, it being found in the long run <Col N="919" /> that it was cheaper to build a new runway to cater for the future needs of Dublin airport.  Obviously the new runway, which will be considerably longer than the existing runway, will greatly benefit the future operations of the airport.  The fact that it is being replaced in its entirety and being increased in length is welcome for the reasons I have mentioned because it will enhance operational prospects at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Because a new runway is being built its orientation is being changed; it will run in an east-west direction.  There are two beneficial factors arising therefrom.  The immediate one that concerns me is that quite a lot of noise problems had been associated with the old runway, particularly in areas in North County Dublin such as Ballymun and Swords.  In my constituency there were adverse consequences resulting from aircraft noise in places like Blanchardstown and Castleknock. Therefore, the reorientation of the runway, which will give rise to different flight paths in and out of Dublin Airport, will be beneficial.  I assume that, so far as is possible, those flight paths will be located over less populated areas than is the case now.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The other point to bear in mind is that the runway is being increased in length by approximately 1,100 feet.  This should improve the capacity of the airport to handle larger and fully laden aircraft.  I understand there has been continuous difficulty experienced with regard to some charter flights in and out of Dublin Airport, flights to various sun spots.  It appears that if they are fully laden they cannot fly safely in and out of Dublin Airport.  Therefore, this extended runway will allow such fully laden flights to operate more safely.  That will augment usage at the airport which is also highly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume also that this extended runway will have the capacity to handle transatlantic traffic.  That being the case, I wonder what will be the implications for Shannon Airport where there is at present a requirement on all transatlantic flights entering and leaving the country <Col N="920" /> to touch down there?  Given that Dublin Airport will now have the capacity to handle such flights, perhaps the Minister would advise us whether the commitment on transatlantic flights to land at Shannon will be maintained.  Now that Dublin will have that capacity I imagine it is possible that that commitment to Shannon Airport may be withdrawn at some point in the future, which would have very severe consequences for Shannon Airport and the people of that region.</P>
    <P>I understand the overall cost of the new runway will be £34 million, which includes not merely the cost of construction of the runway but other ancillary works, including much necessary roadworks which have to be undertaken on roads which will be affected by the coming into operation of the new runway and by the flight paths arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>I welcome this order because its implementation will be beneficial to the air transport industry generally.  Certainly it increases the capacity of Dublin Airport to handle a wider range of air traffic more efficiently.  I also welcome the fact that this project will give rise to a considerable number of construction jobs.  I believe the Minister said that approximately 200 jobs would be created at the peak period.  Of course the construction industry have suffered very severely in recent years.  Therefore, public works programmes of this nature are very desirable from the point of view of their employment content, another reason for my being happy to see this project go ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the timescale within which the borrowings must be repaid.  I do not notice anything in the Minister's remarks to indicate whether Aer Rianta have worked out a timescale within which they expect to be able to repay the borrowings on the strength of this guarantee.  The Minister might let me have that information when replying.</P>
    <P>Various Members who have contributed to this debate so far have claimed credit for all of the growth that has taken place in air transport in recent years. They have claimed credit for deregulation of the licensing of independent <Col N="921" /> operators and the generally improved position that has evolved in recent years. I think I can appropriately leave it to my party leader, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, to answer that aspect more fully. While I was not a Member of the House at the time it is my clear recollection it was he who first set down the markers in all of this area.  I have no doubt he will deal with that aspect in his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Desmond O'Malley will have to wait a little longer to benefit from that accolade. I do not claim any credit for the deregulation of air fares to and from this country.  I have had nothing to do with them.  Naturally I welcome fair and honest competition in all areas and I must compliment Aer Lingus on the job they have undertaken over a very long period. Times have changed, they must now be competitive; they are, and are proving to be successful in changed circumstances.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion before the House I, too, welcome what is taking place at Dublin Airport, specifically in regard to the extension of the new runway.  I shall not claim credit for the fact that it was begun when I was a member of the previous Government. That is history and is on the record.  Bearing in mind all of the cuts the present Government have been proposing since they assumed office I am indeed glad this is one project they feel should continue. This has come about in no small measure because Aer Rianta themselves can pay for the great bulk of the work involved, which, in itself, is a blessing.  We have a roads network largely dependent on State aid.  We know the slow-down that has taken place since I produced a roads programme countrywide just a few short years ago and which seems now to have come almost to a complete halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course problems were encountered in the locality of this new extended runway.  The people living there, using roads on the perimeter of the airport, had to be catered for in drawing up the changes proposed.  Their proposal that a tunnel be constructed under the new runway was not a sound one given the <Col N="922" /> unfortunate security problems we now encounter.  The construction of such a tunnel probably would require now the presence of security personnel at all times to ensure that none of the madmen who inhabit both parts of this island would have access to a vital link with the outside world, who could cause great distress were anything unfortunate to happen in that locality.  I welcome the changes being effected in the roads system in that area and the money being allocated to ensure that the people who live in there, who have to use the roads in the locality, will have a proper road network, rendering commuting time somewhat easier for them on the perimeter of the airport. That is very important and I am glad money is being spent in this way to look after the needs of those people.</P>
    <P>The flight path of the new runway has been mentioned.  I am sure that new orientations have been considered for the flight path but I am inclined to think that there must have been some scientific design in the orientation of the old flight paths.  Wind directions, etc. would have been taken into account.  In those days such work would not have been carried out in a haphazard way.  Large aircraft can, to a large extent, ignore wind direction and can, with all the modern techniques, land safely.  Wind direction is not constant.  For long periods the wind may blow from the south-west and the flight path is east-west orientated but that is only a very minute point considering modern techniques and the development of aircraft.</P>
    <P>More significant is the fact that there is a runway much longer at Dublin Airport, and therefore it should be able to facilitate all types of modern aircraft that are now being flown throughout the world. The aircraft that requires the greatest amount of space is probably the Concorde. It is not my favourite aircraft and I have travelled in quite a few of them in the last eight or ten years.  Nevertheless, it is a modern and much used aircraft but one that I understand could not be regularly accommodated at Dublin Airport. A modern realignment of that airport would ensure that whatever aircraft <Col N="923" /> are available for regular service could be catered for.</P>
    <P>This new runway will give rise to very delicate political arguments.  Pressure has been put on previous Ministers for Transport to allow the American carriers to fly into Dublin, either after a stop at Shannon or to use Dublin as a backtrack for some of their scheduled flights from Europe and Britain.  There were merits in those demands for the east coast area. Many people want to fly to the capital city and regard it as a slight nuisance to have to stop elsewhere and change planes for a very short flight onwards to Dublin. When the proponents of deregulation and cheaper air flights make their arguments for the convenience of passengers they should also take that point into consideration. The decision to ensure that the west benefited from carriers stopping at Shannon was a wise one.  It has been of great benefit to Shannon and to the west.  It would be a serious blow to the tourist industry there should the number of people who at present embark of disembark at Shannon have the opportunity to fly direct to or from Dublin.  I wonder how long that policy can continue in the face of the great pressures that are being brought to bear from the huge conglomerates that run the American aircraft system to fly into Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deregulation in America has meant that fewer aircraft companies have survived. Increasingly, there are take-over bids for the smaller national airlines in that country.  Companies such as North West Orient, Delta and so on will I am sure be bringing great pressure on the Irish Government to allow them fly into Dublin Airport.  The provision of a longer airstrip in Dublin will ensure that the facility to do so will be available to them. That is a very delicate political argument and one that the Government of the day will have to face and have faced in the past.  It will be interesting to see what will happen when that pressure is brought to bear on the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>At present three and a half million people use Dublin Airport.  It is not just <Col N="924" /> necessary to lengthen the runway but also to consider upgrading some of the other facilities at the airport.  One is well aware of the confusion that reigns in the car parking area at the airport.  There are several car parks at the airport, one of which was originally built at a very high cost, that is a covered car park but it does not seem to be available to all the people who use the airport.  In the past if one paid a premium one could use it but for security reasons it was believed to be dangerous to allow normal car parking in that area.  In any event it would be far too small now for the number of people who would wish to use it.  At present it seems to be used solely by employees of the airport.  A high rise car park nearer to the terminal is needed to facilitate passengers with their luggage.  Long periods of time can elapse when one is looking for a car parking space, particularly during the summer and at Christmas when the airport is used much more frequently than at any other time.  The car parking facilities at Dublin Airport are chaotic.  Something should be done to modernise them.  That would be money well spent as the cost of parking a car there is relatively high.  It would be welcomed by most people who use the airport regularly.  They would be happy to pay a little extra to have car parking facilities nearer to the airport terminal.</P>
    <P>It would also be more secure to have a car park under cover.  At present with the open car park people often return from flights abroad to find that the doors of their cars have been opened or that their cars have been scratched.  One is not covered by insurance for that kind of damage to a car.  If we are really going to modernise Dublin Airport, a spur from the DART system to Dublin Airport would facilitate people using the airport. It would be costly, but other national airports such as the one in Brussels and the main London airport have had to accept this and introduce such a facility. It is a great facility for those who arrive in the country without readily available transport, generating even more traffic to and from the airport.  It would go some <Col N="925" /> way towards solving the problem of car parking at the airport.</P>
    <P>The likely cost of this new facility is about £25 million.  The Minister has not told us what kind of claim is being made to the EC to claw back some of this money.  I am sure grants could be got from the regional fund's infrastructural sector to help with this.  We should know if that is the case and what benefit we are getting from the EC towards the provision of this new facility.</P>
    <P>My final point is not one to do with what is happening in this airport, but I hope the Chair will allow me to make it. It is simply to point out that we seem to be aircraft-orientated to the detriment of other types of carrier.  We spend huge sums of money on our airports and in buying aircraft and the like.  When one lives in a seaport town and sees the lack of money being made available for ports one wonders if we have gone too far in favour of airports and aircraft to the detriment of seaports and our shipping carriers who are the basic carriers for so many people in the country.  Very little money has been spent on many of the small ports around the country and they are, in most cases, in a state of decay.  We seem to be going to extremes spending money on airport facilities.  I suggest to the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport that we have 27 or so ports which come under the aegis of the Department of the Marine now.  Nevertheless, very little money is spent on the upkeep, repair, maintenance and extension of seaports compared to the amounts spent on our airports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this motion and comment on some of the things said here this morning by the Minister of State.  It is the first time I have spoken in the House on airports and air transport policy since the difficult days of 1984-85.  Like Deputy Deasy I have to pick out, at the outset, the extraordinary sentence uttered by the Minister of State this morning, &ldquo;The growth in passenger traffic is due to the stimulatory effects of the low airfares policy being pursued by <Col N="926" /> the Government&rdquo;.  I would ask people who are interested in that point to read the debates on the Second and Committee Stages of the Air Transport Bill, 1984, and to look at what happened there from 26 January 1984 onwards into the autumn and winter of 1985 when there were a succession of divisions challenged in this House on this very point of low airfares, on whether we should have competition in airlines.  The result of each division was the same, one for, 165 against.</P>
      <P>Not alone was there opposition to the whole idea that we should have lower airfares, competition between airlines and a break up of the disgraceful cartel that operated in this country for so long, but there was derision at the very idea.  I was described by people on both sides of the House as anti-national.  That is a phrase that was used in respect of me on other occasions; but I was anti-national, no less, and the derision was equal from both sides.  I remember Deputy Jim Mitchell who was then Minister standing up over there and pointing at me across here and saying &ldquo;Here he rides again, the lone ranger.  He cannot get anyone to agree with him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I really am amused at the statements that are being made at the moment.  Only last week in the European Parliament Deputy Paddy Lalor, that man who has devoted so many years to thinking about the ins and outs of air transport, went on at great length lauding the policies being pursued by the Irish Government in this respect and what they had achieved.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal first with Aer Rianta itself which is the subject of this motion.  There have been a succession of measures in this House over the past couple of months looking for more money to be injected into various State companies and looking for permission from the Minister for Finance to guarantee more borrowings by most of these State companies.  In relation to another £100 million that will go down the drain with CIE, Deputy Martin Cullen said on our behalf that it was time for this sort of nonsense to stop, that we would have to draw the line at <Col N="927" /> pouring more and more funds into the bottomless pit that many of these State companies are.</P>
    <P>I absolutely agree with what Deputy Cullen had to say but an exception can be made in the case of Aer Rianta.  I have admired it for many years; it is properly run, it is commercially run, it has a proper attitude on how to run its affairs, which is in stark contrast with many of the companies with which it has to deal and other companies in the semi-State sector who are anything but commercial or realistic in their outlook.  I am delighted to see that two-thirds of this money is being provided by Aer Rianta out of its own resources.  I hope that very soon we will be in a position where all moneys of this kind that it has to raise will be raised from its own resources.  Knowing Aer Rianta and the competent way in which they are managed I would be very confident that this guarantee, which we formally have to authorise today, will never be called on.  There is no question of the Minister for Finance or the Exchequer at any time having to honour the guarantee that is given now.</P>
    <P>The one reservation I have about the proposal for which this guarantee is needed is that it is proposed to build a new runway of 8,650 feet at Dublin Airport.  That does not seem to me to be an inordinate lenght.  I am relieved in fact to find that it is only that length because the proposals of some years ago were that a runway of between 10,000 and 11,000 feet would be built at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The proposal some years ago was that a runway of between 10,000 and 11,000 feet would be built at Dublin Airport.  At that time &mdash; and this goes back over a period of ten years &mdash; I expressed some very serious reservations about any such proposal because I realised that if that happened Aer Lingus, whose commitment to Shannon Airport and that region is and always has been negligible, indeed their attitude is almost hostile, would immediately avail of the opportunity to cut out Shannon Airport altogether and have all of their trans-Atlantic flights landing only in Dublin.  I am not <Col N="928" /> sufficiently expert in this to know if it is possible for them to do this with a runway of 8,650 feet, but would rather think it unlikely.  Certainly, I should think it would be dangerous for fully laden 747 aircraft with full fuel on board to try to take off from a runway of that length.  It may be physically possible to do it, but I do not know if it is within the limits of safety.  I should like an assurance from the Minister of State that this is not the intention.  I want that assurance, not as something that is passed on from Aer Lingus, whose word I would not accept on a matter like this, but as Aer Rianta's decision and the Department's decision that even if it were physically possible for a fully laden 747 or similar type plane to take off on a trans-Atlantic flight, that it would not be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>In any event, one would have thought that if normal commercial considerations dominated in a matter of this kind there would be no question of their wanting to do that from Dublin, anyway, because it has been Aer Lingus's experience over all the years and the experience of other airlines which use both Dublin and Shannon in relation to the trans-Atlantic routes that, year in year out, two-thirds of the passengers on the North Atlantic route embark and disembark at Shannon. Even when it is open to them to come to Dublin, by a majority of two to one they choose not to do so.  I have no reason to believe that that pattern would change in the future, but I want to ensure that they are given the opportunity of embarking and disembarking at Shannon.  In that regard, it is something of a disappointment to find that there is only a passing reference here to Shannon and to some very minor work being done there. There is in Shannon, in spite of its size, busyness and so forth, only one real runway.  The other runways are no longer suitable for modern planes.  They can be used only for light planes, or perhaps in an emergency.  There is a very definite and clear need for the planning and building of a cross runway at Shannon to enable it to be used in all weather conditions by all planes using that airport.</P>
    <P>I notice that the growth in traffic in <Col N="929" /> Shannon has not been as great as in the two other airports.  Unfortunately, as we face into 1988 the growth will be limited by the serious problems, which are created due to the weakness of the dollar, for our North American tourist trade in the year to come.  That is why I heartily welcome Aer Rianta's efforts to spread the attractions of Shannon as an airport to more than just people flying the North Atlantic route into Ireland as tourists.  The advent of the Russian and Cuban airlines to Shannon has been terrifically beneficial and I hope that Aer Rianta's efforts to extend it to other eastern European airlines will be successful.  I hope that proposals they have in train at the moment with the Russians and with other Communist countries will come to fruition, because Shannon could have been facing a bleak time with the present dollar situation were it not for these arrangements that Aer Rianta have so successfully made.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that up to the end of October there has been a 22 per cent increase in passenger traffic in Dublin over 1986.  That is marvellous news and we know why that happened.  The 1986 figure was, in turn, a huge increase over 1985 and in his reply I should like the Minister to tell us what the increase in 1987 is over the corresponding period in 1985.  That would be an even more significant figure.</P>
    <P>I notice that the forecasts I made here in 1984 about the increase in traffic that we could generate and which were derided at the time as being crazy and impossible to achieve have, in fact, been exceeded.  In concrete and practical terms, we have had in each of the last two years about 200,000 additional people coming into this country who would not have come here if the old, traditional Government view to uphold the Aer Lingus cartel had been maintained. Think of the difference it would have made to this country if we had lost those 200,000 people in the last two years.  How much greater the degree of depression would be if those people had not been enabled to visit us.  Deputy Deasy's expression of indignation here <Col N="930" /> this morning at what Aer Lingus were allowed to get away with for so long, even though it was angry was perfectly justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The best part of their operations are public relations operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is often true of companies of that type. It is true of others, also.  I raised the matter here about two years ago that we had an admission, finally, from Aer Lingus that they paid £500,000 of Irish money to KLM, Royal Dutch Airlines, not to fly into Ireland.  I do not know if the real significance and impact of that ever got across here.  KLM, which is one of the major airlines of the world could have brought in over the years probably hundreds of thousands of people into this country if they had been allowed to do so, but the Aer Lingus attitude to them was that they were not to do so, that Aer Lingus would give them a substantial profit not to come in here at all.  When I recall what was described as anti-national &mdash; my attitude in trying to bring in competition &mdash; and compare that with what Aer Lingus did at that time it gives me cause for thought.</P>
      <P>The advent of competition, by Ryanair particularly, on the Ireland-UK routes has opened up the market completely and has changed the whole scene.  The minimum normal fare between Britain and Ireland in 1984, when I was arguing here in this House, was £208.  It was almost impossible to pay less unless you entered into all kinds of restrictive arrangements. The normal fare, today, in December 1987, is £95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>And as low as £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, you can get substantially lower.  However, I am comparing like with like.  The normal fare was £208 in 1984 and today it is £95. When I said three years ago that it could have been that, I was derided.  We have a high degree of competition also now on the North Atlantic route because there are <Col N="931" /> four or five carriers operating scheduled services into Shannon and the American authorities will not countenance any cartel arrangements, or price maintenance, or price fixing, or anything of that kind.  Therefore, fare-wise the North Atlantic routes are okay but the routes which are anything but okay at present are those between Ireland and the Continent. In that third and remaining sector the old cartel system between the state-owned airlines is maintained, and the fares between Ireland and for example Germany, Denmark, France, Spain, on scheduled services, and Italy, are disgracefully high.  The normal fare between Ireland and some German cities is £450. You can fly the Atlantic over and back, which is three times the distance, for half the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>But you get a black pudding for your breakfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe if you go executive class you will get two sausages instead of one and that is supposed to justify paying an extra £200 for that kind of nonsense.  I suggest that the House should not tolerate that situation any longer and that Aer Lingus should be forced to break up the remaining cartels they are in with the State-owned continental airlines and in the process encourage the influx of the hundreds of thousands of German, French and other people who would come to this country if they could have access to it at a reasonable price.  Clearly it would be to our benefit if they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which this objective will be achieved is by allowing competition and if Ryanair are given routes to Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Copenhagen and Paris out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork, if they want them, we will find that the normal £450 fare will fall to about £200.  I say that with all the certainty with which I said in 1984 that the £208 fare between Dublin and London would be halved, and in fact it has been more than halved.  The Minister should now intervene, since a new light <Col N="932" /> has descended on those people who battled so valiantly against me in 1984 and 1985.  They should see the principle through and if there is truth in the statement or allegation made by the Minister of State this morning that a new low airfares policy is being pursued by the Government let them pursue it everywhere. They are not entitled to pursue it only on the Ireland-UK routes; it should be pursued everywhere.</P>
    <P>At that time, I told Aer Lingus, who mounted a strong, personal and political campaign against me for what I said in this House, that they would be the chief beneficiaries of an opening up of competition and a large increase in passenger numbers into and out of this country.  I told them that they should get rid of their inferiority complex and they were unable to compete and that they could survive only if they remained in cartels with other State airlines.  My words have been proven to be true.  When Aer Lingus did get into the marketplace and had got out from under the coat-tails of the cartels they were in for so many decades beforehand, they proved that they were able to compete.  Let them prove it now on the continental routes also.  If they can, not alone will the country benefit but, as I repeatedly told them in 1984, Aer Lingus will benefit as well.</P>
    <P>A help in arriving at the much happier position we find ourselves in today was the views expressed on behalf of Aer Rianta at the time by Mr. Martin Dully, their chief executive.  The manner in which he described the Aer Lingus attitude in 1984 was strong, to say the least of it; in fact it was so strong that I felt there were one or two words in it I would not be allowed to repeat in this House, but I think the man was absolutely justified as everyone else knows perfectly well.  I am glad he had the courage to say in public what everyone involved in this industry knew but which they were afraid to say.  It is a pity that at that time Bord Fáilte were not prepared to say the same in public although they were saying it freely in private.</P>
    <P>Another major factor in helping to bring about the change in climate was the <Col N="933" /> important part played by the Commissioner for Competition in Europe, Mr. Sutherland.  It was he who achieved the final breakthrough when Aer Lingus were putting up the last vestiges of resistance and when he threatened them with legal proceedings if they maintained the illegal and improper cartels they were so committed to.  We would not have achieved the changes we did and as rapidly as we did were it not for the efforts of Mr. Sutherland.  What he did helped all of Europe but it particularly helped Ireland and he has served this country extremely well.</P>
    <P>I express the hope now that the AngloSpanish dispute in regard to Gibraltar airport has been resolved in the last day or two, which is something I rejoice in, that Mr. Sutherland and the Commission will now be able to press ahead with their further proposals which are very exciting and which will be terrifically beneficial to this country, to all Irish airlines, both public and private, if they want to avail of them, and in particular for the tourist industry because access will suddenly be allowed on a reasonable fare level from many parts of Europe.  I commend Mr. Sutherland for what he has done and I ask him to continue with equal determination on the path on which he has set out on. I hope that in the next couple of years he will have the same degree of success as he has had in the past two.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister of State to be good enough to respond to the number of queries I raised in the course of my remarks.  I am supportive of what is being proposed.  I am particularly supportive of Aer Rianta and I congratulate them on their achievements to date.  They are a model which might usefully be copied by many other semi-State companies whose record is frequently so absymal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní mór dom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a chuidigh leis an rún atá os comhair an Tí.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions and I acknowledge their support for this motion.  I will endeavour <Col N="934" /> to answer the queries which were raised by each Deputy.  I acknowledge, in reply to Deputy Deasy, that some steps were taken in regard to access fares into this country by the previous Administration.  Not alone have we continued that initiative but a distinct policy drive on access fares is and will continue to be very evident in the Government's policy.  The Government's policy in that regard is acknowledged by everyone we meet, particularly in the tourist industry. Also acknowledged by all concerned is the fact that we are pursuing at every opportunity the further determination of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with that but let the Minister of State not pretend he started this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Deasy will accept what I said at the beginning and I accept that an initiative was taken. I did not say we took an initiative, I indicated we continued, improved on and emphasised it.  The drive is still going on and it will continue.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Deasy I do not wish to be parochial, but he talked about the airstrip at Waterford and I would like to make one small reference, if I am permitted to be parochial.  Deputy Deasy mentioned Cork Airport and the extension work going on there.  I do not know whether I should have to remind him but I will put on record that the greatest disappointment to the employees at Cork Airport and everybody associated with the travel trade who attended the jubilee celebrations in Jury's Hotel this year was that there was not from a Government Minister attending that dinner a proposal to develop Cork Airport which had been untouched for the previous 25 years.  Now it is going ahead.  We took the initiative and are proceeding with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy and others mentioned grading of the aerodromes and airstrips. There is a self-determined grading for these from grass to tarmac to concrete. Most of the airstrips are privately owned but since 1980 the Exchequer has made available financial assistance of up to <Col N="935" /> approximately £14 million for these regional airports.  Let me give two examples.  Connaught Regional Airport received approximately £10 million and Waterford almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat O'Malley welcomed the cost effectiveness of the proposal.  He welcomed also the reorientation of the runway.  He asked whether with the new runway the trans-Atlantic position relative to Shannon would be affected.  My information is that the position with regard to Shannon would remain unchanged.  He asked about the length of time for the borrowing repayment.  I indicated in my speech that the negotiations for the borrowing are not yet complete because the projected fall of interest rates would be taken into account in finalising the borrowing repayments. In short, the repayment will be long term.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh stressed the importance of the roadworks and a number of Deputies raised a point about noise levels.  I will take the question of noise in association with the orientation I have just mentioned.  As I have said, the new runway is east-west oriented and it will reduce the impact of aircraft noise over less populated areas.  Deputy Pat O'Malley acknowledged that Blanchardstown and Castleknock will experience a reduction in noise levels.  Procedures are being developed to minimise noise disturbance to people in populated areas east of the new runway.  Old aircraft, which are far noiser than modern aircraft, are being phased out and this will improve the environment from the point of view of aircraft noise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh asked about car parking.  Anybody who uses or attempts to use the car park at Dublin Airport will agree with him and so do Aer Rianta. While the car park facilities there have been improved, they are restricted by availability of space.  Aer Rianta regard this as an ongoing priority.  The Deputy asked about the possibility of a DART spur to the airport but such a development would cost an enormous amount of money.  I suggest that the feeder bus <Col N="936" /> service already existing there is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh mentioned ERDF grants.  This project will not qualify for ERDF grants because it is regarded as replacement investment and not new regional development.  Deputy Des O'Malley wanted an assurance regarding fully laden 747s leaving Dublin Airport. I am assured that fully laden 747s will be able to take off safely without difficulty at Dublin Airport for North America.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disturbing to hear that.  A few minutes ago the Minister gave an assurance that the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon would not be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if aircraft would be able to take off.  Of course they will.  That is different from the earlier question.  Deputy Pat O'Malley asked about the trans-Atlantic position at Shannon and I said it would remain unchanged.  They are two separate matters even though there is a parallel between them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Des O'Malley asked about the percentage increase in 1987 over the 1985 figures.  I am informed that increase was 35 per cent.  The same Deputy mentioned low fares.  Low access fares to Ireland is and will continue to be Government determined policy and I have elaborated on that.  The effectiveness of that determination is reflected in the increased numbers.  Like other Deputies I am pleased the dispute between the UK and Spain over the airport at Gibraltar which held up the liberalisation of fares during the year and engaged much of the attention of my Cabinet colleague, Deputy John Wilson, at meetings in Europe has been sorted out.  That must be seen as a positive step in relation to Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said we are concentrating too much on one particular location.  It is well established that the drive by the Government for low access fares is not confined to the UK but to Europe and to any area of the world from which aircraft come into Ireland.  The encouragement for the people to come <Col N="937" /> here must be low access fares which have been, as pointed out by Deputies already, inordinately high down through the years.  I welcome the general consensus that access fares and the reduction of fares to Ireland is a very positive and helpful step.  All of us will continue to support the reduction in access fares.  I would like to thank the Members for their contributions and queries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister convey to Aer Lingus the view that even if an 8,650 foot runway at Dublin is sufficient to enable a trans-Atlantic service to be operated to and from Dublin, the Government will not tolerate that and that the present situation where there is compulsory landing in Shannon will continue into the next century?</P>

      <P>With respect, I asked the Minister to convey my views to Aer Lingus.  I am sure they can read them, if they wish, in the Official Report.  Anyway they are aware of my views.  I am asking that a formal guarantee will be given in this House that there will be no change in the situation.  If the Minister fails to give that guarantee, it will cause considerable agitation in the Shannon region, given that Aer Lingus are known to be and have always been hostile to the idea of landing at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly give such a guarantee.  I am sure the Deputy knows well from his experience in this House and in Government that I could not give such a guarantee.  What I said is that I will take his suggestion and convey it to the Government.  I also said that it is the Government and not Aer Lingus who decide on these matters.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Because each of the six Protocols referred to would involve a charge on public funds, Article 29.5 of the Constitution requires approval of the terms of the Protocols by Dáil Éireann before the State could be bound by them.  Each Protocol would give rise to administrative costs associated with the deposit of the State's instrument of ratification in due course.  Only the 1984 Protocol to the Chicago Convention would give rise to additional operating costs by its obligation on Contracting States to take &ldquo;appropriate measures to prohibit the deliberate use of any civil aircraft ... for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the Convention&rdquo;.  The text of each of the six Protocols was laid before Dáil Éireann on 16 October 1987 for the purposes of these motions.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill is designed to give effect to the Protocols to the Warsaw Convention while Part IV is designed to give effect to the 1984 Protocol to the Chicago Convention.  I shall be commenting further on those Protocols when dealing with those Parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1987, which was recently passed by Seanad Éireann, substantially updates and strengthens the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986, which is the basic law governing civil aviation in Ireland.  The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision on the outcome of the thorough review of those Acts, which was started by Deputy Jim Mitchell, in the light of experience both in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The twin purposes of the Bill are to promote the greates possible security and safety of civil aviation in the State <Col N="939" /> and to enable the State to meet its international obligations by ratifying a number of Protocols to International Civil Aviation Conventions.  In other words, the Bill is designed to safeguard Irish civil aviation and to foster its development in line with the best international standards.</P>
    <P>Ireland's airspace and airports are as secure and safe as the best in the world and, with the enactment and full implementation of the Bill now before the House, should remain so.  There is, of course, no room for complacency where the security or safety of civil aviation is concerned.  I can, therefore, assure the House that the Minister for Tourism and Transport and I will vigorously pursue the attainment of ever higher standards wherever possible and take prompt action where proper standards are not being met.  The Bill enables us to do so.  I also wish to reiterate the commitment the Minister gave to this House at Question Time on 11 November 1987 that, notwithstanding the severe difficulties facing the Exchequer for the foreseeable future, adequate financial resources will continue to be made available for the updating and re-equipment of air navigation facilities in the State on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Being a small island on the periphery of Europe, Ireland is very much dependent on air services for securing needed growth in tourism and trade and, indeed, for development generally.  We have a vital interest in securing the liberalisation of air transport in the European Communities, so as to open up new opportunities abroad for Irish airlines and extend the range and volume of air services between Ireland and other countries. For that reason, and as the Minister informed the House at Question Time on 11 November 1987, he will fully support the adoption, at the Council of Transport Ministers on 7 December, 1987, of the EC air transport package finalised by the Council last June and not adopted because of a problem which arose in relation to Gibraltar.  The Gibraltar problem seems to have been resolved.  If <Col N="940" /> adopted &mdash; and I know the House shares our earnest hope that it will be &mdash; the liberalisation package could substantially boost Ireland's earnings from tourism in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Government's five year development programme for tourism, now in preparation and reaching its final stages, will continue the Government's vigorous drive to reduce access costs.  The reductions secured by the Government in 1987 &mdash; and only in operation since May &mdash; have already greatly boosted the numbers of tourists coming to Ireland and should of themselves enhance prospects for 1988.  All of these developments urge us to be forever alert to the need to safeguard the interests of air travellers in Irish airspace or at Irish airports or on board Irish aircraft wherever they may be.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill now before this House is intended to achieve standards of security and safety in Irish civil aviation second to none.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an extensive measure comprising 48 sections and two Schedules. It was published with a comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum. However, to facilitate consideration of the Bill by this House, I will now make a brief commentary on its main provisions which fall into ten separate categories. Briefly, the Bill obliges all operators of civil aerodromes in the State and all others doing business at those aerodromes to comply with security and safety requirements.  It gives the Minister for Tourism and Transport specific power to specify and enforce security and safety requirements at such aerodromes and in relation to aircraft.  They are contained in sections 5 to 9 and 12 to 16.  Thus, the Bill applies not only to the three State-owned civil airports at Cork, Dublin and Shannon but also to all other civil airports in the State including Connaught, Waterford and Sligo Airports.  Throughout the Bill, the appropriate technical term &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;&mdash; which is defined in section 2 of the Bill &mdash; is used to denote what are colloquially known as civil airports.</P>
    <P>The Bill prohibits &mdash; and provides severe penalties for &mdash; activities which <Col N="941" /> could endanger or disrupt aviation: for having certain dangerous articles in aerodromes, aircraft or air navigation installations without lawful authority or reasonable excuse or cause, in sections 11 and 17.  I shall be proposing an amendment on both sections 11(2) and 17(2) on Committee Stage to delete the words &ldquo;or reasonable excuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;or reasonable cause&rdquo;.  Legal advice confirms my view that those words could undermine the sections prohibition on the unlawful possession of firearms and other dangerous articles in aerodromes, air navigation installations or aircraft.  That obviously calls for prompt amendment of both sections.  The Bill prohibits the giving of any false alarm which interferes with the operation of any civil aerodrome, aircraft, or air navigation installation in the State, dealt with in section 41.  It deals also with the impersonation of &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; or &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; appointed to perform a variety of inspectorial and other duties under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, which are dealt with in section 40.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister for Tourism and Transport to prohibit or restrict dumping near any civil aerodrome in the State so as to obviate danger, etc., to aviation from flocks of birds.  That is dealt with in section 21. The Bill enables aerodrome by-laws to be made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport to deal also with illegal car parking by providing for the wheelclamping or removal, etc. of the illegally parked vehicles, section 24; and provides extensive, but necessary, powers of search and so on of persons and vehicles on all civil aerodromes, to prevent crime, section 31; and enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make by-laws for all civil aerodromes in the State, and not only for Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports, as at present, section 25.</P>
    <P>The Bill substantially increases maximum penalties for all offences under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts to deter would-be offenders, from the existing levels from £5 to £1,000 up to new levels of £1,000 for summary offences and £50,000 for indictable <Col N="942" /> offences, with or without a term of imprisonment as the court may deem appropriate in the circumstances.  Details are given in pages 7-8 of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill.  It safeguards the interests of all persons using aerodromes who suffer injury, and so on thereby requiring all aerodromes to be insured against all public liability while in operation or prohibiting the operation of aerodromes if not so insured, section 10.  This section is supplemented by section 9, as amended by Seanad Éireann, to enable the Minister for Tourism and Transport to prohibit the landing of aircraft at, or the departure of aircraft from, uninsured aerodromes. I shall be proposing two amendments on Committee Stage to correct a drafting flaw in section 10 by providing for section 10 to come into operation one month after the Bill becomes law.  The amendments are needed to allow for the making of ministerial regulations, under subsection (2) of the section, to prescribe the required form of certificate of aerodrome insurance, which are intended to come into effect at the same time as the obligation on aerodrome owners or operators to have their aerodromes insured under section 10.</P>
    <P>The Bill safeguards Exchequer investment in aerodromes against breach of conditions subject to which assistance was given, in section 28; and secures payment of aerodrome etc. charges due, including cost of dealing with abandoned aircraft in section 30.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport is enabled to speed-up the decision-making process in relation to airline tariff proposals by allowing him to decide within 14 days or less, rather than after 21 days as at present, section 47; and allows fees to be charged by the Minister for the authorisation of air services by order, in section 46 so as to cover administration costs.  Fees are already chargeable for ministerial authorisation of air services otherwise than by order and the Bill will allow recoupment of such costs on a more equitable basis.  A total of £10,000 is expected to be recouped for such costs in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> The Bill enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to control use, etc., of aerodromes, aircraft, etc., for dealing with national or other emergencies, section 20.  The State is enabled to ratify a number of Protocols to International Civil Aviation Conventions &mdash; Parts III and IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to four 1975 Protocols to the 1929 Warsaw Convention. The text of the protocols is set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Warsaw Convention, as developed over the years, provides a standardised international code to govern the documents of carriage, and the liability of carriers for loss or damage in the carriage by air of persons and their baggage and cargo.  Ireland and over 100 states are party to the convention.  The Warsaw Convention was amended by The Hague Protocol in 1955, notably to increase from about £7,500 to about £15,000 the limit &mdash; expressed in Poincaré Gold Francs &mdash; on a carrier's liability for death or injury to a passenger.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, gave effect in Irish law to The Hague Protocol.</P>
    <P>Growing dissatisfaction with the liability limits of the Warsaw Convention &mdash; as expressed in outdated Poincaré Gold Francs &mdash; developed in the following decade and culminated in the drawing up of four protocols to the convention in Montreal in 1975.  The main purpose of the protocols was to substitute special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund for Poincaré Gold Francs in the Warsaw Convention, The Hague Protocol, and in the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol.  Each of the 1975 protocols must be ratified by 30 states before it can come into force.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Guatemala City Protocol provided for an increase in that liability limit to about £90,000 &mdash; with provision for increases of about £10,000 in the fifth and tenth years after it comes into force &mdash; and allowed States to establish a supplementary fund to provide extra compensation if they wished to do so.  This protocol has not yet come into force and, as worded, could only do so when it had <Col N="944" /> been ratified by at least 30 states on the condition that the total international scheduled air traffic of the airlines of five states which have ratified it represents at least 40 per cent of the total international scheduled air traffic of the airlines of the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In effect, this meant that ratification by the United States of America would ordinarily be required to bring the protocol into force. However, the 1975 Montreal Protocol No. 3 expressly provided that its own ratification by a State would automatically mean ratification of the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol.  I hope I am making this clear.</P>
    <P>I understand that the United States Administration is now moving towards seeking the approval of the US Senate for the four 1975 Montreal Protocols.</P>
    <P>Montreal Protocol No. 1 substitutes special drawing rights for Poincaré Gold Francs in the original Warsaw Convention while Montreal Protocol No. 2 makes a similar substitution in the Warsaw Convention as amended by The Hague Protocol.  Twenty States &mdash; including seven EC States, namely, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom &mdash; have already ratified both Montreal Protocols, Nos. 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>Montreal Protocol No. 3 substitutes special drawing rights for Poincaré Gold Francs in the Warsaw Convention as amended by both The Hague and Guatemala City Protocols.  Eight States &mdash; including four EC States, namely, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom &mdash; have already ratified Montreal Protocol No. 3.</P>
    <P>Montreal Protocol No. 4 relates mainly to the updating of the system for recording carriage of cargo by providing an option for the use of &ldquo;means&rdquo; other than an air waybill, prescribed in the Convention as it stands, as a record of the carriage of cargo &mdash; if the consignor agrees &mdash; to take account of the growing computerisation of the business of carriers and consignors of cargo.  The protocol also provides for the substitution of the special drawing rights for Poincaré <Col N="945" /> Gold Francs to express the liability limits for cargo and operates a strict liability system for cargo, with a certain limited number of specified defences open to the carrier.</P>
    <P>The defences are: (a) inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo; (b) defective packaging of the cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or his servants or agents; (c) an act of war or an armed conflict; and (d) an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo. Eleven States &mdash; including five EC States, namely Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom &mdash; have ratified Montreal Protocol No. 4.</P>
    <P>Ireland recognises that there may be outdated elements in the Warsaw Convention but considers that the basic Convention should be upheld and, where possible, improved.  The purpose of the Convention is to provide stability in civil air transport worldwide.  The advantages of the system are the certainty of the liability limits for air transport in 100 world states.  The carriers have definite knowledge as to their insurance requirements, and the passengers and persons sending goods by air have knowledge of the liability limits.  Both passengers and senders of goods are also assured of a quicker settlement of claims than by settling through litigation.  The possibility of getting 100 states to draw up and adhere to a new Convention on the same subject is very remote.  Accordingly, Ireland, in conjunction with most other European states, is committed in principle to upholding and developing the Warsaw Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland has given a commitment at aviation-related international fora that it would initiate steps as soon as possible to ratify the Montreal Protocols.  There had been a wait and see attitude to the ratification process for several years throughout Europe in anticipation of ratification by the US.  However, as the efforts to ratify by the US Administration did not materialise, most European states decided they would commit themselves to ratification.  They hoped that with the assistance of some other world states <Col N="946" /> apart from the US it would be possible to reach the required 30 ratifications and, accordingly, give effect to the Montreal Protocols.  Most of the European states are now preparing or have prepared the necessary legislation for ratification.  It is essential that Ireland keeps in step.  Part III of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the limit of liability for death or injury to a passenger which all Irish air carriers are required to apply in practice is about £90,000, the same basic limit as is provided in Montreal Protocol No. 3. However, there is obvious need for legislation to copperfasten that limit for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is designed to give effect to the 1984 Protocol to the 1944 Chicago Convention.  The Chicago Convention established an international code to govern civil aviation and provided for the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organisation to oversee the implementation and development of the Convention.  Ireland has been a contracting state to the Convention since 1946 and has implemented it by orders under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Protocol, copies of which have been deposited in the Oireachtas Library, was drawn up and adopted at an extraordinary session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1984 following the shooting down by USSR military aircraft of a Korean Airlines 747 in USSR airspace on 1 September 1983. That protocol, which has been fully supported by Ireland, obliges contracting states to the Convention to refrain from the use of weapons against civil aviation in flight but does not prejudice the right of states to shoot down aircraft when acting legitimately in self-defence.  Early ratification by Ireland is, therefore, required in order to secure sufficient ratifications &mdash; 102 &mdash; to bring it into force at an early date.  New legislation is required to enable Ireland to ratify the Protocol and Part IV of the Bill provides accordingly.  So far, over 30 states &mdash; including seven EC States &mdash; have ratified that Protocol.  The seven EC States are <Col N="947" /> Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Warsaw and Chicago Conventions, to which I have just referred, there are three important international conventions, to which Ireland is a contracting party, designed to protect civil aviation against terrorism.  The formulation and development of international civil aviation security policy and practice has been a major preoccupation both of individual states and of various international civil aviation organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Civil Aviation Conference.  Ireland, through the Department of Tourism and Transport, participates fully in the activities of these organisations and through them has had an input into the development of current international standards and practices which, I need hardly add, are implemented to the fullest degree at our own airports.</P>
    <P>The three Conventions are the Tokyo Convention of 1963, The Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971.  Briefly, those Conventions provide a regime of prosecution &mdash; or extradition &mdash; for acts of violence committed against international civil aviation.  Ireland gave legal effect to these Conventions by the Air Navigation and Transport Acts of 1973 and 1975. Ireland has participated actively in the preparation, within the forum of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of a new international legal instrument which will extend the system of extradition or prosecution under those Conventions to cover unlawful acts of violence at airports serving international civil aviation.  This new instrument is expected to be approved by a diplomatic conference of states in early 1988 and we would hope to be bringing forward the necessary legislation for its early ratification thereafter.</P>
    <P>In discharging our responsibilities for the security of civil aviation in the State, the Minister for Tourism and Transport and I have available to us the valuable advice and assistance of the National <Col N="948" /> Civil Aviation Security Committee, which operate under our aegis.  The committee is chaired by a senior official of our Department and comprises also other representatives of our Department and representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Defence, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association.  The committee advise the Government and the civil aviation industry on aviation security policy.</P>
    <P>The committee co-ordinates the various interests involved and are responsible for ensuring that internationally agreed and accepted security measures are implemented at all civil airports in the State.  These measures, and their application at each civil airport in the State, are subjected to ongoing review and assessment by the committee whose decisions and recommendations are implemented through my Department. Local security committees, which report to the national committee, operate at each civil airport in the State serving international flights.</P>
    <P>The National Civil Aviation Security Committee fully support the early enactment of the Bill before the House to promote the greatest possible security and safety of civil aviation in the State. Early enactment of the Bill &mdash; and approval of the three motions before the House &mdash; will also enable the State to make up for lost time in ratifying certain protocols to International Civil Aviation Conventions designed to foster civil aviation throughout the world.  I, therefore, strongly commend the Bill and related motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mesmerised between conventions and protocols.  The Minister's speech sounded like an annual itinerary of a well travelled county councillor.  I note that a value of £90,000 has been put on a life under the liability section.  I often wondered whether that should be quantified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that Ireland's air space and airports are as secure and safe as the best in the world.  To date our <Col N="949" /> airports have proven to be safe but I wonder if that is more a matter of luck than anything else.  When one travels around the world one sees extraordinary precautions at airports and still people contrive to hijack aircraft.  I presume the security forces have a plan to put into operation if a hijack occurs here but I do not believe we are very well equipped to handle armed terrorists particularly in the case of a hijacking where hundreds of lives could be at risk.  Will the Minister say if he has a special plan prepared to deal with a hijacking or would we, as some other countries do, have to have recourse to forces from other countries to handle the hijacking.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in <i>The Sunday Press</i> a week or two ago which asserted that military aircraft are constantly flying over this country carrying the most lethal radioactive substances such as plutonium which is more dangerous than uranium.  In reply to questions I asked in the Dáil over the past six or seven months I was told that thousands of aircrafts owned by foreign countries are passing over this country and that a number of those foreign countries have nuclear weapons but that we take their word for it as to whether the aircraft contain nuclear weapons or material.  To claim that our air space is safe when we do not know what is happening is a bit too Irish.  It is most probable that a lot of dangerous material is being carried through our airspace every day but we do not have the means to check up on it.  Let us keep our fingers crossed and hope that nothing happens.  The Minister could not assure me that we could carry out some check.  We just take the word of the people flying over our territory.  That is not good enough.  We should have more concern than that.</P>
    <P>In the preamble I was interested to note the word &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo;.  I assumed that today they are all called airports.  I heard the word &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; used when I was a child but I thought it disappeared in the last war.  It is a bit out of date to use that word now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The Minister in his statement also refers to the problems we have experienced due to the row between Britain and Spain over the status of the airport in Gibraltar.  I am glad that that dispute has apparently been resolved because we will get considerable benefit from the resolution of this problem.  There will be much lower air fares to and from European destinations and I hope that we will have a considerable increased influx of tourists from continental Europe.  At the moment the high rate of air fares is prohibitive and it must be costing us a considerable number of tourists from mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extraordinarily technical.  I wonder if it could not have been abbreviated somewhat and if we could have got an explanatory memorandum which could be easily understood in layman's terms.  These Protocols and Conventions are extraordinarily difficult to follow. When replying I should like the Minister to refer to the problem of over-flying in order to ascertain whether we can be satisfied that dangerous substances are not being carried.  It is not sufficient merely to take people's words on such matters.</P>
    <P>At times the position obtaining at our airports is not altogether satisfactory.  In his remarks the Minister outlined a whole series of increased and indeed new fines for improper conduct, dangerous practices and even dangerous parking.  There is an aspect which is causing the public considerable concern, that is the way in which people who leave an aircraft, particularly at Shannon Airport are dealt with.  I raised this by way of parliamentary question on a number of occasions.  I am glad to note that, in recent times, greater care is being taken to ensure that people who leave an aircraft, at Shannon Airport in particular, are given every opportunity to prove that theirs is a genuine case, whether it be that they seek political asylum or permission to travel on to a western democracy, whether the United States or some other western European country.  The position has improved somewhat but we cannot be too vigilant in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Now that Shannon Airport is being used by a number of airlines transporting people to and from countries where there are severe régimes in operation, Shannon has become a flashpoint at which &mdash; I will not call them illegal emigrants, because that is not their proper description &mdash; people seek sanctuary.  Over the years I have been extremely disturbed in this respect because it was my belief that a number of people were put back on aircraft and returned to their native countries and they may well have suffered some terrible consequences.  I do believe &mdash; and there is plenty of evidence to confirm this belief &mdash; that the position has improved considerably.  We have had people such as Cubans, Afghans and even, on occasion Russians and Bulgarians, seeking refuge.  It is very important that such people who fear for their lives if returned to their countries should be given every facility to remain here or move onto another democracy if it can be proven they are totally genuine.  For a long time I had a very strong suspicion that some cases were not being given the requisite attention and that there may well have been some terrible mistakes made as a consequence.</P>
    <P>The terms of this Bill cover also safety at our airports.  The provisions of the Bill refer to the need for security and safety at our three State airports.  I am not satisfied there are sufficient checks on goods and materials coming into this country.  I am making a statement here I believe to be quite true, that is, that the recent spate of cutbacks has actually reduced the amount of surveillance and checking on passenger and cargo goods coming into this country. There is an alarming prospect that large quantities not just of arms but also of drugs are being moved through out State airports because of a lessening in the amount of surveillance there.  I know from having spoken to people working in that service they are not carrying out checks to the same extent as obtained previously.  I have heard the Minister for Finance say that is not so but I must say I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I have seen statements in the national <Col N="952" /> papers by an association representing Customs and Excise officials clearly indicating that there have been cutbacks which are affecting the amount of time being devoted to searches and observation of goods coming into the country. If those assertions are true, and I believe they are, then that is an extremely serious matter.  The Ministers for Finance and Justice, and for that matter all of us, should be extremely concerned lest such cutbacks jeopardise the position obtaining at points of entry to the country, such as airports.  From time to time it has been said that Ireland was being used as a trans-shipment area for the movement of drugs on the world market.  It would be frightful to think our country was being used not just to bring in drugs here for promotion within the country but also as a trans-shipment area because our checks were less stringent than those obtaining elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have spoken already, on the motion before the House, about the good performance of Aer Rianta and their excellent financial position in recent years.  We have spoken about the necessity for more deregulation, greater access and cheaper air fares.  In this regard the motion and the Bill overlap, something to which the Minister referred quite extensively in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <P>I spoke at considerable length on the need for a fares structure in keeping with reality.  In particular I was critical of the Aer Lingus performance before deregulation came into being, before independent airlines were licensed.  It was interesting to see the Taoiseach have a swipe at the national airline the other day for not taking into account when structuring their air fares the position created because of the weakening of the American dollar.  Surely there should be a downward movement in air fares between this country and the United States when the dollar has weakened so considerably?  I would not like to think that people would use a financial change such as that to help themselves to greater profits.  The profits should be passed on to the consumer to ensure that the traveller <Col N="953" /> gets his airfare at a correspondingly cheaper price.  I wonder if the air companies operating on the North Atlantic route have reduced their airfares as a result of the favourable terms that apply, as far as we are concerned, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the advent of the Russian national airline, Aeroflot, to Shannon and the amount of money it generates in that general area. I have heard the figure of £5 million mentioned. That airline is proving to be of considerable benefit to Shannon Airport and to the surrounding areas.  Not alone are Aer Rianta doing well in Shannon as a result of that and other airlines operating in and out of the airport but there has been a suggestion that Aer Rianta are now going to operate from Moscow Airport and are going to show the Russians how to run a duty free enterprise in that airport.  That would be interesting.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is in existence a National Civil Aviation Security Committee who have studied all the various conventions and protocols that are mentioned in this Bill and that that committee are made up of representatives of a whole series of Departments together with representatives of the main airline companies, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  The committee fully endorse what the Bill sets out to do, to improve safety at our State airports.  That endorsement alone is a good reason for passing the Bill.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this matter that has been referred to from time to time and which gives rise to great emotion, unnecessarily so, is our position with regard to neutrality. We have one of the most strategic geographical locations in the world.  We are on the periphery of Western Europe. We are the country which is the furthest west in Europe and which is most adjacent to the United States.  That area is part of a general area in the northern hemisphere which is served by an organisation known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, better known as NATO.  Whenever mention is made of Ireland joining NATO there is an immediate outcry from certain sections in this country, sections that I do not believe constitute a majority but rather a <Col N="954" /> vociferous minority.  We tend to think that as Irish people we are a chosen race, that we can live in isolation without reference to anybody else and without an obligation to anybody else.  We think we can take from everybody and everything, whether an organisation or an individual country, and that we do not have to give anything in return.  I do not agree with that philosophy.  There is a need for the Irish people to show themselves to be bigger than that, to be generous, to be willing to co-operate and above all to be willing to play their part in world politics, in particular European politics.  There are three State airports in this country which could be of tremendous benefit to NATO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that we pay for the legislation also.  There is an opportunity for a vast amount of money to be pumped into the economy of this State at a time when we are experiencing severe financial difficulties but financial problems should not be our only consideration.  We have a duty to our partners in Europe, whether in the EC or elsewhere, and to other countries throughout the world to see to it that we play our part in ensuring that security in this part of the hemisphere is maintained. The point I was making is that up to now we seemed to glorify in the belief that we could live in total isolation, a rather stupid attitude.  The time has come when we must take into account financial considerations and our obligations to other countries which are of tremendous assistance to us, whether within the EC or not. We have a moral obligation to see to it that we help those who help us.  In the process we could solve a lot of our financial problems, I would point to the situation of Spain and Greece who have individually obtained something like £1 billion a year for allowing NATO bases in their countries.  We have severe financial problems and will have to suffer those problems not just for two or three years but for a long time because of the enormity of the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to give serious consideration to ways of solving the problem which will actually relieve hardship in the country.  People may attempt to fob it off by saying we should not interfere with our neutrality.  There comes a time when one cannot afford to be totally independent particularly when one is in very dire financial straits such as those we find <Col N="956" /> ourselves in at the moment.  It is time to consider how our strategic geographical position might be used to the best advantage. There is a case to be considered. On this I am expressing a personal view which has been expressed by one or two members of my party previously.  It is a valid view and should not be dismissed. We have a vociferous minority who decry anything that could solve our financial problems or allow us to co-operate with other countries but there is quite likely a considerable majority who are prepared to co-operate, particularly if it helps to engender more goodwill throughout the northern hemisphere and also to partially solve the dreadful financial problems that confront us.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that our strategic importance has increased considerably in recent weeks, in my view, as a result of talks between the Soviet Union and the US which, it appears, will lead to a bilateral nuclear disarmament policy so that if there were a war &mdash; and hopefully there will not be &mdash; we would be talking again in terms of conventional weapons.  Our location in such a situation would be of considerable benefit.  We should not be afraid to exploit that.  We are extremely foolish not to consider the benefits that would accrue from membership of NATO and the use of our State airports and other airports.</P>

      <P>We have these State airports and other airports which could be used with considerable benefit to the economy in straightforward cash deals and also in the provision of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of extra jobs.  This cannot easily be dismissed.  Membership of any grouping which would benefit this country should not be lightly ignored.  It is well worth considering.</P>
      <P>This Bill has already gone through the Seanad.  There was a general consensus in the Seanad that this would benefit the country but in reality I do not see that the provisions of the Bill mean a lot unless we have some control over civil or military aviation which is constantly passing through our air space.  We supposedly have control but I have never seen any evidence of that control being exercised. I asked several Ministers previously if they could tell me how they check this traffic and invariably I have been told that there is no practical way of doing it.  Basically, the assertion that we are promoting the greatest possible security and safety of civil aviation is only rhetoric. It means nothing unless we know what is actually happening in the skies above us.</P>
      <P>We will not be opposing the Bill but I certainly have reservations about our ability to police it and know what is happening around us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to the Bill and I would welcome its passage but I want to make some comments on a few matters that seem to arise from it and from the debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major features of aviation nowadays that contributes to safety in the air is air traffic control and radio communication with aircraft in flight.  We have in this country part of the control of the eastern Atlantic flight area as part of what is called the Shanwick area which is jointly administered by Prestwick in Scotland and by Shannon Airport in Ireland.  This system has operated pretty satisfactorily for a long number of years <Col N="958" /> now.  One would wish that perhaps a greater part of it was operated in Shannon rather than in Prestwick.  Nonetheless it has operated satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Then, suddenly in August of this year the system at the Irish end began to break down.  There was no longer full coverage, in particular radio coverage, especially of weather information, being provided from Shannon, or specifically from Ballygirreen radio station near Shannon, to aircraft in the eastern Atlantic.  This is the first time, since the Shanwick system was established, that that proved to be the case.  I got complaints about it from people who were concerned with the situation and what the long-term implications would be.  A month or so ago I put down a question in the House on it relating to the month of August because I had been given specific information about August and I thought that it might perhaps have related to the holiday period and things like that.  I was amazed at the reply I got.  Apparently this system from Ballygirreen was off the air on 34 occasions during the month of August according to the information given to me by the Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>This is not some allegation by me or by some disaffected person who is involved; this is the official information given in the House.  I put down the question about six weeks before it was answered, as one often has to do nowadays unfortunately, and made the error of not including the months of September and October.  On checking with the people concerned, I was told that the situation was appalling in August but that the position at Ballygirreen and Shannon was much worse in September and October and if the figure was 34 times off the air in August, it must have been many times that in the succeeding months.  I understand that the position is still as bad as ever and is deteriorating.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Irish authorities to fulfil their obligations in regard to information to aricraft in the eastern Atlantic arises from the understanding of the different facilities at Ballygirreen and at Shannon.  I was informed by the Minister that this is due to the general embargo, <Col N="959" /> cutbacks and the rest, on public service posts.  This is bureaucracy at its worst. Simply because the people concerned are civil servants or public servants of some description, it is assumed that one is as entitled to reduce the numbers there and the service they provide as anywhere else and that in doing this one is somehow benefiting the Irish Exchequer.  Of course, that is totally erroneous.  This service to aircraft operators is not costing the Irish Exchequer anything; it is fully recouped from the people who use the service.  Still these people are let go and air safety is put at some risk and the possibility of this system being retained in Ireland is also put at some risk.  If the Department of Communications here are not in a position to provide a service, why should it continue to be provided from Ireland?  It is too important a matter to get haphazard treatment depending on whether there are sufficient people on duty at a particular time.  It could quite conveniently be removed to Prestwick or somewhere else in Britain or Northern Ireland, which would be a very great pity indeed.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the bureaucratic thinking involved, that people like these who are operating air traffic controls and radio services in County Clare should be let go as if they were expendable and the myriads of bureaucrats who are providing no actual service to the public and in respect of whom no payment is made by any part of the public are retained and maintained without a thought.  If we must have reduction in numbers, it should not be with regard to people who are not costing the Exchequer anything.  That would seem to be self-evident but the bureaucratic system here does not seem to be able to cope with that rather simple proposition.  It is these people who are costless and free to the Exchequer and the taxpayers who are let go, but those who are very expensive on the Exchequer within the Department concerned are retained.  This matter should be properly dealt with by the Minister for Communications. What is happening now in this or in any other like area should be <Col N="960" /> looked at and rectified without delay, because nothing is achieved by reducing those numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in his speech on this Bill and the various attached protocols reopened some of the matters which we debated this morning on the motion relating to Aer Rianta.  He made some fairly provocative statements in the course of that speech.  I often wonder why these people make such statements, which they know perfectly well are totally untrue.  There is a delightful example, that the Government's programme &ldquo;will continue the Government's vigorous drive to reduce access costs.&rdquo;  I remember when I was preaching the necessity to reduce access costs here in 1984 and 1985 what opposition and derision I received. I was told that it was crazy to think that we could have lower costs and that it would be very damaging to the Irish national interest if access costs to this country were any lower.  How official policy can turn itself on its head in two years I find quite interesting.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The reductions secured by the Government in 1987 &mdash; and only in operation since May &mdash; have already greatly boosted the number of tourists coming to Ireland and should of themselves enhance prospects for 1988.</P>
    <P>What has happened since May of 1987 is of little significance.  The Minister of State himself gave me the figures for the increases from 1985 to 1987 and they are away above what I forecast in 1984.  The increase in our passenger traffic coming in here in the two years is 35 per cent, on his own figure.  That is more than a onethird increase, where in the previous ten years we were almost at a standstill in terms of numbers of air passengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice that I gave here, which was voted down so heavily, was finally accepted and put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to reiterate that the one <Col N="961" /> area, in particular, where this policy has not yet been implemented is as between Ireland and continental Europe.  If this matter is not resolved at the Council meeting on Monday and immediately implemented following that, then the Government should take steps either directly themselves or by suggestion to Commissioner Sutherland, to ensure that proceedings which he has already threatened against Aer Lingus and other cartel airlines in Europe are gone on with and that Aer Lingus are prosecuted for their disgraceful conduct in seeking to maintain an illegal cartel in relation to airline fares and operations as between here and the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>The increase that we have seen from the UK in the last two years has been so enormous that one could confidently look forward to at least the same proportionate increase from Europe if the same steps are taken in relation to European routes as have been taken in relation to UK routes.  There is a crazy situation at present&mdash;and I hope it is now coming to an end as a result of the resolution of the broader disputes &mdash; that Ryanair flights, for example, from Cork to Luton have to land in Dublin and if they were to operate from Shannon they would also have to do the same, even though they want to fly direct.  This is an aspect of the craziness of bureaucracy which still to some extent afflicts the whole question of air transport policy in this country and in Europe generally.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Deasy and others, I am very worried about overflying.  Unfortunately, this was not mentioned at all by the Minister of State in the lengthy speech which he made introducing this Bill.  He does make the statement that Ireland's air space is as secure and safe as the best in the world.  Unhappily for us all, that statement is not true.  It is one of these bland statements that are made. One need only recall what happened a few weeks ago, an unfortunate incident which happened over England in which a test pilot testing a Harrier jump jet recently built was ejected involuntarily from the cockpit, fell to the ground without a parachute in Wiltshire and died. <Col N="962" /> His plane flew on, was monitored by British and American fighters and finally crashed into the sea some distance to the south east of Ireland.  If that plane had crashed on an Irish city, there could have been very serious consequences indeed.</P>
    <P>The number of overflights is huge.  I do not think that we even claim that we monitor them.  There is not much we can do in trying to cope with those which are not permitted by us.  In reply the Minister of State should make a full statement on the position.  Successive Governments have never been very open about this matter and it is one of constant concern. I am not suggesting that Irish air space should be closed off to every military flight but we need to get much better information than we have received up to now on the overflights which are taking place and on the extent to which the Government are satisfied that they are aware of all of them.</P>
    <P>Many of these flights take place at altitudes of between 60,000 feet and 80,000 feet.  Does our radar system allow us to even identify the existence of such flights?  What views do the Government hold in regard to them and the dangers they pose if there were to be an accident? There have been reports of near collisions between some of these military aircraft over this country.  If there were to be a collision the outcome would be calamitous not alone for the crews of the planes but also for many other people.</P>
    <P>One of the intentions of the Bill is to amend section 3 of the Air Transport Act, 1986 which was introduced initially as the Air Transport Bill, 1984.  It is proposed in section 47 to shorten the period in which a decision has to be given by the Minister on a tariff application.  I have no objection to that.  It proposes to shorten the period to 14 days or such lesser period as the Minister may prescribe by order. It is not proposed to amend the maximum period.  My recollection of that Act is that there is no maximum period and that often these applications are left to lie there for between six months and 12 months.  That is a matter which may be looked at.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have no objection to <Col N="963" /> these provisions.  Perhaps, some of them may not be easy to enforce given our resources but it is right that this country should ratify the various conventions which are listed and should continue to play its part in controlling the safety of air traffic and air transport.  It is interesting to note that under some of the Conventions we are discussing today there is an elaborate extradition system whereby people who commit offences in or in relation to aircraft have to be rapidly extradited.  I do not think I will reopen that debate now after the useless and futile four day debate we have had but I should say in passing that it is only perfectly proper in respect of terrorist type offences in regard to aircraft as in respect of all other types of terrorist offences a political defence should not be available as indeed is the case under these conventions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State's speech indicated, this Bill has two main purposes, the first of which is to promote the greatest possible security and safety of civil aviation in the State. All of us must be in favour of that purpose. Its second purpose is to enable the State to meet its international obligations by ratifying a number of protocols to international civil aviation conventions. Again, we find ourselves in total agreement with this purpose of the Bill.  As we are in agreement with the Bill there is no possibility that there will be any objection to it passing either this or subsequent Stages.  Nevertheless, I would like to make a few brief points and I can be brief for two reasons.</P>
      <P>The first reason is that this Bill has already been debated in the Seanad where many of the arguments which we could raise here were raised and dealt with.  Therefore, I do not see any real purpose in rehashing in this House, any of the arguments which have already been made in the Seanad.  The second reason is that any of the points which may be raised in relation to the technical aspects of this Bill can be raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> As I have said, we are all in agreement with the terms of this Bill.  Safety and security are of paramount importance to us all and we must pay glowing tribute to the performance in this area by our aircraft authorities, to the Ministry and to all those connected with our great safety record.  Having said that, there is always a need to continually look at our security and safety arrangements and to update them where necessary.  Therefore, to a great extent this Bill will ensure that that will be done.  This is a technical Bill which makes it difficult to deal with the principle contained in it.  Perhaps, then it is better to look at the individual sections which catch our attention.  I would also like to comment very briefly on some of the comments made by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with insurance and requires all aerodromes to obtain public liability insurance while open to air traffic.  Although it is the technical term, the word &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; seems to be a little archaic and ancient.  Nowadays we prefer to refer to the word &ldquo;airport&rdquo; rather than to the word &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; which conjures up images of Biggles and of Nissen huts.  We have now several modern airports in this country and they are very different from the old aerodrome concept.</P>
    <P>We are all aware about the need for insurance, of the strictures which we have to bear in regard to insurance for cars and how tightly drawn they are.  This Bill is simply catching up with what has been the practice there.  The Warsaw, Guatemala and Montreal Protocols listed at the end of the Bill suggest that a great deal of time has been spent in many exotic places dealing with a very simple concept of insurance and at the end of the day the level of insurance and the value put on a life, on which many speakers have commented, seems in this day and age very small at £90,000.  It has taken so long for these Protocols to be discussed and agreed on that the figures in them are outof-date. Can we imagine anybody today taking out life insurance and regarding his commitments, goods and so on to be worth in the region of £90,000?  He may <Col N="965" /> have a mortgage on a house and if he is the breadwinner and is killed in a crash and leaves no other insurance £90,000 would in no way cover the commitments and the problems he would leave after him for his family to deal with.  Therefore, when the Minister gets the next opportunity to participate in one of these international discussions he will want to update that one.</P>
    <P>A very big trade goes on at every airport by private companies selling insurance or assurance to travellers.  This demonstrates that whatever liability aircraft companies carry for their passengers is insignificant.  In many cases anybody contemplating even a short visit abroad for holiday or any other purpose and flying to his destination will automatically take out special insurance not simply against problems that may occur while he is abroad but for any likelihood of an accident occurring during his flight or in the airports he visits.  Maybe we have got it wrong but I do not think so.  That figure is totally inadequate and the Minister should make whatever effort he can to have a proper assessment made.  I do not think he will need a review body on higher pay for the Judiciary, the Civil Service or politicians to look at that.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 17 of the Bill deal with carrying dangerous articles in aerodromes, on aircraft etc. and refer to guns, explosive materials and the like.  Safety and security measures at airports in the last ten or 15 years go a long way to prevent people carrying that type of material on board aircraft but unfortunately it can be and is done.  Somebody who is determined to bring this type of material on board unfortunately seems to be able to get around the various safety devices placed at all airports.  Of course, 99.99 per cent of people travelling have no intention of hijacking aeroplanes and so on but security measures must be in place and the heavy cost involved has to be endured because, unfortunately, the 0.01 per cent or less people travelling have other ideas when they go on planes.</P>
    <P>Only in the past week we have heard suggestions that two very large aircraft which crashed may have done so as a <Col N="966" /> result of somebody carrying explosive material on board.  That may or may not be so but it has been put forward as one likely reason for the crashes either in the Indian Ocean or the Middle East.  We recall with a great deal of sadness the crash just outside Ireland of the Indian plane from Canada with a loss of all on board.  That crash was proved to have been the result of an explosion on board that plane.  Great credit is due to the Irish airport personnel, the medical staff and the lifeboat crews in the south, the area of the Minister of State, for the work they did then.  This sad event demonstrated the high standard maintained by the people involved in the area of airport safety and surveillance in their efforts to get to the bottom of what happened in that explosion.</P>
    <P>Safety and security are paramount and we must all be vigilant.  When security measures are put in place and nothing happens for a long time people are inclined to become a little lax; then something happens which shows up the weaknesses of some of the security aspects. Therefore, we welcome the Bill in this respect.  It will give a new impetus to ensure that our safety standards are maintained at the very high level we are aware exists at present.</P>
    <P>I mention with some trepidation the carriage of duty-free goods on aircraft. Of course these are not explosive materials but between now and Christmas most aircraft coming into and going out of this country will be fairly heavily loaded with duty-free goods, mainly in bottles.  This suggestion may seem strange, but it seems odd that one loads up in an airport, puts all the material on a plane, is sold duty-free goods on the plane, walks past the duty free area at the airport at the other end and into a car or on to a bus or whatever. Could some arrangement not be made for passengers to pick up duty free goods at the other end rather than lugging them over on an aircraft, adding to the cost of flying a plane?  We are told that if you fly <Col N="967" /> 1 lb. of sugar back and forth across the Atlantic it cost something like £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If you carried two litres of whiskey or brandy it might be better to do as I suggest.  I am not opposed to the duty-free arrangements.  I have used them in the past on many occasions but it has always struck me as strange that you walk through a duty-free area on the way out and then another when you arrive at your destination but you must carry the goods on the plane.  I am sure I will get an adequate reply from the Minister if he wants to argue that we need to bring Irish goods abroad, but surely an arrangement could be made to have an Irish section in the main terminals into which we fly such as New York or London rather than bringing the goods out on short hauls to Europe and so on with many people bringing out their duty-free goods and then bringing them back again. I do not know whether the Bill covers such goods.  I hope they are not regarded as explosives or dangerous articles.  I ask the Minister to assure us they are not and that there is no real danger in carrying such material back and forward.</P>
      <P>Section 23 deals with the placing of refuse dumps.  Coming from Wicklow and having had a discussion recently about refuse dumps in my area I know how some people who never have to go near an aeroplane feel about having a refuse dump near them.  I can well accept the dangers of having refuse dumps near airports.  During the past year there was an incident where birds from a refuse dump got into the engines of a plane which was flying to London.  I will not mention the well known personality who was on that plane but there were many other people on board whose lives were equally precious to their next of kin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, refuse dumps are within the control of local authorities.  One thing which upsets me is when a public company gets involved with another State company or a local authority in order to sort out the difficulties between them. <Col N="968" /> Local authorities who operate dumps within a reasonable distance of an airport should have special arrangements made for them and I hope that this Bill will ensure that this will be the case.  The practice nowadays is to fill open cast type dumps with land fill.  I hope that most of the dumps in this country are open cast ones.  If the dumps were covered daily by whatever kind of fill is handy to the location of the dump this would eliminate many of the problems of scavenging by birds and other animals in the area.  No dump should be located in close proximity to a major airport.  This raises the problem of where dumps should be located.  In dealing with the arrangements for safety it is not enough for the local authority to see that their arrangements are up to the highest standard.  It should also be necessary for the airport authorities to ensure that their personnel visit those sites regularly so as to ensure that the work is being carried out to their satisfaction and not just to the satisfaction of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The over-booking of aircraft is not dealt with by the Bill but nevertheless I think it can be mentioned under the sections of the Bill which deal with insurance.  I am referring in particular to the over-booking of charter flights which are usually used for holidays.  These flights are generally charged at a cheaper rate and are booked in cut-price trade areas.  Over-booking does take place and this is only found out when passengers arrive at the airports.  Another problem for passengers is when mechanical difficulties occur in an aircraft and they are left stranded at an airport.  A Bill of this nature should be all-embracing and try to eliminate as far as possible the difficulties and annoyances that are experienced by air passengers irrespective of what their business is or where they are flying to. There are repeated difficulties every year in this respect.  Passengers can be left at airports not simply for a day or two but for days on end in conditions that they do not expect.  Many of them do not have enough money with them so they cannot stay in comfort while they await the <Col N="969" /> arrival of a new aircraft.  I hope the Minister can look at that.  I know that it does not apply in relation to this Bill but it is a part of air navigation.  If we are taking the opportunity of introducing new structures for the industry perhaps it would be useful to consider this aspect of it as well.</P>
    <P>I too am concerned about the overflying of this country by the military aircraft of foreign powers.  The ordinary public and many of us in this House do not know what the level of this overflying is.  There is a growing concern among the public that this is happening.  We should know if our airspace is being used by the military aircraft of foreign powers.  It is imperative that we should be told if our airspace is being used by aircraft carrying nuclear payloads.  I hope the Minister can assure us that this is not happening.  This country is not part of any military block such as NATO and has expressed itself to be a neutral country for many years.  Therefore, we should be in command of the information about whether or not our airspace is being used by foreign powers and whether those overflights carry nuclear payloads.  We are situated between two large military power blocks and we have a right to know if this is happening.  If it is happening, action should be taken to ensure that it does not continue.  We are members of the United Nations and other international bodies and we should be able to make our case and be able to assure the public that this will not happen in any event.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said during the course of a discussion we had earlier this morning, all sides of the House seem to be taking credit for cheaper air fares.  Last year when I was Minister for Tourism I attended a seminar in Bray called &ldquo;Tourism 2000&rdquo; which was sponsored by the local chamber of commerce.  Speakers at that seminar dealt with access air fares and tourism.  They agreed that air fares were too high and that the greatest enemy to an expansion of tourism was the very high level of access fares.  Resulting from that seminar and in my capaicty as Minister, I instituted a review of the tourism area and commissioned a Price Waterhouse report on it.  That report did not <Col N="970" /> come back to me; they reported to the present Minister.  It is a funny thing that having commissioned that report I never got a copy of it from either the Department or from Price Waterhouse.  I have received a summary of the report but I would like to have been given the full report.  I was interested to see that many matters we considered necessary were referred to in it.  I was pleased to note that the fears we expressed about the tourist industry were commented on in it.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say that through that report the Minister has an opportunity to formulate a long term tourist policy.  I am glad that in the next five years the House will be asked to introduce legislation to implement various aspects of that report.  It is pleasing to note that we initiated that process.  The increase in the number of tourists this year was due in no small measure to the action by the Minister responsible for tourism in the last Administration.  We are all aware that people around Christmas time request literature from travel agents and reach a decision about their summer holidays.  The various holiday resorts carry on intensive advertising campaigns over the Christmas period.  In that regard I was disappointed to hear that the promotion budget of Bord Fáilte was cut drastically this year.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the big increase in the number of tourists coming here was the decision to permit new carriers from the United States.  One part of the United States which offers great potential is the south east.  About 40 million people live in that region and they do not regard Ireland as a holiday destination.  Delta are the main carriers in that area.  I was surprised when I visited that area to discover how many Irish Americans live there.  I hope the Minister will continue the work I initiated in that area and encourage more people to visit Ireland. How many Members are aware that the second largest St. Patrick's Day Parade in the world takes place in Savannah in Georgia but I do not think any Irish Minister ever took part in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider visiting that area next March.  It is important that there should be Irish representatives at that parade.  Many Ministers, and other Government representatives, head for New York for the annual parade in that city but Savannah at that time of the year would be a more pleasant place to visit.  I suggest the Minister of State should, if nothing else happens between now and 17 March, find time to participate in that parade and promote Irish tourism in the region.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Minister of State that promotional visits are very hard work.  I have gone on many such visits, accompanied by those involved in the tourist industry, and they were no fun.  We had to meet many deadlines and ensure that we got our say on the national airwaves at a time when people were considering holiday destinations.  I am sure the Minister will agree that next year it will be more difficult to attract Americans to this country not because of problems like Libya, which we experienced in 1986, but because of the drop in the value of the dollar.  Americans always budget on spending a certain amount on their holidays.  Promotion in the coming months in the US will be very important and that is why I have expressed concern at the decision to reduce the budget for promotion work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we play our part in world aviation to ensure that everything connected with air transport is as safe as possible.  It is not enough to work for safer air travel, we must ensure that our airports are safe.  It is important that we have an input at international conferences on safety and demand the same level of safety at other airports as we have in our own.  The protocols before us are acceptable to the Labour Party but I hope that something is done about the <Col N="972" /> insurance inadequacy in one of them.  We all accept that the Bill is essential for the safety of those who use our airports and travel on our airline.  We support the Bill and I hope the Minister will reply to my questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with one of the most important problems that Irish society face in regard to air transport in that it concentrates on the security and safety of passengers.  Since the country's major international airport is situated in my constituency it is only right that I should have a special interest in the provisions in the Bill.  Most of the security proposals dealt with in it have been implemented.  I am referring in particular to arrangements in regard to car parks and so on.  At Shannon Airport management have taken steps to ensure that there is little likelihood of a car bomb causing damage to the buildings.  I should like to pay tribute to the airport personnel at Shannon, Cork and Dublin who do good work on behalf of the State whether as police officers, immigration officers or in management.  It is a tribute to Aer Rianta that industrial relations in that company are the best of all State companies.</P>
      <P>Under the last Government a lot of progress was made in regard to worker participation in the management of Aer Rianta and I hope the Minister will continue with that.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that worker directors are appointed to Aer Rianta.  The conditions of employment, and the services being provided by Aer Rianta, were examined by a departmental committee established by the former Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell. That committee investigated the air navigation office and a number of other services.  It is my understanding that the far-reaching proposals put forward by that committee are the subject of discussions between staff representatives and officials of the Department.  As the representative for the area, I felt more emphasis should be placed on Shannon as the major international airport because it is the only airport which takes west bound traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> I understand the committee propose the setting up of a services office staffed by engineers, with expertise in this area. I would like this office to be located in Shannon, and perhaps when the Minister examines this proposal he will consider the feasibility of my suggestion.  Most of the personnel required for this office are already settled in the Shannon area. From that point of view it would be advantageous for the Department to locate the headquarters there.  The distance between Kildare Street and Shannon is no longer an obstacle because we have a very up-to-date communications network &mdash; FAX, the telephone and so on.  Because our communications system is so up to date, I do not believe locating this office in Shannon would detract from the proposal in any way.  As I said, I hope the Minister will look at this suggestion favourably.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy O'Malley talk about the air navigation services provided at Ballygirreen.  This international service is moving ahead very rapidly, but because of the embargo, I believe the service is suffering.  I urge the Minister to consider the semi-privatisation of the Ballygirreen service.  As other Deputies have outlined, a profit is being made by this 24 hour service which is available to all the aircraft which cross the Atlantic.  The expansion of this service will depend on the use of satellites. If we had a semi-State body negotiating satellite positions for the air navigation service at Ballygirreen, the future employment of the personnel involved would be assured.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the immigration procedures at airports.  In recent times there were problems at Shannon involving a Sikh and a group of Iranians. They arrived over a weekend and the people who were looking for information about them ran into difficulty when they tried to get in touch with somebody in the Department of Justice.  Problems have arisen at Shannon from time to time mainly because of lack of translators.  I believe the Department have made considerable progress in this area and they now have a line to the United Nations <Col N="974" /> High Commission for Refugees in London.  Difficulties can also arise if the airport staff do not provide access to telephones or an area where the immigration section can deal with these people.  Perhaps the Department would ask Aer Rianta to have another look at this to see if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Deasy, put forward his personal view for an expansion of business at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell will deal with that matter.  I am not about to knock another western institution.  I like to keep my western institution in front of the House and that is why I am appealing for greater flexibility between Aer Rianta and the Department of Justice when it comes to immigration at our international airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Shannon we have a new arrangement with Aeroflot.  The former Minister agreed to purchase Russian fuel on a barter system and since then trade has grown.  I support Deputy Deasy's view that there would be greater utilisation of our international airports if we could increase our percentage of the number of flights across the Atlantic.  As has been pointed out, we are very strategically placed but less than 10 per cent of the traffic crossing the Atlantic calls into Shannon.  This must give rise to some questions about our ability to attract transit traffic.  Deputy Deasy suggested making an arrangement with NATO. Maybe it is possible to do something along those lines under the peace initiative Minister Wilson is talking about when he says Shannon will become an international peace centre.  Maybe we could have NATO aircraft as well as Russian aircraft refuelling and loading at Shannon, but some revolutionary proposal has <Col N="975" /> to be put forward to help the growth of transit traffic at our airport and to maintain employment and, we would hope, even increase employment there.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is quite close to Shannon Airport, as I am, and knows a lot about it.  He expressed concern about southern access to continental Europe, but I am very concerned about southern access to Britain.  I am very disappointed that the deregulation of air fares has not yet been put in place for Shannon to London.  While we are grateful to Aer Lingus and British Airways for introducing new flights, why has the Minister delayed so long in granting a licence to Ryanair, Virgin Airlines or any other company which wants to fly from Shannon to London or Luton?  What is the reason for the delay?  It is important from the tourist point of view that there be greater access to Shannon and the midwest. I appeal to the Minister to encourage his officials and the British authorities to reach agreement on this question quickly and to bring about a reduction in fares.</P>
    <P>Earlier today reference was made to runways at Shannon Airport.  As far as this Bill is concerned, this is another area where control is exercised by Aer Rianta and the Government.  In Shannon there has been a lobby for many years for an additional runway to improve the prospect of getting, say, Concorde to call regularly on the flight from Europe to South America.  Substantial additional business could be generated if we had an additional runway facility but, under the present financial constraints, I suppose this is only a dream.  I hope the Department will put forward proposals for this runway so that we will have the runway extension at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>As I said, the main purpose of the Bill is to increase the security and safety of civil aviation.  Most of the provisions outlined in the explanatory memorandum are in place and the Bill is merely giving effect to them.  However, we need another Bill to give effect to the <Col N="976" /> Price Waterhouse report commissioned by the Department.</P>
    <P>If Knock Airport are making a profit it reflects very well on the system of management. I wish them luck but I do not envy them the growth of traffic.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about maintaining Shannon Airport as the sole transatlantic airport and I hope the Minister will refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which was substantially prepared during my time as Minister for Communications. To a large degree it deals with the safety and security of aviation and, therefore, it is of vital interest to us as an island country which is so dependent on air communications for trade and tourism with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity to talk about the wider area of aviation policy in general.  It is very important because safety and security of air transport grow in importance as the numbers of people travelling by air grow.  I am glad I was the Minister who initiated the policy which caused the great and continuing growth in air travel.  Of course, the increase in air travel is not just in and out of this country, it is happening in other parts of the world.  However, terrorism is also increasing and when I was Minister we had to deal with a very traumatic disaster, the Air India crash off the coast of west Cork in 1985.  We also had two recent air disasters, one involving a South African aircraft and another involving a South Korean aircraft.  There are suggestions, at least in the latter case that, like the Air India disaster, it may have been caused by an act of terrorism.  Fortunately, although the Air India disaster took place near our shores, it had just bypassed our air space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and security standards of Irish aviation have been consistently high.  I know it is the intention of the Minister to continue the policies of his predecessors in ensuring that that very high level of safety and security is maintained. In that, I have no doubt he enjoys the unanimous support of the House. This, of course, falls into a number of <Col N="977" /> categories and it cannot be divorced from all the cutbacks in the public service.</P>
    <P>I hope that whatever reorganisation will take place in the air navigation services office will not be dictated by the exigencies of public finances.  I am not against reorganisation to reduce costs and improve efficiency &mdash; I am very much in favour of that &mdash; and the review which I commissioned from Price Waterhouse had that in mind.  I hope the reorganisation proposed by Price Waterhouse will not be used as an excuse for further economies in order to reduce public finances.  I have little doubt that the Minister would not jeopardise safety or security for financial reasons but it is no harm to have his determination strongly reinforced on this side of the House.  Nor should danger of the reorganisation of the air navigation services office be put off by the possible misinterpretation of what the Minister is doing because it is very clear from the Price Waterhouse report &mdash; which has not been published but to which, of course, I had access &mdash; that there is a major need for reorganisation in that entire area.</P>
    <P>Much of this becomes all the more important and urgent because of the increase in the numbers of people travelling by air.  This recalls the Committee Stage debate on the Air Transport Act, 1985, on 1 and 22 May 1985.  Deputy Desmond O'Malley spoke twice today on matters pertaining to aviation, once on the guarantees for the extension of the runway at Dublin Airport which I was happy to initiate and approve&mdash;and later on this Bill.  However, he did not support the Air Transport Bill; otherwise it enjoyed the total support of this House. He predicted it would lead to higher air fares and fewer numbers travelling by air. Of course, I strongly argued the reverse, that what was important was the policy pursued under legislation.  For instance, the policy pursued in relation to the National Social Service Board is important, not the legislation.  We have legislation setting it up but there is no National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>Under the Air Transport Act, the Government of which I was a Minister <Col N="978" /> pursued a policy, even before enactment of the legislation, of getting air fares down and bringing competition into air travel.  For instance, in March 1983, three months after the Government came to office we licensed the first other Irish airline&mdash;Avair&mdash;on routes to mainland Britain.  Not one single air fare application was approved as it stood; each was reduced even after the British Civil Aviation Authority had approved higher increases.  That is important because Deputy O'Malley during the Air Transport Bill, among many other errors which he did not have the grace to withdraw, held up the British Civil Aviation Authority as the paragon of virtue, the great example to be followed.  I wonder would Deputy O'Malley today say that the British Civil Aviation Authority or the British Department of Transport are the greatest examples to follow?  Can he now see that the British, like every other Government, were busy defending their national interests whilst he was busy attacking ours.  The British Secretary for Transport this week, for instance, disallowed participation by the Scandinavian Airways system in British Caledonia for reasons of national interest.  The British Civil Aviation Authority have refused Ryanair rights to Shannon/Luton and Cork/Luton to protect British airlines who are also on those routes.  Anyone who wants to see the errors of fact can read the debates of 22 May.  We must highlight once and for all how wrong Deputy O'Malley was on aviation and how right was the rest of the House.</P>
    <P>We all want lower air fares and we have got them.  Please God, the air fares will be even lower with continuity of service. Deputy O'Malley said in that debate, when moving an amendment to restrict the Minister's powers to maximum prices that many other countries have this power and when he was challenged to name one he cited Britain and the Netherlands.  When Deputy O'Malley was shown that that was not the case he suggested the US and when shown that that was wrong he had not the grace to withdraw.  Not one other <Col N="979" /> country restricts its power to regulating maximum fares only.</P>
    <P>Every civil aviation authority has the same power that we sought in the Air Transport Act, 1985.  Deputy O'Malley said that Dan Air were hunted off when filing a lower air fare for London.  When Dan Air said that that was not true Deputy O'Malley repeated the allegation. I convened a meeting in the Department of Transport and Communications at which the chief executive of Dan Air, the chief executive of Aer Lingus, Deputy O'Malley and I attended. The several erroneous declarations the Deputy had made were cited to each party, the minutes were agreed and circulated and the minutes directly contradicted everything that Deputy O'Malley said.  Despite the fact that the minutes were agreed by Dan Air, by Aer Lingus and by me as an accurate account of the meeting, Deputy O'Malley would not accept it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made much of the £49 air fare between London and Amsterdam.  The Deputy was asked to admit that the £60 from Dublin to London then pertaining under the restrictions was even cheaper on a per mile basis but he refused.  Deputy O'Malley said that the American authorities did not seek to control cargo fares, but they did.  Deputy O'Malley did not withdraw that error when it was pointed out to him.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage will highlight the grievous errors repeatedly stated in this House by Deputy O'Malley who confidently predicted that the Air Transport Act would lead to higher air fares.  Everybody knows what has happened to air fares between here and Britain and between here and Europe to a lesser extent in the past three years.  This development has not been paralleled anywhere else in Europe.  There have been improvements in other places but nowhere has there been the dramatic improvement that has taken place in the price and range of air services out of this country.  I am very happy to have been associated with this development.  While we were implementing that policy at <Col N="980" /> home we were inaugurating new approaches at the EC Council of Ministers. I thank God that at last there has been some progress there.  Progress has been held up in recent months because of a political disagreement between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar.  The problem has been resolved and the small measure of Fifth Freedom Access which the Council have agreed will be fully agreed next Monday in Brussels and will come into effect making Ireland one of the biggest beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>We made it a condition of liberalisation in Europe that there should be increased market access.  If airlines based in Ireland with a population of three and a half million people are to have any chance of competing successfully with airlines like Lufthansa, British Airways or Air Italia, based on 60 million people, they have to have equality of access.  Otherwise there is a massive distortion of competition and it is almost impossible for the smaller airlines to succeed.  That is why this first step is so significant for Irish aviation.  I have no doubt that both Aer Lingus, Ryanair and perhaps the lesser known Irish airline, Club Air group will be able to expand considerably on foot of the agreement which now seems certain to be reached next Monday.  I urge the Minister and the Government to make it clear at the Council meeting next Monday that this is but a first step and that all steps towards liberalisation can only be achieved by ever-increasing market access so that eventually all the airlines of the Community will have the possibility of access to all the routes of the Community.</P>
    <P>These are exciting times for aviation. When almost every other aspect of the economy is in decline aviation is growing. This sector has been nurtured and is growing.  I hope the policies which have led to that expansion will continue.</P>
    <P>I noted the Taoiseach's statement during the week on this matter.  I was pleased to receive a communication from the Taoiseach thanking me for my role in opening up aviation.  It was a very gracious message.</P>
    <P>In relation to Knock Airport, I believe <Col N="981" /> it was built in the wrong place for too high a price.  I made one speech on that which did not incur favour for me in Knock or among those who supported the Knock project.  If Knock Airport had been built on lower more solid land perhaps ten miles south of Knock rather than ten miles north of Knock it would have cost less.  Apart from the cost of building it, Knock Airport is now a success.  I congratulate those involved wholeheartedly on it.  I decided that policy in the Department, because Knock Airport was already there, would be that we will do everything possible to make it a success. Not only did we license airlines to serve out of Knock but we went looking for airlines to serve out of Knock.  I congratulate all concerned and I would urge <Col N="982" /> everybody in aviation and especially in the Mayo area, of all political persuasions, to work to make Knock a continuing success.</P>
    <P>The level of air fares and the level of air safety are only relevant when there are services.  Continuity and range of service are the vital concerns.  The range of service has been vitally improved by the licensing of Ryanair and Club Air.  The future of Aer Lingus is also a very big question given the amount of capital that Aer Lingus will need to refleet over the next seven or eight years.</P>
