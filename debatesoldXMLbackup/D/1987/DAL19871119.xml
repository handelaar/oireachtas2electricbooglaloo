      <P>As I indicated yesterday and again this morning I wish to give you formal notice, in accordance with Standing Order 30, of my intention to move a motion for the adjournment of this House on a matter of specific and important public interest requiring urgent consideration.  That motion is: &ldquo;In view of the imminence of the coming into operation of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism this House is entitled to be appraised of the Government's intentions as a matter or urgency, and is entitled to be informed of any changes that have taken place or are proposed in the relevant legislation or in relevant administrative procedures, is entitled to be informed on these matters and other matters relevant to the issue prior to persons being informed and <Col N="1228" /> consulted outside this House.

    <Title>Double Taxation Relief Agreement Between Ireland and USSR: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Air Transport Undertakings and Their Employees) (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) Order, 1987.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on the 12th day of October, 1987.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An agreement between Ireland and the USSR for the avoidance of double taxation of air transport undertakings and their employees was signed on behalf of the respective Governments at Dublin on 17 December 1986.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, an arrangement with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation will have the force of law in Ireland provided the Government make an order accordingly. Before such an order can be made, it must be laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 12 October 1987, and contains in its schedule the text of the agreement. An explanatory memorandum which outlines <Col N="1232" /> the effects of the agreement has also been circulated.  The White Paper containing the text of the agreement was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15 October 1987.</P>
    <P>The present agreement has been concluded to supplement the general provisions negotiated by the then Department of Communications relating to air transport activities between Ireland and the USSR.  It does this by providing for the elimination of double taxation which might otherwise arise.  The agreement will facilitate the continuing use of Shannon Airport by Aeroflot and its provisions will operate retrospectively to cover the activities of that airline in this country since 1980.  Aeroflot have been using the facilities available at Shannon Airport continuously since 1980 and these operations have made a substantial economic contribution to Aer Rianta and Irish enterprises operating in the Shannon area since that time.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta estimate that the general arrangements for air transport activities recently negotiated by the Department of Communications should benefit the Shannon area to the extent of £60 million over the next five years.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Article 2 exempt air transport undertakings of one country from taxation in the other country on profits, income and capital gains derived from the business of air transport.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of Article 3 secures that salaries, wages and other remuneration earned by a citizen of the USSR in respect of services rendered to a Soviet air transport undertaking as an officer or employee posted to Ireland shall be exempt from tax in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the same article provides for reciprocal relief by the USSR in the case of an Irish citizen posted to the USSR as an employee of an Irish air transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <Col N="1233" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome this measure and I do not think we need delay the House in debating it.  So far as I can see, it simply applies to air transport and the only effect it will have is in connection with air transport arrangements between Ireland and the USSR, particularly Aeroflot undertakings in Shannon.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister intends replying but I have a few questions which perhaps he might answer.  This measure provides that tax will not be charged on any profits, income or capital gains which accrue to one country from its operation in the other country.  It also provides that salaries, wages and other remuneration earned by a citizen of the USSR in respect of services rendered to a Soviet air transport undertaking as an officer or employee posted to Ireland shall be exempt from tax in Ireland.  It also provides for reciprocal relief by the USSR in the case of an Irish citizen posted to the USSR as an employee of an Irish air transport undertaking.  I understand the agreement will remain in effect indefinitely but that it can be terminated after 1990.  Termination will be effective, according to the agreement, from 1 January 1992, or any subsequent 1 January following notice of termination given by either country.  Is there any significance in that date?  Is there an implication that activity in Shannon will not continue after 1990?  Is there also an implication that new arrangements will be put in place for the Aeroflot operation in Shannon subsequent to 1990?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Double taxation on the income from the business of air transport is avoided in cases of agreements with other countries by the inclusion of an article on shipping and air transport in the comprehensive double taxation agreements with these countries.  As the Minister said, it follows the relevant article in the OECD model on double taxation and provides that the profits of an enterprise carried on by a resident of one contracting State from the operation of an aircraft in international traffic is to be taxable only in the contracting State.  That is the model on which this is based although this measure seems <Col N="1234" /> to be wider as Article 2 of the agreement is more comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The OECD article exempts profits from the operation of aircraft in international traffic.  Article 2 of the Ireland-USSR agreement exempts profits of the air transport undertaking from the provisions and sale of air transport and from associated activities.  Air transport undertakings and associated activities are not defined.  The exemption from tax, however, is obviously more broadly based than that provided for in the OECD article.  I should like the Minister to comment on its significance.  Why is the phrase &ldquo;associated activities&rdquo; included here?  Does it apply to the importation of Russian oil into Shannon airport for refuelling activities of aircraft? Does it go wider than simply the air transport activities of Aeroflot?  Does it apply to ancillary activities in the airport with the Russian input?  In particular, does it apply to the oil farm on the airport which is used, as the Minister knows, for the sale of fuel to many other airlines apart from Aeroflot?</P>
    <P>All income and capital gains derived by an air transport undertaking of one contracting State from the provision and sale of air transport and from associated activities are to be exempt from all taxes of the other contracting State on income and capital gains.  The relevant OECD article permits the country in which the income is earned to levy tax on that income where the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that country.</P>
    <P>There is a similar and corresponding provision in respect of capital gains.  In the case of the Ireland-USSR agreement, therefore, there is a much broader basis for exemption from tax in Ireland in the case of a USSR air transport undertaking and <i>vice versa</i>.  It also applies to citizens and employees of Aeroflot resident in this country.  I presume that there is a desire that they would be exempt from tax here.  In the case of citizens of one contracting State posted to the other contracting State the exemption from taxation in that other State is more <Col N="1235" /> comprehensive than the exemption provided for in the corresponding OECD article.  That article permits the country in which the employment is exercised to levy tax on remuneration in certain circumstances, that is to the extent that the remuneration is derived from the employment so exercised, unless the employee fulfils certain conditions such as not being present in that country for more than 183 days in any 12 month period.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the Ireland-USSR agreement provides for a blanket exemption from income tax in the case of a USSR citizen posted to Ireland in his capacity as officer or employee of the air transport undertaking and <i>vice versa</i> for Irish citizens. Why is this wider than the OECD model and why is it wider than the exemptions provided in other double taxation agreements?  Why is there a departure from the 183 days clause in any 12 months?  It is reasonable to suppose that the effect of any double taxation agreement will give the balance of advantage to one country when all the relevant factors are weighed.  Thus, any exemption provided by a treaty provision will inevitably result in one country foregoing a greater amount of taxation than the other contracting country.  Where the scale of relevant activities envisaged is small and narrowly drawn, the balance in favour of one of the countries may be quite apparent.  Consequently, in the case of this draft agreement between Ireland and the USSR, the extent to which one of the contracting countries is to forego taxation may be readily compared to the extent to which the other country is to forego corresponding taxation.</P>
    <P>The significance of the agreement needs to be viewed in a broader context. Assuming there is not an Irish air transport undertaking operating in the USSR and the effect of the agreement is that Ireland has to forego taxation in the respective Aeroflot activity in this country, we need to look at that in a wider context and view it against the perspective of other factors.  I do not know whether it is the intention of Aer Lingus <Col N="1236" /> to get involved in any capacity in the USSR, but if they do I presume this agreement will cover it.  I would like the Minister to provide us with any information he may have on the nature of the USSR system of taxation on profits on income and on capital gains.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a lot of talent in this House and information about the USSR I am sure could be made available in this House.  Will the Minister comment in relation to this and in relation to Sweden, on the relevance of existing Irish tax incentives, exemption or relief from taxation, for example, in respect of Shannon operations?  Aeroflot have been operating in Shannon since the late seventies.  I wonder are they operating under the 10 per cent tax régime in Shannon airport or are they operating under the zero taxation scheme which operated in Shannon for companies that had been set up prior to 1980?  What is the existing arrangement there?  I have no objection to this but I would like a couple of points clarified, especially why the net is cast so wide and if there are any implications for Aer Lingus operating in the USSR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker I have no objections to this measure.  I understand there are similar agreements in existence between this State and Belgium and between this State and South Africa.  There are not good grounds to oppose the coming into effect of this agreement.  When replying, will the Minister deal with the question of how many employees employed by Aeroflot in this country will be Russian nationals and how many will be Irish nationals and whether they will be liable <Col N="1237" /> to pay PRSI on their earnings here?  Is that something which should be covered by the agreement?  Is there an understanding in relation to redundancy payments and if such people are paying PRSI will the mechanism of the Revenue Commissioners be used to gather those sums of money?  I take it this agreement has no application to value added tax?  In these circumstances, I would like the Minister to clarify that that is the case. Apart from that, this is a sensible arrangement.  It is not without precedent and it is one which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome both provisions. It is entirely appropriate, and to some extent overdue, that these arrangements should be regularised.  They appear to be entirely in accordance with accepted procedures and they will help in the removal of a substantial degree of uncertainty which has surrounded in particular the Aeroflot operation on a number of occasions.  It will in more ways than one regularise the arrangement.  It is imperative that we have a comprehensive record of all the arrangements relating to all employees of this company at Shannon and that the matter be dealt with in a conventional manner.  Accordingly, I welcome that arrangement.  The other arrangement in relation to Sweden appears to be entirely appropriate and it is has the complete support of my party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how this will affect USSR citizens and I am not too sure how it will affect Swedish citizens in Ireland, but double taxation as we understand it is affecting Irish people as a result of the double taxation agreement between Great Britain and Ireland and it is not working out too well for our citizens. It is academic that this should come before the House in relation to USSR and Swedish citizens but the problem is very real in relation to Irish citizens in Border areas.</P>

      <P>I had a letter from the Minister this morning about a particular case.  I might inform the Minister, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, that how the situation is affecting us in this: an Irish citizen, living in Donegal, working in Northern Ireland, importing wages to Ireland &mdash; not the Republic, but from a foreign country, &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; is caught for double taxation.  I am arguing that this is real partition.  This is really saying to people: look, if you work in Northern Ireland and import your wages or money to the Republic, we will put double taxation on you.  That is really saying to such people: go back and live in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am trying to say to the House that I am not convinced in the debate so far, in relation to the two matters before the House, that this is good or bad law.  I am not sure which Deputy mentioned it but somebody asked if this was an Irish citizen or a USSR citizen; was it an Irish citizen or a Swedish citizen.  I am not convinced that this is as good a Bill as had been presented by the Minister, accepted by all parties in the House as being good taxation law. I am pointing out to the House that it is bad taxation law <i>vis-á-vis</i> operations in Border areas.  If that is not relevant to the debate, a Cheann Comhairle, would you please inform me.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I welcome the proposal.  It was heartening to note, in the course of the Minister's remarks, a brief but very succinct reference to the impact that the presence of Aeroflot and its concerns at Shannon will have on the development of the airport and the general area around Shannon. The Minister stated that something in the region of £60 million will be generated in the Shannon area over the next five years because of the establishment and development of Aeroflot facilities at Shannon Airport.  Clearly that is something all of us should welcome and appreciate.  It is something that should be brought home time and again to people who seek in one way or another to detract from the presence of our allies, the Soviet Union, working and developing their enterprises within our State.</P>

Now that we are so heavily financially committed and involved in commerce with the Soviet Union perhaps the Government might examine the financing of the cultural agreement so earnestly sought by them. I do not think we have anything to fear from that country.  There is nothing but good to be gained from the development of our trade, industry and commerce with them.  I would hope that in time the Government would examine that aspect. I would ask the Minister to raise the matter in due course at Cabinet level, that is the formalisation of a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union.</P>

I am suggesting that the Deputy's party have very close cultural relations with the Soviet Union but I must object to the Deputy's reference to the Soviet Union being an ally of this State or of the people of this State.  That is a ludicrous statement, very far-fetched and one which I certainly reject.  In my opinion also his reference to the amount of money that will be made available in the Shannon area by reason of the Aeroflot presence is fictitious.  We should not have any relationship with that state.  I refer to the recent seizure of arms on the <i>Eksund</i> to the fact that they were made in Russia, and to that country's continuing interference in the affairs of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this measure.  One must be practical in these matters.  It is all very well to go around masquerading as a professional scaremonger, <Col N="1245" /> to capitalise on it and to make it one's political career but every responsible Minister and Deputy in this House must get on with his or her business, must be practical and must do the best they can for the economy.  We cannot make a living out of scaremongering, although some people have made a good political living out of it.  It has no place in this House today.</P>
      <P>Coming from Limerick East, I recall vividly statements which were made in 1980 when Aeroflot started operating from Shannon airport.  The objections and statements made at that time were based on prejudice and very narrow-minded attitudes.  We cannot continue to have those attitudes forever in this House or any place else.  Apart from Deputy McCartan speaking about the benefits of this agreement, the Minister in his reply can tell us what will accrue to this country and to the Shannon region from this measure.  He has mentioned a sum of £60 million.  I do not know whether that is a correct figure but I am sure the Minister knows more about the matter than does Deputy McGahon.  I would say it is a correct figure.</P>
      <P>Shannon has benefited a great deal from the coming of this airline to the area.  Not only has it benefited the local economy but it has also benefited the national economy in many ways.  We must take advantage of whatever benefits we can from these international agreements. There is give and take in international agreements: one side cannot have too much of an advantage or impose its will on the other side.  Otherwise it would cease to be an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael Noonan asked questions in relation to taxation and that is always a difficult subject in this House. It is difficult enough to get many Irish people to pay taxation, not to talk of trying to get Russians to pay it.  If we could get many Irish people to pay taxation, certainly the farming class and the people whom Deputy McGahon represents, we would be going a long way towards achieving tax equity.  We must do the best we can with this agreement. In terms of the criteria laid down by this <Col N="1246" /> Minister and the previous Minister, Aeroflot have gone a long way to meet these standards and values we expect from international airlines and companies.</P>
    <P>Aeroflot have been of benefit not only to Aer Rianta but to the country as a whole and they have given useful employment to Irish people not only in Shannon airport but also to Irish people who went to work in the Soviet Union.  I do not think this measure will interfere in any way with Irish workers who go to work with Aeroflot in Moscow.  It is only right that Deputies should ask questions in this House.  We expect the Minister to do the best he can in this measure and to give whatever protection he can in the national interest.  The questions raised by Deputies should be answered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the past Irish workers have gone to work with Aeroflot in the Soviet Union and have gained valuable technical experience there.  It is a measure of our maturity as a nation that we can make these agreements with countries such as the Soviet Union.  The only way we can lessen international conflict and tension is by dealing with countries, big and small, in a civilised way and by forming agreements with them.  There is no other way that I know of whereby agreements can be made between two countries unless there is give and take.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister going further in these matters of international agreements.  We have before us today two measures dealing with the Soviet Union and Sweden.  Our dealings with Sweden will also be of benefit to this country.  The Minister should not stop there.  He should endeavour to explore ways of seeking agreements with airlines from different countries which would bring further benefits to our airports. There is plenty of scope for a Minister with imagination and initiative to seek to make further agreements with countries throughout the world.  Some countries are developing airlines and different routes and there is no reason we should not exploit our strategic position on the <Col N="1247" /> dark edge of Europe to make agreements which would benefit us.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I welcome this measure and it should be welcomed by all Deputies in this House.  The day is long past when somebody can come into this House and exploit such an agreement for his or her own personal interests.  I thought we had got rid of many of those Deputies from this House in the last Dáil.  That kind of narrow-minded stupid attitude has bedevilled parties in this country for too long.  I endorse this agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister, when he introduced this measure, thought he would get the mixed reception he has received today.  As this measure generally affects my constituency I have to say that since the agreement was negotiated with the USSR, and Aeroflot in particular, about aircraft fuel, the cartel or monopoly operated by the so-called free companies, the American companies supplying fuel to Shannon, was broken. That had a significant effect on the growth of traffic in Shannon.  This fuel is now being utilised by the American aircraft who drop into Shannon from time to time.  Any measure the Minister brings to this House to normalise commercial relations between Russia and Shannon airport, which seems to be a little remote from some Deputies in this House, should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the conduct of the people representing the Russian companies is concerned, I have heard nothing untoward about the way in which they do their business.  We, in the west of Ireland are trying to keep people at home and to keep them at work.  This arrangement with Aer Rianta has boosted business in the shops and has generated income.  It has brought about fair trade between companies.  In the free world why should oil companies form a monopoly and freeze out Shannon?  The American companies went into that operation knowingly. Were it not for the initiatives of the directors of Aer Rianta and the previous Government making an agreement with <Col N="1248" /> Aeroflot, this matter would not be brought to the House.  I support the Minister in his efforts to ensure that relations are normalised.  On the other hand, I am not saying I support the supply of arms by the Russians through the <i>Eksund.</i></P>

We have never accepted this to be the case.  Is it not ironic in the sense that these countries have had their liberty suppressed?  I wish to know if the double taxation treaty implies any change in that policy.</P>

      <P>If it does, the Deputy should know because he was in my position. It does not really affect the issue before the House.  I wish to thank the Deputies who welcomed this measure and notwithstanding what Deputy Carey said about a mixed reception in relation to the issue before the House, there was a general welcome for it.  While I appreciate and understand the difficulties, concerns and opinions that Deputies may have in relation to other activities which are not relevant here, I hope that they will get opportunities to raise these matters in other places.</P>
      <P>Turning to the points raised by Deputy Noonan in relation to the detail of the agreement and the time limit talked about of up to 1990, he asked if that would have any effect on the activities of Aeroflot at Shannon.  The answer is no. Those arrangements can, as is said in the agreement, continue indefinitely but if people on either side want to break the arrangements, they can do so with certain notice after 1990.  That is a clause which I think is in almost all double taxation agreements as standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The other question raised was whether the agreement covers ancillary activities on oil operations.  It does, in so far as these operations are operated by or because of Aeroflot.  That is what the agreement covers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably an independent company separate from Aeroflot, therefore it does not come into this arrangement at all.  That is my advice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wider scope of taxes, <i>vis-á-vis</i> one country and another, obviously in any of these agreements countries put forward a package of measures that will be included and there are bargaining positions and some measures are in and some out in relation to any particular element of taxation but, in general, before an agreement is signed between Ireland and the USSR or Ireland and any other country, we shall look to protect our taxation base as they will do theirs to see that we do not have double taxation in relation to those areas.  One may see a longer list of taxation measures in some countries as against others but that is something which is worked out in the package of measures leading to the subsequent agreement.</P>
      <P>A question was also raised about the taxation situation in the USSR.  I understand that there are lower salaries and therefore lower taxes there.  I think about 20 per cent is the rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have circulated a copy of the order.  It is rather long and in greater detail, concerning a larger arrangement.  I think I should put it on the record of the House, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>A Convention between Ireland and Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital gains was signed on behalf of the respective Governments on 8 October 1986, at Stockholm.  It will, when it becomes effective, replace the existing double taxation agreement between Ireland and Sweden which was signed at Dublin on 6 November 1959.  The new provisions take into account changes which have been made in the fiscal legislation of both countries since that date.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, an arrangement with a foreign government to afford relief from double taxation will have the force of law in Ireland provided the Government make an order accordingly. Before such an order can be made, it must be laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.</P>
      <P>The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 12 October 1987 and contains in its Schedule the text of the Convention. An explanatory memorandum which outlines the effects of the Convention has also been circulated.  The White Paper containing the text of the Convention was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 24 March 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Ireland, the Convention <Col N="1252" /> will be effective for income tax and capital gains tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April in the year immediately following that in which the Convention enters into force.  For corporation tax purposes, the Convention will have effect for any financial year beginning on or after 1 January in the year immediately following that in which the Convention enters into force.</P>
    <P>The Convention follows the general principles of the Model Convention published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1977. The provisions are similar to those contained in the treaties which Ireland has concluded with the United Kingdom and Australia in recent years and those which are in course of negotiations with other states.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of eliminating double taxation, the Convention follows the two basic rules established in the OECD model.  The first is that certain income may be taxed in one country only.  Thus Government and local authority salaries will normally be taxable only in the country of source while interest and royalties will normally be taxable only in the country of residence of the beneficial recipient. The second basic rule is that where the same income or capital gains may be charged to tax in both countries, the country of residence will allow a credit against its own tax in respect of the tax paid in the country of source.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the main features of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Article 4 covers residence.  This Article provides a series of tests to determine the country of residence where, under the separate residence criteria used by each country, there would be a double residence position.</P>
    <P>Article 5 covers permanent establishment. This Article defines the term &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; as being, in general, a fixed place of business in which the business of an enterprise is carried on.  This definition is particularly important for the taxation of business profits.</P>
    <P>Article 8 is concerned with business profits.  This Article is concerned with <Col N="1253" /> two questions.  First, it restates the generally accepted principle of double taxation Conventions that an enterprise of one state shall not be taxed in the other state unless it carries on business in that other state through a permanent establishment situated therein.  Secondly, when an enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment in another state, that state may tax the profits of the enterprise but only so much of them as is attributable to the permanent establishment.</P>
    <P>Article 11 relates to the treatment of dividends flowing from one country to the other.  It provides that, in the case of dividends flowing from Ireland to Sweden, a Swedish resident portfolio investor is entitled to the same tax credit as an individual resident in Ireland subject to a charge to Irish tax at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of the value of the dividend plus the tax credit attached to it.  No tax credit is payable to a Swedish company which control at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the Irish company paying the dividend.</P>
    <P>In the case of dividends paid by a Swedish company to an Irish resident, the Swedish withholding tax charge will be limited, in the normal case, to a rate of 15 per cent.  This rate is reduced to 5 per cent where an Irish company controls at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the Swedish company paying the dividend.</P>
    <P>Article 14 is concerned with the elimination of double taxation on capital gains.  Gains derived by a resident of one state from immoveable property situated in the other state may be taxed in the other state.  Gains derived from moveable property will, generally, be taxed only in the country of residence of the person disposing of that property.</P>
    <P>Article 16 sets out the general rule for the taxation of remuneration from employments, other than pensions, namely, that such income is taxable in the state of residence.  It may also be taxed in the country in which the employment is exercised where certain conditions apply.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Article 23 for which <Col N="1254" /> there is no corresponding provision in the OECD Model Convention is to regulate in an international context taxation rights in respect of profits, income or capital gains derived from offshore exploration. An enterprise which carries on offshore activities in connection with the exploration and exploitation of natural resources is deemed to be carrying on business through a permanent establishment provided that the activities in question are carried on for 30 days or more in any period of 12 months.  The creation of a permanent establishment position means that the profits attributable to the activities of that permanent establishment are liable to tax in the country in which it is situated.</P>
    <P>Article 24 deals with the elimination of double taxation where this has not been achieved either by the Convention or under the domestic law of the contracting states.  Broadly speaking, it provides by way of the credit method for the country of residence to allow against its own tax a credit for the tax paid in the other country on the same income or capital gains.</P>
    <P>Article 24 also ensures that the benefits of Ireland's various tax incentive reliefs are preserved for income flowing from Ireland to Sweden.  Paragraph (3) secures that the profits of a Swedish company operating through a branch in Ireland will be exempt from Swedish tax.  Paragraph (4) provides that, subject to certain conditions, dividends paid by an Irish subsidiary to a Swedish parent company will be exempt from Swedish tax.  Paragraph (8) deals with the granting by Sweden of &ldquo;matching credit&rdquo; in relation to a dividend, which is not otherwise relieved under the convention from Swedish tax, paid by an Irish resident company to a Swedish resident out of profits which are relieved from Irish tax under the various incentive provisions.</P>
    <P>The Convention will enter into force when instruments of ratification have been exchanged between the two countries. The existing agreement between ireland and Sweden shall cease to have effect as from the dates on which the provisions of this Convention become <Col N="1255" /> effective.  The new Convention brings our double taxation arrangements with Sweden up-to-date in accordance with the domestic fiscal legislation of both countries and with international practice generally.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, I should like to thank the Minister for a very informative briefing for all of us.  I understand that the former agreement between the two countries is dated from 1960 and was signed on behalf of both Governments in 1959.  I suppose that will automatically cease to have effect from the date this Convention becomes effective. The present Convention is to remain in force until terminated by one of the contracting states and either contracting state may terminate the Convention by giving notice of termination as provided for in Article 31.</P>
      <P>It is timely that we had this double taxation agreement to replace the previous one because since 1960 the Irish tax system has been extensively overhauled and capital gains tax and corporation tax have been introduced through the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, respectively.  It was evidently necessary to take account of these in a revised double taxation agreement between the two countries. Other treaties have been revised and replaced for similar reasons and I presume that others are in the course of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention follows very largely the OECD model double taxation convention and the effect for the most part therefore is as expected.  I would like to comment on some of the Articles and to ask the Minister a couple of questions, not so much about what the Articles mean but rather what is the thinking behind some of the provisions.  Article 2 deals with the taxes covered and in the case of Ireland it applies to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. Surtax and corporation profits tax were <Col N="1256" /> included in the former Article as well as income tax.</P>
    <P>The Convention is stated also to apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes which were imposed after the signing of the Convention in addition to or in place of existing taxes.  The competent authorities of the two countries shall notify each other of any substantial changes which have been made in their respective taxation rules but the Article provides no date by which this must be done.  In the former Article the contracting parties were obliged to notify each other of any change at the end of the year.  It is looser now and I wonder why?  I do not think that it is a good idea that it should be looser.</P>
    <P>Article 4 deals with residence and it follows the OECD Model Convention also.  It provides a series of tests which result in the fixing of residence in one country to the exclusion of the other. Formerly, it was possible to be resident in both countries simultaneously.  I would like the Minister to comment on the reason why this was changed from what pertained under the 1960 model and why this change has been introduced?</P>
    <P>Article 5 deals with the concept of permanent establishment.  This is similar to the original Article but the concept has been extended to include an oil or gas well and the installation or structure used for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources.  Since under Article 8 the profits of an enterprise of one contracting state may be taxable in the other contracting state if it carries on business in that other state through a permanent establishment situated therein, the scope for taxation in that other state is widened somewhat by the extension of the meaning of permanent establishment.</P>
    <P>Article 3 provides that the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is to include any area outside the territorial waters of Ireland which in accordance with international law has been or may be designated under the laws of Ireland concerning the continental shelf as an area within which the rights of Ireland with respect to the seabed, subsoil and natural resources may be exercised.  The effect of all the foregoing <Col N="1257" /> appears to be intended to bring within the charge to Irish tax profits Swedish oil exploration enterprises operating in the Irish sector of the continental shelf.  This provision is also reciprocated.  I do not know whether there is any activity by Irish exploration companies in Swedish waters, or indeed if there is any activity by Swedish companies in Irish waters.  It is just&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Article 9 deals with shipping and air transport and is on the lines of the original Article. There is specific reference in the revised Article to the Scandinavian airline system.  The Article provides that the profits of an enterprise of that contracting state from the operation of aircraft and international traffic is to be taxable only in the state but it is further provided that in the case of Scandinavian Air Services this provision is to apply only to such part of the profits as arise to ABA, the Swedish partner of SAS.  Again, I would like to ask, is that reciprocated?  I am sure the Minister will come in subsequently.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> By Aer Lingus operating in Sweden.  The Article deals with dividends and the original Article has been completely revised.  A feature of the new Article is that a resident of Sweden in receipt of dividends from an Irish resident company is to be entitled to the tax credit relating to the dividend to which an Irish resident individually would have been entitled.  Furthermore, such resident of Sweden may be entitled to payment of part of that tax credit.  In this respect the Article is on <Col N="1258" /> the lines of the corresponding Article in the Ireland-United Kingdom double taxation Convention but in that Convention the repayment can operate on a two-way basis where as under the present Article there is provision only for repayment by Ireland.  Could the Minister confirm that I am correct in this and that there is no reciprocation here in this Article, Article 11, and could he explain why there is no reciprocation?  In the case of dividends paid by a Swedish resident to a resident in Ireland, the maximum Swedish tax is to be at 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.  The OECD model Article here makes no provision for repayment of tax relating to dividends by one country to a resident of another so the questions that arise there are why no reciprocation and why the departure from the OECD model.  There must be some reason behind that.</P>
      <P>Article 14 deals with capital gains tax where there was no corresponding Article in the original Convention.  In accordance with the Article, capital gains derived by a resident of one country from the disposal of immovable property in the other country or from the disposal of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value from immovable property situated in that country may be taxed in that other country.  Gains resulting from the disposal of movable property may also be taxed in the country in which the movable property was situated, if that property formed part of the business property of a permanent establishment located here.  Capital gains derived by a resident of one country from the disposal or rights to assets to be produced by the exploration or exploitation of the seabed or subsoil and the natural resources situated in the other contracting state, may be taxed in that other state together with gains from the disposal of any rights to interest or to benefit such assets or from the disposal of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value from such rights.  In other cases capital gains from the disposal of property are to be taxable only in the state of which the disposing party is resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a question on Article 19 as well. <Col N="1259" /> This deals with pensions and annuities.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  It seems that pensions other than Government pensions paid in respect of past employment in a contracting state and payments under the social security legislation of a contracting state may be taxed in that state.  That contrasts with the previous position under which such payments were to be taxed only in the country of which the recipent was resident. The former position was in line with the OECD model, so there is a change in the model here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Article 23 contains miscellaneous rules applicable to certain offshore activities carried on offshore in connection with the explorations or exploitation of the seabed. There are exclusions in this Article in respect of activities for periods not exceeding, in the aggregate, 30 days within any period of 12 months.  I would like a comment on that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 24 deals with the elimination of double taxation and this is to be achieved either by way of crediting tax paid in one country against the tax payable in the other country or by way of exempting profits from taxation in one of the countries. The most significant provision from an Irish standpoint is contained in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article.  Under paragraph 3 a resident of Sweden deriving income from a business carried on through a permanent establishment in Ireland is to be exempt from Swedish tax, while under paragraph 4 dividends received from an Irish company by its <Col N="1260" /> Swedish parent company are generally to be exempt from Swedish tax.  These provisions must be considered favourable from the Irish point of view.  They stand to enhance the value of incentive reliefs provided under the Irish taxation system. Thus, Swedish enterprise, whether it is in the form of a subsidiary company or an Irish branch of a Swedish company, which is entitled to the 10 per cent corporation tax rate in respect of manufacturing activities may repatriate such profits to Sweden without further tax penalty there.  I presume as the Department of Finance continue to negotiate double taxation agreements with other countries, that they will seek to have this provision applied on a widespread basis. Any of us who had any involvement in industry and commerce are aware of the difficulties for multinational companies, offshore companies, operating here when it comes to repatriating profits.  Quite frequently when they repatriate they are subject to the taxation regime of the parent country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we have no objection to this.  My advice is to the effect that this agreement is good from the Irish point of view.  It is supportive of our general programme to attract investment. The team that negotiated it over such a long period have done a good job on behalf of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one item I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is the following. It is a problem which this agreement solves in relation to Sweden but not in respect of other foreign investors.  The non-resident recipient of dividends from an Irish resident company is, strictly speaking, liable to Irish income tax on <Col N="1261" /> dividends.  In the case of corporate shareholders the rate of tax is 35 per cent of the dividend plus the tax credit attributable to the income tax so computed.  In the case of companies liable at the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, the rate of tax credit is just over 5 per cent, leaving a theoretical liability to income tax of 31 per cent of the net dividend received. This liability is unique to dividends paid from profits taxed at the 10 per cent incentive rate.  In the case of dividends from export sales, these are exempted under Irish law; in the case of other profits, the tax credit applicable to the dividend usually covers the Irish tax liability.</P>
    <P>Article 11(1) (c) of the agreement the Minister is bringing before the House provides an exemption from this residual tax, if I could call it that, for Swedish corporate shareholders owning more than 10 per cent of an Irish company paying such dividends but the point I want the Minister to note &mdash; and it is a point with some substance &mdash; is that this residual tax liability will continue to exist for most other foreign companies investing in Irish resident subsidiaries.  Despite persistent representations made to the Department of Finance and to the Revenue Commissioners since the 10 per cent tax incentive was introduced in 1980, the law has not been changed to remove this liability.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in one sense it is academic because the Revenue Commissioners have no way to recover these taxes.  However, it is not simply academic in this respect &mdash; and this is the point I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to &mdash; because accountants who advise and audit these companies feel they are under an obligation to advise their clients to pay all taxes due and it simply is undesirable that accountants should be put in the position of indicating that this money is theoretically due to the Irish Revenue Commissioners but they have no way of getting it so it can be ignored, because proper professional standards require that accountants should say to their clients that they should pay everything they owe and should say to the shareholders that theoretically <Col N="1262" /> there is a liability here but it just cannot be recovered.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting to the Minister is that in the forthcoming Finance Bill he should bring in a clause to deal with this residual liability, to remove it or to rectify the situation so as not to leave it as a theoretically payable tax which cannot, in practice, be recovered.  It is undesirable from the point of view of professional accountants and it is undesirable to have a theoretical tax liability with no practical way of recovering it.  Having made that point, it is not one which would occur to me but it does concern professional accountants advising international investors in Ireland and I ask the Minister to remedy it as soon as he can.  Apart from that, we agree with the agreement completely.</P>

      <P>Taking the last point first and again thanking Deputies for their contributions and their welcome for this second agreement, there is no doubt but that this is a problem we are aware of.  I will take what the Deputy has said into account and see what can be done but at present we have no way of collecting that tax.</P>
      <P>Turning to the points made by Deputy Noonan, one of the first points he raised was in regard to the notification of changes.  There is now an automatic procedure, which was not there in 1959, whereby each year the Finance Bill is sent to all countries with whom we have double taxation agreements.  It is an automatic procedure now and I do not think that in 1959 it was in operation or as streamlined as it is now.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a point about air transport and Aer Lingus operating to Sweden and that there would not be reciprocation if they did.  When they do so there will be reciprocation.  I understand they are not doing so at present.</P>

He made the point that we did not have the same arrangements here mainly because we do not have a withholding tax here.  Sweden has it.  We do not have it so the issue the Deputy raised is not involved.  Perhaps there are other things on which the Deputy wants clarification?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that the previous Government circulated the text of their Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1987, immediately prior to the dissolution of the Dáil on 20 January last.  The Government have now given careful consideration to their predecessors' legislative proposals in that Bill and have decided that they are necessary and should be proceeded with.  Accordingly, that Bill was initiated by this Government in Seanad Éireann and passed with a number of amendments last week.</P>
      <P>The various sections of the Bill fall into one or other of four categories, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) New measures specifically in <Col N="1264" /> relation to drug smuggling; these give customs officers power to search persons without warrant in the vicinity of any port, airport or the land frontier and powers to search premises under warrant; these provisions are similar to the powers of the Garda under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, as recommended by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism;</P>
    <P>(ii) new measures aimed at strengthening the hand of the customs service in fighting smuggling generally;</P>
    <P>(iii) The Bill contains a number of measures aimed at clarifying, or technically adjusting existing Customs and Excise legislation; these include the application of Customs and Excise law to oil found onshore or to oil and other goods produced on Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf and related matters and</P>
    <P>(iv) Finally, the Bill increases the level of penalties for a number of certain offences under existing Customs and Excise legislation.</P>
    <P>The most important provisions are those which aim to equip the customs service to deal more effectively with drug smuggling.  The availability and misuse of drugs, particularly hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine, in this country pose a grave threat to the individual and to society in general.  It is an evil which must be tackled on all fronts.  As officers of Customs and Excise are in the front line in this fight I consider it vital that they be given the additional powers proposed. This is in line with the recommendations of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate in the Seanad centred on section 2 of the Bill, and rightly so since it is a key section.  That section confers on officers of Customs and Excise powers to detain and search, without warrant, persons, vehicles, vessels etc. in the vicinity of any port, airport or the land frontier for the purposes of detecting drug smuggling.  This confers on officers of Customs and Excise powers <Col N="1265" /> similar to those already conferred on the Garda Síochána by the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
    <P>Customs officers already have considerable powers of search under present legislation, some of which dates back to 1876.  I think it would be helpful to Deputies if I outline these present powers and I hope that it will then become clear that the main thrust of section 2 is to extend to customs officers powers of search in relation to what may be termed &ldquo;meeters and greeters&rdquo;, that is, persons in the vicinity of a port, airport or the land frontier who are not travellers and who are not suspected of an export offence. The present powers of search available to officers of Customs and Excise are as follows:</P>
    <P>Customs officers may search without warrant</P>
    <P>&mdash;any person who has entered the State by land, sea or air;</P>
    <P>&mdash;any person suspected of an offence in relation to exportation of goods,</P>
    <P>&mdash;aircraft and ships,</P>
    <P>&mdash;vehicles within 20 miles of the land frontier and</P>
    <P>&mdash;vehicles anywhere else in the State &ldquo;upon reasonable suspicion or probable cause&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Customs officers may also search under warrant any house, shop, cellar, warehouse or other place.</P>
    <P>The effect of this section, therefore, is to extend to customs officers in respect of &ldquo;meeters and greeters&rdquo; the powers they already have in relation to travellers and in relation to persons suspected of an exportation offence.</P>
    <P>As I said, section 2 generated much debate in the Seanad and I am thankful to all the Senators involved for their contributions which were interesting, frank and very constructive.  In fact, that debate led to the amendment of section 2 by the addition of parts (A), (B), (C) and (D) to subsection (1) (i) of section 2.  That amendment specifies certain safeguards for any person who is to be searched and ensures that any such person understands <Col N="1266" /> the reason for the search and that the search is conducted sympathetically and with due respect for the individual being searched.  In relation to safeguards I might mention also that the 1876 Customs Consolidation Act provides that, before any person is searched by a customs officer, he or she can ask to be taken before a justice or before a senior official of customs who must determine whether or not &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; for the search exists.  Furthermore, any person who has a complaint against an officer of Customs and Excise can complain to a superior officer or to the Revenue Commissioners and can also seek redress through the Ombudsman or the courts.  It is always difficult to balance the rights of the individual against the rights of the community but I am satisfied that the safeguards mentioned strike the best balance in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress at this point that it is not proposed that the search of an individual will extend to compulsory intimate body searches.  Neither the Garda nor the prison service, I am informed, conduct such searches and such powers of search are not now proposed for customs officers.  Under existing law, individuals may be detained for as long as is reasonably necessary to conduct a search.  More extensive powers of detention are not being sought.  Let me assure the House, however, that if the need to increase the powers available to customs officers in relation to period of detention arises, this will be given very careful and detailed consideration.  The Government are satisfied that the provisions in this Bill, together with the existing powers of search, are sufficient and appropriate to deal with the situation as it now stands.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is important also in the fight against drug smuggling and it arises, too, from the recommendations of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  It provides for the issue to, and execution by, an officer of Customs and Excise of a search warrant authorising him or her to search premises or land for controlled drugs which were illegally imported or are intended to be <Col N="1267" /> illegally exported, or for documents relating to such drugs.  The section also empowers the officer who executes the search warrant to arrest any person found in the place being searched and to search that person.  This is an important provision, I believe, if the Customs service is to tackle effectively the problem of drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>Taken together, sections 2 and 3 of the Bill will, the Government believe, increase the effectiveness of the Customs service in making drug detections but, while the powers envisaged will form an important part of our first line of defence, great reliance must continue to be placed on the efforts of the Garda and on information provided by the Garda and from agencies, including customs services in other countries, about the movement of drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, other provisions in the Bill not arising from the recommendations of the select committee in relation to drug smuggling provide for some strengthening of the law in relation to smuggling generally.  I wish to take this opportunity to restate to this House the points already made by the Minister for Finance to the Seanad about smuggling.  The Government are deeply perturbed at the apparent scale of commercial smuggling of certain goods such as drink, oil products and electrical goods.  Smuggling damages local retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and robs the Exchequer of vitally important revenues.  The receivers of such goods obtain their &ldquo;bargains&rdquo; at the cost firstly of their neighbours' livelihoods and secondly, of the ability of the Exchequer to maintain essential public services at an optimum level.  I know that legitimate traders are seriously perturbed at the existence of such traffic and the unfair position they find themselves in when trying to compete with smuggled commodities. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind as to the detrimental effects of participating in such black economy transactions.  They are not helping the community, the economy or ultimately themselves by so doing. <Col N="1268" /> Smugglers are encouraged by those who are prepared to accept a quick return by availing of under-the-counter services and every effort must be made to strengthen the hand of the Customs service to tackle the problem.  The entire fabric of our business and social structure is affected by smuggling.  There must be no dissembling in recognising smuggling for what it is; there can be no pretence that it is morally or socially acceptable or somehow justified by high taxation levels. No such argument is acceptable.  The Government do not intend to allow the community to continue to suffer from these abuses.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of technical adjustments to existing Customs and Excise legislation and also contains clarification of the Customs and Excise status of goods won from the Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf, and it provides for excise control measures in relation to oil found onshore or in areas of the Continental Shelf over which the State exercises sovereign jurisdiction. There is also provision for the application of Customs and Excise controls to goods conveyed by pipeline.</P>
    <P>Finally the Bill increases a number of penalties in relation to breaches of Customs and Excise law.  The Government took the opportunity during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad to increase the penalties to levels they consider appropriate to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I turn now to outline in sequence the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions and provides for standard interpretation clauses.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives officers of Customs and Excise powers to detain and to search, without warrant, persons, vehicles, etc. for the purposes of detecting drug smuggling. The section provides that these powers may be exercised in the vicinity of a port, airport, or the land frontier. I have already explained the rationale behind this section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue to, and execution by, an officer of Customs and Excise of a search warrant authorising him to search premises or land for controlled drugs which were illegally <Col N="1269" /> imported or are intended to be illegally exported, or for documents relating to such drugs.  The section also empowers the officer who executes the search warrant to arrest any person found in the place being searched and to search that person.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the acceptance as evidence, in proceedings under the customs Acts in drugs smuggling cases, of certificates giving the results of tests or analyses carried out in the State laboratory.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the issue of a search warrant to an officer of Customs and Excise to search premises or places where books or documents relating to smuggling transactions are suspected of being kept or concealed.  It also provides for the seizure of any such documents, as well as any smuggled goods which may be found in the course of a search.  Under existing law, there is no provision for the issue of a search warrant to an officer of Customs and Excise authorising him to search for documents <i>per se</i>.  Such documents can be vital in the successful prosecution of a case against a smuggler.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that, where goods liable to seizure or detention by customs are found in a vehicle or other conveyance, the vehicle or conveyance shall be deemed to have been made use of in the conveyance of the goods, and thus liable to seizure or detention along with them.  The purpose of this section is to remedy a possible weakness in the existing law governing the forfeiture of vehicles used to convey uncustomed, prohibited or restricted goods.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes provision for the detention by an officer of Customs and Excise of goods suspected of having been smuggled or of being irregularly exported.  The period of detention, which may not exceed one month, is to enable investigations to be carried out to determine whether the goods in such cases should be seized.  Legal problems can arise in the case of premature seizure of goods which this section will surmount by providing for a period of detention of suspect goods.</P>
    <P>Section 8 remedies a possible technical <Col N="1270" /> weakness in one of the existing provisions relating to the liability to forfeiture of smuggled goods by providing generally that such goods shall be liable to forfeiture, regardless of whether they have been unshipped or unladen.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the onus of proof in certain proceedings relating to exported goods or goods seized under the customs Acts.  Under existing law, where proceedings are taken by the State under the customs Acts in respect of goods suspected of having been illegally imported, the onus of proving that the goods were lawfully imported rests on the defendant. Section 9 provides for a similar onus in relation to goods suspected of having been illegally exported or of being intended for illegal exportation.  The section also provides that where civil actions are brought against the Revenue Commissioners, etc., in relating to goods seized under the customs Acts &mdash; and this includes customs officers and the staff of the Customs and Excise &mdash; the onus of proving where the goods originated, or whether the goods were lawfully imported or were lawfully exported or otherwise lawfully dealt with for exportation, is on the person bringing the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that goods won from the Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf and brought directly ashore shall be deemed for Customs and Excise purposes to have been grown, produced or manufactured in the State and not to have been imported.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the application of excise controls to (a) oil found in the State and (b) oil found in Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf and deemed under the previous section to have been produced in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 12 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations governing the importation or exportation of goods over the Border with Northern Ireland. The section also provides that the existing land frontier regulations shall have effect as if they had been made under the section, and increases the maximum penalty for contravention or of failure to comply with the regulations from £100 to <Col N="1271" /> £1,000.  The purpose of the section is to remove any possible doubt about the validity of the existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister for Finance to apply the provisions of the Customs and Excise Acts to pipelines and goods conveyed in pipelines.  In effect this will enable the normal Customs and Excise controls, e.g. the requirements to make Customs entry, which govern goods transported by ship, aircraft and road vehicle, to be applied to goods conveyed by pipeline.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for a general penalty of £1,000 for offences relating to illicit distillation under the Illicit Distillation (Ireland) Act, 1831 and provides that a district justice may mitigate the penalty for these offences to not less than one half of the full penalty.  The most common offences committed against the 1831 Act relate to possession of equipment or materials used in illicit distillation and making, possessing, conveying or selling illicit spirits, which currently attract penalties of £200.  A district justice is currently empowered to mitigate these penalties to not less than £6.</P>
    <P>Section 15 increases from £100 to £1,000 the maximum penalty which may be imposed for an offence under section 12 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881.  The offences referred to in that section include assault or obstruction of Customs and Excise officers and rescue of seized goods.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends section 31 of the Finance Act, 1929 so as to confer on an officer of Customs and Excise authority, in cases of suspected fraud, to detain documents relating to goods the importation or exportation of which is prohibited or restricted.  That section already authorises the detention of documents in cases of suspected fraud relating solely to Customs or Excise duties.  This provision brings documents relating to goods which are prohibited or restricted within the scope of section 31.  Section 16 also increases, from £50 to £1,000, the penalty for resisting an officer in the performance <Col N="1272" /> of his or her duty under section 31 of the Finance Act, 1929.</P>
    <P>Section 17 increases from £100 to £1,000 the maximum penalty which may be imposed for contravention of regulations made by the Minister for Finance governing the application of Customs and Excise law and controls to Shannon customs-free airport.</P>
    <P>Section 18 increases, from £100 to £1,000, the maximum penalty which may be imposed for contravention of regulations made by the Minister for Finance governing the application of Customs and Excise law and controls to imports and exports by air.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends section 29 of the Finance Act, 1971, so as to ensure that prohibited or restricted goods are subject to the same controls as dutiable goods when they are being imported or being taken out of the State by travellers in their baggage and to strengthen the powers of officers of Customs and Excise in relation to control of travellers.  The proposed amendment to the 1971 Act is necessary in order to provide a clear legal obligation on incoming travellers to declare to customs prohibited or restricted goods in the same way that it is mandatory for travellers to declare dutiable goods in excess of the permitted limits and to impose an obligation on travellers leaving the State to answer any questions put to them by a Customs and Excise officer and to produce their baggage for examination.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the short title of the Bill and for its construction with the customs Acts and the excise statutes.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill to Dáil Éireann I want to pay tribute to our Customs service.  Let me echo what the Minister for Finance said when he introduced this Bill to Seanad Éireann.  The Customs service have a difficult, frequently unpopular and sometimes dangerous job to do.  Most of us have contact with them only when we are entering or leaving the country.  We should remember that, in addition to doing an essential regulatory job, they are our first line of defence against smugglers who have the capacity to destroy the economy and to create <Col N="1273" /> considerable social distress.  The smuggler of today is often a very sophisticated operator and we must keep pace with developments in giving our Customs officers adequate powers.</P>
    <P>The Government are of the view that the measures set out in this Bill will be of significant assistance to the work of the Customs and Excise service particularly in the area of drug smuggling.  I therefore commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for his very informative speech.  I welcome the Bill.  We have no difficulty with its principles and are hoping to give it a reasonably speedy passage through the House. In thanking the Minister I should like to compliment the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism who did some of the preparatory work on this and initiated a debate which gave rise to the Bill which was introduced by Deputy John Bruton when Minister for Finance on 28 January last, a short time before the general election.  Reading the debate on the Bill in the Seanad one can see that a very good job was done on it in that House.  I was delighted to see that the Minister approached it in an open fashion, that he listened to what Members of the Seanad had to say and accepted amendments.  That is the proper way to treat the Houses of Parliament.  I always thought it most peculiar that it was a tradition for a Minister to present a Bill which could not be changed in any respect, even to a comma or semi-colon, as if it was holy writ from the top of the mountain.  I do not think that was good practice and it ignored the parliamentary process.  I was delighted to hear that the Minister of State accepted amendments in the Seanad.  It is my intention to table amendments on Committee Stage and I am sure the Minister will approach them in the same open-minded fashion that he approached amendments in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this is what could be described as a Committee Stage Bill and my main contribution will be when we reach that Stage.  For that reason I do not <Col N="1274" /> intend to detain the House now.  We can all agree with the principle of the Bill because we are all aware of the scourge that drugs can be in a society.  I do not think it is possible to conceive of a measure which would be draconian enough to fight the evil we have experienced in this city and from what we know of what is happening in other cities around the world.  Drugs can have a devastating effect on young and old, on families and communities.  We are all aware that drug abuse erodes the foundations of a fabric of society.  Like other countries, we have to respond in the strongest possible manner to protect ourselves and our communities from the scourge of drugs.  I do not think there is any need to pursue that point.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce when going through Singapore airport and, subsequently, into Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia I got a shiver down my spine when I saw posters at the airport warning people that if they were found guilty of the possession of illegal drugs the punishment would be death.  Drug smuggling is a capital offence and dramatic posters with a rope around an individual's neck greeted people as they went through customs.  I was inclined to check my pockets to see if I had travel sickness tablets or aspirin in case they were mistaken for hard drugs.  Those posters brought the message home to me.  I mention that experience because throughout the world governments have taken measures to deal with the smuggling of drugs which they would not dream of introducing for other crimes because of the consequences to civil liberties.  We are not out of line in being more draconian in combating drugs than in combating any other crime.</P>
    <P>Traditionally Customs and Excise officers have had powers which are stronger than those given to police forces and there has been a long tradition of Customs and Excise legislation being extremely draconian to prevent smuggling, much stronger than powers given to police forces on these islands or in Western Europe to combat crimes under normal criminal law.  However, I will be <Col N="1275" /> looking for an explanation in regard to certain provisions on Committee Stage. Section 1, the definition section, defines an officer of the Customs and Excise as including a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service from time to time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation of anything.  On the face of it the Bill seeks to give extra powers to customs officers but because of that provision in the definition section every power in the Bill is being given not only to customs officers but to the Garda Síochána &mdash; that is fair enough &mdash; and to anybody who from time to time might be employed by the Revenue Commissioners, somebody in a part time job, in a summer job, in temporary employment or assigned from another Department to combat a bad outbreak of smuggling along the Border.  I would like to talk about all that on Committee Stage because these powers are very wide.  I am not making any charge of concealment but the way this is worded gives the impression that these powers are confined to customs officers.  They are not. They are given to every garda and to anybody who can pass as an employee of the Revenue Commissioners, even if he was only employed on that activity for one day.</P>
    <P>The place where the power can be exercised is also very wide.  The Bill is drafted in a way that would suggest it is more confined than it is.  The customs officer can exercise the power in the vicinity of any port, any airport or within 20 miles of the land frontier.  When you put all that together it means that these powers can be exercised anywhere in the State and at any time.  If that is the intent, it would be better to state that in the Bill. The Minister might be able to give me the information but I think there are between 50 and 60 air strips in the country, there are many ports and 20 miles from the land border brings us a good way into the country.</P>
    <P>A third of the population live in Dublin.  Let us look at Dublin and see if there is any part of this city which is not in the vicinity of a port or airport.  If a <Col N="1276" /> person is along the seafront or near the Liffey he is in the vicinity of the port.  If he is on the north side, he is in the vicinity of Dublin Airport.  If he is in the west of the city, he is in the vicinity of Baldonnell. If a person moves south he is in the vicinity of Dún Laoghaire, another port.  The powers being sought and the powers we will give are very wide first, when they define the customs officer as any policeman or any person who from time to time is employed by the Revenue Commissioners. That power can be exercised right through the country.  I am not objecting to that.  It would be ludicrous if the same powers were not given to the Garda.  It would be ludicrous if a power could not be exercised to prevent drug smuggling within 500 metres of an airport, that once a person got beyond that <i>cordon sanitaire</i> he was free to do as he liked.  That would not be right either, but in presenting the Bill it would be better if things were as they appear.  There seems to be a manner of drafting which suggests that the powers are not as wide as they really are.  I will be coming back to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I presume we will spend a lot of time on section 2 on Committee Stage because this section is the most important as far as drug smuggling is concerned.  I have already dealt with the idea of the vicinity of the airport, but the powers of search need explanation and clarification.  In the Seanad the Minister said it was not the intention to exercise this power in a manner which would involve intimate searching by customs officers of people reasonably suspected of smuggling drugs. I wonder is that wise?  As I understand it, a lot of smuggling is done by swallowing drugs and concealing hard drugs in the orifices of the body.  I wonder if we are going far enough in the powers of search in this Bill.  On the fact of it, section 2 would allow a customs officer to intimately search almost anybody coming through an airport but the Minister said it is not the intention to do that.  I would prefer if the Bill gave the customs officers powers which the Minister thought desirable. If that is to be the power of intimate searching, then say so, but if it is the <Col N="1277" /> Minister's view that customs officers should not intimately search people coming through our ports and airports, then that power should be more restricted. It seems to me that, on the face of it, this power is given but we have a commitment from the Minister that that power will not be exercised.  There might be a better way of approaching this and I will be returning to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters I will be raising on Committee Stage.  I notice very extensive powers of search are given in sections 3 and 5.  On the face of it, these are presented as very draconian powers of search to eliminate drug trafficking which is fair enough, but when we read the Bill we find the Minister is widening the net.  He wants the same powers of search to apply to any commodity which is being smuggled into the country.  As I said previously, there are draconian measures in every country to deal with drug trafficking.  The Minister is introducing this measure, giving very strong powers of search, to combat drug trafficking but subsequently he is extending these powers into what might be called common or garden smuggling without any estimation of value and any person smuggling any item would be subject to the same search as somebody suspected of drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>I also have a doubt about the mechanism for search, that is, where a justice of the District Court or a peace commissioner is satisfied from information on oath from a Customs and Excise officer that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting a whole series of things.  I am not too sure that such a serious power should be granted by a peace commissioner.  I do not know the up to date number of peace commissioners but there are quite a number of them.</P>
    <P>We all have an intimate knowledge of how peace commissioners are appointed. Many of us have been involved in either appointing them or petitioning Ministers for Justice to appoint them.  Usually they are men and women of quality who are respected in their community and frequently <Col N="1278" /> they are attached to political parties, but they do not have a judicial background or judicial training of any sort.  Frequently a peace commissioner will comply with the request of a garda or a Customs and Excise officer and will not look behind the request but will grant it.  That is fair comment and we all know it.</P>
    <P>The powers being given here are very wide, the widest powers of search I have ever seen.  They are wider than the powers of search granted in the criminal justice legislation which caused such commotion when I was putting it through the House.  The vesting of that power in thousands of peace commissioners needs to be questioned.  I accept that powers of search are absolutely necessary.  I accept that a district justice is a fit person and I can see the reason these powers are being extended to peace commissioners but it is a point I will be raising on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask where they will find a district justice to grant a warrant to search a premises in the city if drugs are being brought into Dublin Airport in the middle of the night.  So far as the drugs element is concerned, I will be prepared to concede the point because drug trafficking can always give rise to an emergency, but when the same power is extended to smuggling other commodities, to vest that power in a peace commissioner is casting the net a little too wide.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that before I consider putting down an amendment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the powers of search, particularly in relation to documents, there does not seem to be any clause to protect the professional relationship between a client and a member of a profession. For example, do these sections allow a garda or an officer of customs, on the authorisation of a peace commissioner, to enter the office of an accountancy firm and to take away the confidential files containing information of the client's professional relationship? It seems it would.  It also seems it would give the power to a garda or a customs officer, on the authorisation of a peace <Col N="1279" /> commissioner, to enter a solicitor's office, to demand the personal files of clients and to take them away for examination. It might also authorise a customs officer or a garda, on the authorisation of a peace commissioner, to enter the premises of a doctor or a hospital and to take away confidential files if he thought they would provide documentary evidence of smuggling, especially in relation to drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>Is it cast so wide that it would extend to the confidential files of drug treatment centres in hospitals?  Would the power then act as an inhibition on those who are hooked on hard drugs from getting the treatment they need in clinics?  The Minister knows what I have in mind.  On one reading, it looks as if it would only refer to documentation directly related to smuggling, on another it could imply that anything that would throw light on smuggling activities would come within the ambit of the section.  The whole area of the confidentiality of professional-client relationships is something I should like to again raise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is most peculiar that criminal law legislation which emerges from the Department of Finance is generally acceptable, more or less welcomed and nodded through.  However, if the same Bill emanated from the Department of Justice we would be here for months trying to get it through.  Obviously, the pedigree of a Bill is very important in this House.  For example, section 14 provides a general penalty of £1,000 for offences relating to illicit distillation under the Illicit Distillation Act, 1831.  However, there is a provision where a district justice will no longer be able to mitigate the penalty for the offences in full.  He can only mitigate half the fine.  I do not want to make too much out of this but it is curious because various Ministers of Justice have informed the House on numerous occasions that a judge must at all times consider the ability of a convicted person to pay a fine before he imposes one.  We were told that is why we cannot have minimum fines and that it is a plank <Col N="1280" /> of common law that a judge cannot knowingly impose a fine which he knows the convicted person cannot pay.  He would, in effect, be passing a prison sentence on a person because, in the absence of payment of the fine, the person would go to jail.  If that emanated from the Department of Justice there would be a right row in this House but it is all right when it comes from the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wonder if it is constitutional because I have serious doubts about tying the hands of a district justice in regard to fines.  The people who drafted the Bill must have had the same doubts and it looks as if serious advice was given on that section by the Attorney General's office.  If you wanted to impose a fine of £1,000 or £500 on someone for making poitin, the normal thing to do would be to introduce a minimum fine by saying that a district justice shall not impose a fine of less than £500 on conviction under this section.  It is not done that way and it is an attempt to give the traditional discretion to district justices which is required under common law and to fudge the issue.  It is probably still unconstitutional although it is unlikely that the distillers of the white bottle will go to the Supreme Court to test the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section which would raise eyebrows and hackles if it emerged from the Department of Justice but does not have the same effect coming from the Department of Finance is section 9 which involves the reversal of proof.  In all criminal law it has long been insisted that a person is innocent until proven guilty and that the onus of proof is on the State. This is an example of the onus of proof being reversed; it will now be on the person charged to prove he did not illegally import specific goods.  I would not even mention this if the power was confined to drug smuggling but it is not. This gives the power to customs officers to bring somebody to court, having <Col N="1281" /> accused them of smuggling a portable television set from Newry, and demanding proof that they did not.  That is not the way our courts behaved in the past or the way criminal law has been organised. If that came from the Department of Justice it would be treated with enormous suspicion as a device to subvert civil liberties.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the principle of the Bill &mdash; it is about time that these powers were given to customs officers and members of the Garda Síochána in relation to drug smuggling &mdash; I have questions about the manner in which the Bill is constructed.  It certainly gives far wider powers than its casual reading would suggest. It introduces new principles to criminal law which were previously rejected in this House.  I particularly welcome the open-ended manner in which the Minister is handling this and I am sure he will be open to accepting amendments on Committee Stage if we can convince him that they are worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Any measure which can control and ultimately do away with the abuse of drugs is welcome.  Many questions are raised by this Bill as to how these new measures are to be implemented and as to who will be responsible.  There is no doubt that the control of misuse of drugs is the essential element in this Bill.  Drug abuse is indeed the greatest curse of modern society.  Ireland has not been safe from the terrible consequences of drug abuse, particularly of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to widen the powers of Customs and Excise to deal with drugs importation.  In principle we are in favour of the Bill.  The legal remedies available to combat drug pushing are not sufficient. The Government in another Bill should introduce a remedy in both the civil courts and the criminal courts to trace and sequester the assets of drug dealers. This would be a very important deterrent in the area of drug smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives wide ranging powers to Customs and Excise officers.  The definition of these officers is so widely defined as to be not defined at all.  What training <Col N="1282" /> will the Customs and Excise officers have?  From reading the Bill the impression is that anyone employed in the Civil Service can be sent to the front line at any stage to handle drug smuggling and no proper training seems to be involved.  This is not the way to approach this serious matter.  The Garda Síochána enforce law here.  I would rather see in this Bill a clear indication that the Garda are the ultimate authority in this area. There should be provision for more co-operation in the activities of Customs and Excise officers under the control of the Garda particularly in the areas of searching. The Bill mentions facilities for searching suspected drug smugglers. Where are these facilities?  Who is the ultimate arbiter in the context of conducting searches?  It is wrong to assign this job to untrained personnel, to personnel without legal backing, without technical qualifications and so on. According to this Bill even part time employees in the Civil Service could be in the front line in this area.  There is no requirement that officers should have a warrant from the Minister or from the Revenue Commissioners to exercise these powers.  In the context of powers to detail and perform body searches this legislation gives no safeguard that the person involved will have any legal, technical or social training or any system of discipline such as the Garda have.  I understand what the Minister is trying to tackle but there are ways and means of going about it that would be far more efficient.  The job of carrying out searches should not be on an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement involving people without training in these matters.</P>
    <P>The matter of intimate searching was raised earlier.  In the prevention of drug smuggling in other countries, one of the main areas of drug detection, particularly coming through airports, is in the area of body searching.  The facilities at the disposal of Customs and Excise officers in other countries are substantial and it is recognised that without those facilities they would not be able to carry out proper searching.  People involved in drug smuggling <Col N="1283" /> are extremely sophisticated and one cannot find what one wishes to detect without the proper facilities at one's disposal. I do not see where these facilities are and I do not see who is to operate them.</P>
    <P>There should be far better co-operation between the Garda and the customs officers.  The Bill does not indicate that the Garda Drug Squad would be directly involved with the customs officers.  They should be, particularly where customs officers have information or a suspicion that there is to be a major drug smuggling operation.  In such cases the customs officers should immediately contact the drug squad as the Garda are the ultimate arbiters in this area.  This contact would lead to a far more efficient, disciplined and professional approach, as the Garda are a professional body in this whole area. This should not be left totally to the Customs and Excise officers, especially to untrained Customs and Excise officers.</P>
    <P>This Bill also deals with illicit distilling. We are all aware of what occurred in this area in the last week in the Cork area in relation to illicit vodka.  This area is open to abuse and measures which would deal effectively with it are welcome.  Duties and so on on the production of alcohol are to be collected by the Customs and Excise officers.  This is correct but is the Minister aware that in the case of any goods and spirits moving out of bonded warehouses, Customs and Excise take no responsibility for the collection of VAT? It is not even charged on the Customs and Excise documents.  Millions of pounds are being lost to the Department of Finance and to the Revenue Commissioners in this area.  If a person with a bonded warehouse is prepared to buy in direct and large quantities of alcohol, he is only charged on the taking of those goods out of bondage, for the duties involved, but is not charged VAT.  The Customs and Excise people say they have no responsibility in this area and there is no co-ordination so as to collect the VAT. That is why in so many areas we see huge variations in the retail prices of a bottle of spirits.  Some people are able to sell <Col N="1284" /> spirits knowingly having gained them without paying VAT because VAT is not charged on the customs document.  This may not be smuggling but it is an area that seriously needs to be considered by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The increased fines to be imposed in many areas are right and proper.  It is interesting, as Deputy Noonan (Limerick East) said, that the minimum fine should be referred to.  I spoke on another Bill in this House some weeks ago and suggested something along these lines.  While I cannot remember the exact wording I seem to remember I was told something to the effect that probably my suggestion was unconstitutional in some way.  Yet what I had suggested with regard to another Bill seems to have been incorporated in this one.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that because there appears to be a contradiction there.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister said that the customs service have a difficult, frequently unpopular and sometimes dangerous job to do.  He continued to say:</P>
    <P>We should remember that, in addition to doing an essential regulatory job, they are our first line of defence against smugglers who have the capacity to destroy the economy and to create considerable social distress.</P>
    <P>I agree with all of those sentiments.  I would pose the question: does that not highlight the very need for serious and proper training of the people who are to carry out that frontline work about which we speak?  Indeed there would be considerable dangers to these people were they not properly trained and it is essential that they should be.  We will be proposing some amendments on Committee Stage.  I have intimated in a general way some of the areas we will be examining.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact of the district justice and/or peace commissioner being involved in the issue of warrants.  Why not the Garda?  Why should a district justice or peace commissioner be allowed to issue warrants?  Why not the Garda as well?  I contend that the Garda should be <Col N="1285" /> involved in the frontline in this area and that it should not be confined to a district justice or peace commissioner.</P>
    <P>In general terms anything that can effectively control the abuse and misuse of drugs, particularly in the area of smuggling &mdash; which constitutes the frontline of access &mdash; is to be welcomed.  There are many provisions of this Bill which will have to be tightened and we shall be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House &mdash; which has already gone through the Seanad &mdash; implements the recommendations of the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism published in July 1984. The main thrust of the Bill is drugs control.</P>
      <P>As the previous two speakers have indicated, a note of caution must be struck at the beginning of this debate. This House always must be concerned with the civil liberties of the vast majority of citizens of this State who are law abiding and innocent of any offence whatsoever. I support the principle of this Bill. It constitutes an important development in the battle against drugs and their importation.  However, we must ensure that our desire to tackle the urgent problem of drugs and their abuse is balanced by ensuring that the rights of the vast majority of our citizens are not unnecessarily intruded on by any legislation we may enact here.  If an Opposition has any role at all to play surely it is to ensure that those kinds of needs are met and that we articulate the views of people concerned about civil liberties.  Quite clearly we could throw the whole purpose of law out the door and deal with drug abuse and offenders, or people suspected of being drug pushers or offenders, in the way that the Provisionals attempt to deal with it which, as we know, is a totally unrealistic way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone accepts that there is a major drug problem obtaining here, mainly, it has to be said, in the larger urban areas. Of course the drugs problem is not confined <Col N="1286" /> to heroin or hash; we have a major drink problem also.  There are other problems that must be resolved in the drugs area, such as addiction to certain drugs doctors prescribe quite freely and regularly to their patients.  However, the provisions of this Bill do not deal with that area.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that law, of itself, in the customs or other areas will not resolve the problem of drugs or their abuse.  It must be tackled also on the basis of the community being involved, community co-operation with the Garda, Garda co-operation with the community, our educational services co-operating with the Garda and the community generally and the development of an anti-drugs culture. These factors are as important as the law itself.</P>
    <P>I shall endeavour to deal specifically with the drugs problem in my contribution. I shall defer to Committee Stage a number of points I hope to make in relation to specific sections.  I am particularly anxious to speak about a development in the drugs area which has emerged in Dublin North West, the constituency that I and our present Acting Chairman represent, where the group known as the Concerned Parents Against Drugs has been established in the last six months or so.  Until then that group were not active there.  I know, as I am sure do many other Members, that the central committee of that group are simply a front for the Provisionals.  I have decided to endeavour to attend some of the meetings organised by this group in order to attempt to present an alternative view to the one being proposed by these people. Through my attendance at such meetings I have been struck by the manipulation of the meetings by this group.  These meetings have now assumed the character of a travelling circus around the constituency, with a meeting in, say, Finglas South this evening, Finglas West next week, Ballymun the following week, with the same people in control of the platform.</P>
    <P>As they travel from one area to another they gather between, say, one and four people from the area with no connection <Col N="1287" /> at all with the Provisionals but who are genuinely concerned with the problems of drugs in their area, thereby lending themselves a certain aura of respectability and concern.  As a constituent of mine said to me at a meeting I attended last evening: all that was missing from that meeting of last evening were the white pointed hoods of the Ku Klux Klan and the burning crosses.  That is exactly what the meeting seemed to represent, a peddling of fear, ignorance and barbarity. Women who attended the meeting told me they were locking themselves into their flats on account of the fear they felt because some person had named them as having been seen talking to a drug pusher in the area.  There are people actually living in fear of their lives.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to raise on the Adjournment on Thursday last the fact that on Wednesday night of last week these people had attacked a home in the area, had thrown all of the furniture in that home onto the street, literally blocking the Garda from getting into the area in order to protect the people involved.  I must stress &mdash; because the contrary has been said &mdash; that I have no time whatsoever for drug pushers or indeed anybody at all involved in the drug trade. But it will lead to anarchy if we allow a situation to develop in which any group in society can stand on a platform, name individuals and work a crowd or mob into a frenzy to attack a person's home simply on the basis of rumour and, in many cases, half truths.</P>
    <P>I appeal to this House to urge the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health and the Minister who is here today and who is involved with the Customs and Excise to ensure that the resources that are needed by the Department of Health, by Jervis Street Hospital and by the Garda to deal with the drugs problem are provided.  On many occasions when I have gone to the Garda I have got the utmost co-operation but I have been told that they do not have the resources to deal with the problem, to respond to the calls for help and to maintain the kind of vigilance that is needed in the areas.  I <Col N="1288" /> am not talking specifically about Dublin North West; this applies to other areas as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to the meetings I have spoken about, I have argued at all of those meetings &mdash; and people have supported my point of view &mdash; for co-operation with the Garda in relation to the drugs problem.  I have argued very strongly that the people concerned should get involved in legititmate groups that are active in Dublin city to help tackle the whole problem of drug addiction and to educate people to avoid drug addiction.  In many cases I have been howled down by the &ldquo;plants&rdquo; in the audience, people whom I knew to be members of the Provisionals, who surrounded me in an attempt to intimidate me into shutting up and staying quiet.  A very close friend of mine was surrounded last night by four of these thugs who warned him that if he did not shut up they would shut him up later because he was disagreeing with the attempts to drive the crowd into a frenzy against the gardaí who were on duty in the area.  This is a situation which must be dealt with and which this House cannot ignore.</P>
    <P>In the Finglas area the person who was given the lead at those meetings was Mr. Harry Fleming, the Provisional candidate in the area in the last general election. At the meetings held in Cabra Mr. Tony Flaherty was given precedence.</P>

      <P>All of these people, in their election literature, carried a statement to the effect that they supported the campaign or the war, as the called it, in Northern Ireland.  The same organisation which they have declared their support for accepted responsibility for the murder of a constituent of mine and of yours four to five weeks age.  In the last ten days they have accepted responsibility for the vicious murder of 11 people in Enniskillen and yet they are parading around your constituency and mine as being concerned about the victims of drug abuse and the victims of the drug pushers in this city. They are involved in a totally cynical, hypocritical campaign.  I have no hesitation in naming any of them either here or outside this House and I have done so at the public meetings which I have attended.  I wish that all the public representatives in that area would take the same stand.  I make no claim for myself in this regard but it is essential that the democratically elected representatives of the people make it clear that they do not support this kind of hooliganism and attacks on the citizens of this State.  We have courts, laws and the Garda who are there to enforce the law and it is the function of the citizens to co-operate with the Garda and with all the agencies that are attempting, legally and correctly, to deal with the problem of drug abuse in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the highest respect and praise for the Garda who are dealing with a very difficult problem in relation to drugs.  I <Col N="1290" /> know they have a particular problem with drug pushers because of the way they operate and the way they use young children to carry their drugs for them.  Nevertheless, last week the Garda in the Dublin north city area succeeded in putting away two of the biggest heroin pushers for a period of seven to eight years.  One of them is a person in a wheelchair and I hope the Minister for Justice will ensure that he will not be let loose again on to the streets of this city simply because he is in a wheelchair.  Rumour has it that on a previous occasion, having been sentenced to two years on a drugs charge, he was released within two weeks because the facilities were not available in Mountjoy to cope with him and his wheelchair.  I hope that is not true and, if it is, that it will not occur again.  Unless the people of this city see that the laws and the activities of the Garda are succeeding in putting away drug pushers who are convicted and in keeping them off the streets for a long period of time we are leaving the door open to the kind of groups that I have been speaking about.</P>
    <P>Many decent people who are concerned and angry about the drugs problem have been caught up in the campaign of the CPAD and the Provos and it is our function to provide them with an alternative.  There are a number of things which could be done and which would require very little resources.  For instance, in every district a Garda should be appointed to liaise with the community in relation to the drugs problem in their area.  Sometimes when a citizen goes into a Garda Station to report something about drugs they are told that that is not the area they deal with or that the person who does deal with it is not on duty until the following day and they will have to come back then.  There should be a Garda appointed to liaise with the people in the area on the question of drugs.</P>
    <P>Every Garda station should have a confidential telephone line for people to ring with information they may have and who, because of particular circumstances, may not wish to go to the Garda station personally. That will require some resources and we must be prepared to give the <Col N="1291" /> Garda and the Customs and Excise officers the resources and the powers they need to deal with the problem of drugs.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the question of the seizure of the accounts, moneys and resources of convicted drug pushers.  This is an area the Minister here would be involved in.  If this were done it would be an important deterrent for drug pushers.</P>
    <P>To return more specifically to the Bill, there has been concern expressed about civil liberties in relation to this Bill.  It is well to remember that while this Bill is directed largely at drug smugglers, it will affect everyone.  Under the Bill customs officers will now have the power to arrest without warrant, to detain for a certain period in unspecified places, to apply for a search warrant, to search, and if necessary enter a premises forcibly.  Under the Bill there is a very broad definition of what constitutes a customs officer.  It includes:</P>
    <P>Any person in the public service who is, for the time being, employed in the prevention of the illegal importation and exportation of goods.</P>
    <P>This is a very broad range indeed.  It is important to remember that these powers may be exercised over a very wide area, not just at ports and the main airports. For instance, the new powers may be exercised by customs officers in the vicinity of airports.  I understand that there are about 50 airstrips in the country.  Are these covered by the definition of airports? If they are there is almost nowhere in the country that is not adjacent to an airport.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise again that I do not oppose the powers being given to the customs officers.  What I do say is that we must try to ensure that those powers are balanced with obligations and responsibilities. There must be protection for the vast majority of law abiding citizens from unnecessary intrusion into their lives. Deputies will remember that when the Criminal Justice Act was going through the Dáil, there was such widespread concern at the additional powers being given <Col N="1292" /> to the Garda that it was agreed that most sections of the Bill would not come into operation until such time as regulations were published for the treatment of people in Garda custody and an independent complaints system was provided. In giving the customs officers the powers we are talking about in this Bill, which are similar in some respects to those of the Garda, they should be subject to the same type of constraints as the Garda in order to provide the protections I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>There are some other minor issues I would like to refer to before I conclude. There is the question of training of customs officers.  Are they to be trained in methods of arrest and detention? What will happen if suspects resist arrest? Are the customs officers to be trained to cope with these situations? I suggest that it would be desirable that, as a matter of policy, customs officers should be accompanied by Garda officers when they are making searches and arrests.</P>
    <P>I have not gone into any specific detail in relation to the sections of the Bill and I propose to do that on Committee Stage. I thank the House for their forbearance in listening to my points in relation to drug abuse in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these new measures giving customs officers power to search persons without warrant in the vicinity of any port, airport or land frontier and powers to search premises under warrant.  I welcome the fact that the Bill proposes to widen the powers of Customs and Excise officers to enable them to tackle drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>The escalation of hard drugs on the streets in the past ten years has caused grave concern to all law abiding citizens. The greatest fear of any parent, particularly in the cities, is that their children will become involved in drug taking.  I have known families in my own county where a daughter or son has become a drug addict, causing horrendous problems for the family and destroying the fabric of the families involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug barons and the faceless godfathers who bring drugs into this country <Col N="1293" /> and make available to the vulnerable young deserve no mercy from this House or the Ministers dealing with them. People caught trafficking in drugs should automatically be sentenced to life imprisonment which is no more than they deserve.</P>
    <P>In regard to the seizure of assets, we all know that some drug barons have built up massive amounts of money and property from the profits they make from selling drugs.  Those assets should be seized where it can be proved that they were accumulated because of involvement in drugs.  The Revenue Commissioners have a role to play here and should set up a special taskforce to examine the assets of known drug dealers and make them account for the building up of such assets over the years.</P>
    <P>The reason I am speaking on this today is because I live close to Rosslare port. It has been described by many as the gateway to Europe with one million passengers per year passing through that port. It is questionable if the present manpower at the port are capable of checking such large numbers of people and monitoring the traffic of illegal drugs coming through the port.  There is a problem there and the evidence is there to prove it.  In the past year £250,000 worth of cannabis was seized on two occasions and £300,000 worth of cannabis was found floating in the port for which no one has ever been brought to account.  This problem is serious and the customs people there are very worried about it.</P>
    <P>Introducing a Bill is one thing but if the Minister is genuine &mdash; and I believe he is &mdash; he will have to provide the national resources to implement it.  I have not been in this House too long but in the last number of years a number of Bills have been introduced by different Governments but the financial resources needed to implement them have never been made available.  At present Customs and Excise officers are working under the most archaic conditions without even the basic facilities needed for detention purposes.  One customs officer told me recently that the only equipment they have in Rosslare are a few spanners, <Col N="1294" /> a screwdriver and a hydraulic lift for looking under the cars.  That sort of equipment is very basic and inadequate to deal with the highly professional people trafficking in these goods.</P>
    <P>The customs people are operating against those who know every trick in the book, who are there to make massive profits and are using every illegal system to get drugs through the ports.  The Government must look at the whole area of equipment available at our ports.  At the moment we have only one customs drug dog, as far as I am aware, covering ports from Donegal to Rosslare.  I ask the Minister to ensure that at least a drug dog and handler are permanently based at Rosslare and other ports.  That is the least that can be made available to our customs officials who are trying to take on the drug barons and others.  In many cases when officials at Rosslare ask for this drug dog he is not available, being needed in some other part of the country. We cannot be serious about dealing with this problem if we allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I am being very parochial here in speaking about Rosslare, but it highlights the existing situation around the country. There are three officials there dealing with drugs on a part time basis at present, despite the fact that one million people come through that port.  There is need for a full-time drug unit liaising with other ports in the country, with the UK, Cherbourg and other ports from which ships travel to Rosslare.</P>
    <P>Intensive, ongoing training in drug detection and areas relating to different drugs is also obligatory in any new system which evolves as a result of this Bill.  Over the past four years nobody has gone for training from Rosslare.  The last person went to London five years ago, came back to Rosslare and within six months was transferred to Drogheda.  He has received an intensive training course in Heathrow in London that would enable him to deal with the problem of drug trafficking through Rosslare.  Perhaps he looked for a transfer, but it seems foolish to train a person in London using special training facilities, with the expense <Col N="1295" /> involved, and after a few months allow him to leave the port.  That is an area which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is need for scanners, night vision equipment and a small sea-going vessel for the customs people to operate.  In a seaport, particularly a seaside resort, in summertime numerous people come in their yachts and small boats from different countries to visit and spent their holidays here.  There are many strange yachts, often continental, that come to Rosslare and other ports about whose activities the customs people are sometimes suspicious but because they have no sea-going vessel available to them they have no way of checking what is on board. This area must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Radio contact is needed.  At present if a Customs and Excise official leaves a port, his only means of contact with that port is a public telephone kiosk or the telephone of some friendly neighbour. That there is no contact between the person on duty and his base is not good enough in this day and age.  Proper radio equipment should be available as in the case of the Garda Síochána and, indeed, some private business concerns.  Agricultural and haulage contractors have those basic requirements and here we have customs people trying to operate under such poor standards.</P>
    <P>Another area is manning levels.  For a Fianna Fáil Deputy to talk about increasing manning levels at the moment would be heresy, but there are areas where special concessions and special needs must be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I sincerely thank all the Deputies for their many varied, informed and positive contributions. I thank them for their very open and honest approach to this very important Bill and Second Stage.  I found their attitude, suggestions and contributions helpful and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I thank Deputy Noonan for his acceptance of the Bill in principle. I look forward to listening to him in Committee where I shall deal in detail with the points raised by him and respond to them.  In general terms, I would inform the Deputy that in certain respects, and of course it is his right, he is reading perhaps too much into the text of the Bill.  The definition of customs officer is <Col N="1297" /> taken from the Customs Act of 1956. The intention is that the powers will be exercised solely by the custom service. Similar powers of search already exist for the Garda Síochána under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill may look in certain areas to be wide ranging because in certain circumstances where the customs officers would be on duty and for any particular reason or by demand gardaí may have to be called, the intention is to ensure that the gardaí will have full power to deal with any given situation at any given time.  We want to extend those powers to include the gardaí while on duty there, or civil servants from Government Departments coming to take reports or present reports to customs officers so that, on delegation by a senior officer of the Customs and Excise they would be in a position to delegate powers and functions to any given servant or employee of the State at any time. However, we shall deal with that in Committee in much more detail.</P>
    <P>In relation to the definition of &ldquo;the vicinity&rdquo; of a port, airport or land frontier, careful consideration was given to the most appropriate term.  Indeed, in the Seanad we had much discussion on that point.  What is needed are powers of search of &ldquo;meeters and greeters&rdquo;, of people coming to ports and airports, to greet and welcome them, take them home or whatever.  The phrase &ldquo;in the vicinity&rdquo; meets this need.  We shall go into that matter again on Committee Stage but we have found over the years that customs officers have no power whatever to deal with &ldquo;meeters and greeters&rdquo; who accept parcels, packages or objects from visitors coming to our ports or airports.  Often these recipients transfer or carry drugs or whatever objects are being brought in.  This Bill covers those people who carry for further use or misuse such articles and we must include such terms.  I want to reassure the House that compulsory intimate searches are not intended under this Bill.  On Committee Stage I will deal further with Deputy Noonan's point about the terminology <Col N="1298" /> of the section.  Indeed, there was discussion on this point during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad where I accepted amendments to try to include so far as physically and humanly possible all the different constraints which may present themselves to customs officers in their searching of persons who may be carrying drugs or other objects into the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to access to personal files and the concern expressed about breaches of confidentiality, it is very difficult to balance the rights of the individual against the rights of the community and the needs of the State.  It is the Government's view that if customs officers are to carry out their duties effectively in regard to drug smuggling, access to documents is vitally essential.  I am satisfied that these powers will not be abused and, as I have said in my opening speech, that adequate safeguards exist.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 9 and the onus of proof let me say that the section's absence from the Bill would seriously militate against the effective enforcement of customs law in this area.  I will be happy to expand on the rationale for this section on Committee Stage.  Deputy Cullen referred to the possible evasion of VAT.I will be very happy to examine this matter and reply to him on Committee Stage if he wishes to raise it then or, alternatively, I can reply directly to him if he so wishes. I want to thank him for the very important point he has made.  I will be following up that point.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 3 and the role of peace commissioners which were referred to by both Deputies Noonan and Cullen let me say that the provisions of the section follow closely the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984.  However, this matter can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage but we are sticking as closely as we can to the relevant sections in the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984.</P>
    <P>I also found Deputy De Rossa's contribution of interest but a number of the points he raised are covered either in my opening speech or in what I have now said.  I welcome the fact that he does not <Col N="1299" /> oppose the powers now sought and I can assure him that they will not be abused. The Deputy also referred to constraints but I do not think the Garda complaints procedure should be extended to customs officers for a variety of reasons.  In general, Garda powers are much broader than those of the customs service.  There are adequate procedures to redress any abuse of power by the customs service. In the first instance, a person who has a complaint against an ordinary customs officer can raise it with a senior customs officer, then with the Revenue Commissioners and the Ombudsman or, alternatively, in the courts.  Therefore, there is adequate redress for anybody who has a complaint against any member of the State's staff in any section and particularly under this Bill which deals with the officers of the Custom and Excise service.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that very few complaints are made against the customs service and that, in particular, very few have been made to the Ombudsman.  I welcome Deputy Browne's contribution to the debate.  I listened with interest to the many points he made in regard to equipment and drug sniffing dogs.  He is well informed and is obviously in close touch with the position in Rosslare as I well know for other reasons.  I acknowledge the very open contribution he has made.  No matter what party one represents or what Government are in power I hope that no Member of the House will feel constrained from making the points which are relevant to ensuring that the best Bills possible and the most effective, strongest, and stringent laws are enacted in the best interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>At present I have to admit that the customs service have only one drug sniffing dog but the acquisition of other dogs is under consideration and I hope that we will be able to increase the number.  I am very anxious to ensure that the customs service have all the equipment they need but, unfortunately, the Exchequer's resources are severely constrained. We must provide the necessary modern technology and equipment and we must ensure that whatever meagre <Col N="1300" /> State resources are available for any section of Government are fully utilised. Above all, we have a duty as legislators to ensure that the most effective, efficient and stringent laws possible are put in place to ensure the maximum efficiency of the State's services in all areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to thank sincerely the Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to Committee Stage.  If the contributions of the Deputies today are anything to go by that Stage should be very interesting.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deputising for the Minister for Justice who is in the Seanad at present but who will be here shortly.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, to enable the court to grant a protection order as an alternative to, and separately from, a barring order.  At present, on an application under the 1981 Act, the only final decision which the court may come to is to grant or refuse a barring order.  While it may, pending a <Col N="1301" /> decision on the application, grant a protection order prohibiting the respondent spouse from using, or threatening to use, violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant spouse or a child, that order is of an interim nature only and ceases to have effect once the court comes to a decision on the barring order application.</P>
    <P>On the enactment of this Bill, therefore, it will be open to the court, on an application by a spouse, where it considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of that spouse or of a child so requires, to make a protection order in its own right, prohibiting the other spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, or molesting or putting in fear, the applicant spouse or the child.  Alternatively, the court may make a barring order, directing the respondent spouse to leave the family home, and prohibiting him or her from entering the home again before a specified date, or until further order.  Finally, the court may decide to make both a protection order and a barring order. In this event, the combined effect of both orders will be the same as that of a barring order made under the 1981 Act, which includes a prohibition on the use of violence, threatening behaviour etc. by the respondent spouse towards the applicant or a child, as provided for in section 2 (2) of that Act.  A protection order or a barring order, when made by the District Court, will expire after 12 months if not previously discharged.</P>
    <P>In empowering the court to grant a protection order independently of a barring order, the Bill will enable it to deal more flexibly with cases of domestic violence which come before it.  Because of the drastic nature of a barring order, which excludes the respondent spouse from the family home, it is understandable that a court may be reluctant to make an order except in particularly bad cases.  The grant of a barring order may on occasion lead to the complete estrangement of the spouses and put an end to any possibily of reconciliation between them.  On the other hand, if the court decides not to grant the order, the applicant spouse may, under the existing <Col N="1302" /> legislation, be left in a very difficult situation. Any interim protection order that may have been made pending the outcome of the proceedings will have expired, and the atmosphere in the home, in consequence of the court proceedings having been taken, may not be welcoming to say the least.  In such circumstances, it would seem that an ongoing protection order could serve as useful compromise measure.  While allowing the respondent spouse to remain in the family home, it would prohibit him &mdash; and, in the nature of things, the respondent is usually the husband &mdash; from using violence or threatening behaviour against the other spouse or a child of the family.  This prohibition would be reinforced by the power of arrest for breach of an order, provided for by section 7 of the Principal Act, leading on to the impostion of a penalty of a fine or imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>I might mention that this Bill was prepared in response to representations made by a number of interest groups concerned with family law reform, notably the AIM group, to the effect that a less drastic remedy should be available to victims of domestic violence, as an alternative to a full barring order.  The matter was examined in consultation with the various services involved, including the courts' administration, the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice, and solicitors attached to the Legal Aid Board.  There was general agreement that the law should be amended along the lines indicated.  The present Bill represents the outcome.  I should like to point out also that the Bill follows the commitment in the Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to amend the law to protect women against domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. The first five sections replace sections 1 to 5 of the 1981 Act with provisions of a similar nature, except that they empower the court to make a protection order separately from, and as an alternative to, a barring order.  It will also be open to the court, as I have already mentioned, to make both a protection order and a <Col N="1303" /> barring order, both running concurrently. Pending a decision on the application, the court will retain the power, as at present, to make a protection order as an interim protection measure, even where a summons has not yet been served on the respondent spouse, pending a final decision in the case.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are of a technical nature and do not call for comment at this stage.  I am proposing the Bill as a non-contentious measure and trust it will be welcomed by Deputies in that spirit.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House which is designed to implement certain changes in family law that are of some importance.  Currently a wife who is at risk of violence when she seeks a barring order in the courts may find she cannot establish to a judge's satisfaction that the allegations she is making against her husband are true.  The judge does not regard the evidence presented as sufficient to warrant making a barring order and there is no intermediate remedy the courts can provide for her protection.  This measure is designed to allow the courts to make a protection order as an alternative to a barring order when a wife seeks a barring order.  To that extent the Bill is welcome.  The protection order has been a mechanism available to the courts as an interim remedy.  When a wife seeks a barring order pending the hearing of the barring proceedings, in an emergency the District Court and the Circuit Court have been able to grant protection orders but they have not at the conclusion of the proceedings had the option to make a protection order instead of simply a District Court or Circuit Court barring order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a concern about this Bill which needs to be voiced and put on the record of this House.  Instead of assisting some wives as it is designed to do, the Bill could create difficulties.  We have a problem in the area of family law which I have referred to on many <Col N="1304" /> occasions in this House, and particularly in matrimonial law.  Currently the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court have varied jurisdictions in the area of family law.  It is possible at present for a wife to seek a barring order in the District Court, Circuit Court or High Court and in each of the court's systems different judges are hearing different family law cases.  The difficulty is a complete lack of uniformity of approach not only between the different courts but in the courts themselves, in deciding, for example, whether to make a barring order as matters stand under existing law and as they will be under the new Bill.  The court can make such an order if it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of a spouse or of any child requires that an order be made.</P>
    <P>Different judges have different views of what behaviour is sufficiently grave to warrant the making of a barring order. Some judges will regard behaviour as tolerable and bearable by a wife that other judges regard as intolerable and unbearable. A wife who is the victim of serious physical violence will generally get the benefit of a barring order.  However, a wife whose husband's behaviour is placing her under severe mental stress, placing her and the family at serious risk, making it impossible for a normal family life to be conducted and possibly posing a long-term threat to the psychological well-being of children, but which falls short of violence can find that the courts are not willing to investigate the effect his behaviour is having on her and the children and so do not provide her with the type of protection she needs.</P>
    <P>Some judges are of the view that unless there is serious violence a barring order should never be made.  Family circumstances of an appalling nature can arise when marriages break down, which I and many who work in the area of marriage breakdown believe can place at serious risk the welfare of the wife and children, but judges currently are loath to grant barring orders under such circumstances. The introduction of the protection order mechanism has the merit <Col N="1305" /> that where there are family difficulties but it is not warranted that the barring order be made, it allows the courts to provide some degree of legal protection for a wife at risk.  The worry is that judges who simply do not like to grant barring orders no matter what the family circumstances may when they have the power to make a long term protection order, instead of making barring orders nearly always resort to making protection orders.  The wife who has been the victim of serious violence, for example, might find a judge giving a very violent husband another chance in the home, leaving her living in the family home in fear of further violent attack at the hands of her husband. There is a need, which this legislation fulfils, to allow the courts to make a permanent protection order where a wife requires some protection but where the evidence before the court is not sufficient to warrant the making of a barring order.</P>
    <P>However, in cases today where the courts regard themselves as having sufficient evidence to make barring orders, upon the enactment of this Bill some judges may still give a violent husband, a second, third or fourth chance by making a protection order.  There is a need to get the balance right.  I am not saying that in the event of marriage breakdown a husband or wife should always be barred from the family home, but where there is a serious threat to the safety or welfare of a wife or children, whether posed by violent conduct by a husband or by other types of conduct, it is necessary that the powers to make a barring order be used by our courts.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the barring of a husband.  About 97 per cent of barring order applications are made by wives seeking protection from the violent behaviour of husbands, but in about 3 per cent of instances barring orders are sought by husbands seeking protection against the violent behaviour of wives. Our Judiciary tend to take it for granted that wives are generally the victims of violence and it can be extremely difficult for a husband who is a victim of violence and is being battered by his wife to convince <Col N="1306" /> a judge that this is actually happening. It can be extremely difficult for a husband in those circumstances to succeed in getting a barring order.  I am aware of individual cases where husbands have fled the home, taking the children with them, in circumstances where a wife subjected to violence would have stayed at home and got a barring order.  I am aware of such instances occurring across the mainstream of Irish society, from medical practitioners to corporation workers.  In seeking to provide for a uniformity of approach on the part of the courts there is a need for our judges to be open-minded to the possibility that in a minority of cases the husband is the subject of physical violence.</P>
    <P>This measure will in theory provide for equal treatment for husbands and wives in the obtaining of barring or protection orders.  This problem of lack of uniformity will never be resolved until such time as we have a unified and coherent family court structure.  This is another piece of legislation which will involve both the District Court and the Circuit Court, which will have concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction.  Different judges will be dealing with family matters at different court levels all bringing to bear their own subjective views and prejudices on the decision-making process. Until we have uniformity of approach within our courts there will always be some wives at risk of violence who will not get the protections to which they are entitled.  This will apply to some husbands also.</P>
    <P>People who seek assistance from the courts when marriages break down will be subject to a system of judicial roulette. If they strike lucky they may get the right judge who has a real understanding of the nature of the problems upon which he is adjudicating, but if they are unlucky they will get the wrong judge who has no real insight into these problems.  This is a particular problem in the context of protection and barring orders.  It is a particularly subjective judicial exercise to decide whether a protection order or a barring order should be granted.  It has been made a great deal more difficult by <Col N="1307" /> a judgment of the Supreme Court which has been wrongly interpreted by some members of the Judiciary as meaning that barring orders should never be made unless there has been an instance of violence. These are problems we must be aware of in this area.</P>
    <P>The mechanism to provide for the making of barring orders first came about with the enactment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  There is no doubt that barring orders have provided a very helpful and effective remedy by providing real protection against the violence imposed by a husband.  Nevertheless there are other problems.  The 1981 Act, which this Bill seeks to amend, extended powers to the Garda to arrest without warrant a husband who has broken a barring order or protection order.  Women's Aid, the organisation which has for many years provided a safe house for wives who are the victims of violence, have recently produced an excellent report detailing the difficulties suffered by a number of women who sought refuge in the hostel as a result of their husbands' violence. They also detail in the report some of the steps necessary to ensure that adequate protections are provided and that the barring order system can work effectively.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where a barring order has been made excluding a husband from a family home and he attempts to break the barring order by entering the home and assaulting his wife, the report indicates that the extent of the protection provided by barring orders in these circumstances is very often dependent on the efficiency of the gardaí in the local area where the wife is residing.  It can be dependent on the interest of the local inspector or superintendent in ensuring that his own gardaí are organised to respond effectively and provide help for wives at risk of violence.  The report of Women's Aid has suggested that there should be a code of Garda conduct regarding intervention by gardaí to provide protection for wives at risk of violence, particularly those wives who have <Col N="1308" /> already been afforded the protection of the courts by the making of a barring order.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the new Garda Commissioner to circulate official instructions to all Garda stations setting out a uniform code of practice to which all members of the Garda should adhere in the context of the enforcement of barring orders.  This is to ensure that the protections we seek to provide in this House are truly available on a uniform basis throughout the State.  It is not sufficient that the Judiciary apply the law uniformly; it is important that it is enforced uniformly.  The protection which can be afforded by the arrest without warrant of a spouse in breach of a barring order can be placed at serious risk by the failure of the Garda to respond.  The ability of the Garda to respond in such cases is dependent on the interest the local inspector or superintendent may show in this area and his concern to ensure that wives at risk of violence are properly protected.  It is as basic as that.  The ultimate responsibility may rest on the shoulders of the local station sergeant to ensure that barring orders are effective.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for calling for a code of conduct to be issued by the Garda Commissioner, setting out the procedures to be followed by the Garda in implementing the sections of the current Act and of the new Act dealing with barring orders.  First, it will draw to the attention of those in a command position in the various Garda districts the responsibility in regard to this.  There is not always a very clear view as to what are their responsibilities.  Secondly, it will impress upon the individual members of the Force what their own obligations are with regard to providing assistance for wives who have obtained barring orders in certain circumstances where their husbands are breaking such orders.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need for another reason.  There is no section of Irish society which is immune from the sadness of marital breakdown.  Equally, there is no section of Irish society which is immune <Col N="1309" /> from the tragedy and the horror of domestic violence.  The occurrence of domestic violence and vicious assaults on wives is not confined to any particular strata here.  Lawyers beat up their wives, doctors beat up their wives and, occasionally, politicians beat up their wives. County councillors, corporation dustmen and busmen beat up their wives.  In my experience in every part of Irish society there are some people who are either the victims or casualties of broken marriages or who are the perpetrators of violence within marriage.  The Garda are not immune from that.  There are members of the Force who have been barred by our courts for engaging in violence against their spouses.  I am aware of instances where that has occurred and those of us who have worked with the problem of marital breakdown in voluntary organisations or in a professional capacity as lawyers, social workers or doctors are aware of instances of that nature.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty because it is the Garda who are looked to by many wives who obtain barring orders to enforce those orders and provide them with protection. I have come across instances where gardaí who have been barred for assaulting their own wives have been sent to provide assistance for other wives who have been the victims of violence.  I have come across cases where members of the Force have been sent out to restrain another member of the Force who has been barred from trying to re-enter the home.  That creates very real difficulties. The demarcation line in the Garda between a person who perpetrates an offence and the possibility of arresting a colleague gets very confused.  There is a need for a strict code of conduct to be handed down on by the Garda Commissioner setting out to members of the Force exactly how they should exercise their powers to arrest without warrant under existing legislation and under the Bill before us where a spouse who has been barred, be it a husband or wife, breaks a barring order or a protection order.</P>
    <P>One of the great fears of many wives <Col N="1310" /> is that if they get a barring order and the husband arrives at the home in the middle of the night there will be nobody available to provide them with help if they call for it.  There is a need to reassure wives who are the victims of violence that barring orders work and can be effective.  In the great majority of cases barring orders are effective in providing protection for wives.  They are effective in having violent husbands put out of the family home. There is a need to reassure wives that if they obtain a barring order the powers conferred on the Garda to arrest without warrant will be truly exercised if the violent husband is in breach of the barring order.  I hope the new Garda Commissioner will look at this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the problems that Women's Aid speak about in the excellent report they published some weeks ago have been referred to by women's organisations in many countries. Similar reports have been produced in Canada by women's organisations in the context of the Canadian courts enforcing orders similar to barring orders.  There have been similar problems in England and in the United States.  It is noteworthy that in some of the police authorities in England the codes of conduct and practice which I would like to see applied here has already been brought into operation.  They have been seen to work, to build up the public's confidence and, in particular, the confidence of those who look to barring orders to provide them with protection and in the protection being real.  There has been a uniformity of approach by the police in responding to calls for help when barring orders are broken.</P>
    <P>A number of other problems arise in the context of barring orders and which apply equally in the context of protection orders.  If a District Court makes a barring order it will expire 12 months after the date it is made.  A barring order made by a Circuit Court can go on for a longer period.  If a husband is being violent the courts make a barring order under which the husband is excluded from the home.  From then on he is left alone and the law takes no further part in the life <Col N="1311" /> of that husband but 12 months later when the husband may return to the home he may have the same violent personality he had when he was barred 12 months earlier.  There is no provision in our legislation for any social work help, counselling or any assistance to be given not only to the wife who obtains the barring order but to the husband who was barred.</P>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown emphasised that where a husband was barred it was in the interests of his family, society and himself, that there should be provision for an effective service to provide counselling for him.  It is in the interest of the husband so that he will have an opportunity to come to terms with whatever personal difficulties he has.  It is in the interests of the wife so as to ensure that if the husband is to return to the home 12 months laters, or some time later, that he does not return as a person who seems to be threatening violence on her.  It is in the interests of the children of the couple because whether a husband is barred or not he still remains the parent of his children and will continue to have contact with them.  Any personal difficulties or problems the husband has which have given rise to him responding in a violent way to his wife could create equal difficulties for the children.</P>
    <P>At present we bar husbands and wash our hands of them.  We leave them to return to the family home 12 months after the barring order has been made, as in the case of a District Court order, like a smouldering Exocet waiting to explode in a night of violence.  Some wives find themselves in the position of having to move out of the house in such circumstances. There is an absolute necessity to have the probation and welfare service available in the absence of statutory provisions to provide for counselling for barred husbands or husbands against whom a protection may have been made. In the absence of some form of counselling provided by way of statute and in the absence of a family court structure with a full back-up service, there is a need to utilise the probation and welfare <Col N="1312" /> service so that welfare officers who have experience in dealing with marital breakdown problems can make contact with the husband who has been barred to ascertain if he is willing or interested in co-operating in a form of support counselling following the making of a barring order.  There is a need to involve agencies and not to leave that husband as someone abandoned, who is shut out from his home yet still maintaining some sort of unspecified contact with his children.  It is possible he will be full of resentment because he has been put out of his home and he may return 12 months later with an even more violent personality than he had at the time the barring order was made.  There is a real problem in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not want the message to go from the House that barring orders are only in force for 12 months.  A person who can afford to go to the Circuit Court or who can get assistance from one of the Government law centres to go to the Circuit Court may get a barring order that will remain in force permanently. Many permanent barring orders have been granted but a vast number of orders are granted by the District Court.  This is where we have another problem, and it is a problem Women's Aid referred to, as did the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It is a problem which in a sense is repeated in this Bill because this Bill falls down in one very important respect.</P>
    <P>In the context of obtaining a barring order or protection order the provisions of this Bill provide for the expiration of such orders 12 months after they have been made.  At the moment a barring order lasts 12 months and the wife can go back to court and look for an order for a further 12 months.  When that expires, in theory, she can go back again.  The difficulty is that there are two different judicial approaches used in these circumstances. Where a wife seeks to have a barring order which has been in force for 12 months renewed she may or may not succeed depending on the justice, no matter how serious the violence which originally gave rise to the barring order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> Some district justices take the view that if a barring order has been made, if the husband has stayed away from the family home and behaved himself for 12 months, and if the wife seeks to renew the order, no matter how horrific the assaults of the husband on the wife were before the barring order was made, the order will not be renewed.  Some district justices take the view that the order will only be renewed if the husband has broken the barring order or if there has been a violent or threatening incident during that 12 month period.  Other district justices take a different view.  They take the view that if the original barring order was granted because violence was particularly bad and if the wife comes back after 12 months and says she is truly afraid of her husband and could not possibly live with him, and that even though he has behaved himself for 12 months she believes he will be violent again, they will grant a barring order.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to where I started 20 minutes ago, that is, the lack of a uniformity of approach on the part of the Judiciary.  It means that some wives get better protection from the courts than others, and whether they can have the barring order renewed for another 12 months will depend on the game of judicial roulette and which district justice sits on the day their cases are heard.  That is a very real problem.  I would like to see on Committee Stage some provisions setting out the criteria that should be applicable in the context of the courts, and the district courts in particular, deciding whether to renew a barring order, because at present this is left totally to the justices' discretion.  There is no real guidance in this legislation as to how a district justice should determine an application to renew a barring order. There is a very real need to set out the specific criteria which should apply in these circumstances so that the varied, differing and contradictory approaches which take place in our courts are brought to an end and a uniform approach to the renewal of barring orders at District Court level comes into being.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in the area <Col N="1314" /> of barring orders which should be mentioned. This, too, was referred to by the Oireachtas joint committee.  When a barring order is made, effectively a husband is barred from the home.  When the barring order is sought the wife may bring other court proceedings.  She may be looking for maintenance for her support and she may bring custody proceedings with regard to children.  If she does so, the husband, if barred, may look for an order for access to his children.</P>
    <P>There are many cases where wives simply seek protection orders or barring orders, as they will be under this Bill. They do not bring proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  The children are living with them and there is no dispute about custody although they may bring a maintenance application at the same time.  The district justice hears the case, and grants the barring order.</P>
    <P>There can then be a difficulty when young children find one of their parents has been excluded from the family home.  It is one of the curiosities of family difficulties that a husband who is barred from the home for being violent may have a very good relationship with his children.  The husband who is behaving in an appalling way towards his wife may not only have a good relationship with his children, but the children may have a very good relationship with him, and the wife may say that the husband has a very good relationship with his children although he behaves very badly towards her.  Unless this husband brings his own court proceedings when the barring order is made, he can be excluded from having excess to his children.  Separate additional court proceedings have to be brought if he wishes access to them.</P>
    <P>It would make sense to put a provision in this Bill saying that when making a barring order the District Court should have jurisdiction to make orders granting the spouse, against whom the barring orders is made, access to his children, such as the orders which can be made under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1954 without the necessity of instituting additional proceedings.  Under existing legislation a barring order can be <Col N="1315" /> subject to conditions.  It is arguable that in making a barring order at present a district justice could use the fact that it can be subject to conditions to insert as one of those conditions the access arrangement but, in practice, district justices do not do that.  While that is possibly a theoretical legal interpretation of the measure, I think there should be an explicit provision in this Bill conferring powers on the courts when making barring orders, where it is in the interests of the children, to also make access orders.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have regard to some of the comments I have made with a view to bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I ask him to respond to my suggestion that the Garda commissioner provide a uniform code of practice for the Garda with regard to the enforcement of barring orders and protection orders.  In my view, it would be a proper function of the Minister to write to the commissioner asking that such a code be prepared and perhaps the Minister would report to us on Committee Stage and tell us the response he has received from the commissioner to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister indicate what his current position is with regard to some of the other major reforms of family law that are recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown? That committee said the possibility of making permanent protection orders should be provided and this Bill is a response to one small part of their recommendations.  It is becoming increasingly urgent that we provide a comprehensive system of family courts with judiciary properly trained to deal with family law matters having the necessary back-up services to assist them in reaching decisions arising out of very difficult and heart-rending disputes which occur when marriages break down.  The current court system and court structure are grossly inadequate to provide the type of family law system that those who look to our courts for help when marital difficulties occur are entitled to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> The manner in which we deal with family law matters would be inadequate in the context of an objective at any level. In the context of the special position given to the family under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, of the outpouring of concern from the Fianna Fáil Party about the family, family life and marital breakdown during the course of the divorce referendum, one would expect the Government and the Minister to bring expeditiously before this House legislation to provide a comprehensive system of family courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter will appreciate that while he can make a case for the present proposed legislation, he is not entitled to range too far on the need for other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. However, it would be expected that such proposals should be brought forward and this Bill indicates the need to do so.  It is completely illogical to have a family law system where in one court you can get a barring order for 12 months but in another you can get a permanent barring order.  If you go to the Circuit Court it will cost a great deal more than the District Court.  Those who have sufficient money can get greater protection under this Bill and the current law than those who are poor and cannot afford legal fees.  They may be at the risk of violence in a marriage and they must go to the District Court.  Those at risk of violence in a marriage who have sufficient money go to the Circuit Court to look for permanent protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course those who are in financial difficulties can also go to the Government law centres but they may have to wait three, five or six months before they even get into one because the solicitors are overworked and understaffed.  The reality is that a wife who is being battered cannot wait in a long line of clients at law centres for six, eight or ten weeks to get an appointment.  People also cannot wait until their local law centre can cope with the work it already has.  This Bill, in microcosm, shows how we have one law <Col N="1317" /> for the poor and another for the rich in the area of family law.  Until we have a unified system of family courts, we will not solve that problem.</P>
    <P>It was most disappointing in response to a Dáil question which the Minister for Justice gave last June in regard to family courts, that it appeared quite clear there is no intention on the part of the Government to provide a family court during their lifetime.  I hope I am wrong.  If so, the Minister might tell me whether legislation to provide family courts is being prepared in his Department and, if so, when it will be published and come into operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements one very small aspect of the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  In some ways, the Bill will certainly provide additional protection for wives but in other ways one is worried as to how the Judiciary will approach it. One is also worried &mdash; although I know this is not the Minister's intention and I would not impute it to him &mdash; that in seeking to provide additional protection it could, in some ways, remove protections by district justices resorting to making protection orders in circumstances where at present they make barring orders.  It is important that Members of the House voice that concern if for no other reason than to seek to highlight this as a worry in the hope that our Judiciary will take note of it and that they will not react to the Bill in the way to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, between now and Committee Stage, will respond to some of the points I made although I appreciate he may not be able to do so at the end of Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly welcome the Bill which basically amends the law relating to barring orders and the protection of spouses and children from assaults by the other spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law was first introduced by means of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, and the use of that Act has become increasingly frequent over the past number of years.  It provides two methods of protection for a spouse, a protection order and a barring order.  The protection order is applied for in the District Court and is known as an <i>ex parte</i> application, that is, where only one party to the proceedings, i.e. the spouse who is bringing the application, is represented, It is a holding order which says that the defending spouse should not interfere with, molest or assault the applicant spouse pending the hearing of <Col N="1319" /> an application for a barring order directing the defending spouse to leave the family home.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of further clarity, I will refer to husband and wife, assuming that the wife is the one who is being assaulted and making the application to the court, as is generally the rule.  The wife, when she has made up her mind to bring an applicatin to the court for a barring order to put her husband out of the house because of an assault on her, will then apply to the earliest court available for a protection order which is then served on the husband.  It is a criminal offence for the husband to assault or interfere with the wife in breach of the protection order although he is still living under the same roof.</P>
    <P>There are many instances of breaches of protection orders.  What happens is that the protection order is served on the husband and on the local Garda station. If there is a breach of the order the Garda will then arrest the husband and charge him with the offence.  In most cases the husband, having being charged with the offence, is then released on Garda bail pending the hearing of the case.  Alternatively, he arrives in court the following morning and is released on bail by the court.  This situation has given rise to a great deal of difficulty where husbands who have been arrested and charged come home, sometimes the same night and certainly within 24 hours, and cause additional trouble in the household.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the District Court should be given power in making a protection order to include in that order, as a temporary measure, a temporary barring order directing the husband to leave the family home and not to reside therein until the matter has been finally heard and determined by the court.  This would give power to the District Court in the case of a serious assault to make an immediate protection order, the breach of which would be a criminal offence and in making that order to direct the husband to leave the family home until the application for the barring order has been fully <Col N="1320" /> heard and determined.  For this purpose the Bill would need to be amended by adding to section 2(1) a further definition under the definition of barring order. This addition would be as follows: temporary barring order means an order under the provisions of section 3(2) of this Act.  There could be an amendment to section 3(2) by the addition after the words &ldquo;served on the respondent spouse&rdquo; at the end of the subsection, of the following &ldquo;and the court, if it is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of the applicant's spouse or of any child so requires, may if it so thinks proper make an addition to a protection order, an order in this Act referred to as a temporary barring order directing the respondent spouse if residing in a place where the applicant spouse or child resides to leave that place and whether the respondent spouse is or is not residing at that place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is from a consultancy study commissioned by the interim local radio commission in 1986 which estimated the amount of advertising revenue going to <Col N="1325" /> the illegal radio stations.  It was their estimate that I gave to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he favours a liberalisation of the supply of all telephone terminal equipment and value added services; if he favours the retention of a Telecom monopoly in any part of these areas; and if so, where.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means by liberalisation that terminal equipment can be supplied without restriction by those holding licences under the Postal and Telecommunications services Act, 1983.  The supply of telephone terminal equipment is virtually fully liberalised.  Telephone terminal equipment, including telephones for the EIRCELL cellular radio system and extensions for connection to a private automatic branch exchange, may be supplied by licensees.  The only equipment not fully liberalised are other types of telephone sets and BTE have an exclusive licence to supply these.</P>
      <P>In regard to the supply of value added services this is a rather complex question which is currently being studied in my Department.  While it is likely that competitive supply of some such services will be permitted it is too early yet to say how the provision of these services will be regulated.</P>
      <P>In deciding on future licensing policy in relation to the supply of telephone sets and on the regulatory regime for the provision of value added services my aim will be to ensure that any monopoly role given to Telecom Éireann will be no more extensive than is required in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will consider a proposal from RTE to collect its own licence fees; if such a proposal were more efficient than the present arrangement and cost less than the £5.3 million it is proposed to pay An Post next year for providing this service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern as Minister for Communications is to ensure that the maximum number of television households are correctly licensed and that the work of collecting television licence fees is carried out in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In May 1986 RTE submitted a proposal to have television licence collection work transferred to it. Collection costs in the RTE proposal was £4.0 million at 1986 prices whereas the collection costs for An Post was £4.4 million. Having considered the application, An Post were given 12 months during which their performance on the work would be reviewed.  In that connection I am glad to say that An Post has reached <Col N="1330" /> a very difficult target of television licence sales for the 12 months ended 30 September 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, because RTE benefit directly from the proceeds of licence fees, they might be better motivated to collect such fees themselves and that the rate of unlicensed sets might diminish if RTE were allowed collect these fees themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors to be taken into account here. First, An Post are doing an excellent job.  They have computerised their whole system and, on 30 September last, for the first time ever they reached the target agreed between RTE and An Post, of 795,000 licence fees actually collected.  A proposal to take the collection franchise from An Post would involve the loss of approximately 120 jobs in An Post, or 120 people being made redundant.  The trade union movement in An Post have been lobbying strongly in regard to the work they are doing.  I am conscious of their representations.  I set targets for them and told them at a meeting earlier this year they would have to meet the targets laid down for them.  They have achieved those targets and deserve credit for so doing.  Indeed I have already complimented them on that account.  The fact that they have achieved that target will be taken into account in arriving at the final decisions following the 12 months trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of overall television sets in the country does the agreed target represent?  When is it proposed to make a final decision on the matter of another agency collecting these fees?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, An Post were given a 12-months trial period and that period will conclude around April of next year.  However, I am very satisfied with their work so far on reaching the agreed target of 795,000.  I have not got the exact figure.</P>

      <P>In 1985 the former Minister for Communications, as part of a package of measures in regard to local radio, introduced the Wireless and Telegraphy Act which proposed to increase substantially the fines for people who do not pay their licences.  That will be reintroduced tomorrow in the Sound Broadcasting Bill.  The inadequacy of the fine is part of the reason people have not been paying the licence.  In relation to the resources of An Post, with their network of post offices around the country and their intimate knowledge of individuals they have a special facility for collecting these licence fees.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications in respect of each application to increase a charge for telephone services under section 90 (2) of the 1983 Telecommunications Act or previous similar enactment, the scientific, social and accounting basis upon which Telecom Éireann calculated the scales of telephone charges; whether in respect of <Col N="1332" /> each such application the company supplied him with information regarding any cross-subsidisation by business or domestic users, by international or local callers, or by any other category and, if so, the nature of the information; and the way in which the present scale of charges in each category compares with those in each other EC country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tariff principles for telecommunications services have developed historically out of a complex trade-off between commercial considerations and universal service goals rather than in response to articulated scientific, social and accounting bases.</P>
      <P>Two applications for increases in charges have been considered since the passing of the 1983 Act and these were evaluated against the requirement placed by the Act on the company to keep its charges for services at the minimum rate consistent with meeting approved financial targets and to ensure that the revenue of the company is sufficient to meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account, generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs, remunerate capital and repay borrowings.</P>
      <P>So far as cross-subsidisation is concerned, the legislation setting up Bord Telecom Éireann acknowledges, in granting its exclusive privilege for providing telecommunications messages within the State, that a viable national telecommunications system involves subsidisation of some loss-making services by profit-making services.  It is clear, therefore, that any uniform structure of telecommunications charges must involve complex systems of cross subsidisation.</P>
      <P>Because of the variation and complexity of pricing structures, and leaving aside altogether currency exchange considerations and problems of purchasing power parities, a comparison of telephone charges between different countries is seldom straightforward.  However I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing a comparison of telephone charges in the various EC countries.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister circulate details of the cross-subsidisation of the different categories of user in the present tariff structure?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech of 20 October 1987 made on the occasion of the Power of the Press Advertising Awards in which I indicated that I had established formal ongoing contact between representatives of the print media and RTE to deal with matters of mutual concern with respect to advertising market share.  My role was solely that of an intermediary aimed at creating a formalised liaison between the interested parties.  The terms of any agreement which may arise is a matter to be worked out by the parties themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on what he had in mind when he suggested that statutory action might be taken if agreement was not reached? Does he feel his proposals for commercial radio and television will affect the agreement towards which he was urging the parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the arrival of a legal régime for radio in this country and the considerations of an independent television, if that is so decided, will have an effect.  The print media have a very special role in our lives, in the information they supply to the general public.  They have a very complementary role to the electronic media.  I would not like to see the balance between the amount of advertising the print media receive and that received by the electronic media going so far out of kilter that it could damage the future of the print media. As far as the legislative proposals are concerned, proposals were made in Holland in regard to relationships between the electronic and the print media. However, I do not see myself or the Government going down that road of regulation of advertising.  That should be <Col N="1336" /> left to the commercial world but I would like to see a balance.  The meetings that have already taken place between RTE and the national newspapers in Ireland have already resulted in some successes. For example, there has been an alteration in the type of promotional programmes that were done.  We have the example of a car being given as a prize to a particular programme and that, in turn, was an advertisment of the car or holiday or whatever.  That practice has now been stopped, and rightly so, and that arose out of the discussions between the newspapers and RTE.  That is the type of tidying up I want to see happening.</P>

Is it not so that one of the problems in television advertising from outside the State, notably that on Independent television, and that this is something that must also be taken into the reckoning with the tax regime of newspapers?

      <P>The comment made in <i>The Irish Times</i> report that he would be well aware of the intense approaches and the amount of work that is going on to find a proper use for the Whiddy terminal and the extension of Whitegate is a matter on which all the Fianna Fáil representatives in that area have been pressing the members of this Government and particularly me as Minister responsible, and in the light of that continuous pressure this response by the Deputy concerned was made.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that Whiddy and Whitegate are of more than local importance and that they are of major strategic national interest.  We understand that the negotiations have been underway for at least six or seven months.  Could the Minister give some indication of when he would expect negotiations to reach some stage of conclusion, indicating either that it is feasible or might not be going ahead. Is it likely to go on throughout the year or does the Minister regard it of some urgency to bring it to a conclusion?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter of great urgency and is receiving careful attention on a daily basis.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the present position regarding the building of a briquette factory at Ballyforan, County Roscommon; the cost of <Col N="1346" /> site development for the briquette factory; if any of the fixed fittings which were provided on the site have been sold recently; the cost of purchase of same; and the reasons for which they were sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals at present before me for the building of a briquette factory at Ballyforan.  In 1984, Bord na Móna evaluated the solid fuel market and concluded that the output from Ballyforan could not be absorbed at an economic price.  Having considered the serious implications which additional borrowings would place on the board's operations, they decided to defer this project.</P>
      <P>The board reviewed this decision in 1985 and again concluded that the project should continue to be deferred.  The board's financial position has since weakened as a result of two bad production harvests in 1985 and 1986.</P>
      <P>The cost of the site development for the proposed factory was £1.2 million. As no fixed fittings other than poles for floodlighting were placed on the site, the question of sales therefrom does not arise.</P>
      <P>There is not at this time a prospect of early revival of the project.  The possibility of sale of machinery for which there is no foreseeable use cannot be ruled out, but no decision on this has yet been taken by the board.  The development expenditures on the complex of bogs have, of course, enabled production of milled peat to take place and this is being absorbed by the ESB.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Government are taking every possible action to seek the closure of Sellafield. We see this as the only answer to lack of confidence in the safety of the plant and to the continuing discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.  In April this year I wrote to the then UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Peter Walker, MP, calling for the elimination of discharges from Sellafield and its closure as soon as possible.  The NEB had advised me that the four nuclear reactors at Calder Hall, which are located within the Sellafield complex, are on average 30 years old; that they do not have secondary containment systems and that the reactors fall appreciably short of modern safety standards.  Consequently, I expressed concern about the safety of UK reactors, especially the old Magnox reactors which were not designed to meet modern safety standards and which have now surpassed their original operational life expectancy.  I requested that such reactors, particularly those at Calder Hall and Chapel Cross, be phased out.  I repeated these calls at my meeting with Mr. Parkinson on 16 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have established close ties with the Isle of Man Government which shares many of our concerns about the UK nuclear industry, particularly Sellafield. On 25 September last, I met with the Isle of Man Chief Minister and also their <Col N="1355" /> Minister for the Environment.  We agreed to co-operate in every way possible on these matters.  Gwynedd County Council in Wales have similar concerns. A delegation from the county council were met by officials of my Department on 9 November last.  It was agreed that contacts would be established on matters of mutual concern.</P>
    <P>Prior to the meeting of the Paris Commission last June, I carried out an intensive international lobbying campaign for the closure of Sellafield and for support for our recommendation for its closure, which we had submitted to the Paris Convention. At a ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency on 11 May, I sought support for our position from most of the Ministers representing countries which are party to the Paris Convention. I also had meetings with ambassadors of the Nordic countries seeking their support.  While agreement on our recommendation for the closure of Sellafield could not be reached at the Paris Commission meeting, considerable support and sympathy for our position was expressed.  I intend to pursue this issue again at next year's meeting of the commission and I will continue my lobbying campaign towards this end.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to radioactive discharges, significant progress was made at this year's meeting of the Paris Commission. A recommendation which I tabled, concerning the application of the best available technology to minimise and to eliminate, as soon as possible, any pollution caused by radioactive discharges into the marine environment, was adopted by the commission.  On the basis of another Irish proposal it was agreed to establish a provisional system for the reporting of unplanned discharges from nuclear installations.  Ireland, acting as a lead country, undertook to examine this system to see if it could be improved.</P>
    <P>The proposal of British Nuclear Fuels to construct caverns under the Irish Sea for the storage of nuclear waste is completely repugnant to the Government.  At my recent meeting with Mr. Parkinson, I stressed the total opposition of the Irish <Col N="1356" /> Government and people to this proposal and I called on Mr. Parkinson to prevent British Nuclear Fuels from proceeding with it.  Although this is just one of the options being considered in the UK, I emphasised to Mr. Parkinson that I intended to raise the issue at every available forum including the EC and the London Dumping Convention.</P>
    <P>The Government are also opposed to any expansion of the UK's nuclear industry which could cause a further threat to the health and safety of the Irish people. I have made this clear to the UK Government both in my letter to Mr. Walker and also at my meeting with Mr. Parkinson when I requested that any proposed new nuclear plants along Britain's west coast should not be built.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to continue their campaign on issues of nuclear safety, to seek the closure of plants which are considered to pose a danger to the health and safety of people in this country and the discontinuance of the idea of constructing caverns for the storage of nuclear waste under the Irish sea.  If we fail to achieve our objectives through bilateral and international discussions, I will review all other possible courses of action to pursue our legitimate demands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 18, would the Minister not agree that it would be preferable that nuclear waste should always be stored as far as possible on the site where it originates? What are his views on the storage of nuclear waste in undersea caverns?  He has said that he is against that because if it is stored in an undersea cavern the danger is that it is not recoverable.  It will remain radioactive for thousands of years and we have no way of ensuring in an undersea storage system that it would be recoverable and capable of being dealt with or neutralised in the event of something happening in the distant future. Consequently, will he continue to exercise pressure to ensure that no such storage proposal will get off the ground or come into being?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one of the concerns in regard to the recoverable aspect.  I am also concerned about further pollution of the sea.  Leaving aside the recoverability in the event of any incident, the very existence of the undersea store could contaminate our seas further. The Deputy can be assured that I will use every available opportunity to lobby against this proposal.  I have had discussions in the last fortnight with Mr. Clinton Davis, EC Commissioner for environmental issues and I lobbied there again for an EC inspectorate and brought to his attention the proposals of the UK Government.  I raised the matter again at a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen recently and expressed the concern of the Irish Government at this proposal.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that no opportunity will be lost and we will avail ourselves of every possible opportunity in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now apparent that the British authorities consider the Irish Sea their entire domain and central to their plans for waste and sewage disposal. In view of the rather poor response the Irish Government have had from the Paris Commission and endorsing the Government's position with regard to finding the British attitude to the Irish Sea and the dumping of waste there completely repugnant, would the Minister consider it appropriate for us to commence proceedings before the European Court of Justice under the provisions of EURATOM as being the only effective way we will ever get the British Government to respond to any of our demands regarding the use of the Irish Sea as a wastage disposal area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy said in regard to our lack of success.  We succeeded for the first time ever in having a resolution passed.  The best available technology had to be used in these plants at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the response of the British Government, I will continue to lobby them.  With regard to alternatives and legal action, the Deputy may not be <Col N="1358" /> aware that the Government recently decided to associate themselves with Luxembourg in a case they are taking against the French in relation to discharges from a new plant being built on the Luxembourg border.  This is the first time the Government have taken this sort of initiative.  Therefore, I would not close off the possibility of further legal action. I do not want to say at this stage that we will take that road immediately.  We have already linked ourselves to one European case on this which is further advance than if we were ourselves to start at this stage on a case.  We hope that we will get some results from that Luxembourg case.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister join with the Nordic countries in seeking to extend the North Sea Conference to cover the Irish Sea with a view to extending the management programme for the North Sea to the Irish Sea?  Much of the waste discharged travels through the atmosphere and the sea itself into the Nordic domain and they are concerned to have some say.  Will the Minister join and support them in their case in that?</P>

      <P>I have already had negotiations with the Nordic Ambassadors on <Col N="1359" /> this.  The Deputy can be assured of my continued interest in the possibilities of formally associating with them in relation to their North Sea case.  On the flow of water through the Irish Sea much of the pollution from Sellafield and other places ends up in the North Sea.  We are conscious of the potential of involvement with the Nordic countries in this area. For example, the Icelanders have been particularly supportive of us in our battle on Sellafield and we are conscious of their support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the actions taken so far by the Government in relation to the call for the closure of Sellafield have not been effective?  He has outlined various courses of action which have been taken, but obviously they have not resulted in the closure of Sellafield or anything near to that.  I ask him to consider other forms of action that are available to him of which he has not availed.  Those four courses of action are in the legal area. Deputy McCartan referred to one of them under the EURATOM Treaty under Articles 37 and 38 under which the Minister has available a process whereby he can apply for directives to be imposed on plants such as Sellafield to control the level of radioactivity which emanates from such plants.  We have never sought for such directives to be applied.  If directives are handed down and are ignored, we have the automatic facility of bringing the offenders before the European Court <Col N="1360" /> and forcing them to comply with a directive requiring the operators of the plant to set minimum standards for radioactive waste.  Why does the Minister not proceed along those lines, given that his actions to date, while they are worthwhile in themselves, have not achieved positive results?</P>

      <P>I raised with the Commissioner for Energy and twice with the Commissioner for the Environment, as recently as ten days ago, the question of the Commission bringing forward the type of proposals the Deputy is speaking about under the Euratom Treaty.  I want to see an inspectorate which will monitor the operations of and emissions from these plants on a proper basis, rather than depending on the health and safety operations in various countries.  Every possible action at European level is being taken.  The Government have also taken court action.  A case is already proceeding at the European Court on the question of emissions from nuclear plants.  This is the Luxembourg <i>v.</i> France case.  Because it is so far advanced we have decided to associate ourselves with the Luxembourg case.  This is the quickest means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether he views the present procedure used by the ESB for providing for depreciation charges and amortisation as satisfactory; and the impact he foresees that these practices will have on the future trend of electricity prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB charge depreciation on their assets at different rates in accordance with accepted accounting conventions.  The details of these are given fully in the notes to the accounts of the Board.  In regard to amortisation, the ESB have for a long number of years, followed the practice of making extra provisions (additional to depreciation) in the form of an amortisation fund to ensure that they will be in a position to meet their heavy loan repayment commitments as these fall due.  Again, details of these are given in the accounts.  These are satisfactory and prudent arrangements and it is not seen that they will, of themselves, cause any notable change in the medium-term trend of electricity prices.  Any such changes in <Col N="1362" /> electricity prices would be more influenced by labour and fuel costs.  In the report of the inquiry into electricity prices, under the chairmanship of Mr. E.L. Jakobsen, a recommendation was made that both the amortisation and depreciation charges should be replaced by an inflation adjusted depreciation charge together with a specific growth related capital fund.  Action has not so far been taken on this recommendation which, however, appears to relate to clarity rather than a change in substance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question on the latter matter, I will be delighted to answer it.  The Deputy is aware that amortization is directly related to outstanding borrowings and will decrease as the debt falls.  It is not a question of being satisfied or otherwise. This is something which is specific to the ESB and relates to the 1927 Act.  The report's recommendation was aimed at making the ESB's provision for capital expenditure more transparent.  There was no suggestion in that report that the ESB were overproviding for capital expenditure by their present procedures. It is important to remember that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Workers' Party recognise that it is an important though small amendment to the whole armoury of the development of law for the protection of the family, spouses and children beleaguered by matrimonial strife and difficulties. However, I must pass a number of comments in the context of the Bill and of some perceptions abroad as to the possible effect of its provisions.  Many commentators, and those concerned directly in the area of this law, are concerned that it will be seen abroad, particularly within judicial circles, as an endorsement of a trend by the Legislature of a view that the barring order has been somewhat too punitive or onerous a provision in dealing <Col N="1402" /> with matrimonial strife in the past. The Minister, in the opening speech delivered on his behalf, used the word &ldquo;drastic&rdquo; when referring to the issuing of a barring order.  We want to emphasise clearly that if and whenever a barring order is made, drastic though it may be, it is in response to a very drastic and unhappy situation.  The message must go out from the House that we have full confidence in the barring order procedure and in the competency of any of our courts to make such an order when the judge or justice thinks it proper.  There is no doubt that the introduction of the judicial process of issuing a barring order for the protection of a beleaguered spouse or family has been an incredible safeguard and an important development in our law to protect vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the Bill was a response to a promise made in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto issued last February.  I am glad to see that some members of the Government remember that document and that some promises in it are seeing the light of day in legislative action.  However, it will be of concern to me if the Bill will be the only response to the promise contained in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. In time it may prove to be too small a proposal.  There is no doubt that in dealing with the whole area of the protection of spouses, and the barring of spouses from the home in the case of strife we should seize the opportunity to expand, develop and improve the law. The Bill should be used to expand the areas of protection to spouses and the expulsion of bullying spouses from the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From statistics it appears that courts are developing in a retrograde way, that they are moving back from the original intention in the granting of a barring order when first introduced into our law in 1976.  Statistics for the years 1983 to 1985 indicate that our courts are becoming more reluctant to act in issuing barring orders.  It is said that that was immediately consequent on the ruling of the Supreme Court in the O'B <i>v.</i> O'B case delivered in June 1983.  It appears <Col N="1403" /> that the courts are taking a more narrow or more conservative stance on the issuing of barring orders.  In 1983 in the Dublin metropolitan area 1,697 application were made for such orders and of that number 848 were granted.  However, in 1985, after the O'B <i>v.</i> O'B ruling, 1,856 applications were made but only 516 were granted.  That trend developed further in the following year, the last year for which we have full figures, when 1,927 applications were made and only 440 were granted.</P>
    <P>It appears that upwards of 1,500 applications made by spouses who were in positions of difficulty and vulnerability were not either pursued because of the high onus of proof required or were not sympathetically entertained primarily because of the restrictive definition given by the courts in the wake of the O'B. <i>v.</i> O'B decision.  I bow to the better views of Deputy Shatter and Senator Robinson that it was a misconstruction of the intention of the O'B. <i>v.</i> O'B. judgment, namely, that there would be need for proof of physical violence, or the threat of it, before a court should or would act in the issuing of a barring order. The intention in bringing in the Bill is not to endorse that narrow attitude and not to say that, recognising the restrictive nature of the grounds on which a barring order can be issued, there will be available in the alternative the issuing of a protection order of an interim, premanent or semi-permanent nature.</P>
    <P>We need to re-establish our confirmation of the importance of the barring order as a necessary, though unfortunate, weapon in the campaign to put down bullying spouses in the matrimonial home.  We should use the Bill to extend, as widely as possible, the application of the law in this area and there are a number of areas that we should consider widening.  First, we should consider widening the grounds on which a barring order, or a protection order, can be made.  It is important to re-establish the original conception of the 1976 legislation, that it should involve physical and mental injury or damage to the spouse or <Col N="1404" /> child.  If nothing more we should use this opportunity to reaffirm the view of the House which is contrary to the perceived or misunderstood interpretation of the O'B judgment.  Secondly, the scope for making orders against those persons should be extended.  For example, we should not confine ourselves to the spouse definition.  It is clear, particularly in the area of sexual abuse, that we are dealing with people who are not necessarily the spouse but often a brother, an uncle, or another person living on the premises.  In my view it is desirable to make it possible to issue a barring order against persons living outside the marriage or who are cohabiting or sharing a dwelling.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose and draft of the legislation is to protect, and the extent to which children and adults can be the victims of abuse or violence and threats of abuse or violence should be recognised, irrespective of whether the adults are married.  I hope the Minister will consider extending beyond the definition of spouse the definition of persons who are entitled to seek order and against whom orders can be made.</P>
    <P>Another important area in which the scope and concept of the availability of the barring order must be developed is to concerned agencies outside the marriage definition.  It is clearly recognised that many spouses, particularly women, in some way beaten down, bullied, frightened or simply because of pride, were unprepared to seek aid.  I concede that in many of the applications which were not granted these people had the initial courage or were desperate enough to seek the order, but they drew back at the last moment because of the fear of having to go into court to tell a stranger sitting on a bench the terrible turmoil they had to endure in the marriage.  Where there is a concerned external organisation&mdash;such as a health board or a welfare officer&mdash; available who is aware of what is happening in the home, they should be entitled to bring proceedings on behalf of the beleaguered spouse to ensure the ejection from the home of the bully.  I <Col N="1405" /> hope the Minister will consider the extension of this legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>I know these matters are not news to the Minister because they were raised in the debate in the Seanad and they will be raised here again at Committee Stage.  I hope he will respond as magnanimously in this area as he has done over the past few weeks.  The message must be underlined that the availability of the issuing of the protection order is not to be seen as a supplant of the barring procedure. There are a number of practical reasons for this.  It is clearly recognised that it is much more difficult to prove the breach of a protection order than to prove the breach of a barring order.  It is a fact that the errant respondent found in the garden or at the front door by the gardaí if and when called is clear proof, conclusive almost, of a breach of a barring order, but it is very difficult to prove that there has been a breach of a protection order particularly when the definition allows for the making of a threat or the presentation of violence rather than the administration of it.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the difficult role the Garda have in the policing of these orders.  It is clear that the Garda Síochána are pivotal to the proper implementation and application of the law in this area.  In the case of a barring order, it is a very simple job when they arrive at the family home and find the errant respondent on the premises, but what happens when a protection order is in force?  When the Garda arrive a blunt complaint is made that the errant respondent has done something which the wife considers to have been a breach of the protection order.  In the face of a blank denial, when there is not extraneous evidence to suggest a breach of the protection order &mdash; such as a broken picture frame, banged door, spilled tea or the sign of a bruise or mark on the spouse &mdash; what is the garda's position? He is an invidious position.  I know from practice it is a position they do not want to have to extend unnecessarily or unduly.  This must be borne in mind when we are dealing with this legislation.</P>
    <P>For example, in the area of assault, the directive issued to the Garda Síochána is <Col N="1406" /> that when called to the matrimonial home on complaint of an assault, the garda should not seek to arrest and remove the husband unless there is the sign of the infliction of a blow.  Therefore, the officer is instructed to look for such things as reddening or bruising, torn clothing or something extraneous from the word of the injured party to suggest that there had been the commission of the crime of assault.  That is probably the general working rule which is applied in regard to breach of protection orders.  For that reason I join in the calls for the introduction of clear guidelines for members of the Garda Síochána so that they can act effectively in the undoubted increasing availability of protection orders in the future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific provisions of the Bill, it is a very welcome fact that there is an onus laid on the courts which issue protection orders for an order to be sent as quickly as possible not only to the person who seeks it but also to the local Garda station so that there is on record available to the Garda up to date information of the orders in their locality or any alternations or abbreviations to them. That is a very welcome development under section 5.  The provision in section 4 with regard to the oral notification of the respondent is a good development in the law and will be supported by us.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters to which I would like to refer briefly.  It is strange that recent legislation has given us the opportunity to make comment on the very poor situation in which our civil legal aid offices find themselves.  There is no other area of the law in which these offices are asked to concern themselves more urgently than in the protection of beleaguered and battered spouses.  It is a fact that 90 per cent of the applications being brought before the court are initiated, unaided, at the behest of the victim because of the overworked legal aid offices and the lack of facilities and staff there.  The beleagured battered spouse must make her own way to the District Court and there encounter at first hand the intricacies of this legislation.  I know they are very well catered for and <Col N="1407" /> aided by the staff of these offices, but it is undesirable that they do not get advance advice, counselling and aid from the legal aid services.  I hope the Minister in responding to his Government's manifesto in bringing in this legislation will recognise that a comprehensive, fully staffed legal aid service is the only way we can give effect to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point that once we bar spouses from the home, for whatever good reason, it is incumbent on us to consider providing care and attention for those people.  It is clear that many of them have personality disorders or problems, particularly alcoholism.  Many of them are wandering the streets as a result of a barring order.  They have nowhere to go and are in great need of counselling.  I should like the Government to take that problem on board. Clearly, in trying to develop a uniformity of view and development of this whole area, there is a very urgent need for the establishment of family law courts.  I know this is actively in the mind of the Government and I realise it will involve the commitment of resources but it is quite clear that the Government should, at the earliest possible opportunity, consider the establishment of these courts from the point of view of developing the quality and effectiveness of the service and ensuring the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party welcome the Bill and we commend the Minister on its introduction.  We particularly commend the Government because it appears they are responding to a lot of good counsel from very concerned organisations outside the House in this area.  That is something which any Government should always be prepared to do, to listen to those in the field and to respond at the very earliest opportunity.  There are, as I indicated, areas that immediately concern The Workers' Party which we will be addressing by amendment on Committee Stage and we look forward to a response of a positive nature from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the amendments to the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill which are included here today and I appeal to the Minister to consider them as another step on the ladder to the broader area of family law reform which is so urgent and necessary.</P>
      <P>As legislators, we recognise and take into consideration that many of the problems we are now encountering at least have the freedom of being recognised and of having remedial action taken, both legislative and social.  We all welcome that because many of us know that for years many people suffered in silence because there was a stigma attached to the victims of violence.  Indeed it has been carried on to this day.  Sometimes when legislators are talking about protection of the wife and her children in the home the comment may be made that there are also battered husbands.  That probably can happen and we all deplore violence from any side.  That is why we have been careful to refer to the protection of spouses.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that there is a special need to focus and to refer specially to women in the home without appearing to be chauvinistic or sexist.  In that connection I should like to refer to a recent publication entitled <i>Domestic Violence Against Women</i> by Dr. Maeve Casey and published by Women's Aid.  The book was commissioned to show the co-operation, concern and support for this drastic problem.  In order that the book will be more widely read and recognised, the Garda Representative Association made available the funds for publishing this report.  We all join in recognising and acknowledging that contribution as the gardaí are in the front line in regard to coping with this problem.  In part 1 of this report, to probably explain why we are dealing with the level of abuse and violence against women, an historical background is given.</P>
      <P>Under the heading 1.2, Historical Background, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under English Common Law, on which much of Irish law is based, a <Col N="1409" /> woman's status as wife excluded her from the legal process, and gave her husband extraordinary discretion in determining punishable offences. Dobash &amp; Dobash¹ quote Sir William Blackstone on English common law in 1765 when he stated: &ldquo;By marriage the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended in marriage&rdquo;.  Wife beating was tolerated as the &lsquo;natural prerogative&rsquo; of the husband, providing the extent of the chastisement was &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;;² and there was little objection in the community to a man using force against his wife as long as he did not exceed certain tacit limits.³</P>
    <P>Such attitudes reflected a value system which say the wife as a chattel or possession of her husband, resulting in the assault of a stranger in the streets being viewed as a grave crime, but a similar assault on a wife being viewed as a trifling error of judgement. 4  It is from this historical background that a shift in attitudes to domestic violence against women is occurring.</P>
    <P>It is important that we see violence to women against that background and that we realise why, to a frightening degree, there was a tolerance of that type of violence to women and sometimes to children. Even if the children were not beaten they certainly witnessed the violence. That attitude must be changed and the education and awareness that must go with the legislative reforms cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>As has already been welcomed and acknowledged, the Minister for Justice and the officials drafting this legislation responded to a need and to groups and organisations who are dealing daily with this problem.  This is very welcome because that kind of practical advice makes for good legislation.  In this regard I would briefly like to cover some of the points because many of them will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The points I wish to refer to are contained in a submission made by three of the agencies dealing particularly with violence in the <Col N="1410" /> home, Women's Aid who, of course, are the refuge afforded to women and their children escaping from violence, AIM and the Sisters for Justice.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill these organisations believe it can be strengthened even further on Committee Stage because their whole concern is for the vulnerable and the victims.  One of the points they make is that applications for protection orders and barring orders should be made separately and that the applicant should have an opportunity to choose personally which order they wish to apply for.  They should be made aware that there is a choice.  The organisations also believe that in self-evident cases of abuse an <i>ex parte</i> barring order should be issued in the same way as an <i>ex parte</i> protection order.  They believe that if women victims were made aware of that choice and used it, it might reduce the numbers of women coming to the Women's Aid refuges at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am sure the officials have taken into consideration &mdash; we may have to make special provision for it in the Bill &mdash; that the protection and barring orders should be applicable to any violent family member over the age of 18 years of age. Unfortunately there have been cases where sons or other members of the family beat up the parents.  That is something against which we must provide protection.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern to all of us in dealing with violence and undesirable social tendencies and crimes committed by those under the age of 18, that there should be safe places of detention for juveniles.  While there are a certain number of safe places for boy offenders we do not really have any safe places of detention for young women many of whom are vulnerable and can be led into prostitution or other crimes.  We must ensure that such young women who cannot be convicted as adults are not left to wander the streets, without a place to go where we can save them physically and morally.  We are all aware of this problem and in providing detention and <Col N="1411" /> rehabilitation units it should be a top priority.</P>
    <P>The current grounds for a barring or protection order being issued are the safety and welfare of a spouse or child. Because of the interpretation of O'B <i>v.</i> O'B in the case of 1983 there is grave concern that mental suffering may be excluded.  It is suggested by a number of agencies concerned about this that we should include &ldquo;physical and/or psychological welfare&rdquo; as part of the Bill to cover that.</P>
    <P>According to this very valuable book which has been scientifically researched, a very high number of women made the point that mental violence and damage was more intolerable than physical violence. The phrase used in the Bill &ldquo;because of the conduct of the other spouse&rdquo; is absolutely valid but it may have to be extended to include &ldquo;and other members of the family&rdquo; because it might not be the spouse who is inflicting the violence.  That is something we can talk about on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Garda should also be made aware of this legislation.  The garda called into such a violent situation should be very clear as to his powers and in order to show the seriousness of the case a minimum penalty should be considered for a breach of either the protection or the barring order.  We have minimum penalties with regard to litter, pollution or other antisocial actions and this is certainly a very anti-social action.  The imposition of a minimum penalty would mean that there would be a record and in the event of future violence or future arrests a record could show that this was not a first offence.</P>
    <P>The point was also made about how important it is to have family law courts. There is an anomaly in our law which almost amounts to a discrimination in that at present in order to have a permanent barring order one needs legal representation and the money to go to the Circuit Court as the District Court cannot give the same amount of protection. In seeking justice there should not be a inbuilt advantage which can be bought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> It might be considered in the context of this Bill, particularly with regard to court procedure, that the applicants and respondents in the courts should be allowed one support person of their choice, other than their legal representative. This has been looked at with regard to procedures for rape victims.  It can be of tremendous support to victimised people who find themselves again in a very emotional situation.  This would mean we would have some record as to how judgments are made in these instances.  An absolutely essential part of a family court is that cases are held in private as much as possible, but what is disturbing at times is that because of that priority, there can be a lack of awareness as to what happens to cause, for instance, huge disparities in judgments, in the treatment of people appearing before the court and in the behaviour of different judges.  This is a matter of grave concern and will come up again and again in our family law.  We must consider how we are to monitor it to make sure that the people who are immediately touched by these cases can see that justice is being administered.</P>
    <P>As well as that, it would be of tremendous help to us as legislators to be aware of the needs that might arise so that we can propose amendments and reforms to such legislation.  It would be most important, once this Bill is enacted, anybody who can take advantage of its provisions would benefit by way of administration &mdash; here I am thinking of people like the Garda &mdash; but essentially women themselves or people who might be at risk in the home.  I would hope that such people would be made aware of the strengthened provision of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the booklet entitled <i>Domestic Violence Against Women &mdash; The Women's Perspective</i>&mdash; by Maeve Casey Part 4 contains many recommendations.  I do not intend to enumerate them.  One such recommendation is that if we are really to treat this whole problem in the round and alleviate and even prevent it in the long term we should first ensure that the Garda are aware of their powers and are trained to be aware of the difficulties and <Col N="1413" /> sensitivities in this area.  Therefore, it would be highly desirable that this aspect would comprise part of the Garda training and perhaps it does form part of their training already.</P>
    <P>This is an issue that has been raised by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. In fact, we have written to the incoming Garda Commissioner requesting him to meet the committee so that we might agree that the recommendations contained in this booklet be drawn up as a code of practice and, through the Garda Commissioner's good offices and directions, made available to every Garda station in the country.  As Deputy Shatter has said &mdash; and as we are all aware in our respective constituencies &mdash; violence in the home and against women is not confined to one area or region.  Therefore, in an effort to tackle it properly it is only fair that every garda in every Garda station throughtout the country should have these recommendations as a code of practice.</P>
    <P>In addition, all of the community resource services we can offer victims of such violence will be of tremendous value.  In this respect I must welcome the new building erected for the needs of the Women's Aid refuge in Dublin.  At times it is filled to overflowing, which is an indictment of our society and evidence of the violence still perpetrated against spouses in the home.  There is need for increased public awareness and education on this problem of domestic violence. Here I join all my colleagues in saying that there is more entailed than counselling and support &mdash; which is needed initially for the victims of such violence &mdash; but essentially we must break the cycle of such violence by the establishment of counselling services and indeed support and rehabilitation services for the assailants themselves.  In the long run, in cost effective terms it is preferable to get to the root of the problem rather than endeavour to cope and heal the wounds emanating from constant violence.  Thankfully, the old historical attitudes to wives being seen as possessions of their husbands who could chastise and freely beat them into shape <Col N="1414" /> is no longer socially or legally acceptable. There is till tremendous need for public education on the dignity and sancity of family relationships which are incorporated in the very words of our Constitution anyway.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister may feel he has no direct influence in this area but may I appeal that, in addition to the dimension of the training of Garda, we look in a reforming manner at the training of our judges so that they would be subjected to a training period in all areas of the law and particularly in relation to family law which might be described as a younger branch of the law.  Perhaps by way of formal or informal meetings and groupings they might reach agreement on certain guidelines, not statutory ones because I know there are many arguments against that but rather a consensus on the behaviour and attitude of judges toward crime and court proceedings emanating therefrom.</P>
    <P>What we should attempt to do in all areas of law reform is ensure that no citizen is left at risk but rather that he or she would receive help and support when in need.  Above all, when people have to have recourse to the law and court procedures, by way of implementation of that law they should be assured that such law is fairly administered, and is freely and openly accessible to everybody regardless of income.  It would be my hope that by bringing this problem of violence and its attendant shame out into the open, there will not longer be need for the immortal phrase encapsulated in the title of the book written by Erin Pizzey &mdash; who involved herself in Britain in the establishment of refuges for women &mdash;<i>Scream Silently Or The Neighbours Will Hear</i>.  The neighbours and all of us legislators here must listen and respond, ensuring that people do not live behind closed doors in that dreadful vulnerable position amidst the cycle of violence and hatred that emanates therefrom.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to be in a position to welcome this Bill enthusiastically. <Col N="1415" /> Its provisions will provide additional remedies for the tragic victims of family violence.  Those are many things required in this country by way of laws to try to assist those who are caught in difficult family circumstances, particularly in relation to marital breakdown of which this family violence is often a major cause or, as some people might say, may have a contributory effect rather than be the cause.  There are many people, many women particularly, living in this country frightened of their lives to be in their family homes, unfortunately also frightened to have recourse to the law by way of remedy whether that be by way of a barring order or, under the new proposals, by way of a protection order. Their fear is occasioned by the feeling that a bad situation can often be rendered worse if one does have recourse to the law by way of remedial action.  That is a pity.</P>
      <P>I am sure many Deputies, particularly those female Members, often come across women living in very difficult and frightening circumstances.  When one asks them why they have not taken a case to court for a barring order or a protection order &mdash; awaiting a barring order as will be the case now &mdash; they often say they feel it would not really solve anything, that it would make their position worse, leading to all kinds of consequences for the family and children. It is a pity that often people are prepared to put up with terrible violence and pressure, particularly mental violence &mdash; which can often be worse than physical violence &mdash; in order to keep a family together, to save face with relatives or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that Members of this House would encourage people in those situations whenever possible to have recourse to the law by way of remedial action.  I accept that when one is dealing with a family &mdash; particularly in circumstances as they relate to husbands and wives &mdash; those relationships are such that, when the law begins to interfere, it worsens their position no matter what it may have been; generally it will render <Col N="1416" /> their position worse.  When one goes to court and gets a barring order against a spouse one is taking a very drastic course of action.  In my experience I have never witnessed a case, subsequent to such action being taken, where there is reconciliation between the two parties.  That course of action is brought about because of the difficulties that exist in relation to the whole family law area.</P>
    <P>For many years people sought barring orders as one way of trying to get some arm of the law to recognise that their marriages had broken down.  The tragedy is that 18 months after the second last referendum to change the Constitution in relation to the prohibition on divorce was defeated we have an even bigger problem with marital breakdown.  Why were so many people unwilling to help others who are the victims of marital breakdown?  Why are we not prepared to deal realistically or compassionately with those unfortunate people who have to live a life of hell because of the kind of laws that exist?</P>
    <P>In so far as this legislation is one part of a long litany of legislation that is required to improve our laws and to make them more realistic and more caring, I welcome it.  I hope it is only one part of such legislation and that this Dáil will have an opportunity of introducing much more legislation in this area.  I was a member of the all party committee on marriage breakdown and that committee made very fine proposals, almost all of which can be implemented without any recourse to the Constitution, although perhaps the most fundamental ones would need constitutional change.  A lot can be done in the absence of constitutional change.  I hope we are just starting along the path to introducing that kind of caring and progressive legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the judicial system as it affects family law matters, every Deputy who has ever dealt with people who have gone through family courts, who have taken a case, be it for maintenance, custody or separation proceedings, will realise that those people have one thing in common.  They all say that the courts as we know them are not adequate and <Col N="1417" /> are not suitable to deal with matters between individuals in a family.  The adversarial courts system drives people further and further apart.  It seeks to establish who committed the matrimonial fault, as it were.  It does not seek in any way to try to help in a caring and compassionate way the victims of family law disputes.  It is high time we introduced proposals to set up a proper system of family tribunals, tribunals not just by name but ones that would have available to them the proper back up expertise that can genuinely help people in these positions.  We need marriage counsellors, psychologists and in particular people who are in a position to help the children who are very often the losers in family law disputes.</P>
    <P>When we grant a barring order to a spouse to bar from the family home the other spouse or when we grant a protection order to warn, as it were, one spouse against mistreating or using violence or threatening language against the other spouse or the children, that legislation will not be sufficient unless side by side with it there is in place a proper system of counselling to try to help people during this period to rehabilitate themselves, to come to terms with the problem and to try to find a solution.</P>
    <P>Many of these problems stem from the huge problem of alcoholism in this country. I will quote from a submission which, I think, every other Deputy in this House has received, too.  It is from the Coolock Community Law Centre, a committee who frequently deal with the victims of marital breakdown.  They say:</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that the grounds for obtaining a barring order should be clarified by legislation. In particular the difficulties in cases where there is no violence, the behaviour of the offending spouse has a very serious effect on the applicant and the children.  This commonly occurs in cases of alcoholism.  There is a general reluctance on the part of the judiciary to bar a spouse on the grounds of alcoholism unless it is coupled with violence.  The majority of clients <Col N="1418" /> coming to this Centre seeking barring orders do so usually on grounds relating to abuse of alcohol and it is felt that the Court is not providing relief for these clients.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt we are not providing relief for the huge numbers of people who suffer, maybe not physical violence, but mental violence.  There is terrible pressure on the spouse and the children and the present law does not deal adequately with that situation.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator Robinson has said in the other House and what Deputy Shatter has said in this House in relation to the interpretation of the Supreme Court's decision in the case of O'B. <i>v.</i> O'B.  They are eminent lawyers in this field.  The fact remains that in 1983 1,697 applications were made in the Dublin metropolitan area to the District Court for barring orders, 848 of which were granted.  In 1985 1,856 applications were made, almost 200 more than in 1983, and only 516 were granted.  In 1986 1,927 applications were made and only 448 barring orders were granted.  Since that Supreme Court decision there has been a dramatic decrease in the numbers of people capable of getting barring orders. Considering that 1,927 people sought barring orders in 1986 and only 448 of them were successful, at least 1,479 couples are living in an even more dangerous situation because, having taken proceedings for a barring order, one puts oneself into an even more vulnerable position with the difficult spouse or the spouse using violence, abuse or whatever. We should update the law in relation to barring orders.  It is not enough to say that there must be physical violence.  I accept what the eminent lawyers said, that that is not really what the Supreme Court said.  The facts seem to be that fewer barring orders are now granted.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where women have been living under terrible mental pressure and mental violence &mdash; that is what I would call it &mdash; and they have not been able to secure barring orders.  Instead they have to return to the home and live <Col N="1419" /> in an even more difficult environment.  It would be very worth while indeed if some training were given to the Garda Síochána to allow them to be effective in cases of marital violence.  I am often told by people that when they ring the Garda in relation to the enforcement of barring or protection orders they are not treated with the same level of seriousness they would receive if it were a different kind of case.  I can understand why that is the case.  The Garda are generally reluctant to interfere in these matters.  They find it very difficult to do so, albeit that there is an order in force from the courts.  It is a difficult situation to place them in and they need some training and guidelines.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another group of people who certainly need training in this area, the Judiciary.  I have said before in this House that we need more younger members of the Judiciary and certainly more women members, particularly today with this kind of case.  The members of the Judiciary here tend to be elderly men, many of whom have had no training in family law matters because when they were student lawyers these problems did not exist and we were not very far advanced in the whole family law area.  It is a well known fact that in legal circles the family law area is known as the pits because there is not much money in it; it is not taken seriously, with a few exceptions &mdash; it is generally left to the women lawyers and to date there are not many of them at a senior level.  The members of the Judiciary need training in this whole area particularly if they are to staff the new family tribunals that I hope will be established before too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening address that this Bill is part of a programme Fianna Fáil promised in their election campaign.  He said:</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also that the Bill follows the commitment in the Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for Natioinal Recovery</i> to amend the law to protect women against domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister is not directly responsible, I say to him that the funding <Col N="1420" /> that has been given this year and that is proposed for next year to the women's organisations trying to help women in these difficult circumstances does not support the view that Fianna Fáil are trying to help women who find themselves involved in domestic violence. AIM, the women's group the Minister complimented for being, to a large degree, responsible for this kind of legislation, were given £4,000 in 1986.  That tiny £4,000 was decreased to £1,000 in 1987.  What can an organisation of that kind do with just £1,000?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Barnes says, there is none for 1988.  It is a disgrace. Maybe it is because these groups do not have enough political muscle or not so many people are affected but the cause they are trying to help is far more important than some of the groups which seem to be able to get a lot of money from all Governments.  It is a tragedy and a pity that the commitment the Government seem to have in their statements to women suffering violence in the home is not followed through by support for these organisations that are trying to survive in very difficult circumstances and trying to help in a practical way the women so affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many practical difficulties for a woman in a situation of violence.  If she fails to get a barring order and is the joint owner of the family home, if she wishes to get out of that situation and leave the family home she has, effectively, no chance of getting alternative accommodation from the local authority. They will say to her that she is the joint owner of a family home and must go through the rigour of selling the home and proving she is not in a position to independently provide housing for herself. That can take months, sometimes years.  What is she supposed to do in this situation?  I have often had women come to me saying that their marriage has ended and they are living in a difficult situation, cannot put up with the pressure and asking what they can do.  If they leave <Col N="1421" /> their husbands, will they get alternative accommodation?  The fact is that they will not if they are joint owners of a family home or if they voluntarily leave the home.  They effectively have no choice. In these difficult circumstances groups like AIM and Women's Aid provide temporary shelter which gets women out of their own difficult situation and at least gives them time to think and work out something for the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to people who are barred from the family home, if we are to be practical about this legislation we will have to provide alternative housing accommodation for them.  Although we might take a poor view of somebody involved in family violence, the fact is that if this legislation is to be effective, particularly if barring orders are to be effective, this can only be so if alternative accommodation is provided for the spouse who is barred from the family home.  The lack of alternative accommodation is what may prevent some members of the Judiciary from granting barring orders in the first instance.  In the other House reference was made to the fact that many people who are the victims of family violence are very often not married to each other.  Because of the huge problem we now have with marital breakdown, many people live in what is known as common law situations.  It is not open to a person living in this kind of situation to apply to have the other party to the relationship barred from the family home or to have a protection order placed in court in situations of violence or the threat of violence.  If we are to be practical and realistic we will have to look at ways of helping people whose relationship is not based on marriage.  If we are to be practical about the plight so many people find themselves in because of the result of the second last constitutional referendum we will have to provide remedies.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for protection and barring orders to apply to members of families other than a spouse.  We all know of the increasing rate of violence against children in particular by people other than the spouse or the father.  Brothers, <Col N="1422" /> uncles and other people who live in the family home can be involved in molesting and interfering, often in a sexual way, with children.  It should be open to health boards or competent authorities to apply in certain restricted circumstances to have a particular member of a family barred from the family home instead of necessarily having always to take the child out of the situation.  It may also be necessary for that other authority to apply because the mother or wife might be reluctant to take proceedings against her own husband or the father of the child.  It may well be necessary to update our laws to allow for competent authorities such as health boards to make application in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which are not in this Bill but which are important if we want to properly update the law in this country as far as it affects families and particularly as it relates to family law.  We have a long way to go to have the kind of realistic legislation we all realise is so badly needed.  I hope that this Bill, which I fully support, will be the first step in a programme of reform the Minister or his colleagues will bring before this House in order to help those who tragically find themselves in difficult family situations. The all-party Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown reported on these matters more than two years ago.  In that time we have not used that report as usefully as we could to implement in law many of its fine recommendations.  Most of its recommendations were made with full support of all the participants from all parties and Independent members. We should build on that consensus and bring in the legislation and I am sure it will have an enthusiastic and welcome response in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this Bill will prove to be helpful in difficult marital situations that arise but I am not entirely convinced it will.  There is a danger that the courts, if invited to do so, may tend to use these protection orders as a kind of half-way measure rather than give a barring order in an appropriate case.  If that tendency was to develop it could have serious <Col N="1423" /> consequences in some families. However, the main defect of the Bill is that it does not recognise what is the major factor in this country that gives rise to marital breakdown, that is, alcoholism. Many of us who are involved in that kind of work &mdash; and as politicians we come across it in our clinics &mdash; know that the major factor is alcoholism.  That is not a ground for a protection order or a barring order, but it should be.</P>
      <P>Many of the courts have been working under a difficulty up to now because the actual grounds on which a wife would be entitled to get a barring order are not specifically spelt out.  It should be spelt out that alcoholism and all that that implies ought of its own accord to be a base for an application for a barring order.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment tonight the question of an 8th century cross which is not in the possession of our museum authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Chair for granting me an opportunity to raise this important matter here in the House.  Yesterday morning I was appalled to read in our national newspapers and to hear and see on radio and television that a historic cross had been found and retained by a person in whose possession it still is.  It appears from the articles and news items that efforts had been made to sell this cross in the United States.  I was further appalled to find that this famous 8th century bronze cross from Clonmacnoise, one of our most famous historic sites, had been offered for sale to the John Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, for $1.75 million but that that museum was not interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> Many people to whom I spoke yesterday and today were dismayed that this person was fined a sum of only £10 and, secondly, that the finder still had possession of the cross.  This find was made prior to the passing of the amended National Monuments Act which is why the justice was permitted to impose only a maximum fine of £10.  The Minister in question, Deputy Treacy, his predecessor, Deputy Doyle and some previous Ministers of the Department and departmental officials were concerned at the size of fine.  Nowadays, at least, a fine can be imposed of up to £50,000 in the event of a find of this nature not being reported.</P>
    <P>There is a very glaring loophole in the law at present when such treasures as this bronze cross and the Derrynaflan Chalice can be retained by the finder.  The matter is before the Supreme Court following the decision in the Derrynaflan case and we await the Supreme Court decision which it is to be hoped will be made at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is essential that such treasures, which are so much associated with our history and culture, should be retained in the National Museum for the benefit of the people and for future generations.  We talk here about the past, about our history of which we are proud but at present such items can be sold outside this country. It is questionable whether they should be capable of being sold outside the country.  Immediate action is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that we should be actively considering a constitutional referendum.  It is incumbent on the Government to hold such a referendum so that the people can be given the opportunity of stating clearly and unequivocally that they are opposed to private individuals selling our most valuable treasures to millionaires around the world.  To these millionaires and to some institutions outside Ireland, £3 million or £5 million is very little money to pay for such items, which are so interwoven with our history, culture and past.  The referendum should deal with the matter of <Col N="1425" /> a person who makes such a find being forbidden by the State to take possession of it.</P>
    <P>I am also advocating, as part and parcel of the Bill which would go before the House concerning such a referendum, that there should be a reasonable scheme of reward, that reasonable compensation should be paid to the finder of such an article.  A committee should be appointed which would have power to pay a just, reasonable amount in compensation.  I go so far as to suggest that such a committee should comprise some of the following people: a person appointed from the National Museum and somebody appointed by the Minister from his own Department, also an auctioneer or experienced valuer and, finally, that it be chaired by a judge of the standing of a High Court judge in Ireland.  Some of the matters that I feel the committee should take into consideration would be the value of the article, the difficulty in obtaining the historic item, the care taken by the finder in excavating the object and in its preservation.  The degree of co-operation with the State should also be taken into account in regard to the reporting of the find.  These matters should be part and parcel of the compensation to be paid.</P>
    <P>Some people will disagree with me and say that no such compensation should be paid for items which are part of our history and culture, but I am against that viewpoint.  If we do not reward a finder, then the likelihood is that such an item will be hidden and smuggled out of the country.  The Minister and his officials are aware that from countries such as Italy and Greece many valuable items have been smuggled out to Switzerland and other parts of Europe and to the United States.  We would not wish to see that happen in this country.  If you suppress or only give infinitesimal awards it will encourage people to take property out of this country.  It is essential to encourage some degree of reward and this we would be very anxious to do.</P>
    <P>This country has a very rich inheritance. We are particularly pleased and proud of the history, culture and inheritance <Col N="1426" /> that have been handed down to us. Now that we have the National Monuments (Amendment) Act which compels a person to report a find, it is essential that we take the matter to the next logical step which is to hold the necessary referendum, otherwise the position will remain very vague.  The matter at present rests with the Supreme Court but the Government should be considering taking positive action.  I am appalled that Irish men and women would even consider selling historical treasures outside of Ireland.  If people are prepared to do this for monetary gain we must ensure that the necessary laws are passed and a referendum is held so that people would not be able to sell these treasures outside of Ireland.  I put it to the Minister of State that this referendum should take place at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Those are my views on this matter and I feel very strongly about it.  I am sure the Minister of State will be anxious to take immediate action on this matter and I hope he will take action along the lines I have advocated to him.  If it is in order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to allot my colleague, Deputy Nealon, the time which is remaining to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to anticipate the agreement of the Minister of State for that request.  Does the Minister of State agree?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has a great interest in this matter and, indeed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you have long shown a great interest in this area also.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Enright, for allowing me to speak on this matter and I am delighted that I am present in the House to endorse fully everything he has said.  I have had a special interest in this matter in the past and dealt with the most recent find, the Lough Kinale Book Shrine.  That find was brought to a very quick and very satisfactory conclusion for all the parties concerned.  The legal end <Col N="1427" /> is tied up and there will be no difficulty about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright talked about a just reward.  I also think that there should be a just reward but there should be no question of the person who makes the discovery, be it accidental or by meticulous effort, becoming the rightful owner of what amounts to part of our heritage. One of the most outrageous scenes I have witnessed on television was when the finders of the Derrynaflan Chalice, popping champagne, asked the entire nation to take part with them in the celebrations and this after they had ripped them off of £5.5 million.  I ask the Minister of State to give us some indication as to when the result of the court case in regard to the Derrynaflan Chalice will be known?  As Deputy Enright has said, and as I am sure the Minister of State will agree, the only possible way of solving this problem for all time and of preventing a constant recurrence of what we are seeing now and what we have seen in the past is by way of the holding of a referendum.</P>
      <P>I understand that another referendum will have to be held as a result of the difficulties which arose in regard to the Single European Act and I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a single question on this matter will be included on that occasion.  This could be done at very little extra cost.  I sought to have that done at the time of the referendum on the Single European Act but it was thought that that matter was so important that there should be no fudging of the issue and as a result it was not included. I am sorry now that it was not included.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to indicate the date of the more recent discovery and to say whether, if the discovery were made now, it would be covered by the underwater provisions in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act.  I believe it would be.  I also suggest that in any referendum to be held a retrospective clause should be included which would cover all past discoveries which are not yet in the possession of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff of the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and the Department <Col N="1428" /> of the Taoiseach are sometimes blamed for this problem but I would like to say that there is no element of slowness on their part, as I have discovered, once the right decisions have been made and the necessary financial wherewithal have been given to them to solve the problem. A pefect example of this is the Lough Kinale Book Shrine.  From the day it became known to the National Museum and the Department of the Taoiseach only ten days elapsed before the legal end was tied up.  Cash was paid over and the Lough Kinale Book Shrine was among our greatest national collection in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>We do not want to upset the bargaining positions of those involved but I, and I am sure Deputy Enright too, would like an assurance from the Minister of State that a reasonable amount of cash will be made available so that a solution can be obtained.  This is a very important issue and I know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you if you were not in the Chair you would be contributing to this debate.  This is a problem we must solve.  We will not be forgiven if we do not solve it.  A solution has to be obtained.  No one can say whether we will ever obtain a book similar to the Book of Kells or find a chalice similar to the Derrynaflan Chalice but no one ever knew either that we would find the Lough Kinale Book Shrine which rates alongside the Cross of Cong, the Tara Brooch, the Derrynaflan Chalice etc.</P>
    <P>Provided the more sophisticated methods which are now in use are used legally I believe great finds similar to the Lough Kinale Book Shrine and the Derrynaflan Chalice will be made on a recurring basis.  Past experience suggests that such finds will be made.  I am aware of the Minister of State's interest in this matter and of the extraordinary amount of heritage material which exists within his own area of County Galway and, indeed, within my own area of County Sligo, where an important slab, perhaps important as the Lough Kinale Book Shrine, was found in the back of a car following a chase by officials of the National Museum.  It was on its way to <Col N="1429" /> America in the custody of a man who, because of his occupation, would not expect to be hit by lightning.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister of State will give us an assurance in this respect but I emphasise once again that the only solution to this problem is the holding of a referendum and it should be held at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies for raising this very important matter.  In speaking about our heritage and our artefacts they speak for all the Members of this House and I am sure for all the people.  I hope the fact that they have raised this matter in this House will bring to the light of those involved in the holding of State treasures that they are the property of the Irish people and rightly belong in the National Museum which would hold them in trust for all the people of this country.  The existence of the cross in question came to the attention of the National Museum in December, 1986 and when it was brought to the attention of the Department of the Taoiseach in January last, an inderdepartmental working party was set up to consider and monitor the action necessary to deal with this and other related cases.</P>
      <P>Investigations showed that a consortium was involved in the midlands who were arranging to sell the valuable cross in the United States.  Museum authorities in the USA were alerted to the fact that the export from this country of this item in this manner would be an illegal act. Subsequently, the Getty Museum, one of the most prestigious in the USA, turned down the offer of the cross which had been made to it for a sum of $1.75 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April of this year, the officials of the National Museum of Ireland were approached by a solicitor acting on behalf of the finder or finders.  He described it as a cross approximately 18 inches high of wood and metal, with decoration similar to the Lough Kinale Book Shrine.  It is dated to the seventh or eighth century AD.  The National Museum were, subsequently, given the opportunity of <Col N="1430" /> seeing the object and of taking photographs. From subsequent investigations, it became clear that not only the date of finding but the find place were not as indicated by the finders.  Proceedings were instituted against one of the finders for failure to report the find within the statutory 14 days required.  He was convicted and fined £10 under the old Monuments Act.  The National Monuments Act, 1987, has now increased this penalty to a maximum of £50,000 with the possibility of a year's imprisonment.  The charge of giving false information to the National Museum officials was dismissed on the technicality that it was not given to the Director of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Further investigations into this and other related cases are proceeding.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to have a meeting of the interdepartmental working group in the aftermath of the court case of 17 November to consider the next steps including clarification of the position regarding ownership and the possibility of acquiring the object for the National Museum. They will also be considering the necessary action in other related cases.  It must be realised that this is part of a wave of plundering of archaeological objects by organised groups whose intention is to sell the object or objects to the highest bidder and if necessary, to illegally export them for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Taoiseach has made it quite clear that the full rigour of the law will be applied to deal with the activities of those who would seek to deprive the Irish people of their archaeological heritage and of the opportunity of having it conserved and displayed in our National Museum.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Director and staff of the National Museum and the Garda for their success in preventing the illegal export of this item and for ensuring that it can be available for scholars and the public generally for study and appreciation.  On behalf of the Irish people I would also like to thank the Curator of Sculpture at the Getty Museum in the US for the very positive attitude they have adopted there <Col N="1431" /> to the offer made to them for this very important artefact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright, who raised this matter, has requested that we hold a constitutional referendum to give an opportunity to the people to show the regard they have for our heritage and all objects and artefacts found in any part of our country by any person or persons.  That is a praiseworthy suggestion but as a very important case is before the Supreme Court at the moment we cannot even consider holding a referendum or we would find ourselves in contempt of court.  However, we will consider it when the Supreme Court decision has been made as we cannot at this stage prejudge that decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright and Deputy Nealon made a number of points regarding compensation. The practice of the National Museum has been that compensation is paid in respect of a loss incurred by somebody. The museum has always paid awards to finders of objects.  Finders' awards must also take account of the circumstances of discovery.  Often the museum is asked to pay awards to finders in respect of objects owned by other people, that is, the landowners from whose land objects have been removed, unknowingly or otherwise.  The museum is considering setting up a new system &mdash; or maybe an updating of the present system &mdash; of payment of awards to ensure that any artefacts or objects found can come into the custody, control and care of the National Museum on behalf of the people as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon asked when the Supreme Court will rule on the Derrynaflan case.  It is expected that the Supreme Court may reach this case before its Christmas recess.  We hope it will do so and we await its decision with interest.  I would like to be able to take immediate action on this and on other matters but we are constrained by the legalities to be decided in the Supreme Court and we cannot prejudice those or make decisions that may be in conflict with any decision that may be made by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Again, I congratulate the Director and staff of the National Museum, the people in the US for their positive attitude, the officials in the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department for their co-operation in these matters, and Deputies Enright and Nealon for raising this matter.  I make a final appeal on behalf of the people of Ireland to the people who now hold this cross to come forward and offer it immediately to the National Museum so that it can be held in trust for them and for the people of Ireland.  The finders will find a reasonable, fair and positive attitude will be forthcoming from the museum director and his staff and they can take into account the fact that this case has been dealt with under the old Monuments Act rather than the new 1987 National Monuments Act.  I hope that in the interests of the country and of preserving our heritage they too will adopt a positive attitude and come forward and co-operate with the director and staff of the National Museum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated it must be realised that this is part of a plundering of archaeological objects by organised groups whose intention is to sell these illegally if necessary.  We have some valuable, indeed priceless, objects in the National Museum.  Is the Minister satisfied as to the very tight security necessary in that building?  I recommend that he gives that matter the closest possible attention, particularly because of what he has stated here.  Very vigilant and tight security is necessary at our National Museum against people who are prepared to plunder and steal such items and then try to sell them outside Ireland.</P>

      <P>The INPC's mandate as owner of the Whiddy Island oil terminal permits it to pursue all prospects for the establishment of a revenue earning, employment generating activity at Whiddy, while at the same time taking appropriate steps to have the potential of the terminal as an oil storage and transhipment facility realised to the maximum degree.  The INPC identified the possibility of fishfarming as an alternative revenue earning activity.</P>
      <P>What is involved at present is a pilot project using one tank on a joint venture basis with a Norwegian company which is supplying the expertise and the necessary funds.  This pilot project is due to be completed in 1988 when the position will be reassessed.  As a general principal, this Government are in favour of State agencies diversifying into other activities, provided this can be done on a sound commercial basis.</P>
      <P>Authority for INPC to engage in the project is governed by Article 101 of its articles of association which permits the INPC to engage in activities outside its oil related activities provided ministerial approval is given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In this case this was provided on 16 February 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 33 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The Forest Service of my Department has ongoing consultations with the sawmilling industry concerning matters of mutual interest.  The decision to dispose of timber from State forests by way of auction sales, on an experimental basis and in part substitution for tender sales, was taken following a specific recommendation of the interdepartmental committee on systems for disposal of State-owned timber which reported in October 1984.  In the course of its deliberations the committee consulted fully with the Irish Timber Council, the umbrella organisation of the Irish sawmilling industry, who themselves in fact recommended to the committee that auction sales be considered as a means of diversifying existing sales systems.</P>
      <P>The merits of the auction system over the tender system have been fully examined. However, on this point I must stress that it was never intended to replace existing sales methods entirely by auction sales, but rather to diversify the system to the mutual advantage of the State and the industry.</P>
      <P>The first national auction was held in Dublin in July 1985 and was followed by a regional auction in Kilkenny in January 1987.  A second national auction was held in Dublin in September 1987.  On each occasion the industry has expressed satisfaction with auctions as an alternative method of sale and it is proposed to hold further auctions in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific reference to the auction held in Dublin on 17 September 1987, it was considered a success from both the <Col N="1368" /> point of view of the Forest Service and that of the sawmill industry.  Total sales to the value of £1.45 million were realised.  I am satisfied that it would not be in the commercial interest of the Forest Service to disclose the information in respect of sales to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 46, 51 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that when Deputy O'Sullivan is referring to alternative sources of energy he means new and renewable sources of energy.  In relation to Deputy Kelly's question, I assume that when he refers to development of energy resources independent of oil he means imported oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to new and renewable sources of energy, considerable sums of money have been expended in recent years in the promotion of research, <Col N="1369" /> development and demonstration work in this area.  This investment has been undertaken by my Department, by State-funded agencies, by the universities and by the private sector.</P>
    <P>This expenditure was incurred in areas such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass, biogas, wave and tidal energy. National efforts have been supported both by the EC and the IEA.</P>
    <P>It can be expected that past expenditures will continue to benefit us in the future, but because of the pressures on the national finances departmental funding for new and renewable energies cannot be maintained at the same level as in previous years and is being scaled down.  This will not in any way deter private sector interests from presenting appropriate projects for assistance from the EC.</P>
    <P>My Department has no plans at present to harness sea power for energy purposes but the ESB are maintaining close links with developments in other parts of the world.  With the assistance of the EC under the Valoren Programme my Department will fund measures to evaluate the potential for wind energy applications at suitable sites in Ireland.  My Department has published guidelines for the private developer of small-scale hydro schemes and it has also published a report on the potential for small-scale hydro development in Ireland.  This report identifies over 500 sites in private ownership which are suitable for development. Furthermore, the ESB have proposals to develop small-scale hydroelectric facilities at ten sites.</P>
    <P>With regard to energy conservation considerable investment has been undertaken by my Department in this area especially since 1979.  This investment has resulted in significant energy savings and it must be expected that the benefits of any expenditures undertaken in the past will continue into the future.  The gains from this programme are, therefore, cumulative.</P>
    <P>The current programme is comprised of several activities some of which are carried out by the IIRS on behalf of the Department.  A fuel efficiency survey <Col N="1370" /> grant scheme is in operation and provides grants of up to one-third of the cost of engaging consultants in the carrying out of fuel efficiency surveys for hotels, manufacturing industries and third level institutions.</P>
    <P>The IIRS have regional energy officers based in Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon who advise industry and other intensive energy users on the elimination of energy wastage.  This involves visiting consumers throughout each region to provide on the spot advice and to identify areas for further action by the energy user to achieve energy savings.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the IIRS provide an electrical energy audit service free of charge to industrial and large commercial firms. This service is designed to identify savings that can be achieved from more efficient electrical energy usage.</P>
    <P>A telephone advisory service is also provided by the IIRS to advise particularly the domestic energy consumer on any matter relating to conservation of energy.  Furthermore, the institute has available to members of the public energy conservation booklets and publicity material which are designed to promote public awareness of the importance of energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>With regard to developing our other energy resources independent of imported oil, I would refer Deputy Kelly to my statement in this House on 15 October 1987 where I gave a detailed outline of the Government's plans to promote the exploration for oil and gas.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna will continue its investment in the development of our indigenous bogs.  Over the next five years 8,600 hectares of bogland will be developed partly under the Valoren programme and partly under the board's own third bog development programme.</P>
    <P>The ESB have come to the end of a major investment programme in generating plant with the commissioning of the third unit at Moneypoint earlier this year.  This coal plant will reduce substantially our dependence on imported oil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> With regard to coal, I am taking measures to secure development of the country's coal reserves to their maximum potential.  The availability of areas in the Leinster coalfield for the grant of prospecting and mining facilities was advertised recently and my Department is considering applications for such facilities at present.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is continuing its examination of potential gas markets based on various options combining existing and possible additional sources of supply, and when this is complete, the board will be submitting proposals to me for consideration.  The viability of supplying an expanded market is critically dependent on the price at which we can sell gas into it.  This, in turn, depends on the cost of gaining access to additional sources of gas.  Accordingly, any arrangement for additional supplies would have to take account of our ability to use the gas economically.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 32, 52, 54, 56 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are convinced that it is in the interests of all that measures should be taken at Community level to ensure the observance of the highest standards of safety and operation of nuclear installations.  We believe that the most effective way of achieving this is through <Col N="1374" /> the establishment of a European Community Inspection Force.</P>
    <P>In April 1986 Ireland formally requested the European Commission to establish a Community Inspection Force under Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty to report to the Commission and to the member states on existing or potential health or safety problems in individual nuclear installations in the Community. This request was formally repeated in May 1986 following Chernobyl.  In June of that year, the Commission's legal service met with representatives of the Attorney General's office.  It was agreed at that meeting that the Community had the competence to take the initiative to set up an inspection force under the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has proposed the establishment of an inspection force at Council level on numerous occasions, most recently at an Informal Energy Council on 21 September last where I drew attention to the Sellafield issue and again called for the establishment of an inspection force.  I said that this would be necessary to ensure independently that uniformly high standards are applied at nuclear installations throughout the Community; that national regulatory authorities carry out their functions effectively and that any plants which cannot meet the highest safety standards are closed.  I also called for support for an inspection force when I met recently with the European Community ambassadors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I met with Commissioner Stanley Clinton Davis on 7 May last to discuss this issue.  In July, in response to the Commission's announcement of plans to resume inspection of national monitoring facilities, I again formally raised the question of an inspection force with Commissioner Clinton Davis saying that, while we welcomed their initiative on inspection of monitoring facilities, it did not prejudice our long-standing request for a nuclear safety inspection force.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the recent statement by Commissioner Clinton Davis in favour of an inspection force and calling on member states to support its establishment. In effect the commissioner <Col N="1375" /> stated what Ireland has been saying all along &mdash; that the Community provides the obvious legal and technical infrastructure for such a force.</P>
    <P>The commissioner also said that objectivity was very hard to achieve where there are large special interests to be protected and that it was quite clear that national authorities and their nuclear operators have such special interests.  I agree with these views and I feel that full collaboration between national authorities can only be achieved under the infrastructure of an external objective inspection force.</P>
    <P>I had further discussions with the commissioner on 5 November.  I reiterated that it was vitally important that the commissioner should take more constructive initiatives on nuclear accident prevention and said that he could expect the full support of the Irish Government.  The commissioner took note of my concerns. He indicated that there was a moving forward on the question of inspections and he shared my wish to see faster progress. He said that he was considering what proposals he would bring forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are currently considering the best way to raise the issue of an inspection force at United Nations level.  In all of my contacts at international level I have taken every opportunity to emphasise the unanimous policy of the Oireachtas on this issue.  I welcome the initiatives taken by individual Deputies and MEPs in support of this policy.  I am considering ways in which we could collaborate with maximum effect and I will bear in mind the suggestions of Deputies Quinn and O'Sullivan.</P>

      <P>It is my wish that Bord na Móna should continue developing in the most effective way its core business of bog development, peat production and related business.  In this respect I have been successful in securing significant EC assistance.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published last month envisages the development over five years of more than 8,600 hectares of additional bogland at eleven locations at a cost of £22 million.</P>
      <P>As part of my overall plans for the board I intend having a study carried out of the board's entire operations with a view to maximising efficiency and identifying new products and services which can be delivered on a profitable basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the recent decision taken by the Government in relation to the development of Bord na Móna's cutaway bogs for forestry purposes. I am mindful of the desirability of ensuring continuation of employment in areas where bogs are becoming exhausted, but I would point out that there are 20 years or more of solid development work yet to be done by Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware various independent reports have been prepared on safety matters at Dublin Gas.  The recommendations in these reports have set the agenda for improving the gas supply system.  Safety in the operation of the gas system is a pirority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the implementation of the gas-related recommendations in the Cremer and Warner report should be completed by the end of the year, and that the recommendations of the VEG GAS INSTITUUT report are on schedule for implementation within their respective timescales.  About 30 per cent of the recommendations of the Task <Col N="1379" /> Force Report on Multi-Storey buildings have been implemented.  All its recommendations will be implemented within the three year timescale recommended by the Task Force.  Progress on all of these reports is being closely monitored.</P>
    <P>At present about 14 kilometres of mains and service pipe have been replaced.  By year end this figure will rise to about 17 kilometres.  The pipe replacement programme is being carried out on a safety priority basis.  An extensive mains conditioning programme is also well advanced.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dublin Gas continue to run public awareness campaigns consisting of mail-shots, newspaper advertisements, notices in public buildings, and TV coverage beginning in mid-December.</P>
    <P>All of these efforts are designed to reduce to the absolute minimum the possibility of danger to the public.  It is not possible, however, to eliminate risk entirely, and public awareness and co-operation are essential to discharging the onus on everyone to secure maximum safety.</P>

      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board carry out an ongoing monitoring programme of the Irish marine environment to ascertain the levels of radioactivity in the water and its consequent up-take in fish and shellfish. The consumption of fish and shellfish is the most likely route by which exposure to the Irish public could occur as a consequence of the discharges of radioactive effluents from Sellafield which is the principal source of radioactive contamination of our marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's monitoring programme is concentrated on the analysis of fish and shellfish samples from commercial landings at a number of fishing ports around the country.  The board's findings are generally corroborated by independent tests <Col N="1381" /> carried out by our universities.  The results of their programme are published regularly and the reports for the periods 1982-84 have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>I understand that a report on the board's monitoring programme for the period 1985-86 will be published shortly. The board's latest estimate is that the average Irish consumer of fish and shellfish would receive an annual dose of less than 0.4 per cent of the annual dose limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to stress that the oil market is remaining calm despite events in the Gulf region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, my Department has in place a detailed emergency response programme which would come into operation in the event of an oil crisis.  This programme, described by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as &ldquo;well-prepared and flexible&rdquo;, centres on the use <Col N="1383" /> of demand restraint measures aimed at limiting the amount of fuel in the hands of the distributors and reducing availability to consumers.</P>
    <P>The legal authority for the implementation of such measures derives from the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, as amended, under which a Government order devolves power on me, as Minister for Energy, to regulate or control the acquisition, supply, distribution and marketing of all fuels in the common good. In addition to overt demand restraint, existing public awareness of the need for moderation in energy use would be bolstered by a publicity campaign.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that Ireland's membership of the IEA and the EC entitles her to a share in any drawdown of strategic stocks held by member states. Under new IEA mechanisms oil stock drawdown arrangements could come into operation within seven days, should the need arise.</P>

      <P>I understand that the proposed Aldradavilla project was a research project into the feasibility of granite as a long term storage location for radioactive waste.  I believe that the decision of the Spanish Government not to proceed with the project sets an example of one country which uses nuclear energy recognising the legitimate concerns of a neighbouring country about the transboundary effects and potential risks which can arise especially where nuclear projects are planned in border or neighbouring areas.  I am encouraged by this development and I trust that it will help our own initiatives on the disposal of nuclear waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal pattern of production from conifer plantations is for thinning to commence when the stand of timber is about 20 years old.  Subsequent thinnings occur at about five year intervals until the plantation is 40 to 50 years of age at which stage the site is clear-felled and replanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action in September contained a mix of thinnings and clearfells.  These thinnings and clearfells came from stands that vary in age, species and growth rates. Many of these stands still have crops which will provide further thinnings and clearfells.  As expenditure and income are spread over a full rotation of up to 50 years, it is not practicable to assess the profitability of these individual stands. The question of transferring a profit or loss to the new forestry company does not arise.  The prices achieved at the auction were up to the highest expectations, <Col N="1385" /> having regard to current market conditions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the return to the State on its investment in forestry, I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the Report of the Forestry Review Group in 1985 which stated that forestry had achieved profitability of 2 per cent over and above inflation.</P>

      <P>The roadways to which the Deputy is referring are known as the &ldquo;Odd Lamp <Col N="1387" /> Road&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Polo Road&rdquo;, which were closed to vehicular traffic last August. The purpose of these closures was to bring land masses together for the enjoyment of the public, to lessen the impact of through traffic using the park and to reduce the number of junctions to the main road, where most accidents in the part occur.  The phased closure of some minor roads in the park was a stated objective of the Phoenix Park management plan launched by the Commissioners of Public Works last year.</P>
      <P>There are alternative routes available to traffic within the park and I cannot accept that the closure of the roads in question causes hardship to any section of the community.</P>

      <P>There is a general scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted under which all persons in the State may claim and which is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Prison officers who are criminally injured in the course of duty may claim under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I take it that in referring to the absence of a scheme of compensation the Deputy has in mind an amendment made to the general scheme with effect from 1 April 1986 to exclude payment of compensation in respect of pain and suffering. The implications of this amendment for prison staff injured in the course of duty have been under examination in my Department for some time but so far it has not proved possible to agree a separate scheme for prison staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prison officers who received criminal injuries in the course of duty are also <Col N="1388" /> subject to the provisions governing occupational injuries which apply to civil servants generally.  These include payment in accordance with the normal sick leave arrangements in respects of officers unfit for work as a results of having been injured in the course of duty and, in cases where officers have to retire, benefits under the Injury Warrant 1946 (as amended by the Injury Warrant 1978).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to a deserted wife's payment is that the claimant's husband has wilfully refused or neglected to contribute to the support and maintenance of her and her children.  This condition is prescribed in regulations under section 100 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  It is also provided by regulation that in determining whether or not a husband contributes to the support and maintenance of his wife, monetary payments and other contributions which are inconsiderable may be disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned is in receipt of £80 a week maintenance from her husband. It has been held by a deciding officer and again by an appeals officer, on appeal, that the level of maintenance payments in this case is such that the claimant is not a deserted wife within the meaning of the relevant legislation and <Col N="1390" /> they have accordingly disallowed the claim on that basis.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of fresh facts or new evidence.  There is no provision in the legislation governing deserted wife's benefit for topping-up payments as suggested in the question. Under the terms of the schemes, a person is qualified for benefit as a deserted wife or not.  If qualified, the benefit is paid irrespective of other income.  In determining whether or not the husband contributes to the support and maintenance of his wife, monetary payments which are inconsiderable in extent may be disregarded. However, once they are considerable in extent, as in the present circumstances, the wife is not regarded as being a deserted wife under the terms of the legislation and she cannot qualify under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is noted that the level of maintenance by the husband in this case was established by a court order made over three years ago.  It is open to the claimant to apply to the court to have the amount increased.  If she is in need, it is also open to her to apply to her local health board for help under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has a total of 122 paid contributions since entry into insurable employment and exhausted his entitlement to disability benefit on 13 February 1979.</P>

    <P>However, the claimant has continued to submit medical evidence to the Department and credited contributions have been awarded to 10 November 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate received.  These credited contributions while not entitling the person concerned to payment, will preserve the <Col N="1392" /> continuity of his insurance record for the duration of his illness.

      <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987 provides a comprehensive legislative <Col N="1393" /> framework for controlling air pollution. Under the arrangements provided for in the Act, it is for the local authorities concerned to consider and implements remedial action on air pollution, including the creation of special control areas, where breaches of prescribed air quality standards occur.  The standards for sulphur dioxide, lead and nitrogen dioxide prescribed in the Air Pollution Act, 1987, (Air Quality Standards) Regulations 1987 (S.I. No. 244 of 1987) are being fully observed.  In the case of certain parts of Dublin, the standards prescribed for smoke have been breached.</P>
      <P>Before creating a special control area, the relevant local authority would have to survey the incidence and causes of air pollution in the areas concerned as well as the systems used for the domestic space heating and cooking, industrial and commercial needs, etc., giving priority to areas of heaviest pollution.  This survey would assist them in considering the desirability of making special control area orders and the appropriate extent and phasing of these.  A special control area order may prohibit the burning of any fuel other than an authorised fuel.</P>

      <P>I am aware that medical preparations do not at present have their non-active ingredients listed.  The Medical Preparations (Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1958 as amended and the relevant EC Directives on Proprietary Medicinal Products do not currently require such listing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its examination of applications for product authorisations for medicinal products the National Drugs Advisory Board take account of the possibility of allergic reactions from the presence of non-active ingredients.  The board take steps to have such ingredients removed where feasible or to inform the user of potential risks.  This is done, in agreement with the applicant, by drawing attention to the presence of the non-active ingredients (which would include those artificial <Col N="1397" /> colouring agents which may cause an allergic reaction) on the label and/or the package insert.</P>
    <P>The presence of lactose presents particular difficulties since it is present in almost all tablets.  Persons with an allergy to lactose should where possible be supplied with the liquid dose forms which do not contain lactose.</P>
