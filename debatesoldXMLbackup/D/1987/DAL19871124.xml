Ach, mar is eol don Aire Stáit é féin, tá an mhonarcha seo dúnta anois le breis agus sé mhí agus tá na daoine sa cheantar ag éirí an-mhífhoighdeach.  Tá cor eile sa scéal, go bhfuil cuid de na daoine a bhí ag obair sa mhonarcha tar éis cuireadh a fháil dul ag obair i dtionscail den chineál céanna i Sasana.  Tá cuid acu ag taisteal an tseachtain seo.  Mar sin, tá brú mór, agus an bhféadfadh sé aon tuairim a thabhairt dúinn cén fad a bheidh sé á mheas nó cén uair is féidir linn a bheith ag súil go ndéanfar socrú éigin an tionscal a athbhunú sa mhonarcha?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the number of State agencies which are either themselves directly involved in, or have plans to become involved in, fish farming or have invested in firms involved in fish farming; and his views on whether a wide dispersal of expertise in this area is a wise policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five agencies involved in a significant way in fish farming.</P>
      <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta, as part of their general Gaeltacht development remit, are directly involved in the encouragement of aquaculture through grants and in the case of Údarás through shareholding.</P>
      <P>The ESB, utilising their expertise deriving from management of hydro schemes have invested directly in salmon farming.  The National Development Corporation have provided venture capital for aquaculture projects.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation have made facilities at Whiddy Island available for experimentation with Norwegian partners in land based salmon farming.</P>
      <P>I do not see this involvement in a complex multi-faceted industry like aquaculture as a problem.  I am making arrangements to manage and co-ordinate the efforts of all those involved so as to avoid duplication and to ensure that the expertise is applied in such a way as to guarantee that the contribution which this important and growing sector can make to national output, employment and exports is maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to formalise a structure to ensure that the key State agencies involved operate in tandem under the <Col N="1440" /> auspices of my Department and I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's statement.  The purpose of my question was to get the Minister to do what he has just announced, to ensure that there would be a formalised system of consultation. May I take it that the Minister agrees with me that having five separate agencies potentially going their separate ways in regard to a matter which is extremely market sensitive is not wise and that there should be co-ordination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there should be co-ordination but I am sure the Deputy is aware that we propose to announce plans, before Christmas we hope, or, if not, immediately after Christmas.  I should like to tell the Deputy that this did not come about as a result of his question.  Quite a lot of work has been put into this since we took office on 10 March last and since the Department of the Marine were established.  I am pleased that there has been a welcome for this from the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he has any plans to strengthen safety regulations for fishing vessels in the light of a number of recent accidents involving loss of life; if it is intended to introduce controls on the design of vessels and limits on the load they may carry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Current legislation regarding safety of fishing vessels is contained in the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1983 and in rules and regulations made thereunder.  These cover safety equipment to be carried in a fishing boat, registration of fishing boats, manning and certification of crews, provision of radio installations, musters and safety of navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of fishing vessels has been <Col N="1441" /> a matter of great concern at international level for some time, but the great differences in design and operation between fishing vesels and other types of ships has always proved a major obstacle to their inclusion in the International Maritime Organisation's Safety of Life at Sea Convention and Load Lines Convention.</P>
    <P>The International Maritime Organisation studied in great detail the specific problems relating to fishing vessels and their findings formed the basis of a Convention, adopted in 1977, called the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels.  This Convention incorporates the safety requirements for the construction and equipment of new, decked fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over, including those vessels also processing their catch. Because of difficulties perceived by many member states, including Ireland, with its provisions, the Convention has not as yet entered into force.  The Convention is under review by the IMO and my Department will examine any amended version with a view to incorporating its provisions into domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>I also propose to make regulations shortly which revise the manning and certification requirements relating to fishing vessels.  The proposed new regulations take account of the trend towards larger fishing vessels of considerably increased engine power and correspondingly increased range and will require for the first time the carriage of qualified engineer officers on board fishing vessels. These regulations will improve considerably safety on board fishing vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that neither current Department regulations nor obligations by the State under the Torremolinos International Convention 1977 cover boats under 40 feet?  Will the Minister accept that there is an urgent need for his Department to regulate such things as the weight that boats of under 40 feet carry and the need to carry life rafts or life jackets, none of which is legally obligated on such vessels at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1442" />
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that that is the position.  There is legislation in existence concerning the safety of fishing vessels.  Under the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1983 there are rules and regulations covering safety equipment to be carried by fishing boats as well as registration, provision of radio installations and the manning and certification of crews.  There is primary legislation in relation to life saving and fire appliances and liability on an owner and master of a vessel.  Another provision provides authority to survey a ship to ensure compliance with requirements in relation to life saving appliances.  I should like to tell the Deputy that we have not ratified the Torremolinos Convention and I understand that it cannot be ratified until such time that 50 per cent of the shipping tonnage in the world agree to it.  We are far from that position at the moment but we could ratify the part of the Convention that relates to safety at sea.  I expect that Convention to be amended in the near future and we should await that before giving consideration to ratification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister of State for outlining the areas covered by regulations under maritime shipping laws but what he has said only confirms my view that issues such as the design, the weight of the load that can be carried, the need to carry a life raft or life jacket are not obligatory on boats under 40 feet.  Has the Minister's Department any intention of taking action in regard to those matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is not obligatory and the reason is the cumbersome nature of life jackets.  Now that smaller life jackets are available we are making every effort to impress on fishermen the need to wear them at all times.  It is also a matter for the owners and masters to ensure that is done.  We will have another look at this area and, if necessary, we will consider introducing an order.  Fishermen will agree about the cumbersome nature of some of the life jackets.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the boat involved in this unfortunate accident off Malin Head in September, the <i>Boy Seán</i>&mdash; four fishermen lost their lives in that accident &mdash; was 36 feet.  In view of the fact tha seven lives were lost this year, will the Minister not agree that it is time a regulation was introduced by the Department?  Encouragement is not enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention of the unfortunate accident off Malin Head in which four men lost their lives gives me an opportunity to sympathise with the McDaid family on their tragic loss.  Hopefully the body which is still missing will be found and can be laid to rest.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar anamacha na ndaoine sin.  An investigation is being carried out by an inspector of my Department and we hope to have a full report soon, which will be available only to the Minister for the Marine.  If he finds it necessary to have a public inquiry, that will be his decision.  As I said, we are awaiting the report and we may have a lot to learn from it.</P>

      <P>The limit of 32,000 tonnes gross registered tonnage on the Irish fleet was included in an EC Commission decision of 24 April 1985 in the context of Irish multi-annual guidance programme submitted under the 1983 structures regulation.  The decision was taken under the management committee procedure in spite of opposition from Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have submitted a new multi-annual guidance programme in respect of the fleet and aquaculture in accordance with the most recently adopted structures regulation.  The programme envisages an increase in the overall GRT of the fleet and a decision is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>I admit obvious mistakes were made then and we are doing our utmost to rectify those mistakes.  A limit of 32,000 tonnes gross registered tonnage could have serious effect for the industry if we are to modernise and develop our fleet, even for safety reasons, to fish in waters off any of our coasts, but particularly the west coast, to take up our white fish quotas, to continue to build on the non-quota species, such as blue whiting and horse mackerel and, hopefully, to obtain the increased quotas before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if we are, and have been for some time, exceeding considerably the 32,000 tonnes upper limit of gross registered tonnage and if we are outside the law?  Is there any risk of further applications in the immediate future being refused whether for grant-aid or licence on the basis of the existing figure of 32,000 tonnes?  What figure of gross registered tonnage has the Minister included in his recent submission to which he referred as being acceptable under the multi-annual guidance programme?</P>

      <P>We were operating well above the 32,000 gross registered tonnage limit, and we are not ashamed to say this.  Mistakes were made and we have to rectify them.  We must try to achieve the maximum figure but the figure I gave was that which was given on 31 December 1984.  I believe that figure should have been approximately 45,000 tonnes.  On 1 January 1987 the gross registered tonnage stood at about 53,000 tonnes.  We are negotiating with the Commission at the moment and we are trying to achieve a substantial increase on this 32,000 tonnes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13, 17 and Written Question No. 71, together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to the reply of 31 March 1987 in which the then Minister for Communications explained that the question of providing financial assistance for the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited raises complex and sensitive issues.</P>
      <P>At the moment, despite an exhaustive review of the situation of the former employees, it has not been possible to find a means of making available further payments beyond the statutory entitlements which have already been paid.  I wish to reassure the Deputies, however, that the legal issues involved in the matter are under active scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that while the matter remains unresolved, it would be inappropriate, if not misleading both to the House and to the employees concerned, to make specific provisions in the Estimates.</P>

Recently a meeting was held between the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, the Minister for Labour and representatives of the Irish Shipping Limited workers.  At that meeting it was explained <Col N="1448" /> that the Government had inherited a difficult and complex legal situation and we said we wanted to have a further look at this before taking any action.  As I said, there are legal complexities involved and the commercial law has taught all of us that, if there are unsecured creditors, there is a knock-on effect which could have drastic consequences for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Every consideration <Col N="1449" /> is being given to the legal complexities involved.  As the Deputy is a member of a party which is very concerned about financial rectitude, he should be aware of the knock-on effect which such payment would have.  The former Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, said in the House on 15 October that he went to the Attorney General's office to establish the legal complexities and he was informed that the knock-on effect could amount to over £200 million.

These preliminary discussions took place between a company and the British authorities in relation to this matter.  My understanding is that no application has been made and we have been given an assurance that, in the event of an application being received we will be fully consulted before a decision is made.

      <P>I will certainly ask the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and the Office of Public Works to have a look at the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and the Office of Public Works are considering a number of projects and if <Col N="1455" /> such a scheme is not one of them I can ask them to include it for consideration. Bank clearance works, minor improvements, and work on access to the canals are being carried out.  The projects are generally outside Dublin.  However, the board and the Office of Public Works have considered a number of projects in the inner city area.  Difficulties regarding access and the availability of finance is limiting the extent to which the board can carry out these works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the criteria for regulating scallop fishing; the value of scallop sales; if there is a close season; the fishing limit; if beam trawlers can fish scallops within the 12-mile limit; if there are departmental inspections or checking; and if so, how often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Scallops are subject to a minimum landing size of 100 millimetres. There is no national close season but local close seasons apply in some areas of Kerry, Galway and Donegal. Skin-diving for scallops is also prohibited. The landed value of scallops in 1986 was £626,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no restrictions on areas where scallops may be fished but beam trawlers exceeding 24 metres in overall <Col N="1457" /> length with engine power greater than 221 kilowatts are prohibited from fishing scallops within 12 nautical miles of baselines under EC Regulation 3094/86.  The use of beam trawlers with an aggregate beam length of greater than eight metres is also prohibited in this area.</P>
    <P>My Department's sea fishery officers and regional fisheries boards' protection staff carry out routine inspections on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the regulations relating to the size limit and close seasons.  The Naval Service as part of its patrols monitors compliance with the EC regulation on beam trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How do our regulations or lack of them compare with other countries in Europe?  Is the Minister aware that beam trawlers that accord with the description the Minister has just given are fishing scallops within the 12-mile limit off our coasts and that inspections, such as they are, do not appear to have the necessary detrimental effect?  Would it be possible to ensure that more vigilance is operated in this area?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is impossible to eliminate, but it is our intention to ensure that boats outside the specifications referred to in my reply are not allowed to do this.  If the Deputy knows of certain vessels and wishes to give me the information privately I will pursue them.  I have no doubt that the naval authorities and the fishery officers responsible are not turning a blind eye to this.  We do not condone this and we will pursue these people as vigorously as possible.  These are renewable resources and we must ensure that all adhere to the general regulations and the local by-laws in the three relevant areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will outline the position taken by the Government at the sitting of the Oslo Commission held in Cardiff in June 1987 on the issue of an imposition of a termination date for the dumping of sewage waste and incinerated waste at sea; if he will outline the reasons for this position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish position at the meeting of the Commission of this Convention in Cardiff was that it could not at this stage support proposals for the phasing out of sewage waste dumping at sea or the setting of a <Col N="1459" /> date for the termination of sea incineration for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  These disposal methods are allowed only where they are the only option considered environmentally acceptable and preferable to other disposal methods and where they are the only practical solution available for the material involved.</P>
    <P>Permits to dump or incinerate are given only where examination of possible alternatives shows that these are not feasible and dump-sites are monitored to ensure no environmental damage is caused.</P>
    <P>(b)  They may in many cases be the disposal option of least detriment to man and the environment.</P>
    <P>(c)  Should they be discontinued there might be an increase in illegal discharges to the marine environment from land based sources and/or the use of disposal methods on land which might lead to additional environmental hazards.</P>

When this area of responsibility was transferred to the new Department of the Marine from the Department of the Environment am I correct in thinking that there had been draft proposals or heads of a Bill in relation to legislation in this area gathering dust for some time?  Indeed, it is a indictment of all of us over the past ten <Col N="1461" /> to 20 years that we have not tackled this problem by way of the proper procedures.

      <P>It is a matter for BIM to answer that question but I can give an opinion in that the fairest way would be first in first served.  A vital factor would be that of employment and labour content.  It is a matter entirely for BIM.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed. I accept what the Minister says, that BIM will answer my question, but I thought it was within his area to answer that very important question, because it has already arisen.  There are more applications on hand for this year than can be processed.  Apart from selecting the applicants on specific criteria, BIM will not know what moneys they will have in 1989 when their 10 per cent of this year's applicants will be due to be paid.  Would the Minister consider a three year rolling budget for BIM to ensure <Col N="1466" /> maximum use of scarce resources? Would he consider decreasing the appalling 35 year old average age of our fleet at present?  Would the Minister consider a three year rolling budget so that this year's applicants could be considered in the light of BIM's allocation for 1989? Perhaps progress could then be made.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that we have a problem in that some of the youngest boats are eight years old and it is vitally important that as many new boats as possible come on stream.  I would like to think that we could do what the Deputy suggests but the Government cannot make a commitment in advance. We can assume that there will be a commitment each year but, as Deputy Doyle will be aware from her time as Minister of State, no Government can make a commitment in advance.  I assure the Deputy I will do all in my power to ensure that finances are available each year.  Suffice it to say that we have a commitment, that we are anxious to ensure that as many new boats as possible will come on stream and that we will take full advantage of the facilities that are available under FEOGA.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that this system is making nonsense of the new marine credit plan which has been announced?  The applicants that need approval this year will not be considered for payment until 1989 at the earliest, or maybe 1990.  There is a two year time lag for EC approval and for construction.  If we do not know what money will be available in 1989 or 1990, BIM will not be in a position to approve even a portion of the applications they are receiving.  It is making a farce of the situation when we so badly need new boats.</P>

      <P>The money which <Col N="1467" /> has been provided for 1988 in the Book of Estimates will be adequate.  The Deputy is assuming that after 1988 it is a <i>fait accompli</i> that we will not be providing moneys.  The Government and my Department have a commitment and I am as anxious as the Deputy in this regard.  Because of the complexities of the matter the Government cannot make a commitment in advance.  The Deputy can rest assured that both the Minister and I will do our utmost to ensure that sufficient moneys are provided each year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other point raised by the Deputy, that we are running ahead of ourselves, it does not normally follow that when one applies to BIM one will have to wait six or 12 months to obtain approval or otherwise, or if they are successful that it will take eight to 12 months, depending on the tranche in Europe, before one can start work on the boat. That does not normally happen.  What happens in practice is that immediately the application is submitted to Europe one is in a position to start on the work. I do not see any great difficulties in that area.  I would like to think that we could plan that far ahead financially but Governments do not commit money in advance.</P>

      <P>The amount of the mackerel quota available to Irish fishermen on Friday last was 1,168 tonnes.  This represents the balance outstanding from the 1987 quota of 79,350 tonnes and the additional 7,000 tonnes secured by way of quota exchanges with other member states. <Col N="1468" /> Discussions are currently ongoing with a number of other member states with a view to possibly securing further amounts but this will depend on the ability of these member states to make further amounts available and on our being in a position to offer in exchange the species which they desire.</P>

      <P>What quota does the Minister intend to swap and what are the countries with whom he is negotiating for a swap at present?  Can he confirm that, as there is less than 1,000 tonnes of this year's quota left, his advice to the Donegal trawlermen is that if they all leave the port together with the knowledge that there is, say, 1,000 tonnes left and they all arrive back with about 3,500 tonnes between them, it will be in order and that this might be a way of securing the small amount of quota that is left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already advised the Deputy in this House that she should be very careful when she obtains information from a particular source or sources.  I kindly advise the Deputy today again that she should not accept information from those sources.  On the first occasion on which I answered questions in the House, I advised the Deputy that we would do all in our power in this <Col N="1469" /> matter, the situation being that her Government had at the time secured a quota of some 79,000 tonnes.  If I come back with anything less than a reasonable increase on that quota, I shall hang my head in shame but I have no intention of securing less than a reasonable increase. The last Government allowed indiscriminate fishing over a six week period, which was in no way advantageous to the producer, processor or factory worker, and they closed the season in the middle of February.  That Government took political advantage of that time.  They left the incoming Government with a 7,000 tonnes quota for the end of the season. We secured an additional 7,000 tonnes at the expense of other types of fish, but certainly not at the expense of the fishermen. We have a total quota of 14,000 tonnes and a balance of 1,168 tonnes and if the Deputy's friends were factual with her they would tell her how pleased they are with our operation.</P>
      <P>In addition, we set a precedent in having this matter put on the agenda of a meeting which was cancelled today, but my Minister and I have asked that that meeting be rescheduled at the earliest possible date.  We are at a very sensitive stage of negotiation.  This evening I shall again be looking after the best interests of our fishermen and, it is hoped, shall secure an additional quota which will bring us nearer to the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution of harbour authorities under the Harbours Act, 1946 provides for a wide spread of representation which is intended to ensure that sectional interests do not dominate.  If harbour authorities exceed their powers under the Act they are liable to be challenged in the courts.  Having regard to the outcome of recent relevant court proceedings, however, I am considering <Col N="1471" /> whether the time has now come for me to exercise my powers under the Act to make regulations in respect of the procedure and business of a harbour authority.</P>

      <P>Under this Act, the harbour authorities may regulate their procedures by way of standing orders. In the particular case to which Deputy Pattison refers, the harbour authorities have since then either altered or introduced standing orders and under these orders they could then exclude from discussions or from voting a member or members with a direct interest.  Of course, the Minister may bring in regulations and if necessary he will do so.  In the meantime, I propose to contact the harbour authorities around the country and establish the standing orders which exist.  First and foremost, those authorities should make use and take advantage of the section of the Act which permits them to introduce these standing orders, if necessary.  We are taking this matter very seriously and looking at the question of procedures, with particular reference to the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sea fishing boat licences have been issued in respect of beam-trawlers over the last six months to fishermen in Killybegs and Clogherhead. In September, when approval in principle was granted for the issue of sea fishing <Col N="1472" /> boat licences in respect of five beam-trawlers, I decided that, for the future, licences for beam-trawlers would issue on a strict replacement basis only.  This decision was based on the uptake of our whitefish quotas, particularly of sole and plaice and in the light of present fleet capacity engaged in fishing for these species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister considering introducing a charge for these licences in future?  Is he aware that a beam-trawler licence has been issued in the last few months to a person who has not even got a boat and never had one?  What are the criteria for land based people obtaining such licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is no intention of introducing a licence fee.  Of course, there are conditions attaching to these licences.  One of the main conditions indicates our anxiety about over fishing in the Celtic Sea.  The five licences which were issued at that time excluded the Celtic Sea.  One of these licences must be taken up by 1 December and the other four by 1 January, so there is no question of any landlubbers or land based fishermen receiving these licences.  All licences will be issued in the best interests of the fishermen and at all times we shall take into consideration the species involved, species under pressure and the very important question of employment and labour content.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not taken up by 1 January these people will be in a position to re-apply and I do not think that that would prejudice their applications. They will be treated as all other applications in the same way as we will receive as and from 1 January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House during the debate <Col N="1474" /> on security matters on 10 November, there are reasons for believing that four separate cargoes of arms and ammunition may have been landed here by the Provisional IRA during 1985 and 1986.  There are indications that the combined tonnage of the four cargoes may have exceeded that on board the <i>Eksund</i>.  It is the professional judgment of the Garda Síochána who have evaluated the intelligence in this case that it is sufficient to warrant the actions being taken.  In those circumstances there is a most serious obligation on the Government to make every effort to establish whether those arms were, in fact, landed and to find them, if indeed they are here.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, early yesterday morning the Garda, supported by the Army, commenced the most comprehensive search ever mounted by the security forces of the State.  The search is being particularly concentrated in the counties close to the Border, but major searches are in progress throughout the rest of the country also.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for any suggestion that there was unnecessary delay in getting this search under way.  Intelligence relating to matters of this nature has to be evaluated carefully before action is decided on and extensive searches such as the one currently under way are major logistical exercises which, of their nature, require detailed planning if they are to be thorough and effective. This is so particularly when two separate branches of the security forces are involved.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to give complete details of the material being sought.  The intelligence that is available suggests that it is similar to that carried on board the <i>Eksund.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was considered appropriate that the public should be told as fully as possible what was happening once the security forces had taken up their positions and had commenced the search.  This was done to allay any fear or alarm that such a large scale operation might cause, to bring home to the public the seriousness of the threat and to enlist their help in the search.  I believe that it is unreasonable to <Col N="1475" /> suggest that this operation could, in any event, have remained secret for any length of time.</P>
    <P>The prevention of the importation of such munitions by subversives in the future is being given serious consideration in consultation with the security forces.</P>

Secondly, in view of the Minister's ordering, which I assume he did, of this operation to take place, can he tell us if he has information as to where the cargoes came from and if he will now divulge that information to this House which is the proper place to make such information known?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject the insinuations in the Deputy's questions.  I have clearly said that after very careful analysis by the security forces of the information which was available to them, then and only then, was the plan drawn up to carry out the search which is at present under way.  There was no delay whatsoever but very careful planning had to go into the organisation of this search.  In regard to the insinuation made by Deputy Barrett in relation to the newspapers, I can only say that this operation was planned with the greatest secrecy and that there were not leaks about it nor was any request made to the newspapers to hold off, as has been suggested.  In regard to what the Garda may have found, we are in day two of a very big search.  When the search has been conducted then and only then will I ask the Garda to let us know what they have found and I think that is a reasonable position to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two questions.  In view of his statement that he sought no news blackout, would the Minister not agree that prudence in carrying out an operation of this nature would require him to have a news blackout and to advance the search to the maximum possible extent before this hit the news media, thereby tipping off people who might be able to move around the very material which the security forces are looking for?  Would the Minister not agree that he was detracting very much from the capability of the <Col N="1479" /> security forces in taking away the element of surprise which in most military establishments is regarded as of crucial importance but is not so, apparently, to this Minister?  Secondly, when he says with some degree of confidence that he is relying on our own intelligence services for his information about the Libyan involvement &mdash; which is fine as far as it goes &mdash; will he not agree that it is standard practice in the field of intelligence to seek information from all intelligence that is available from friendly countries who may have means of surveillance by satellite or otherwise?  Has he done that? Does he intend to do it?  If not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with the two supplementaries raised by the Deputy.  Of course, he should know that our security forces work in the closest co-operation with all other security forces and we hope that will continue and they will be able to help one another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, the Deputy should know that the security forces agree that this search would benefit considerably if the public knew and were aware of what was going on and it was with their approval &mdash; I stress that &mdash; that the announcement was made at the time it was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement of approval by the Garda and the fact that he did not ask for a blackout, why did a number of senior gardaí ask newspapers and RTE not to publicise this matter when they became aware of it on Sunday and made inquiries from the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that nobody was empowered by the organisers of this operation to ask the newspapers for the blackout Deputy O'Malley suggests they were asked for.  I was in my office very late on Sunday evening when a leading <Col N="1480" /> correspondent of one of the national dailies rang my office to find out what, if anything, was going on because quite a number of cars were seen outside my office late on Sunday night.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one senior Garda officer said that his actions deprived the Garda Síochána and Army search of its main strength, the element of surprise?  In case people think I am causing trouble, that is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  Would the Minister not think that if there is such a threat to the security of the State the present Taoiseach had an obligation to brief the leaders of the Opposition parties before such a massive search took place?  In line with the action of the Government in relation to many matters, everything is done outside this House as distinct from inside it.  Would the Minister not agree that when the Taoiseach was in Opposition he complained bitterly any time a statement of any description was made outside this House that he felt concerned him?</P>

I have contacted your office in writing but you may not have seen the correspondence because you were in the Chamber.  What I am seeking is in accordance with Standing Order 28 of the Orders of this House.  I request your permission to move an addendum to the Labour Party amendment, amendment No. 2, to the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Front Bench which is due to be decided in Private Members' Time this evening.  The addendum will read as follows: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann further calls on each party represented in the Dáil to endeavour to co-operate in finding alternative ways of meeting the Government's overall targets, in order to ensure that the pupil/teacher ratio in primary education <Col N="1549" /> can be maintained at the same level as heretofore.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last week, I had covered most of the ground in relation to the specifics of the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which I wanted to draw to the attention of the Minister and to request him and the Department of the Environment, in the formulation of his reply, to have regard to those measures and see if they would be in a position to respond to them. Many of the points I made were centred more on the administration of the Minister's Department than on the intricacies of the legislation itself.  It is a convention on Second Stage debates to cover generally the areas which the legislation addresses, so I feel I was in order in covering that ground in a fairly substantial way.</P>
      <P>It is my view and the view of the Labour Party that the overall changes in the Public Capital Programme for 1988, as indicated in the Estimates, combined with the effect of this year's budget, which is now currently in operation on the ground, will reduce severely the supply of local authority housing and as a consequence will drive more marginal people, from the point of view of disposable incomes for housing purposes, into the area of low cost loans and into the area which this legislation proposes to cover. Because of the system that is proposed in Housing Circular 10/87 and the way the Government are proceeding to act we are going to compound unnecessarily the housing difficulties these people have.  I will repeat what I said in relation to that area but I want to summarise in essence what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, by effectively shifting its responsibility for a large amount of housing loan capital to the private lending associations, is in the process &mdash; in order to ensure that the private lending institutions will offer mortgages to people of modest means &mdash; of underwriting certain ceilings up to a maximum of 50 per cent by way of guarantee in the case of default. We have nothing against that principle. Indeed, it has certain merits because those institutions appear to have a lot of savings capital that is not being properly used.  Some form of guarantee for people <Col N="1557" /> with marginal incomes who are coming into the mortgage market would probably be necessary.  One could argue technically on what is the best way to do it, but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the bureaucracy in O'Connell Bridge House is obsessively concerned with matching paper with paper and guarantee with guarantee.  The reason for that might be to cover the condition of the guarantee whereby if an applicant is to be successfully considered by a local authority he will have to have two refusals in writing from two lending institutions, for example, a bank and a building society, or any combination of those.  This will be a counter productive measure from the point of view of encouraging people to house themselves. This is particularly so when it is recognised that much of the demand in this sector will come from people who will no longer be able to look to a local authority to house them because of the squeeze in the Public Capital Programme on that area of supply.</P>
    <P>The view I put forward is not one that is expressed just by me or held by my party; it is a view that has been communicated to me from a number of channels. A number of councillors have been in contact with me directly as a result of the receipt of the circular and the accompanying press release which went to every housing authority.  A number of housing officers, with whom I have had private conversations, expressed their dissatisfaction and bewilderment at the motivation behind this.  The Irish Home Builders Association which is a subsidiary of the Construction Industry Federation issued a document entitled &ldquo;Budget Submission On Private Sector Housing&rdquo; in November 1987.  No doubt the Department have already received a copy of this document.  They refer specifically to the deterrent effect this new administrative system will have on the people who are coming into the lowest, most exposed and most fraught end of the housing market and the unnecessary hoops they will be forced to jump through.</P>
    <P>Not alone will they have to do that but they will be faced with all of the <Col N="1558" /> arguments I referred to the last time I spoke, for example, humiliation, duplication and bureaucracy for what appears to be bureaucracy's sake.  Many people may decide simply not to bother and this may compound other difficulties which they may have within their families. Deputies are well aware of the impact bad housing has on family life in many ways.</P>
    <P>If this is not just a cautious bureaucratic response, which is the benign interpretation of the motivation for this administration procedure, there is the malign interpretation that somewhere in the bowels of Merrion Street there are people who have always argued, from the point of view of the Department of Finance that there is too much State assistance in the housing sector and they should make things more difficult for people rather than easier for them and that this requirement will have that effect no matter how tortuous or convoluted it may appear to be.  If my malign interpretation is correct &mdash; and I hope this is not the case &mdash; I hope the Department of the Environment have not succumbed to the Department of Finance.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity in his reply to clarify this point.  We are deducing the reasons this administrative system has been put in place.</P>
    <P>I know this is the day when we are apparently asking the Government to withdraw circulars and I do not think the circular which I have asked to be withdrawn has aroused anything like the same degree of controversy, newsworthiness or column interest as the education one has.  I suggest, with all due respect, that the Department should reconsider the operation of this system as a matter of urgency.  They should rephrase or clarify the circular and look again at the requirement for written refusal from two financial institutions and replace it with a set of criteria that could be drawn up fairly reasonably so that the system could run effectively and efficiently.  I have no reason to believe that is not the Minister's genuine motivation and I urge him to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>Despite the assurances we received <Col N="1559" /> before we went into this part of today's business &mdash; the Chair will recall that on the Order of Business the Minister for the Environment indicated that two pieces of legislation would be introduced in this House between now and the end of this session &mdash; I would be pleasantly surprised if we got to the stage of having these Bills circulated, having regard to the business to be dealt with.  We would be lucky if we reached the Second Stage either on the Bill Deputy Gay Mitchell has been pursuing for some time dealing with Raglan House or the more general Bill dealing with homeless persons.  Since we are unlikely to have an opportunity before next April of discussing housing in any substantial way, I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the experienced Deputy he is, appreciates that he has been delightfully out of order.  On Second Stage of the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, he must use his ingenuity to refer to what is or should be in the legislation.  He cannot, as he knows, range over the area of housing generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for one moment would I attempt to do so.  I was attempting to say what I was not going to do in order to justify it.  This, in summary, is the only housing finance legislation we are likely to have for the foreseeable future.  Perhaps I was over-extensive in range when making that point.  I would like the Minister in his reply on Second Stage to what I proposed to be an amendment to a very successful housing finance institution, the HFA, to indicate to the House, since he has sought to make a massive change in the ceiling of capital borrowings that the HFA will now be entitled to borrow, what other structural changes he would see in the way the HFA disburse their funds.  It is clear there will be a massive change in the demand for housing in our economy over the next number of years. Not only will there be a quantitative change but there is also likely to be a fairly substantial qualitative change in the <Col N="1560" /> type, location, and structure of that demand.</P>
      <P>We are looking at the legislation in the context of the 1987 budget, which has withdrawn an enormous amount of support from the housing market; the housing supply, new house construction and home improvements.  I would draw the Minister's attention to two documents.  I have already referred to the submission by the Irish Home Builders' Association. The second document from the Construction Industry Federation has also been submitted to the Government in advance of the 1988 budget and is entitled <i>Crisis in Construction</i>&mdash; A Strategy for Survival.  I think, Sir, you will realise that when a body such as the Construction Industry Federation which in the past has placed so much hope on the Fianna Fáil Party in Government delivering support to the building industry submit a document with that title it is clear there are major difficulties.</P>
      <P>If this legislation is to have any substantial relevance to the taxpayers who are represented in this House and to the administrators who derive their powers and authority from the laws which we enact &mdash; and we are in the process of debating the enlargement of the amount of money the HFA can borrow by way of State guaranteed sums which will ultimately fall on the shoulders of the taxpayer &mdash; it is right and proper that we should hear from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing what he proposes to do in responding to the changing nature of housing demand in our society over the next five to six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear there will probably be less than 2,000 local authority dwellings completed in 1988.  The figures and estimates vary and in the absence of a detailed response to written questions I can only speculate.  The highest figure I have seen is 3,000 for houses to be completed this year with a much lower figure in the following year because of the decline in house starts.  If that happens and if the Minister has no other proposals for altering the mix of supports that currently exist for housing supply, for assisting local authorities to provide additional <Col N="1561" /> supply through different mechanisms, such as the restoration of some form of the £5,000 buy-out grant that was so successful in stimulating local authority housing supply, we really need to look at whether the provisions of this Bill go far enough, whether the administration of the HFA and the guarantees that are being delivered will be sufficient to meet housing demands in the 1988-90 period when I expect by and large that the present Administration will still have responsibility for Government.  Unless the Government start to take significant steps now they will bring about, either by accident or by Department of Finance design, a managed, engineered housing crisis in our society.</P>
    <P>The industry, represented through the CIF, has submitted two documents which are clearly indicative of a dramatic downturn in demand.  Those documents should, I believe, be measured against the background of demand which underpins any housing finance agency legislation, namely, the changing structure of the Irish population.  I draw the Minister's attention to a document published in September of this year by Davy Kelleher McCarthy Ltd. which deals in detail with forecasts of population and the labour force to 2011.  A recent experience of demographic forecasting would make anybody wary about projecting too far ahead but on the basis of headship rates, the base upon which housing demands can be calculated, there are already sufficient indicators to enable us to be relatively secure in our interpretation of what demand is likely to be, within a reasonable range.</P>
    <P>I would put to the Minister and his Department that there is enough documentation and basic research available to back up individual changes, whether in the Housing Finance Agency, the grants structure or in unilaterally withdrawing full support for local authority house-building programmes.  In order that a reasoned and rational debate takes place in our society and particularly in this House, on the housing policy we now need, it would be very useful and constructive <Col N="1562" /> if the Minister were to bring forward a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I believe we really need a very clear and comprehensive outline of the total housing package, of which this legislation is simply a part.  The Government for a variety of reasons have dismantled an entire interlocking comprehensive housing support system that produced among other things the highest rate of home ownership in the world, which reduced for the first time in living memory real levels of local authority housing waiting lists and precipitated a massive amount of home improvements in the existing stock.  While it has been argued by Government Deputies and Ministers that such a package could not be sustained on grounds of cost, nobody argued that the package was not comprehensive and that it did not address in its own way different subsectors of the housing market while this legislation refers to only one.</P>
    <P>I would say, Sir, unless you want to find yourself subject to arbitrary criticism, which in many cases might be ill-timed or apparently unjust because it does not understand or fully comprehend the entire range of activities that you are trying to undertake, I suggest that there is a clear and urgent need to put a new comprehensive housing policy in place as the Government have effectively demolished the present housing policy.  First and foremost, the Government need to bring forward a White Paper outlining the changing nature of housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Minister should revise or withdraw the housing circular which is giving administrative effect to this amending legislation.  Secondly, he should look at the impact of the capital structure allocation for 1988 on the operation of this legislation because of the effect on people on the housing waiting list.  Finally, if the Minister wants to have the support of this House for constructive measures in the housing area &mdash; nobody has a monopoly of wisdom or fortitude in these areas &mdash; he should bring forward on the basis of the new demographic factors now emerging a White Paper on housing that would enable us to have a proper debate throughout the country and in local authorities so that we could get on to dealing with new kinds of housing problems which certainly exist and which will undoubtedly become worse if action is not taken quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the purpose of this Bill is to increase from £500 million to £1,000 million the Housing Finance Agency's ability to borrow and to empower the Minister to contribute towards the cost of the agency.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency, together with the other publicly-funded loans schemes, have contributed very greatly to the ability of people of modest means to acquire their own homes.  Most Irish people and families are very keen at all costs to become owners of their own place of residence.  Figures show that we have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the entire world.  This has been helped in no small way by the contribution of the publicly-funded loans schemes throughout the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency introduced pay-related schemes which gave people the courage they needed to <Col N="1564" /> acquire their own homes.  They encouraged them to make the necessary commitment to such an acquisition.  The acquisition of a home or unit of accommodation is for most people the single greatest transaction they will undertake in the course of their lives.  The Housing Finance Agency scheme gives local authority tenants the confidence to acquire their own homes.  People experience a sense of satisfaction and commitment when they become owners of their place of residence.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency took a great step forward by relating repayments to income.  It changed the face of local authority home ownership.  Allied to the £5,000 grant, the changes in local authority schemes, particularly in Dublin city and county, were quite significant. While the £5,000 grant was very much welcomed at the time, we are now seeing the negative effects of this grant.  I would not suggest for a moment that it should never have been made available to local authority tenants of three years standing to help them acquire their own homes but certain people involved in social work at that time began to make the point that there was a price to pay, particularly because there was no tenant purchase scheme for part of this period.  I think the period involved was 1984 to 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  The local authority tenant who wished to become a home owner during that time found himself compelled to vacate his local authority house.  Had a suitable tenant purchase scheme been in operation at that time we would not necessarily have seen mass movement out of the local authority estates.  This point was made time and again by social workers and community leaders in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now seeing the results in the local authority estates, particularly in Dublin.  Over 400 housing units are empty, a terrible waste of national resources.  It is not right to claim that we should carry on with the major house building programmes we have had in <Col N="1565" /> recent times.  In many areas of our towns and cities we have a surplus of local authority houses.  We must get the balance right before we embark again on local authority house building.</P>
    <P>In my own area of Tallaght and Clondalkin vast numbers of houses are empty, subject to unauthorised entry and interference. The regrettable result is that Dublin Corporation have embarked on a policy of bricking up empty houses in the estates, although they are in the administrative area of Dublin County Council. I have told corporation officials that this is a retrograde step because the appearance of these bricked up houses leaves a lot to be desired.  Offering an empty house to a family in need does not always meet with success because prospective tenants are put off by the environment of the estate in which they are shown these surplus houses.  I would like to see an end to that practice.  There should be adequate security in those empty units until such time as they are required for proper letting.</P>
    <P>It is the wish of most people to own their own home and local authority purchase schemes have helped many in the past.  It makes sound sense for the Minister to turn to the private lending institutions to help people purchase their own homes.  I have always felt that such institutions were ultra-cautious and ultra-conservative when lending to people of modest means.  They tended to go after the best applicants and were not always prepared to accommodate the person of modest means who, as a result, had to approach a local authority.  The Minister's agreement with the private lending institutions should be applauded.  Those groups should carry some responsibility for helping people to acquire their own homes by extending house purchase loans to people of modest means.</P>
    <P>An example of how cautious such institutions are is that when loans fall into arrears they seek repossession of the property.  I know of cases where those institutions were harsh in their approach and adopted the attitude that if they repossessed the house the local authorities <Col N="1566" /> would step in to house the person concerned.  That is not the proper approach.  Those institutions are in the business of lending money to people to purchase houses and they should have a greater commitment to help those who find themselves in difficulties.  They should concentrate their energies on helping people get over temporary difficulties and not be so quick to seek possession. The building societies and the banks should play a greater role in helping people cope with any difficulties they may experience in meeting their mortgage repayments just as local authorities do.</P>
    <P>The tenant purchase scheme introduced recently by the Minister has proved very popular.  For two years people were not able to purchase the local authority house in which they lived for many years and for which they had paid a lot of rent. It is pleasing to know that many people have decided to remain in their own community in stark contrast to what occurred between 1984 and 1986.  I hope we will always have a tenant purchase scheme to enable local authority tenants purchase their own home.  We are all aware of the drawbacks of large scale movement from local authority housing estates.  Over the years local authority tenants developed basic facilities in their estates and fostered a community spirit.  Housing estates of 300 or 400 houses developed their own identity and the tenants developed a commitment to their environment.  Community leaders emerged and they gave guidance and assistance to their neighbours. Unfortunately, when those people acquired their own home and left such housing estates they left such communities without leaders.</P>
    <P>Another by-product of that movement of people was that only those who were in employment found themselves in a position to obtain house purchase loans. In most cases the new occupier of local authority houses was unemployed and such estates became places of substantial unemployment.  An example is the area of Fettercairn in my constituency where more than 70 per cent of the workforce are unemployed.  Many of the original <Col N="1567" /> tenants availed of the various loans and grants to acquire their own home outside the area.  Such a big movement of people from local authority areas will not occur again if we provide an adequate tenant purchase scheme.  The Minister should examine this to see if it is necessary to streamline the existing scheme so as to encourage more people to buy out their house.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that local authorities will benefit if more tenants decide to buy out their house.  The first benefit that springs to mind is the reduction in the provision for maintenance.  We are all aware that the cost of maintaining local authority houses is substantial.  From figures provided by the Minister it is obvious that there is a substantial gap between the amount collected in rents and the cost of carrying out necessary repair work to houses.  Another advantage is that there will be stability in local authority areas and those of us who represent such estates will welcome that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to encourage building societies and lending institutions to play a greater role in funding people of modest means who wish to purchase their own home.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the scheme introduced by those institutions is not bound up by a lot of red tape.  Those institutions should have qualified people available to discuss all aspects of house purchase with applicants. They should be courteous and helpful to those who apply.  The purchase of one's home, whether through a local authority house purchase scheme or a private lending institution, is a difficult and onerous task.  It is the biggest commercial transaction that most people undertake in their lives.  Private lending institutions should streamline their system to ensure that any difficulties that arise in the initial stages are dealt with swiftly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on increasing home improvement loans from £6,500 to £8,000.  This is a very welcome increase.  Allied to the publicly funded loans for the purchase of houses, I believe this increased loan will be taken up all round <Col N="1568" /> the country.  When the loan was pitched at £6,500 that was too low.  This increase to £8,000 will be of great benefit to people who need to avail of this type of loan to improve their accommodation.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to look at the complete area of house purchase loans so far as they are publicly funded.  I know the Minister is aware of this from his experience with local authorities.  I hope when he looks again at tenant purchase schemes he will be able to devise a new system which will be very attractive and will encourage people in local authority dwellings to start purchasing their dwellings. I am primarily interested in people buying their local authority homes because this gives a great deal of stability to the community and helps to develop a community which needs this type of assistance.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the frustration and annoyance felt by Deputy Mitchell who has been here since this Bill was introduced at not being called but, in respect of a Second Stage debate, a tradition has been established as to the sequence of speakers.  When the spokesperson for the three major parties and the second spokesperson for the Government have been called, we then call on The Workers' Party.  Accordingly I am calling Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  May I offer some consolation to Deputy Mitchell by saying that I will not be making a very long contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill as presented but I have reservations as to how the Housing Finance Agency loans operate.  I doubt that many people who enter into these loans realise the type of loan they are taking on and the very heavy debt facing them in the first ten to 15 years of that loan.  Nevertheless, this system has been availed of widely.  The main attraction is that it offers people who would normally be on the housing list, or in local authority <Col N="1569" /> houses, the choice of where they would like to live.  That does not necessarily mean they want to move out of local authority estates because I know that, in most cases in the Dublin area, these loans are taken on former local authority houses bought in what are high demand areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this much vaunted demand &ldquo;to own one's own house&rdquo; is to a large extent shaped by the fact that it offers a choice to the person who seeks to buy rather than rent.  The fact is that, if a person wants to rent accommodation, unless he has a very high income, the only kind of accommodation he can get at a reasonable rent is local authority accommodation. There is ample evidence that, if a person tries to rent a private house or private flat, he pays through the nose for it.</P>
    <P>There is no subsidy on renting a private flat or a private house, but if a person is buying a house he gets a substantial subsidy.  There is a myth that the only housing which is subsidised in this State is local authority housing.  We hear all sorts of criticisms, particularly on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;, of local authority tenants whose accommodation is subsidised, but private mortgages are substantially subsidised.  I have seen figures which in some cases indicate that there is a much higher subsidy for the private purchaser than there is for local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect about which I am concerned and which I would like the Minister to consider, that is, where local authorities repossess houses, whether bought through HFA loans or through special category loans.  The local authority with which I am familiar, Dublin Corporation, repossess these houses and resell them at a price which is really nonsensical. If the house has to be repossessed and sold at a fraction of the cost, it would make more sense to have it put back into local authority stock and rented to a person on the waiting list.  However, I have reservations about repossessing houses in the first place, especially where local authorities repossess houses, because in most cases the local authorities <Col N="1570" /> are obliged to rehouse those families.</P>
    <P>This whole process is carried out simply to satisfy a legal requirement.  Rather than disrupt a family by repossessing a house because the family are unable to pay their mortgage, it would make better sense to leave that family there and let them become the tenant of the local authority in their own home.  It does not make sense to evict them, rehouse them and then sell the repossessed house at a fraction of its value.  As I said, this seems to be done purely to satisfy a legal requirement. This is a matter at which the Minister should look seriously.</P>
    <P>The figures for repossession in the Dublin Corporation area in the past five years have risen from seven or eight to about 20 to 24 in 1986.  Obviously in terms of the large numbers of loans granted by the corporation this is not a large figure; nevertheless, the rate of rise is significant. We can avoid disrupting even one family by changing the rules and the legislation to enable a local authority to leave that family in their own home, which they might have spent a lot of money refurbishing and making comfortable, rather than moving them, say, 500 yards down the road to another local authority house and selling the repossessed house at a fraction of the cost.  This causes financial problems for the corporation and untold hardship and misery for the family concerned. I appeal to the Minister to look at that aspect.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer in relation to the Bill is the <i>ad hoc</i> approach to housing.  I recognise there is a need to increase the money available to the Housing Finance Agency but it is unfortunate that decisions have been made by various Governments without any apparent overall approach to the provision of housing and the need for it. The last time we had a White Paper on housing was in 1960.  It is time we produced another which would take into account the various changes which have taken place in society, the age of the population, family sizes, the growth in the phenomenon of single parent families and the kind of accommodation required <Col N="1571" /> by them and whether it is right to separate people who cannot provide housing for themselves within their own means from those who can afford a mortgage from the Housing Finance Agency, a building society or a bank.  That approach has resulted in housing ghettoes and it means that families on a certain wage level live in a particular area.  There is no reason for a local authority not to build houses for sale and for rent, the same as any other provider of housing.  I do not see why there is any need to maintain the kind of rigid residential qualifications which the various local authorities have in relation to the allocation of housing.</P>
    <P>There is no need to maintain the very rigid divisions between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in relation to the allocation of housing.  The last speaker made the point that the corporation are responsible for thousands of houses in his local authority area although Dublin County Council are responsible for the various services such as sewers, water, lights and so on.  Dublin Corporation are merely responsible for maintaining the houses but when you go out the garden gate Dublin County Council take over.  During a very bad spell a few years ago a pipe burst in a certain area, the corporation had to be called to deal with the problem in the house and the county council had to repair the roadway. It does not make sense.  It all relates to the allocation of housing and providing it in the best way possible.  As I said, there is an urgent need for a White Paper on housing, to look at its provision and how it is managed, particularly in the greater Dublin area which has a population of over one million.  We often hear propaganda in relation to the fact that there is no longer a housing crisis but there are still waiting lists in Dublin Corporation, in Wicklow and Kildare.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the fairly large units of vacant accommodation and the £5,000 grant.  There is an urgent need for this House to come to grips with the question of producing a coherent housing policy which will deal with modern conditions and take into account that a very <Col N="1572" /> substantial portion of our housing stock is sub-standard.  There has not been a survey of housing stock or its standard for many years or of the various changes in our population structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill and I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on introducing it as it now provides increased funding for the Housing Finance Agency amounting to £1,000 million.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill mainly because of the fact that the Housing Finance Agency have, since 1986, introduced a block building approach to the local authority. It is important that the agency can purchase through the local authorities.  There are three types of loans involved and it is important that they are inter-related.  The Housing Finance Agency are a great help to the people looking for a loan.  Over a four or five year period there should be enough funds to operate the loans and to allow funds to be provided to local authorities.  It is very important that any crisis or confusion in local authorities is relieved by the fact that we are now providing £1,000 million to the agency.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of increasing the income limit for a HEA loan and the maximum for the ordinary capital loan should be increased from £22,500 to £25,000 so that there would be more money available under this scheme than under the SDA loan.  We should give that option to people who are caught in income limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the Housing Finance Agency loans many families have been able to get new and secondhand houses and a large number of people on the waiting list for houses have been able to buy them. However, one of the things that concerns me &mdash; and many public representatives &mdash; is the delays in relation to title when people apply for these loans.  Despite the best efforts of local authorities, there is considerable hardship for people who have to wait long periods for the title to be sorted out, as they must pay very high bridging finance.  Time is of the essence for applicants for these loans.  It is important that legal difficulties are sorted out, <Col N="1573" /> certainly within four or five weeks, so that people will not have to pay very high bridging because of the delays.</P>
    <P>In relation to income limits it is very unfair that one-income families are dealt with in the same way as two-income families. A one-income family should be allowed twice as much as a two-income family.  One-income families have experienced hardship under the present system. The Housing Finance Agency has worked well.  The administration costs are low and the local authorities have worked hard in this area.  Nowadays very few loans are coming through my local authority because income limits are the same for all loans.  It is time now to make a change.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who got subsidised loans through the local authority under the Housing Finance Agency scheme did not realise that they would have to pay back so much money to redeem the house and buy another house some years later. In these instances, people are losing money.  Many local authorities have advised applicants to pay back a little more than the required amount.  An income-related scheme is very attractive in the early stages but people do not realise how much they owe on their houses and it comes as a shock to them when they try to sell and repurchase.  This should be pointed out to people repaying loans.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financing of private housing, I am glad that the interest rate has now dropped to 9.75 per cent which includes mortgage protection.  I have spoken about this to the Minister on many occasions.  When other financial institutions have a lower rate than the local authority for SDA loans, it is time to reduce the interest rate for SDA loans. I welcome the reduction.  Over the last decade building societies have become the mainstay of the private housing sector.  The SDA loans and the HFA loans were very important in the last five years, but the building societies should be more involved in the provision of finance for private housing.  Figures from the construction industry federation show that in 1985 SDA and HFA loan payments <Col N="1574" /> accounted for £163 million out of a total for all agencies of the £600 million in the private housing sector.  In other words, the State provided between 20 per cent and 25 per cent.  That points to the need for the financial institutions to be involved in housing finance.</P>
    <P>The request of the housing sector for a guarantee of funds was acceded to in the Minister's announcement introducing this Bill when he stated that the State's role would give a limited guarantee to the borrowings from the financial institutions. That is very important.  The director of the construction federation said that any new arrangements would have to focus on, among other things, the need to place the investors' interests on a par with those of the borrower in what has become a ritual row that mortgage rates had to be moved upwards.  In that context the State's role in guaranteeing the private sector is important.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that applications already with local authorities are dealt with under the old scheme.  It is unfair to send people who had already applied to local authorities back to the private lending institutions.  I hope the Minister will be forthcoming on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that home improvement loans have been increased from £6,500 to £8,000 and that these will be funded by the Housing Finance Agency.  This is the only source of State funding for house improvements. Many people wanted this loan increased.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and I thank the local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency for their work.  I hope the Minister will look at some of the points raised about the amount of loans, the income limits and the delays in establishing title which have caused a lot of hardship to applicants who have had to pay very high bridging finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the income related loans scheme and the more recently introduced convertible loans scheme have made a significant contribution to the ability of people to acquire their own homes.  That is a fact. <Col N="1575" /> I would like to see a greater ease of convertibility from Housing Finance Agency loans into fixed interest loans, as people get on their feet.  Many people take on the HFA loans in the commencement years of their mortgage and find it difficult to convert later.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to something Deputy Flood said.  It is a fact that, in certain parts of Dublin, in particular &mdash; because of the availability of the £5,000 grant to people who surrender their local authority homes &mdash; there is a number of houses remaining vacant.  However, that problem is being mitigated.  Whereas it may justify the fact that there has been almost a full stop to house building programmes in Dublin I suggest that there is still housing squalor in Dublin.  I will not attempt to apportion blame.</P>
      <P>In recent years our efforts on both sides of the House have concentrated on local authority housing lists which have been brought considerably under control.  The previous Government spent £156 million, from Dublin city's budget alone, on building houses in the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 and that has had a major effect on reducing the housing waiting lists. When I first became a public representative, in 1979, one could not get a house for love nor money in Tallaght or anywhere else.  Certainly that problem has been dealt with.  We need to address our attention now to the housing squalor in our inner cities.  I make no apology for saying that.  I want to say to the Dublin Corporation official who was reported in the press as saying that I must never have visited these places: yes, I have visited them, they are located in the inner city part of my constituency.  I will bring any official who contends they do not exist there and how him these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in Dublin city 16,000 local authority flats.  I will put my hand on my heart and say that approximately 10,000 of those are not fit for human habitation in terms of accommodation in which we should like to live ourselves.  That should be the litmus test: would we wish to live in them ourselves?  Some of those flat complexes are unfit for animal habitation <Col N="1576" /> never mind human beings; human beings should not be asked to live in them.  The State has a duty to provide proper housing accommodation for those people.  I have seen the developments that have taken place in Leaview House in Hackney. I must say that the standard obtaining there is the one to which we should aspire for our local authority tenant dwellers, not just in Dublin but in Cork, Athlone and anywhere else where there is need for major refurbishment.  For instance, when Oliver Bond flats and St. Teresa's Gardens complexes were built they were considered luxurious because, before then, people had been living in tenements with perhaps one toilet or a bathroom on one floor shared by all occupants. Therefore the move into these flat complexes then was considered a major advancement.  Indeed I should say fair play to the Government of the day who provided them.  However, many of those flats do not have a shower.  There have been steps take to replace windows and so on but such does not constitute proper refurbishment.  We need to refurbish those flat complexes along the lines of what has been done in Hackney at Leaview House.  They need to be converted into dwellings in which people can live for another 20 or 30 years.  I am talking about expenditure in the region of £20,000 per housing unit.  It would cost approximately £200 million to bring Dublin's inner city flat complexes up to scratch.  That is not an unrealistic figure or one incapable of being achieved.  For example in the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 we spent the historic figure of £156 million. The work can and should be done. People should not be asked to live in those types of complexes and their attendant environment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is free some day I shall be very happy to show him some of the flat complexes about which I am speaking. I know he is as concerned about them as I am.  There is a potential Housing Finance Agency role here, were we to engage in that type of investment and request people to make repayments based on a percentage of their incomes in order to finance such a project.  That <Col N="1577" /> may be a possibility.  It might be possible also if we were to abolish the housing maintenance programme in Dublin city which are nothing short of a disgrace and are not properly organised at all.  Indeed their operation was investigated by An Foras Forbartha at the request of Dublin Corporation.  Such refurbishment works could lead to a major saving in the Social Welfare Estimate, taking people off the unemployment list and engaging them in such refurbishment projects.  This is something that must be tackled.  Before the inception of the Housing Finance Agency we did not think people could buy their own homes.  I can assure the House that I believe it is possible to carry out a major refurbishment job.  When one thinks of the educational problems and the protests taking place at present one might well ask oneself how children can be educated in that type of environment? It must be acknowledged that they start from a handicap in terms of background.  That is a disgrace and we must try to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I might make a passing reference to the £10,000 income limit which I contend should be increased.  There are many people who would be quite happy to build or buy their homes if this limit was revised even to take account of inflation.  They are snookered if they engage in even a little overtime over a three year period and can find themselves in serious difficulties. I hope the Minister will find it possible to devote his attention to that matter and revise that limit in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed at the activities of building societies generally.  It is my belief that thy could be of much more assistance in helping people at what might be termed the lower end of the market obtain or purchase their own homes.  At present local authorities operate in the same way as building societies, albeit their activities concentrating on the lower end of the market.  It is my belief that building societies have not taken seriously their duty to provide homes for people on a mutual society basis.  They have grown into monarchies with profits being made by small numbers of directors. <Col N="1578" /> There are 13 building societies in existence, five of which dominate the building society arena taking 90 per cent of business and operating as a cartel. We need to examine the way in which building societies operate.  For example, in 1970 the total assets of all Irish building societies amounted to £87 million.  In 1985 that figure had risen to £2,638 million. In 1970 they had 76,000 investors which figure had risen to 932,000 in 1985. None of those investors had any say in how the building societies operate, or in assisting the Minister or those people who endeavour to house themselves.  The people who control the building societies seem more interested in taking those profits and concealing them in purchasing premises at every crossroads rather than lending those profits to people for the provision of homes.  For example, at Sundrive crossroads in my constituency there are located five building society offices and there were signs of a sixth locating there recently.  That is totally unnecessary, a squandering of money.</P>
    <P>Building society expenditure on advertising has been scandalous.  They are supposed to be mutual societies.  We would not have to be concerning ourselves with Bills such as this if only these people got their act together and did what they are supposed to do, operate on a friendly, mutual benefit type basis.  Rather than self-perpetuating monarchies, making profits, concealing them and lending money for business purposes &mdash; which they are not supposed to do &mdash; they might take more seriously their concern for and duty to the public.</P>
    <P>I expressed concern in the House earlier in the year when the building societies increased their interest rate, by one stroke of the pen, by 3 per cent.  One might well ask if they have ever reduced their rates by a corresponding amount? The answer is: no, and they never will. Instead they reduce their rates by perhaps 0.5 per cent now and 0.5 per cent again. They have people's hearts broken by their method of operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of building societies in lending to people at the lower end of the market.  I really do believe <Col N="1579" /> there is need for a major investigation of their activities.  Local authorities such as Dublin Corporation &mdash; at present on the brink of bankruptcy because of insufficient funding &mdash; are being asked to lend money under the Housing Finance Agency and local authority funding schemes.  Yet it is those local authorities who have to make up the losses when people cannot meet their repayments. The building societies make no effort whatsoever to assist.</P>
    <P>In an effort to underline the point I am making I might give an indication of the post-tax return on gross assets, average figure for 1981 and 1982.  In the case of the Bank of Ireland the figure was 0.77 per cent; Allied Irish Banks, 0.80 per cent; Irish Permanent Building Society, 1.32 per cent; and Irish Nationwide, 2.37 per cent.  These are profit-making bodies. They should be told by the Government to assist us in housing these people and to help us to remove the housing squalor. This money belongs to the one million investors who will not be allowed to elect people to the boards of the building societies.  If the societies are not behaving like mutual societies in the national interest then the Government and this House should tell them that we are going to legislate.  It seems they are largely ignoring or finding their way around the legislation which was passed last December and which was very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to tell the House what progress he has made as a result of his consultations with the building societies and what the outcome of those consultations has been.  I regret that the Minister has not involved in those consultations the account holders of the building societies.  They should also be consulted.  The building societies adopt a very high-handed attitude and this needs to be brought under control. They, like other sections of the community, seem to think that they are a republic within a Republic and I ask the Minister to ensure that they are brought back on the rails very soon.</P>
    <P>The number of branches of building societies should be examined.  In 1971 <Col N="1580" /> there were 97 branches.  In 1982 that figure had risen to 525 and there is probably in the order of 600 or 700 branches now.  The building societies are not supposed to make profits of the order they are making and therefore they hide those profits by taking on real estate costs, costs which they can realise at a future date because they are acquiring an asset which is increasing in profit.  They buy prime sites in every town and village and write them off against their profits.  Therefore they show smaller profit figures than they would otherwise show and they have a large amount of real estate to their credit for doing so.  That is not the function of building societies and they should be prevented from doing that.  Their function is to lend money to people to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>If the building societies were providing money for that purpose the Minister would not have to come in here today with a Housing Finance Agency Bill. There would be so much money available that interest rates, which are at a synthetically high rate at present, would be reduced.  They could quite easily be reduced further to compare with the rates prevailing in other countries.  There would be a greater amount of cash available and there would be greater competition between building societies in seeking to make that money available. The Minister would not have to introduce a Bill such as this because the building societies would be very innovative in getting borrowers to provide homes for themselves if they were forced to make that money available.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister ask the building societies if they are involved in lending money for the purchase of public houses.  They should not be allowed to do so.  I wonder do any of the people who put money on deposit in building societies know that some of their money is being loaned for risk purposes.  Not so long ago a bank had to be pulled out of the mire because of bad investments and I hope the day does not come when we have to do the same for a building society.  Many people who invest money in the building societies do so in the belief that it is being <Col N="1581" /> lent for housing purposes only and that there will be real assets should the borrowers not be in a position to make repayments. I do not think many of them would be very comfortable if they knew that some of their money was being loaned for the purpose of purchasing public houses or other types of businesses. There is evidence to show that that has been happening and the Minister should look into that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the management expenses which the building societies must show to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in 1983, the last year for which I have figures available to me, they showed a total figure of £31 million.  There is no breakdown of what these management expenses are and the building societies are not required to indicate what they are.  These are meant to be mutual societies, societies which are democratically controlled and not societies controlled by one or two people or in some cases by families.  There should be a requirement in the legislation that a breakdown of these management expenses should be provided.  If all these matters were addressed there would be no need for us to be constantly concerning ourselves about extending the remit of the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address these questions and to report to the House the current situation on his meetings with the building societies.  I ask him in particular to address himself to the lack of mutuality in these societies.  I reiterate the urgency of addressing the state of our inner city flat complexes.  I hope also that the Minister will make it easier to convert from Housing Finance Agency loans to fixed interest loans.  These are very serious matters which need to be addressed. Coming into the millennium year we could make a start on removing much of the housing squalor that exists.  I want to assure the Minister that he will have every assistance possible from this side of the House if he will set about tackling that urgent task which is calling out for attention.</P>
    <P>In many cases the people involved feel totally alienated from the system.  The <Col N="1582" /> voting rate in some areas at election time is as low as 50 per cent because the people do not feel part of the system.  Money could be made available to the building societies, the Housing Finance Agency and to many other areas if we put our minds to it to remove the sort of housing squalor that exists.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind my comments.  Perhaps some day when he is free we could take an informal trip around some of the complexes and he will be so aghast that he will take into account what I have said today and very quickly bring in legislation to deal with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up the last point made by Deputy Mitchell which has nothing to do with the Bill.  I can assure Deputy Mitchell that if he could persuade a very busy Minister of State to take a trip around some of those areas he has mentioned he would find it a valuable experience.  Indeed, we had the privilege of taking the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, to the Oldcourt estate in Bray recently and to Rockfield Park in Kilmacanogue and as a result of that, and within something like two weeks, we cut through all of the bureaucratic red tape and put into operation two of the finest modern refurbishment schemes which other Deputies from other parts of the country should visit and replicate in their own areas.  It is a timely opportunity to put my personal gratitude and the gratitude of the residents of Oldcourt and Rockfield Park on the record.  I hope that the Minister will be as forthcoming with funds in those estates next year and that his largesse will know no bounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is relatively straightforward. It is quite undeserving of some of the hysteria that has attended a number of the contributions made already in this House.  The Bill seeks first of all to increase from £500 million to £1,000 million the amount the HFA may borrow to fund house purchase loans. That must surely be welcome to Members of the House.  Second, it aims to empower the Minister for the Environment to contribute to the cost of the agency and to validate contributions already made.  I <Col N="1583" /> really cannot see how anybody can object to that.  The effect of both of these amendments is to expand the financial capacity of the HFA.  The changes are vitally important in the context of the agency's operations and should ensure a swift passage of the Bill through this House and through the other House.</P>
    <P>The HFA has been a success since its inception.  It has undoubtedly enabled people who found themselves above SDA limits and who would not normally have been in a position to go to the commercial agencies to buy their own houses. This must, of course, always be the object of housing policy, and has been the object of housing policy of successive Governments. Home ownership is not an ideological principle, it is a pragmatic principle which has been espoused by all Governments certainly since 1947 when that particular housing policy was enunciated. I find myself at a loss to understand some of the comments made in this regard about home ownership and its elevation by Deputy De Rossa.  I can understand that there would be ideological arguments perhaps among Marxist parties that should not be the case. But the reality is that most Irish people want to own their own homes, most Irish political parties want people to own their own homes and we should encourage that.  I think most democratic parties do.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the HFA's short history has been the number of changes and the number of modifications made since its introduction.  A fundamental change came about in 1986 when the HFA was allowed to confine itself in effect to a more central role with the local authorities becoming effectively its agents operating the loan system and bearing the risk.  This change was not universally welcomed at the time; it was not welcomed by everybody in this House.  Listening to contributions here it is evident that not just here but in the local authorities there is confusion as to the authors of that change.  For example, Deputy Gay Mitchell seems to have some confusion in his mind on this point.</P>
    <P>A more important change was the <Col N="1584" /> decision recently to allow the HFA to put forward a more flexible lending arrangement whereby a fixed income related loan scheme would not be the only means of funding but whereby a fixed repayment scheme would come into operation.  This is a major breakthrough.  It moves the HFA away from being an entirely income related payment scheme which caused very considerable hardship and I think every Deputy in this House now recognises that it has caused some hardship.  It caused hardship largely because of changing circumstances.  I would like to make the point to the Minister and the Minister of State that some local authorities were apparently reluctant to notify people on HFA loans that this particular possibility of modifying the repayment schedule was coming up.  I would certainly feel where local authorities have been tardy in this regard they should have their knuckles well and truly rapped and told to discharge their responsibilities properly to the borrowers in their areas.</P>
    <P>The recently announced decision whereby the building societies and banks have been encouraged to increase their lending to persons who would normally have been seeking local authority loans is a very welcome one.  Under the new arrangements the financial institutions will increase their funding of home purchase loans for persons under the £10,000 income limit and they will be increasing loans made to people of more limited incomes up to about £70 million.  That is a very good move.  Like Deputy Mitchell I agree that it is about time the banks and other financial institutions, particularly the building societies, were forced to take up some of this area.  The administrative arrangements whereby there is a limited guarantee given by the local authority in these loans is welcome.  I also note that the guarantee is not open ended, that there is a limit on the amount being guaranteed.  So there is some element of sharing the risk between local authorities and financial institutions and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>I really cannot understand how some Deputies opposite have had a problem with this innovation.  I must say I was <Col N="1585" /> rocked on my heels by Deputy John Boland's contribution in this regard.  I note and would put it on the record that there is obviously a serious departure in views between what Deputy Boland had to say the last day and what Deputy Mitchell has had to say today.  It strikes me that Deputy Mitchell's contribution is far more meaningful and logical in this regard.  As I said, a number of Deputies grossly misrepresented the situation with regard to this decision.  They went further, it was suggested by Deputy Boland that because lower income families would still inevitably have to make demands on SDA and HFA loans that &ldquo;the portfolio of risk in the SDA would be increased&rdquo;. This, I would submit to the House, is a gross slander.  If the Deputy had chosen to check the record he would realise that there is no evidence whatsoever that low income families easily become delinquent on mortgage repayments.  I admit that there are very few statistics available in this regard but in so far as there are statistics available they prove that low income families value the idea of purchasing their own house and that they will not easily become delinquent on mortgages; indeed many other things would suffer first.  I think if, with some mature reflection, Deputy Boland looked at his contribution here, he would remove his remarks from the record and indeed remove the slander that he puts on low income families.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill is of course in sections 2 and 3.  Section 2 does not require any elaboration whatsoever. Section 3 is very welcome.  The need for the type of contribution from the institutions referred to in the section arises because of the problem the agency has had in index linked funds.  It is a technical section.  There is no need to go into it in great detail, but it is a realistic section and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have ended their contribution by straying somewhat from the main point of the Bill.  They have chosen to present us here with a distorted picture, a vista which is distorted beyond recognition, of the housing situation in the local authority housing <Col N="1586" /> area.  Certainly in the case of the local authorities with which I am familiar there is no sign of a crisis build up on the council housing lists.  I would submit to the House that there is no crisis in local authority housing at this time.  Anybody who seeks to suggest that there is is ignoring the reality which is plainly visible throughout housing estates the length and breadth of the country.  In the conventional housing estates the reality is that there are empty houses in many areas.  These houses are being allowed to deteriorate.  More to the point, they are being subject to squatting and to vandalism and to wanton destruction, and this surely cannot be good housing policy.</P>
    <P>To go on investing more and more money into the standard, traditional type of local authority housing units would be folly not acceptable to Ireland's taxpayers nor acceptable to those who are looking for local authority housing at present.  Our scarce resources must, of necessity, be channelled in a much more discriminating way than has been the case in the past.  The waiting lists have been reduced dramatically.  Talk of a three year waiting list as in the contribution of Deputy Quinn is not just specious nonsense, it is a wilful effort to distort reality. What is happening with regard to housing demand at present is of interest to this House.  An analysis of housing lists in north County Wicklow shows that the type of demand coming forward is going through a change.  In Bray, for example, which is a typical town with a fairly conventional housing programme, up to 35 per cent of the current housing demand in the local authority area is for small family units, primarily for elderly couples, for single parents, for elderly single people and in some cases, tragically, for the single homeless.  In this housing area there is no crisis.  What we are witnessing at the moment is a dramatic alteration in the pattern of housing demand.  This needs to be appraised, to be addressed by the local authorities, leading to the provision of more small family units and the more flexible use of existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>Another area which requires attention, <Col N="1587" /> although not new building, and which has been ignored by Deputies from the opposite benches, barring Deputy Mitchell, is the question of refurbishment of existing housing stock.  We in County Wicklow have a very proud record.  We have broken the ground on this and have undertaken, in Kindlestown Park in Greystones, in Rockfield Park in Kilmacanogue and in Bray, major, and in my submissison model, housing refurbishment schemes.  For too little attention has been given to refurbishing local government housing stock over the years. I would go a long way with some of the remarks of Deputy Mitchell in this regard.</P>
    <P>In north Wicklow we have, for example, a direct labour scheme which is highly cost effective, so much so that one local authority are operating as contractor and adviser in other cases.  This has produced housing stock of the highest quality.  I welcome the opportunity of showing any Deputy from any part of the country and, indeed, any party, around those estates.  It strikes me as an important innovation and as an area in which we should be investing funds in the future.  In this regard I would confine my comments entirely to the refurbishing of local government housing stock.  I would also like, as other Deputies have done, to welcome the increase in the home improvement loans from £6,500 to £8,000.  This strikes me as a reasonable and far from excessive figure and is a very welcome change.  Again, it helps in regard to improving existing housing stock, which is something we have tended to ignore.</P>
    <P>Housing is, of necessity, an emotive issue.  Discussions on the topic should be cool, they should be dispassionate and if any progress in housing is to be made people who contribute to the discussions on housing should make an effort to check the facts.  It is very evident that many Deputies on the Opposition benches have come into this debate, which should not be acrimonious, and <Col N="1588" /> have introduced spurious logic and distorted treatment of reality.  This has not helped to progress the discussion on housing.  I find the contributions of Deputies Boland and Quinn particularly reprehensible in this regard.  Both of these Deputies know the reality better than they reflected it in this House.  We are going through a period of change in local government housing.  That change needs to be addressed and not to be distorted. If we are to have logic in housing policies, elected representatives, who have a good deal of contact with those on housing lists, owe it to themselves and particularly to their constituents, the taxpayers and everybody involved to reproduce reality and not distortion.  Fiction should not find its way into debates. We should have facts.</P>
    <P>A number of people have requested the Minister that he insist that all local authorities be required to treat existing HFA and SDA applications under existing arrangements.  I have had a number of cases, as I am sure other Deputies have had, of people who are well involved in the process of buying houses being told by housing officers that they must fulfil some bureaucratic requirement to get their refusals from banks and buildings societies.  That is not on.  It has caused quite unnecessary hardship to people in the process of buying their houses.  This additional requirement has been spuriously introduced by housing authority officers.  I hope that the reality relating to existing mortgage applications, or SDA or HFA loan applications, would be brought clearly to the attention of the local authority housing officer and that people will not be forced unnecessarily to go through the whole process when they are halfway through house purchase &mdash; a traumatic period for any young couple.  I hope that they will not be shoved through any unnecessary bureaucratic hoops by local authorities.  The changes proposed in this Bill are positive and as such they should be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address myself to a few points contained in the Bill. First, a number of speakers have referred <Col N="1589" /> to the success or otherwise of the Housing Finance Agency over the past number of years since it was introduced.  It certainly fulfilled a very valuable role and achieved its aim in making available to people in a particular income bracket an agency through which they could be favourably considered within a reasonable time for loan applications which would ultimately lead to their being able to house themselves with the aid of that agency.</P>
      <P>I might add that the agency was not received favourably on all sides in the political arena, especially among local authorities, and got very much a baptism of fire.  I note Deputy Roche's advice to avoid distortion.  I can assure the House that distortion occurs in various other fora as well as in this House and I have witnessed it at very many county council meetings.  We all know what we are talking about there.</P>
      <P>One area that requires a little attention at present, and which was referred to by the last speaker, was the question of people who by virtue of their being in a high income bracket and perhaps having received a loan some five or six years ago find themselves making very heavy repayments and have asked for annuity facilities.  That request is not being favourably considered at present.  The local authorities are saying that they have received a communication from the agency to the effect that they want to defer further discussion on that matter. That is the ultimate in senseless and useless bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facilities would help the people involved to pay for their houses in the best possible way and to keep their repayments up to date.  By virtue of the ridiculous bureaucracy, they have been pursued by the agency, through the aegis of the Department of the Environment, and are finding that they are not able to meet their repayments because of the ever increasing amount of their income they must contribute towards their mortgages. This is ridiculous and I would ask the Minister to ensure without delay that persons requesting to opt for annuity based repayments be given that facility, provided that they have a reasonably <Col N="1590" /> good payment record and that it will not place the agency at a serious financial loss.  The effect of a refusal should be taken into account.  I would emphasise that it is totally and absolutely undesirable to allow a delay of a year or 18 months while those concerned find themselves in ever increasing financial difficulties. This infuriates the public who deal with local authorities, or with any other State agency.  The Minister of State knows quite well that what I say is true and probably has had ample experience of it himself.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of the introduction of a new system which hopes to save something in the region of £55 million for the Exchequer in a full year.  This involves calling on banks and building societies to service the loan area to those with an income of over £10,000 a year.  I take issue with Deputy Roche in his criticism of Deputy Boland's remarks in relation to this area.  What is happening is that the cream of the area to which the local authorities heretofore lent is now being handed over to the financial institutions because on paper at least they seem to be the safer risk.  I appreciate that a £10,000 limit always applied but those under the £10,000 limit must first go to a lending institution and, having been refused, must then go to a local authority.  What should happen then is that the housing authority, or the lending agency as it used to be prior to the recent change announced by the Minister, would take account of the housing needs of the particular individual.  There is nothing to compel the lending agencies to take into account any such needs and they have no intention of doing so.  If they should start doing so they would find themselves in a very precarious position with their investors.</P>
    <P>If a person under the £10,000 income limit goes to his bank or building society and finds he is not being entertained, he will go back to the local authority and because his employment record during the past few years has not been as it might have been they may say again that they do not consider him a fit risk within the meaning of the new regulations.  That <Col N="1591" /> is a departure which is completely and absolutely unacceptable because again the local authority will be getting away from their responsibility under the 1966 Act in the belief that they have no duty or moral obligation to look after the basic housing needs of people who are not in a position to get local authority housing and who are not in a position to provide houses for themselves by any other means.</P>
    <P>We would then attempt to put them on a long waiting list and they could either rent accommodation or live in a mobile home or some other unfit accommodation until such time as they could either raise the money or put a deposit on a house with a building society or are lucky enough to get a local authority house.  Given the present financial climate, and I do not criticise any Government in relation to this, it is highly unlikely that any Government will be able to provide sufficient funding to meet the shortfall in the market by way of direct local authority houses in the foreseeable future.  That is an area that will become the ultimate as far as bureaucracy is concerned and I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the way the local authorities will operate the new regulations.</P>
    <P>It is important that we remember also that a number of other grants, such as the £5,000 grant and the home improvement grants which were available to people in the particular income group to which I have referred &mdash; those in need of a local authority house or those who ordinarily apply for local authority loans &mdash; have been abolished.  I was critical of the abolition of those grants previously in this House.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister take personal interest in how those people are going to fund the building or the buying of a house in present circumstances.  I would also point out that here I am speaking from personal experience. Not alone have I been keeping an eye on what has been happening in my own local authority but also in other local authority areas and, as the Minister is aware, I do not have to travel very far <Col N="1592" /> beyond the county boundary to find that out.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the difficulty I am pointing to. Otherwise the system which was envisaged under the 1966 Act will become irrelevant and people will be housed, not on the basis of need, and here I am talking about the lending system which includes the Housing Finance Agency and the new system which will be operated by the banks and the building societies, but rather on the basis of their ability to raise a deposit.  Previously, the local authority had to have regard to the housing needs of the individual.  That was of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the variable interest rate has been lauded on some sides of the House.  I fully accept that at times of decreasing interest rates the variation is of benefit but I would also point out that going back over a ten year period a fixed interest rate was far more beneficial to people.  We should not get too fixed on the idea that the ultimate would be to depart from the fixed interest rate and go on to a variable interest rate and that it should never be changed again.  I presume that the Minister intends, should interest rates increase, introducing a clause stipulating that the rate may be fixed.  Otherwise serious problems may arise for families who have taken out loans under these schemes.  In fact, problems have arisen for those who have taken out such loans from the building societies and banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the commercial agencies who will now have certain responsibilities in relation to what previously were local authority loans.  He said:</P>
    <P>In this context, I should emphasise that house purchasers will still be able to apply to their local authority for a loan where they have failed to obtain one from the commercial agencies. The participation of banks and building societies in this area of the mortgage market is very welcome and will enable the Public Capital Programme provision for house purchase loans to be <Col N="1593" /> reduced from £155 million to £100 million with a consequent saving in the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £45 million and a saving in the HFA's borrowing requirement of £10 million.</P>
    <P>But then there is another clause whereby the local authority underwrite the possible loss in the event of a borrower defaulting.  It seems rather peculiar that the Exchequer attempts to save money by handing over to the commercial interests an area in which previously the local authority were involved while at the same time decides to underwrite half the possible losses that could be incurred by the lending agency should the borrower default.  It seems that the commercial agencies have scored very well on this one because I cannot recall a similar provision being made in regard to any other agency and the banks and the building societies must be considering themselves very lucky to have achieved this.</P>
    <P>We do not live in a healthy financial environment nor do we live in the happiest of employment climates at present. I am not making a political point but that is a fact of life, not only in this country but right across the world.  There is a strong possibility that people will find themselves in difficulties and they are finding themselves in difficulties at present.  I do not see why the handing over of the responsibility for lending the money to the commercial interests should also bring with it a commitment from the Government in relation to any possible losses.  I do not think it is a good idea and it may prove to be an expensive one, much more expensive than has been anticipated by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the reconstruction loan from £6,500 to £8,000.  I would have increased it by another £1,000 because due to the removal of grants and various other incentives, a number of people are entitled to apply for that type of reconstruction loan and can do a good deal with it to improve their homes.  In my county of Kildare there are quite a number of old vested houses, in some cases with no sanitary facilities, and in <Col N="1594" /> many cases tenanted by people on low incomes, a fixed income on social welfare and in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance and in some cases with fairly large families.  Deputy Roche referred to refurbishments which have taken place in some estates in Wicklow.  I hope that will apply to a number of others throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a file in the Minister's Department from Kildare County Council on a number of individual houses such as I have just described.  They are old type or pre-1940 houses which are in need of restoration and the provision of basic sanitary facilities and improvements.  The only thing the occupants of those houses have to assist them at present is the unsecured loan which is about £2,000.  In those circumstances they are incapable of carrying out the work and cannot be expected to do so, and the local authority have not sufficient funds, even if the house is devested, to carry out the work. Therefore, the increase in the reconstruction loan is a welcome improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say &mdash; and I am not sure whether it is in the Bill &mdash; whether the period for repayment has been increased.  It needs to be increased considerably. At present there is a provision of 15 years for repayment.  It should go to at least 20 years in order to give people in that lower income group a chance to meet their repayments.  It is one thing to provide them with the loan, but we should also consider their ability to repay it.  If we pitch the loan at the right level and the repayment period over a reasonable time, they have a greater opportunity to meet their commitments.  We can swamp them by cramming repayments into a short time and then the unfortunate applicants find that the situation gets out of hand and perhaps they end up with re-possession.  That is not on.</P>
    <P>This HFA Bill encompasses quite an area as does any Bill relating to housing. I ask the Minister to have regard to the areas to which I have referred.  I know that he has personal, first hand experience, as a member of a local authority, of the way local authorities very often <Col N="1595" /> seem to become bogged down by mountains of bureaucracy and ultimately the public who have to have access to the services provided by these local authorities are completely put off and discouraged by the response they get and often give up and go away.  Their opinion of the local authorities and the agencies on whose behalf the local authorities are working is very much soured.</P>
    <P>Given various Acts, regulations and statutory instruments provided by the Oireachtas through the Minister from time to time, surely the attitude of any agency, be they the HFA, the local authorities, or whatever, should be to operate to assist people who have to have recourse to them, but that does not always apply.  For instance, in many areas a member of the public makes application for something under some heading and is told all the reasons he cannot qualify. The simple thing to do would be to assess his situation and decide there and then whether the person has a valid application, and either tell him straight out that he has no chance and should forget about it or else adopt a positive approach and help him.  We public representatives must spend a great deal of time on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays and every other day of the week at various clinics. We will not have to spend so much time if what I suggest is put into operation. That criticism applies to very many agencies operated by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to speak to this House on the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill because anything that pumps or injects finance into the building sector at this time must surely be welcomed.  If ever there was an area which must be reeling under the onslaught of cutbacks it is the construction industry and, unfortunately, this measure seems to be too little and too late.  Looking at the pattern of scaling down of activity in the construction industry, the consequent effect on employment and the statistics, one cannot but <Col N="1596" /> wonder if any housing policy is in place at this time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies Boland, Quinn and Durkan have pointed out, a number of the key components and support areas for the construction industry have been dislodged and put out of place or dismantled completely.  The most innovative development in the construction industry for a number of years was the decision to introduce a grants scheme which would help to refurbish dwellings, to bring back to habitable condition dwellings which had lain idle, were dilapidated or had deteriorated to the point where they could no longer be expected to be used as habitable accommodation. If ever an innovative measure caught the public imagination, was welcomed generally with open arms and had the desired effect of boosting the housing stock, it was the house improvements grants scheme.  It had ancillary benefits.  It gave people the opportunity to realise a cherished dream which had been unrealisable in that they had not the finance themselves to do the work.</P>
      <P>In addition, it had the quite obvious direct knack on effect of coaxing people out of the black economy, of ensuring that people who were working as illegitimate operators in the building trade, unregistered plumbers, carpenters, blocklayers, painters and so on, were now for the first time being induced out into the open economy on the basis that there was an attractive lucrative scheme there. It induced them to register for taxation proposes and become legitimate for the first time.  What happened?  The people were driven underground again.  There was an increase in the number of people who had to take to the emigrant boat and a whole scaling down in the level of operations particularly in the area of reconstruction and improvements to domestic dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, in isolation, was enough of an attack and assault on the construction industry and caused enough demoralisation in its own way.  It was coupled with a number of other measures which equally demoralised, undermined and generally brought about the wholesale <Col N="1597" /> devastation of the construction industry. I am also talking about the lack of finance at local authority level, for example in the Minister for the Environment's own County of Mayo.  I recall this time last year that he pontificated at length during the Estimates debate and he informed the House that when he became Minister for the Environment there would be wholesale devolution of power, numerous schemes would be brought on stream and local authorities would become real local authorities with enough autonomy of their own to have decision-making powers for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>In the local authority of which the Minister was a member since the early seventies, we do not have enough money to pay any essential repair grants.  Disabled person's reconstruction grants were a great haven for elderly people.  They were enabled to build little flatlets adjacent to houses of other members of the family, thus creating a physical environment where the extended family became a physical reality, where there was a sense of detachment and at the same time a sense of belonging.  People were able to keep elderly people out of geriatric homes by constructing little flatlets, granny flats and so on.  All of those measures proposed up, supported and financed by the disabled person's reconstruction grants are now scrapped at Mayo County Council level because the finance has not been made available to provide the necessary funding for these particular measures.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to increase the number of new houses to help the housing construction industry.  The new house grant scheme was valuably augmented by the presence of the mortgage subsidy scheme.  The scheme was introduced initially as a £3,000 scheme repayable over the first three years and subsequently, it was extended to a five-year period.  A person received £1,000 in the first year, in the second year £800, the third year £600, the fourth year £400 and the fifth year £200.  All this helped to get young couples over the teething stages of the early repayment period of a mortgage. <Col N="1598" /> Suddenly, in one fell swoop, this was dismantled, gone, annihilated.  It now seems gone for ever and certainly for this Administration's term in office.</P>
    <P>The special tenant purchase scheme was a new dimension, an innovation, and was designed to bring to reality and fruition the realisation of a dream &mdash; which was to many people nothing but a dream &mdash; of again owning their own house.  Somebody in a local authority dwelling would be given £5,000 to move into a house purchased by him or her, or them as the case may be, or to construct their own house.  This was working in areas like Ballyfermot, Blanchardstown, Tallaght and in a number of our provincial towns.  Those local authorities suddenly found a situation emerging where people were taking up at an increasing rate, those offers of £5,000 coupled with the SDA loan or the Housing Finance Agency facility and were moving out and establishing independent houses of their own in some other area.  All this led to an increase in activity, a generation of industry, a sense of dynamism and excitement in the construction industry.  This scheme which was the last ditch hope of many persons in local authority houses to own a house of their own has been dispensed with.</P>
    <P>If you look at the estimates of the various local authorities at present, there is a startling contrast when you come to the programme dealing with construction, the building industry and so on.  If you look at the estimates in that segment for 1987, 1986 and 1985, you will see the number of houses at design stage in each local authority area.  The number of houses in the course of construction was evidence that a lot was happening in the construction industry.  The number of houses anticipated for completion was statistically enumerated for everybody to see, but this year the pages are largely blank.  Certainly, in the local authority of which I am a member it is envisaged that there will be no new start-ups in any of the provincial towns in County Mayo.  All of this serves to underline the fact that housing and housing policy, for some reason, has gone out the window.  I <Col N="1599" /> should like to know from the Minister of State when it is envisaged it will come back again so that people will know precisely where they are and what the housing policy will be for the future.</P>
    <P>This is all the more extraordinary when one considers that there was a very clear commitment given at an Ard Fheis less than 12 months ago that there would be a massive injection of capital into the construction industry.  A sum of £200 milion was to be pumped in in order to create 20,000 jobs.  This massive investment was intended to create the necessary buoyancy in the construction industry to carry it over the hump and set the scene for a massive inflow of capital into the nineties and the next century.  It is extraordinary also that this year it is proposed to cut public building projects funded by the Department of the Environment by £250 million.  Rather than the anticipated additional investment of £200 million as stated at the Ard Fheis, we have in addition the further taking out of £250 million from the public building projects.  Let nobody say that the Government's decentralisation plan will compensate for that massive reduction of spending in this area.</P>
    <P>The day on which the Minister of State introduced the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1987, to the House, people were startled by a tandem announcement from the Minister in relation to the funding of local authority house purchases.  Local authority housing loans which were one of the really worthwhile schemes which were worth maintaining, because if ever a scheme did a tremendous amount to keep our housing programme up and enabled people, particularly in the lower income sector to realise the ambition of owning their own homes, it was this particular scheme. People knew it had a beginning and an end.  There were terms of reference which were clear and defined.  There was an interest rate which was generally lower than the interest rate which prevailed in the banks and lending institutions and in insurance companies.  At present, it is pitched at 9¾ per cent.  It was frozen and <Col N="1600" /> static and repayments from day one or at the end of the 30 year repayment period were precisely the same.  People could budget for it.  It was within the means and the income of the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has decided that this scheme is no longer essentially in being. I know the scheme is in being but what is intended in this is that the Minister has signalled the beginning of the end of SDA loans.  Despite all the verbiage and the many explanations, when you look at the reality of the scheme from now on it is the beginning of the end of SDA loans. From now on a person seeking an SDA loan must hawk his or her financial credentials around to a building society or a banking institution to have them vetted. If a person is found not to be a sure risk for a building society or a bank and is rejected by them, he will then have to go to the housing section of Offaly, Laois, Mayo or some other county council. Local authorities are now expected to take up the financial rejects of the lending agencies.  No local authority housing officer can be expected to pick up the tabs in such cases.  Local authority housing officers and county managers have said quite clearly that this is inoperable, that it will not work and that they will not work it.</P>
    <P>One of the salutary statistics within the estimates which are now in the process of discussion and completion at various local authorities is the fact that every local authority already have massive arrears in relation to SDA loans, accumulated as a result of job losses in some cases and, in other cases, because people tend to piggy back on the needy.  If some people see that there is a tendency to be lenient or flexible or that there is a general inclination on the part of the powers that be to restructure loans or to put repayments in abeyance for a period until somebody gets back again into the mainstream of earning a living in this tossing economy, they tend to jump on the band wagon.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people who now find themselves in financial difficulty in relation to the repayment of loans are <Col N="1601" /> genuine and decent people.  When they negotiated their contracts they were in a position to see things through within their earning capacities.  Local authorities cannot be expected to take on board more lame ducks or to take into the net, in an open-minded fashion, people who for very good financial reasons have been rejected by bank managers and building society managers.  This is an area which cries out for redress, rectification and amendment.  The Minister should seriously look at this because the implications, in terms of housing numbers, are going to be devastating.  People will undoubtedly be put in the position of having to stay in local authority houses whereas, given the scheme that was in operation and given, in particular, that interest rates have fallen from 12½ to 9¾ per cent during the past two years, they would have been increasingly induced to move in the direction of borrowing to buy their own houses.</P>
    <P>I never cease to be bewildered at the stereotype bureaucracy which sets confines, restrictions or deadlines.  I notice that the two gentlemen sitting beside the Minister are smiling at my remarks.  I am convinced that bureaucrats very often tend to be overly rigid in relation to guidelines and regulations when a little flexibility might have the desired and productive effect.  I am referring, in particular, to the threshold in respect of the area of a new house in terms of the grant, that is, 1,346 square feet.  This is what the threshold has been and looks like remaining at.  Therefore, if a person's house is at or under that dimension, he will qualify for the £2,000 new house grant but if his house is larger than that area he will not qualify for anything. There are before the Minister and his Department pathetic pleas from people who, through no fault of their own but because of a minor aberration on the part of a contractor, went marginally over the limit for qualification.  The Minister should look seriously at the possibility of having some kind of penalisation clause, a kind of <i>quid pro quo,</i> whereby if somebody errs by a margin of one foot, one metre or ten feet there should be a commensurate <Col N="1602" /> reduction in the amount of the grant rather than a total demolition of the grant.</P>

      <P>Marginally, but I am about to revert again.  The Bill is intended to create greater energy, activity and industry in the housing sector.  I am merely adding the minor ancillary point that if the Minister or his Department could agree that there should be no upper limit in relation to qualification square footage for a new house grant, this might have the desired effect of providing an added impetus at a time of extreme recession.  Somebody who builds a house which covers 2,000 square feet uses more materials and has more input tradewise. There is more value added tax and more activity involved and a longer period is needed to build the house so that throughout the duration of the construction of that house there is a greater sense of activity.  Because it will not cost the Department anything, they should move in this area.  If the Minister or the Department decide at some stage to introduce some type of property tax this would obviously have a commensurate knock-on effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency scheme is an excellent one.  There is no doubt that it has enabled many people who would not otherwise have been facilitated with a loan elsewhere to have income-related loans with a view to providing their own houses.  I welcome the general thrust of the scheme but I still maintain that if all of the other blocks that have been in place in the construction industry were dislodged, it would be seen that there has been a very significant reduction in the level of construction in this country.  Today I got statistics from the Central Statistics Office in relation to local authority and private housing during the past number of years.  In 1983, 6,190 local authority houses and 19,948 private dwellings were constructed; in 1984, there were 7,002 local authority <Col N="1603" /> houses and 17,942 private dwellings constructed; in 1985, 6,523 houses were built in the local authority sector and 17,425 houses in the private sector and in 1986, 5,517 houses were constructed in the local authority sector and 17,163 houses in the private sector.  So there has been a consistent pattern right through.  The local authority sector averaged between 5,500 and 7,000 and the private sector averaged between 17,000 and 17,900 houses built over the four year period. There has not been a great deviation over the period.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1987 show the writing on the wall because for the first three months the number of local authority houses constructed was 701 and the number of private dwellings constructed was 4,145.  For the second three months up to June 1987, the number of houses completed in the local authority sector was 1,002 and the number completed in the private sector was 3,360.  Therefore, for the first six months of this year the number of local authority houses actually completed is a mere 1,803, far below the average for the previous four years of 5,500.  The number of private dwellings constructed during the first six months of the year was 7,500, substantially below the average figure of 17,000 for the previous four years.  The signs are ominous. There are grounds for pessimism.  The portents are, given the massive scaling down and withdrawal of investment this year, that there will be a substantial reduction in new house numbers in both the local authority and the private sectors when we review the input of the new Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>The wholesale disillusionment, dismay and despondency so prevalent in the construction industry will be considerably exacerbated this time next year.  Recently Mr. Tom Reynolds, managing director of the Construction Industry Federation speaking on behalf of the industry said as reported in the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>The impact on the industry next year will be savage and devastating: and <Col N="1604" /> will result in widespread job losses, company closures and yet further emigration. Public capital expenditure has yet again borne the brunt of the reduction in overall Government expenditure but it only represents 13 per cent of overall expenditure &mdash; despite accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the total cuts in all public expenditure being proposed for 1988.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that a sector which has always been a mainstay of employment, labour intensive and providing much needed employment when other areas of the economy were reeling from job losses and economic devastation is, for the first time in its life, totally on the broad of its back.  If we are to revive the industry and give it the necessary injection to stop the emigrant boat again draining away the life blood of the country, it will take far more than the increase in the borrowing requirement of the Housing Finance Agency as envisaged in this measure.  I appeal to the Minister, in the name of Heaven, to examine the key components which were so vitally part of the construction industry and to put them back in place again.</P>
    <P>I have never subscribed to the idea that the construction industry of itself was a productive sector.  Generally speaking, the construction industry is a barometer of the economic health of the country.  It responds to economic activity.  At a time when jobs are being devastated, when people are being forced out of the country, having been lured into the open, legitimate taxation market, and when families are in total disarray and do not know where the next penny will come from, as I see it the construction industry is the only sector in the short term that could provide the necessary safety net to save the family and social structure. While I wlecome the Bill, I believe it is too little, too late.</P>

      <P>First, I thank all Deputies for their contributions. The debate has been wide ranging and has covered more areas than <Col N="1605" /> the provisions in the Bill.  I can, therefore, understand that it is a very fundamental issue.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, of course, a technical measure designed to increase the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency and to validate the payment of grants to the agency.  It is, nevertheless, a very important Bill in that it reaffirms this Government's commitment to the principle of private house ownership and it established firmly the Housing Finance Agency's role as the primary source of State funds for private housing.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it very clear straight away that, contrary to what Deputy Boland alleged in his contribution, there will be adequate funds available for house purchasers on modest incomes in 1988.  In fact, the commercial lending agencies have funds available which can be used to finance loans for a substantial number of house purchasers in this sector.  The Government have harnessed this money and devised arrangements which will enable the agencies to depart from their normal requirements and limitations so as to meet the needs of people on lower incomes.  These arrangements will enable the Government to reduce the published Public Capital Programme provision for local authority loans in 1988 while at the same time maintaining the availability of mortgage funds for house purchasers on modest means.  Under the new package the building societies and banks will increase their funding to this segment of the mortgage market by up to £70 million in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority loan schemes account for about 25 per cent of all house purchase loans.  Both by historical and international standards the public sector is currently funding an exceptionally high proportion of mortgage lending.  An analysis of local authority borrowers shows that many of them would be quite capable of obtaining loans from other lending agencies especially since interest rates have fallen significantly.  Indeed, the agencies were already servicing part of the market.  Given these facts and the <Col N="1606" /> healthy funding position of these agencies, the arrangements are a logical extension of the Government's drive to reduce public borrowing and expenditure. Contrary to Deputy Boland's allegation, the new arrangements will not reduce the capacity of people to house themselves.  The Public Capital Programme provision for 1988 will be £100 million and together with the £70 million additional funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Public Service Expenditure Allocations for 1988: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> on Wednesday, 18 November 1987:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann conscious of the serious effect of projected 1988 expenditure allocations on many public services currently provided:</P>
    <P>&mdash;and in particular the unacceptable increases in class sizes at primary level through the worsening of the pupil-teacher ratio and the consequent weakening of the entire educational system;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and also the difficulties for many public service employees arising from the operation of the redundancy and redeployment schemes;</P>
    <P>notes that the cost in 1988 to the Exchequer of the Draft Agreement on Pay in the Public Service will be an estimated £70 million while the reductions through staff shedding are similarly estimated for 1988 at £70 million (before the cost of redundancy and lump sum payments, not yet disclosed):</P>
    <P>&mdash;calls on the social partners forthwith <Col N="1607" /> to return to discussions so as to achieve a better balance between continuation of public services, public service employment and public service pay;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and in that context, requests the public service unions to suspend all further action on the current 1987 Draft Agreement on Pay in the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;affirms that the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> including the Draft Public Service Pay Agreement and the analogous Draft Private Sector Pay Agreement, negotiated between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industries, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Cooperative Organisation Society and Macra na Feirme represents a concerted and balanced approach, unique in our history, to the grave problems facing the country and an equitable sharing of the burdens which have to be borne by the different sectors of the community as well as providing a sound basis, agreed between all economic and social interests, for increasing growth and employment; in that context it endorses the contribution made by the trade unions particularly as regards pay in the formulation of this type of participative economic programme long sought by the trade union movement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday I said that the question of the pupil-teacher ratio must be taken in the context of the economic reality.  If Ireland were a limited company we would have declared ourselves to be in liquidation a long time ago.  The public finances have been deteriorating for a considerable time.  At the end of last year we had a total national debt of £25 billion which represents about 150 per cent of GNP.  If any company on this island were in that financial condition the liquidator would long since have been called in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past 15 years politicians and the public have collaborated in an act of national suicide.  We have indiscriminately put the country into an impossible situation.  I have been consistent in saying over many years that extreme measures would have to be taken or we would reach this situation.  At least there is now a general consensus abroad that we have come to the day of reality.  In the past ten years we have had innumerable elections and, apart from the election earlier this year, most of them were conducted in an atmosphere of total unreality in regard to the real state of the country.  I need not recall the famous Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 but I would add the famous Fine Gael manifesto of 1981 which promised £9.60 for working wives.  During the most recent election campaign most of the parties conducted the debate in a realistic manner, except for one party who recognised the problem of the <Col N="1609" /> national finances but wanted to introduce overnight a tax rate of 25 per cent.  Let us all take our full share of the blame.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government in 15 years at least who have made any real effort. We have all talked about the crisis in the public finances but under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, this Government have faced reality.  The reality is that the public services we provide may all be very necessary and desirable but we cannot afford them.  It might be very necessary and desirable for a lady in Kildare who has six children to have a tumble dryer but if her husband earns only £150 per week she cannot afford it and does not get it. We have behaved as if the State can afford everything over night and we have provided ourselves with a level of services whose cost we cannot afford when compared with the income of the State.  It is a matter of facing up now to the state of public finances.  If we do not do so, we will not need to worry about health, education or anything else in a few years time because we will not have any services at all.</P>
    <P>I recognise the new consensus in this House on the question of public finances and I should like to comment on the position of the present leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes.  There is a great Irish tradition of always speaking well of the dead.  A particular person who has passed on may have been the greatest bowsie in the locality but when he has gone it will be said that he was not the worst of them.  A friend of mine usually replies to such a remark by agreeing that this individual was not the worst but adding that he was one of the worst. In politics it is not usual to compliment anybody until he has passed on in the political sense.  As a student in the sixties I do not remember any of the political parties at the time praising the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, but when he passed on people recognised the worth of what he did for Ireland.  What I am about to say will not be of any benefit to the object of my remarks or to myself in the political sense.  I wish publicly to congratulate Deputy Alan Dukes, the Leader of Fine <Col N="1610" /> Gael, on his radical new approach to Opposition politics.  Knowing the realities of Irish politics, I am aware that he will not be able to continue this approach <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>Many times during my career I have spoken about our ridiculous adversarial style of politics.  What makes it even more ridiculous is the fact that it is impossible to discern any ideological difference between the main conservative parties. In the past those parties were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but now they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  This view has been shared by many people in Ireland and in this House, particularly Deputy John Kelly, Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others of the left and myself.  I am not sure where I would classify the Progressive Democrats in this new scenario.  The approach of Deputy Dukes is a radical new departure which I wholeheartedly welcome.</P>
    <P>I have never envied the task of any Minister for Education.  My remarks on the topic of education will be made in the context of the overall economic realities. If I had a choice of ministry, which probably will never happen, education would be at the bottom of my list.  It has been consistently the most difficult ministry during any five-year period.  The headaches of any Minister for Education can be classified under a number of headings. I will confine myself to two, but these can be subdivided many times.</P>
    <P>The actual size of the Department of Education, with so many different sections, makes it exceptionally difficult. During my experience as a Dáil Deputy I have found the Department of Education under Ministers of various political parties the most frustrating to deal with at any level.  The civil service of that Department is the monolith of all monoliths. I extend my sincerest sympathy to any Minister dealing with such a bureaucratic monster.  The foregoing comments probably mean that I will end up being purposely frustrated by the bureaucrats in that Department.</P>
    <P>The other problem facing the Minister in that Department is the major interest <Col N="1611" /> groups concerned in education &mdash; parents, churches, the multiplicity of unions and pupils.  These add to any Minister's problems and all must be dealt with at primary, secondary and third level. Under these headings there are many subdivisions.  For example, at second level we have vocational schools, community colleges and religious secondary schools.  In any small town in Ireland one can find a vocational school, a day boys' secondary school, a day girls' secondary school and probably a boarding school.</P>
    <P>We have triplication, often quadruplication, of resources at second level in most towns.  The State would need an oil well in every county to fund such an outmoded and crazy system.  There are historical reasons for the growth of the foregoing and I must put on record my appreciation of the sterling work done by those sections of education in the past. However, is it not time to look at what I consider to be a waste of scarce resources at second level?  My views may be somewhat controversial but in my view they are only commonsense.</P>
    <P>I have ideas about the funding of third level education which may not be universally popular.  Why should the State, mostly through the taxes of the ordinary working class, provide resources which in the main will benefit those of a higher class who as a result of such third level education will be in a position to generate incomes for themselves to provide a lifestyle for the rest of their lives to which the ordinary working class can never aspire? Increasingly third level graduates are emigrating, either forced or voluntarily. Whether emigration of the graduate is long or short term, the Irish taxpayer loses out.  If the graduate never returns, some other country benefits from the investment by the Irish State and its taxpayers. If he or she returns some years later the earning power of that person has increased dramatically to the benefit of that person alone.  Is it not time to at least consider the major funding of third level education by a system of loans <Col N="1612" /> instead of grants?  The exact details of such a scheme would take detailed preparation but it should at least be considered.</P>
    <P>The time span of this debate does not allow me to develop that and other arguments but I have made my points to illustrate the following: 1, the problems faced by any Minister for Education; 2, to emphasise the need for radical restructuring that is so obviously well overdue; 3, the waste of resources is endemic to the system and by some restructuring those scarce resources could be better utilised and, 4, to draw a direct link between my comments earlier and the debate tonight.</P>
    <P>Can Members envisage the uproar that would ensue from the vested interests if any of the changes I have suggested were even spoken of by a Minister for Education? The Minister would have the teachers' unions, churches, pupils, parents and all interest groups up in arms, each jealously guarding their own sphere of influence.  Therefore, I wish to emphasise that I have every sympathy for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  She must try to live within her budget at the time of the greatest financial crisis in the history of the State.  She has put forward her proposals for the pupil-teacher ratio as a way of living within her overall budget.  I know her proposals are genuine and are put forward in what she considers to be the least disruptive way.  However, I believe the Minister has taken the wrong option in her proposals.  She has made a serious mistake, one that should be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Constitution refers to education in one sphere only, that is, primary education. Therefore, if overall education must take its share of the cutbacks the least affected area should be the primary sector.  The figure we are talking about to reverse the changes is quite small in an overall budget for the Department of £1,100 million.  It is an even smaller percentage of total Government spending proposals for 1988.  If I could not find that amount of money in such a huge sum I would throw my hat at it.</P>
    <P>The Education Estimate for 1988 at more than £1,100 million is equivalent to <Col N="1613" /> 18 per cent of Government expenditure next year and salaries and pensions represent more than 82 per cent of that Estimate. In the primary education sector of that Estimate salaries and pensions comprise 90 per cent approximately of the sum provided.  Therefore, if savings are to be made in the education budget it is self-evident they must come from the salaries area.  I agree with the Minister for Finance that it is not feasible to agree with the proposal in the Fine Gael motion which advocates an adjustment to the national wage agreement.  However, I welcome the Fine Gael approach because it is not the usual blanket Opposition politics that has bedevilled this House and this country for too long.  It is in line with the new Alan Dukes' strategy which I heartily welcome.</P>
    <P>Since I have said I believe the Minister has taken the wrong option it is important that I should put forward my cost saving measures.  I do so in the absolute knowledge that they will not be universally popular and will incur the wrath of other interests and pressure groups.  I should like to assure the Minister that irrespective of the savings she tries to implement she will incur the wrath of other pressure groups.  My first proposal is that the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools should remain unchanged, left at the old ratio before the changes were announced by the Minister.  My second proposal is that the school entry age be increased to five years of age and the third is that the voluntary redundancy and redeployment packages should proceed as planned.  My fourth proposal is that there should be no intake into teacher training colleges in 1988 at least and the fifth is that if the required savings in the primary budget for 1988 are not attainable under the other proposals the budgets for second level and, in particular, third level education for 1988 should be proportionately reduced.  I recommend to the Minister that if the suggestions I have put forward do not produce sufficient savings she should look to the third level sector.  I make that suggestion in the knowledge that we will have more marches on our streets and <Col N="1614" /> more groups putting pressure on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The most controversial aspect of my proposals relate to the school entry age and the cessation of the intake into teacher training in 1988.  Apart from cost savings there are sound education reasons for raising the school entry age to five years.  The time span of the debate does not permit me to develop my argument in greater detail but I am aware that a number of educationalists agree with me.  I expect that my good friend, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, whose views I greatly respect, will object strongly to that suggestion and point out the many disadvantages to the underprivileged if such a proposal was introduced.  The argument can rightly be made that Ireland has no formal pre-school system and only the well-off can afford pre-schooling. Such arguments would be totally consistent with Deputy Higgins' views, a Member who has genuine socialist principles and whose whole <i>raison d'être</i> for entering politics stems from that very solid foundation.  I happen to believe in the capitalist system and I make no bones about saying it.</P>
    <P>My proposals are based on our current financial position.  My capitalist argument, if that is what people wish to call it, is that we cannot keep providing ourselves with a level of public services the cost of which we cannot afford in relation to our income.  Is it not better educationally to give children in primary schools a good sound education as is just possible under the present pupil-teacher ratio rather than increasing the ratio in class sizes to such a level that all children lose out?  For a large segment of our children primary education will be the only formal education they will receive. I will not accept the other standard objection, that some children will be almost six before they go to school.  That problem is not insurmountable.  A very simple solution, and a way out that is used in other countries, is to start all children at school on the day they reach five years of age.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation who must bear some responsibility for the <Col N="1615" /> mess they find themselves in.  Last summer it was leaked, rightly or wrongly, that the Government were considering making some changes in regard to the school entry age and the INTO were up in arms.  Any proposal is unacceptable to the INTO.  As a trade union it is their job to protect the interests of their members and future members.  Any Minister for Education should be alive to the fact that all proposals for change will be resisted by the teachers' unions.  Any Minister who would think otherwise is not living in the realms of political reality.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly an orchestrated campaign at the moment led by the teachers, but I would not like to over-emphasise it.  In any country when people have a good and just cause it is extremely easy to motivate them.  The people of Ireland are not fools.  When the INTO in the last couple of years mounted a campaign about the 15 per cent, the public were not behind them but parents and the public are behind them in this matter because the parents have a very just cause.</P>
    <P>Regarding my proposal on teacher training, what is the point in taking more people into teacher training in September 1988 when we are trying to get teachers out of the system by offering voluntary redundancies?  It just does not add up. Any Minister for Education can rest assured that, irrespective of what is done, it will cause difficulties and there is no doubt she will bring the unions down on top of her.  There are also many other pressure groups.</P>
    <P>I had some misgivings about speaking in this debate this evening and outlining my proposals.  It was not, as some people might assume, because I was coming into conflict with my own Minister for Education &mdash; those considerations have never bothered me in my political career in the past, do not now and hopefully will not for as long as I remain in politics &mdash; but my misgivings related to the fact that I urged governments over many years, first, to take a strong line on public finances and, secondly, to resist the policies of the pressure groups.  My constituents are <Col N="1616" /> aware of that.  Whether my party are in power or in Opposition, I do not succumb to any form of pressure from any interest group.  I can assure the House that I would be saying the same things tonight if there were only ten people in the country against these proposals.  I do so because I believe the impact of the present proposals on the primary education system is disproportionate.</P>
    <P>At long last, there is an understanding among all sections of the community that cutbacks need to be made in all areas of Government expenditure.  Parents, teachers and all sections of Irish society are willing to face up to this fact. However, the present proposals smack too much of the slide rule approach.  The economists, dream of a perfect economic Ireland would have the whole population spread evenly around the country.  All parishes would have about 30 children born each year and the panel system would not operate as it does but on a national basis.  However, this is not the case.  If the perfect economic argument could be found, these proposals might not hit so hard.  However, the areas of burgeoning population will be hit the hardest by the Minister's proposals. Undoubtedly many schools in rural Ireland will not be affected at all.</P>
    <P>I made my views knows to the Minister before tonight.  I think she has taken the wrong options in dealing with this matter. I put forward what I considered constructive proposals to solve the impasse. My ideas will not meet with universal approval; neither will anybody else's. They will not meet with approval either inside or outside this House.  Indeed, there may be many better ways.  I am not saying my ideas are sacrosanct but at least they should be considered.</P>
    <P>I recognise the financial and budgetary constraints and I am happy that the overall spending on education and the Government's proposals for 1988 are sufficient, given the state of the nation's finances.  There is no disgrace in owning up to mistakes.  I speak as somebody who has had more practice in making mistakes that anybody else and it is probably easier for me to say this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> I hope the Minister's mind is not closed on this issue.  I know it does not make it easier for her when she has to listen to contradictory statements on the public finances from the mould-breakers on one side of the House who at the same time not alone will oppose this measure but any other measure she may introduce. The overriding consideration must be to take the correct policy option.  I do not believe the current proposals are the best available.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there will be hardship in other areas of education if the Minister adopts a different approach, but in all honesty I have concluded that her present primary education proposals regarding the pupil-teacher ratio should be changed to a more advantageous one.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in her predicament but I would be failing in my duty as an elected representative if I did not point out to her the folly of her present proposals.  Furthermore, I know I speak for a large majority of my Fianna Fáil backbench colleagues.  I urge her to reconsider her proposals on the lines I have suggested.  If there are better and more effective suggestions than mine, I would gladly accept them.</P>

      <P>One could be forgiven, listening to the opening of the debate, for being confused as to whether we were discussing the economy or a very specific proposal on education.  Of course, the economy is inextricably linked with making provision for education. When the Estimates for the Department of Education were published and showed a cut of £44 million in the provision for primary education, the Labour Party voted against that Estimate. It was clear to us then that because of the known salary content of the provision that is normally made for primary education, there would have to be an adjustment in the number of teachers who would be allowed to survive in primary education.  We later tabled a number of motions dealing with the implications of the different cuts in education. I cannot go into all of them this evening in the limited time available to <Col N="1618" /> me, and in that regard, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like to share some of the time available to me with Deputy Spring.</P>

      <P>The general cuts in education which have been announced fall on the educational sector in a way that deepens the existing social inequalities in our society.  I would like to tell the Minister that whatever the results of our votes this evening, she can look forward to a campaign continuing and widening to include, for example, the most inequitable cuts which have been announced for the vocational sector which is carrying more than its share of remedial education and the provision of education for the disadvantaged.  But the entire country is watching this evening because they are considering the effect of the Minister's Circular 20/87 on the primary sector of education.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment on the Order Paper to the Fine Gael motion is as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;aware that the Minister for Education and the Government has made one of the most profoundly erroneous and damaging policy decisions in the development of first level education in the history of our country in relation to the pupil/teacher ratio at primary school level; and conscious that the Minister has seriously underestimated the amount of hardship and disadvantage that her Circular letter 20/87 will cause; and mindful of the impact on social justice and future economic, social, and cultural development of such a severe attack on primary education instructs the Minister to cause the Circular to be withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what parents, teachers and the <Col N="1619" /> public who are interested in primary education want.  They want the circular withdrawn. We worded our amendment deliberately and we sought earlier today to be more formal on the implications of our amendment.  We have no objection to talks between all the parties to see what our proposals would be for making good the amount of funding required to restore the position of primary education.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment is worded in such a way that it could reasonably expect support from those who may differ in their approach to the economy but who share the conviction that this circular is profoundly damaging for primary education.  The message that has come from public meetings of parents, managers of schools, pupils themselves and the concerned public is a simple one &mdash; withdraw the circular and then let us discuss the matter of provision in education and let us have a debate on it. This does not represent any derogation of responsibility in relation to the economy of the Labour Party.  I could very easily list a number of ways in which the Labour Party favour the provision of sufficient funds for education.  I could begin by noting that capital taxation as a proportion of total taxation is 4 per cent whereas in 1977 it was 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>I could refer to the amount of interest paid by State and semi-State bodies, health boards and others to the commercial banking sector last year which yielded a figure of over £500 million.  I could refer to wealth tax and so on but many people in Opposition would have proposals to make as to where funds would be provided.  The public are of one mind, they are concerned as to the effect of this circular in the classroom on their children.  The circular is sinister in its effect in a number of ways.  No political party in this House have sought or received any mandate to effect a turning around of our debt to GNP ratio on the backs of small children who rely on primary education for their main, constitutionally guaranteed source of education.</P>
    <P>Education has always been one of the <Col N="1620" /> great institutional mechanisms by which a class divided, unequal society reproduces itself.  This is revealed in the expenditure on education.  On the basis of income, the top fifth consume over 30 per cent of the total expenditure on education and the bottom fifth consume 9 per cent. From primary level through to third level the differences in entry go by socio-economic groups.  The differences in participation grow and the differences in qualification at the end grow.  In many ways, we have facilitated the reproduction of a class divided society.</P>
    <P>There are those in this House who do not like concepts like class and there is a good reason for that.  In a kind of illiterate and semi-ignorant politics, it is not very useful to speak about well known concepts in political and social differences in the civilised world.  Thus, people come out with the notion that we are a small country with very little real differences between us.  The figures are there in income, wealth and access to the resources of the State that clearly show a divided society in many respects, in the amount of wealth it holds, in income, debts and in participation in society.  As unemployment bites, there is an emerging two-tier citizenship in which people who are below certain levels of income find themselves disqualified from forms of participation in society.  It does not seem to bother many people that they are given an equal right to participation in taxation if they are PAYE workers. However, when you compare the unskilled worker on the PAYE scale with the professional person on the same scale, the professional person's family have eight times the chance of their child entering a third level institution.</P>
    <P>This is relevant in so far as perhaps the only area of education where there might have been equality to which parents had looked for what they saw as a constitutional guarantee of at least primary education is being attacked by the Minister's circular.  The Minister is well aware at this stage of the rage as a result of Circular 20/87.  It has uniquely united teachers, parents, children, educationalists and the public in its rejection <Col N="1621" /> as a badly thought out ploy circulated to schools without its consequences being clearly thought out.  If there is need for evidence of that assertion, it is in the Minister's own statement.  She first said that 1,300 teachers would be unemployed as a result, she then raised the figure to 1,800 and then she shifted her ground again when she said that affected schools would be brought into her review committee to work out their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Was the responsibility not on the Minister to know what she was doing in education before the circular was issued? When a circular is issued changing the ratio of pupils and teachers it can be judged very clearly if you know the enrolment in different schools.  It was very easy to see that the large urban schools carrying a heavy component of disadvantaged children would suffer most. If you take &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; in its broadest term, including the particular needs of the very highly talented child to the child who might be having reading difficulties, and if you lose these children in larger classes and delay the possibility of their difficulties being recognised, you are preventing them from future participation in education.  If we accepted a figure of 5 per cent or 6 per cent of all children having some kind of special needs, the number of children affected by the circular would be over 120,000.</P>
    <P>If you increase the class size it is not only the child with special difficulties who will suffer; all children in the class are affected.  Indeed, when the INTO began their survey of the effects of the circular it was very interesting to note that the preliminary results for parts of Dublin city showed that 21,350 pupils in the greater Dublin area would have to be redistributed around classes in different schools, accepting the average class size of 30.5 given by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There is a worse side to this.  Ignoring the position of disadvantaged children, unwilling to acknowledge the effects by increasing class sizes, the Minister goes very much further and argues that the teachers and the parents put up with it in the past and that they could do so again. <Col N="1622" /> This pathetic Minister for Education is moving backwards at a rate of knots. She wants to tell the teachers who were willing to comply with a request in 1971 to teach the child-centred curriculum that they should do the same in 1987.  No doubt, by the end of next year she will be back to the class sizes of the sixties and we may look forward to class sizes which obtained in the fifties.</P>
    <P>I am a parent with three children at primary level and I had been looking forward to a time when there would be less pressure on teachers.  It was to be a time for innovation and for expanding the child-centred core of the curriculum. However, that is now an aspiration.  How can you have child-centred education in classes that move upwards from 40, 45 and, in some cases, over 50?  What can you say to a teacher who has been trained in the new curriculum?  Is he or she to be told that they must now try to keep control and discipline?  No doubt there will be the odd hack who will tell the Minister that the old way was good and that it worked.  If we want that old version of education, we accept that we must have Circular 20/87.</P>
    <P>Anybody who believes in child centred education and anybody who had the aspiration to think that all those old days of heavy discipline might have gone and that the teacher might have been able to address the needs of each individual pupil, that the child centred curriculum would be extended beyond the tested measures that have been used in the introduction of drama, art, music and other things that would have incorporated a centre of creativity in education, is concerned about Circular 20/87. It represents a savage unplanned backward proposal for a level of education at a time perhaps 50 years ago when there was an aspiration to some kind of equality of access even in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is a side to this which is tragic.  If we take the cost of producing an average primary teacher we could ask what has the State invested wisely.  In terms of producing a young teacher the State invests many thousands of pounds.  At the moment there are over 2,000 teachers <Col N="1623" /> who are not in full time, permanent employment.  For the next three years 500 per year will leave the training colleges, that is 3,500.  To that the Minister proposes to add 2,000.  This means that even under the old curriculum there has been many millions of pounds of State investment in preparing teachers who could be available for children, but that is not what is happening.  Teachers are being told that they will not be employed and parents are told that they must be happy with the old curriculum and that children must be happy in larger classes.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger, because of the Irish schizophrenic condition in principal matters that in speaking in strong terms in favour of the adequate funding of education one is disqualifying oneself somehow from the realms of reason and economy.  How wise and rational is it, in economic terms, to squander £70 million or £80 million worth of human resources from unemployed teachers in a country like ours that has so many children?  How wise is it to say that the children must carry their share of the national debt?  I have listened for years to people taking the national debt and dividing it by every person.  It is an meaningful as dividing it by all the dogs and cats in the country. Listening to that, one would think that one was a cat walking around with a piece of the national debt hanging from one's neck.</P>
    <P>We know how the national debt was amassed.  I know better than many people about one figure that the Minister might bear in mind.  Last year the figure given for industrial promotion purposes for an industrial policy exceeded the education budget.  It was £1.245 billion approximately. Can we turn around and ask the question, having spent all this money in achieving industrialisation that has not emerged, looking at unemployment rising, is that not a failure?  Instead, we are invited to look at the total cost of education.  Any person interested in trying to establish some moral absolutes would have to accept that whether we succeed in economic planning, because of our hostility to planning, whether we <Col N="1624" /> succeed in creating employment, let us at least provide education and even if we are going to say that we will not provide adequately for second or third level, let us not go back beyond the famous statement of Mr. de Valera, that most would have to do with primary education.  The Minister has gone beyond that point.  She is simply saying that people cannot look forward to primary education in classes that can be managed with a sensible and flexible programme.  She is saying &ldquo;let the classes get bigger&rdquo;.  I need not add on what she has also said, that classrooms will not be improved unless it is an emergency repair.  What is an emergency repair?  It does not include condemned buildings.  It does not include windows being missing.  The Minister's recipe for primary education is to cut back on repairs, and abandon any new extensions on buildings.  The Minister did not cry halt at that; her idea was to have four teachers so that the classes can grow bigger and then she added piously, as did many of her colleagues: &ldquo;let us all hope that when this miracle worker who now heads the Government has finished his course, we will be able to get back to civilised levels of classes again&rdquo;.  May the Lord indeed help us.  There is here at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche, you <Col N="1625" /> have not waited too long and you will in your time get much opportunity of listening to economics and to what might be the case for planning.</P>
      <P>This circular will be of major consequence to people who may find themselves on the emigrant boat within the next decade or two.  Can we not say that despite all our economic difficulties, despite all the measures we need to take on the economy, we will leave education alone, particularly primary education, which every child in the country aspires to finish, so that there will be one place where every child can consume equally the benefits of a child centred programme? Could we not leave that alone at least?</P>
      <P>Many people who have listened to politicians for a long time have been sending a special message to this House asking us to leave the quality of primary education alone, to look elsewhere for whatever draconian measures we may wish to achieve. We are in this House to represent this point of view.  This is, I hope, a point of view that will prevail this evening with the withdrawal of the circular.  As well as this, it is absolutely scandalous for a Minister to be backed by a party that did not campaign on cuts in primary education. There is no mandate for this circular. It should be withdrawn and my party will oppose it.</P>

      <P>I have a number of regrets about this.  I regret that we are not dealing just with education because with the cuts in the primary sector it is the most pressing question facing us here now.  I regret that the Ceann Comhairle did not see fit to allow the addendum which I submitted this afternoon to the Chair's office on behalf of the Labour Party.  I regret in the interests of the public and the parents of the children in primary schools that the Chair did not see fit to allow that to be taken this evening as a matter of urgent necessity.  That is a matter of regret but <Col N="1626" /> it is your decision, Sir, and I will be bound by it.</P>
      <P>There is a temptation in this House &mdash; given the general nature of the motion before us &mdash; to discuss many matters.  I intend to be very specific.  I intend to speak strictly on the proposed cutbacks in the primary education sector.  What is important in this House this evening is that the Government are stopped, before they go any further, in relation to their proposals on primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last number of years in this House the present Minister for Education came in here on many occasions and pretended to be concerned about what was happening in education.  She pretended to have a concern for the under-privileged and the less well off in the field of education.  But when it came to the first test, or perhaps this is the second test, they failed without getting it on to the Floor of this House; the first test took place over a weekend when the Government, on a Friday, were considering increasing the age of entry to primary schools.  They did not need to put that test to the country, to this House or outside it, they withdrew it themselves after one weekend.  When it came to the second test &mdash; which is that now contained in Circular 20/87 &mdash; where had the concern of the Minister evaporated to all of a sudden?  Where is the understanding that she set out to portray in this House on many occasions over the last four years?  Where is the feeling of those days gone?  I say to the Members of this House and to the Minister that not one iota of that which was displayed here over the last four years is now present, not one inch in terms of response from the present Minister for Education.  One might well ask what response the Minister gave publicly when she was challenged as to what she was doing in education and the destruction she was going to bring about? When she was first confronted, asked for an explanation, on explanation which was long overdue, and why she reneged on all of the statements of the last four years, alas, her reply, was a weak, arrogant and insensitive one: &ldquo;Ah, but I am now the Minister for Education&rdquo;.  That reply was <Col N="1627" /> inadequate.  Not only was it inadequate but it was a gross insult to the Members of this House.  It was a gross insult to every parent with a child in primary education or indeed in any sector of our educational system.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important to direct our remarks this evening strictly to the aspects of Circular 20/87, those aspects which would lead to an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio and which would prevent in the future the concept of the walking principals in our national schools.  I am absolutely amazed that the Minister for Education, with her background in education, can come into this House and present the proposals she has attempted to make.  The fact that the proposals have not been well thought out, the fact that they are inherently weak, that they will not withstand the test, has and must have become apparent over the weekend.  The Minister herself has started to run for cover offering a review body before the proposals were even put to the test in this House.  It will be too late &mdash; and the parents of this country know this and have said so over the weekend to every Member of this House &mdash; to have a review body after the vote has been taken here this evening.  There is no point in reducing the numbers of teachers and then coming back with the offer of review body.  It is not enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education must be stopped here this evening.  There is a responsibility on all parties in Opposition to ensure that the Minister is not allowed to stumble blindly, dismantling the primary education service which we have striven to build up in this State for the last 50 years.</P>

It takes a very big person indeed to admit to a mistake.  I am calling now on the Minister for Education &mdash; who is sadly lacking in the support of her fellow Ministers here in this Chamber this evening; it must be obvious to her she is being isolated &mdash; to admit her mistake, and to withdraw Circular 20/87 before further damage is done.</P>

      <P>I am sure it will be distributed.  All of our systems must be examined and scrutinised in order to achieve the best results.  Collectively they must contribute also to achieving national priorities in education and social development. They cannot be immune from constraint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points I should like to make in relation to the motion put down by Fine Gael Deputies.  First, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated that an appropriate pattern of pay developments has an essential part to play in the success of the programme. That is stated in section II, entitled &ldquo;Macroeconomic Policies&rdquo;.  This indicates that an agreed pay policy is part of the general strategy for recovery.  This is so because it is necessary that costs in both the public and private sectors be restrained if recovery is to be got under way.  It is necessary also that there be harmony in industrial relations so far as that can be achieved.  It is for this reason <Col N="1631" /> that the programme records agreement on pay increases at a level not exceeding 2.5 per cent in each of the years 1988, 1989 and 1990.  Our Government attach great importance to agreement on the principles governing pay as a major factor in facilitating national recovery, Such an agreement and the industrial harmony it would produce would be jeopardised if the approach suggested by the motion before the House this evening were to be adopted.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we must ask how the proposal from the Opposition would work in practice.  Would they tell teachers that they must forego an increase because otherwise posts would have to be retrenched? The teachers would rightly object strongly to this proposal.  They would feel, in addition, that in the future they might again be called upon to pay out of their own pockets, as it were, for the financing of the educational system.  This is the motion which was put down by the Opposition Deputies.  As I have said, the various decisions of this Cabinet have been taken on the clear understanding that we have a task to do, that is, to get our finances in working order over a three to four year period so that the young people of whom we speak tonight will be enabled to take their place in Irish society in the future.</P>
    <P>As has been referred to by previous speakers, the major difficulty in considering reductions in spending on education is the very high proportion of total spending devoted to pay and pensions. In primary education, three-quarters of total spending goes on teachers' salaries. If pensions are included this rises to 80 per cent.  This shows the difficulty of providing for necessary expenditure reductions out of the remaining 20 per cent.  Deputies will appreciate that the proportionately smaller segment of non-teacher expenditure cannot sustain reductions in funding of an order large enough to yield the savings that are necessary. There are obviously two ways to go about this.  Either teachers' pay is reduced, as has been suggested by Deputies <Col N="1632" /> opposite, or teacher numbers are reduced.  The motion before this House in the name of Deputy Dukes chooses the first of those two courses.  The Government have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it appears that the people in the press gallery have scripts and I think the Minister owes it to the House to distribute a script to Deputies before it is distributed to the press gallery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the motion is not quite as pointed as that in relation to teachers.  However, to spread the burden over other public service employees, as is suggested in the motion, does not solve the problem.  How are we to explain to employees in other sectors of the public service that they must forego pay increases which they consider due to them because the money is needed to maintain teaching posts or because money is needed in some other area unrelated to their work?  Moreover, if public servants must forego negotiated increases in order to pay for teaching posts, what other sacrifices would they have to make next year?</P>
      <P>Finally, the question of public service pay costs was highlighted in the previous Government's plan <i>Building on Reality,</i> as a major factor in trying to reduce public expenditure levels.  We all know how far that Government got with <i>Building on Reality</i>.  They opted for containing pay levels as against reducing public service numbers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of success of <Col N="1633" /> that plan warns against following that road in this instance.  In summary, the most effective way to contain public service pay expenditure is to reduce the numbers in the public service.  The Fine Gael motion means that employees in the public sector should effectively have elements of their pay set off against the financing of the sector in which they work.  Even if it were feasible to proceed on that basis, it is not one which would commend itself to this Government.</P>
      <P>In a recent debate in the Seanad I said that, if our resources are less than we would wish, it would be better to spend them on ensuring a high quality of teacher in our schools.  I have always said so and I continue to say so.  I draw the attention of Deputies to the position of teachers in the UK where year by year their status has diminished simply because their pay has not been increased.  To barter teachers' pay for other costs in education would be to risk a decline in teacher quality in the long run.</P>

      <P>I am concerned at the misrepresentation in certain quarters in relation to the effects of the proposed changes.  Whatever differences may exist between certain organisations and the Government, one would hope that pupils in our schools would not be used to promote that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight I want to clarify some queries that have been raised regarding Government decisions at primary level and also to repudiate some serious misrepresentations which have been circulated regarding those decisions.  This must be said quite distinctly.  A huge campaign has begun which says that come 1 January 1988 huge changes will take place in the primary schools in Ireland. That is untrue.  It was untrue from day one and it remains untrue now but it was promoted by people and organisations who wished to promote it.  On 1 January the panel system will come into effect which means that teachers, as they have <Col N="1634" /> done since the mid-twenties, will go on a panel but will remain teaching in their classrooms.  It is a pity that Deputies do not know that.  That has always been the case and will continue to be so.  The INTO here requested, and have been assured, that there will be no changes in the present panel system.  It remains as it has always been.</P>
    <P>The changes which will come about will not come into effect until September 1988 and there will be plenty of time between now and then for the Government and the major interests in primary education to get together in the primary review committee, which I have organised, and also in the quota review committee, to work out any difficulties which may arise.  The quota review committee which has existed at post primary level has been quite successful in years gone by when major changes in pupil-teacher ratio took place at that level.  It was a grouping whereby the various interests in post primary education came together with the officials in my Department, with the Minister having the final say, as Deputy Hussey can confirm, and decided on areas of difficulty which could arise. That committee was in existence on and off in the seventies and more recently in 1982 when the previous Minister announced major changes in pupil-teacher ratio at post primary level.  It was again set up in April of this year when I took office and has worked very successfully.</P>
    <P>I have made an offer to all of the interested parties.  I have now set up this quota review committee at post-primary level and have extended it to primary level.  I extend again here from the floor of this House tonight an invitation to all of the interest groups in primary education to work with me on my proposals whereby various cases can be made to my Government Department, to me and my officials.  The Government are of the opinion that this mechanism will permit of any changes resulting from this circular being talked through in a major way.  I refer particularly to disadvantaged areas, remedial teaching, sudden growth surges because of a high birth rate at a particular <Col N="1635" /> time, the organisation of classes.  I have extended to the interested sectors an invitation to come to this quota review committee and put forward their point of view.</P>
    <P>By establishing this committee the Government undertakes to review the deployment of resources in the primary sector with a view to meeting the difficulties which could arise in some areas, for example, where it could be claimed that because of the disadvantaged situation of a school, the growth in pupil numbers, the needs in terms of remedial teaching or an imbalance in class sizes, the school is particularly affected by the revised programme.  This committee would have representation from management, parental representation and representation from the INTO and would be chaired by a senior officer of my Department.  Such a development will lead to a positive and rational resolution of any problems which may arise.  As Minister I must take the responsibility for the education budget.  I do intend to exercise my responsibility in this area with due care and with humanity.</P>

I do not believe she is unaware of the effects that Circular 20/87 will have on the pupil-teacher ratio and on class sizes. It is inconceivable that the Minister, surrounded as she is by Ministers and departmental advisers and consultants, would be unaware of the effect that her circular is having.  If this House is worth its salt at all, we must give a short sharp kick to this Government and tell them that they must withdraw this circular.  Nothing less will satisfy this House.  It is interesting that Deputy McCreevy said here tonight that he represents the vast majority of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil who also want this circular withdrawn.  I hope they will demonstrate their backing for this position here tonight when the vote comes.</P>

      <P>Last April the Minister said she would give particular priority to education.  Since then she has acted in flagrant violation of that promise and in violation, indeed, of everything that her party said in Opposition.  Last Saturday and Sunday we saw an attempt to cloud the issues by a partial, totally ineffective proposal in relation to the quota review committee.  The only effect of what the Minister proposed on Friday night and what was published in the papers on Saturday would simply be to extend to schools which would otherwise not be affected some of the effects of the measures which the Government proposed. <Col N="1642" /> That does not resolve the issue, it does not deal with the problem before us.</P>
      <P>The root of this problem lies in the now infamous <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It proposed quite plainly £70 million in extra pay for the public service in 1988 and to finance that by having £70 million worth of staff savings in the public service.  The social partners did not know that that was what was going to be involved, but the Government clearly did.  The Government went ahead and acted in the knowledge that they were going to carry out the savings in that way. So the pay deal was signed on a Friday and the price tag that attached to it was set out clearly to us in this House on the following Tuesday.  It is no coincidence at all that the figure on each side is £70 million.</P>
      <P>In order to finance that, a certain level of redundancies would be required. There are various estimates &mdash; 6,000 to 7,000 in a full year.  They would not be achieved instantly so that more than that would be required for the effect over the full year.  To give the results we need, we are talking about 10,000 to 12,000 redundancies.  Given the origin of this problem, we propose that we should go back to that origin in order to resolve it. The Government are going to be back, under the terms of the agreement, negotiating with the social partners, anyway. Our proposal was that, rather than simply talking about how many fewer jobs there were going to be, they would adjust other elements in pay and expenditure in order to avoid having these redundancies.  The whole point of our motion was to produce a situation in which the Government could deal with the problem before us which we all want to resolve in a way that would not require us to exceed the overall total of expenditure that has been set out for 1988.  There may be no one single unique way of doing that.  We have put forward a way and a principle under which that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I return now to where I started this evening.  Because we have stuck resolutely to that view, because it is the right way to seek a solution to the problem before the House, taking account of all <Col N="1643" /> the interests, of the children, of the parents, of the taxpayers, all the interests involved, we have put down a motion in the names of the Fine Gael front bench on the Order Paper before us and stuck to it.  What we have heard from the Minister this evening is an indication that she is less than determined about the measures that were set out before this House.  I want now to ask again, and I want a categoric answer to that question, will the Minister confirm in the House, before we come to the conclusion of this debate, a categoric assurance given to me by the Taoiseach via the Government Chief Whip and my own Chief Whip that the primary school pupil-teacher ratio will not be changed?  I want confirmation that that is what the Minister is saying in this House tonight.</P>

      <P>The statistics sought by the Deputy are not yet available.  I will arrange to have the required information supplied to the Deputy in relation to the reported salmon catch as soon as it comes available in approximately three weeks time.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate the numbers of fish taken illegally.  I am well aware that illegal salmon fishing takes place at various points around our coast and the relevant regional fisheries boards are doing everything possible with the resources available to them to cope with the situation.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the various protection regulations on salmon fishing are designed to conserve salmon stocks.  I cannot condone breaches of the law or the violent behaviour of some offenders which places staff engaged on fishery protection work at serious risk.  My aim is to enforce the necessary conservation measures in as fair and equitable a manner as possible in the interests of the future of the fishery.  To this end I am currently considering a number of proposals which have been recommended by the Salmon Review Group.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to ensuring that all farmers pay their appropriate contribution in income tax, thus putting them on the same basis of personal taxation as non-farming taxpayers. The notional systems of taxation referred to by the Deputy would be less equitable than income tax, since they would inevitably result in the systematic undertaxation of those farmers with the greatest ability to pay.  Also, I do not accept that notionally-based tax revenues from farmers would be greater than farmers' income tax yield once the income tax system is effectively extended to all farmers.</P>

I understand that there are no proposals at present to assign additional clerical staff to the station but the possibility of redeploying, to Garda offices, civilian clerical staff who may be made redundant elsewhere in the public service, is being examined.  On the question of other resources, it is planned that a new radio communications system for the Garda in the Dublin Metropolitan Area will come into operation early in the New Year.  This new system will benefit all stations in the DMA, including Tallaght.  It will help Garda management to ensure that all the resources available to them are used to the greatest possible advantage and enable gardaí engaged on operational duties to provide a more efficient service to the public &mdash; for example, in answering calls from the public for assistance.</P>

I have already sought to assist these farmers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community Regulations.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will now ensure that a claim to industrial injury benefit is allowed in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 who has been on disability benefit since 13 April 1987 and whose claim to injury benefit is clearly justified since the accident took place while he was executing the duties of his employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 13 April 1987 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an alleged accident at work on 16 March 1987.  Pending the completion of investigations, he was awarded disability benefit on an interim basis and this was paid to 7 November 1987, after which he was certified fit to resume work by his own doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am satisfied with the progress made in relation to the changeover to the metric system of measurement in the economy generally and in the grocery trade in particular.  In the area of prepackaged goods the changeover is virtually complete with quantity being <Col N="1520" /> indicated in metric on practically all packages. Various regulations relating to packaging and labelling require that quantity be indicated in metric sizes although in most cases imperial sizes may also be indicated.  In 1989 the EC Council of Ministers is due to set a date for ending completely the use of the imperial system of measurement.</P>
      <P>Regulations relating to the indication of prices of foodstuffs sold in bulk or prepacked in variable quantities, for example, fresh meat, require that the unit price of the product be indicated in metric terms, that is the price per kilogram or per litre.  The corresponding unit price in imperial terms may also be indicated but may not replace the unit price in metric terms.</P>
      <P>The level of compliance with the unit-pricing regulations is not satisfactory and the efforts of my Department to improve the situation are continuing.  I am confident that these efforts will bring about greater compliance with the regulations.</P>

      <P>My proposals in relation to beer cans are designed to give effect to one element of the national programme for implementation of EC Directive 85/339 <Col N="1528" /> EC.  This programme was formulated in consultation with trade interests concerned and took full account of the prevailing levels of industrial activity in the various beverage sectors and the extent to which particular forms of containers are used.  The Irish beer market is almost totally dictated by consumer demand for either draught or bottled beer.  Cans account for little more than 1 per cent of the market which can function effectively without reliance on canned beer.  The market for soft drinks is radically different and cans account for about 20 per cent of the trade.  Accordingly, I have no proposals to prohibit the use of cans for soft drinks.  In addition, I understand that the product manufactured by the firm referred to is for export markets which will not be affected by my proposals.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme (SES) is designed to provide employment for up to 52 weeks.  The person in question obtained 52 weeks employment on an SES project during the period June 1985 to June 1986.  He was allowed to continue for another 52 weeks on the scheme under a special roll-over agreement in force at that time.  His second 52 week <Col N="1537" /> period on SES will terminate on 4 December 1987.</P>
      <P>The roll-over facility was abolished at the start of 1987 in order to ensure that as many people as possible can obtain employment on the scheme.  It is therefore, not possible to retain him on the scheme.  If the person in question is still unemployed after a further 52 weeks have elapsed, he will once again become eligible to participate on the scheme.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 9 (iv) of my Department's letter of allocation for 1988 allows health boards to exercise flexibility, with my consent, in relation to charges and other income gathering measures, which are not in conflict with existing statute, where such flexibility would result in increased income.  For example, paragraph 2 (iv) identifies an increase in canteen charges from 1st January next of, on average, 20 per cent.  If, however, a health board is of the view that a restructuring of the entire canteen pricing system rather than a flat percentage increase, would be more beneficial in terms of income, the board may, with my consent, opt for such a restructuring.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a matter for individual health boards to determine the appropriate areas for which such flexibility should be sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The service charges which are referred to in the letter in question are those provided for by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976 (S.I. No. 180 of 1976).  These regulations enable a charge to be made on a person who has been in receipt of in-patient services for ninety days where such person does not have full eligibility for health services and has no dependants.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to amend these regulations with effect from 1st January 1988 to enable a charge to be made after 30 days instead of 90 days as at present.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce new hospital service charges in 1988 other than a charge in certain circumstances for persons who receive in-patient hospital services outside the functional area of their health board and without the approval of their board.</P>

      <P>The document referred to has been circulating in Europe raising unnecessary fears about the safety-in-use of many food additives.  The scientific authorities of the Villejuif Hospital, alleged to be the source of the information, have dissociated themselves from the document.</P>
      <P>A system of control over the use of food additives exists in this country. Regulations controlling particular classes of additives list the substances which are permitted and, where appropriate, specify the conditions under which they may be used and the maximum levels of use. Additives are included in &ldquo;permitted lists&rdquo; only if there is satisfaction as to their safety and that there is a technological need for them.  The Minister is advised on these matters by the Food Advisory Committee which is a committee of independent experts.  In addition, additives are also examined by international expert bodies such as the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives as well as by the national authorities of many other countries.  Information about the safety of additives is exchanged internationally.  The use of permitted additives is kept under continuous review, particularly in the light of any new evidence relating to safety and if any was shown to cause widespread problems appropriate action would be taken.</P>
      <P>With regard to the use of E-numbers, these indicate that an additive has been approved for use unanimously by all member states of the EC.</P>

As I have already made clear, the hospital is not due to close.  The consultant-covered acute services which have been provided at the hospital up to now will, from around 14 December, 1987 be provided at St. James's Hospital.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to inform the Deputy that agreement has been reached between the board of the Hospital and the Eastern Health Board to provide 50 beds for continuing care, a large health centre and a general practitioner staffed casualty service at the hospital.  Arrangements for the provision of these services are being made as a matter of urgency and it is hoped to have them available before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that 36.6 per cent of students who were enrolled in the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1984-85 transferred to third level education in 1985-86.  The transfer rate for school candidates who sat the leaving certificate in June 1985 and proceeded to third level education in 1985-86 is estimated at 36.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>As a number of third level colleges have not yet submitted statistical returns in respect of the 1986-87 academic year, it is not possible to give the transfer rate between 1985-86 and 1986-87.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the revisions in the schedules governing the appointment and retention of staff in national schools will result in a saving of £10 million in the cost of 1988 of national teachers' salaries and a saving of £27.4 million per annum thereafter.  These figures reflect the savings in salary only and do not take into account the cost of awards payable under the terms of the voluntary redundancy &mdash; early retirement scheme for teachers for which I am not in a position to give costings at this stage.</P>
      <P>This estimate is based on a combination of assumptions and calculations regarding the reduction in teacher numbers which will be achieved through voluntary redundancy, early retirement and redeployment measures, and the various salaries and allowances payable to the teachers likely to avail of such measures.</P>
      <P>The principal assumptions are that,</P>
      <P>(i) in the case of re-deployments, the main effect would be to block new entrants, resulting in an average saving estimated at £10,200 per teacher.</P>
      <P>(ii) in the case of redundancies, the bulk of those awarded redundancy would be senior teachers, resulting in an average saving estimated at £17,000 per teacher.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will appoint a remedial teacher to Tallow and Ballyduff national schools in County Waterford in view of the fact that both schools are to lose a teacher in January 1988 and Tallow national school may lose a second teacher in September 1988.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to a similar question which I replied to in the Dáil on 3 November 1987.</P>
      <P>There is no direct correlation between the fact that a specific school will lose a teacher and the need of particular children in that school for remedial education.</P>
      <P>Available remedial teaching posts have always been allocated in accordance with priority of need and not in accordance with pupil-teacher ratios.  This criteria will apply in relation to the cases referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tallow national school and Ballyduff No. 2 national school have made application for a shared remedial post.  This <Col N="1548" /> application will be considered in due course.</P>
